19120,partial lead service line replacement plslr results in the addition of a new galvanic connection and can increase lead concentrations at the tap focus has been given to minimizing lead release after plslr but little information is available on the impact of lead remedial actions on copper concentrations especially before passivation occurs the impact of water quality decreased chloride to sulfate mass ratio from 0 9 to 0 3 addition of orthop ph increase to 8 3 on lead and copper concentrations was investigated after stagnation 30 min 336 h in a pipe rig comparing full lead service line lsl and two configurations of partial lsls cu pb and pb cu results show different trends for lead and copper maximum lead concentrations were reached in 16 h while copper concentrations continued to increase over 336 h lead release rates were also the highest in the first 16 h of stagnation and were strongly impacted by water quality and the configuration of plslr cu pb vs pb cu increasing the sampling flow rate from 5 to 15 lpm drastically increased the particulate lead release 78 fold in pb cu configurations this effect was however not observed in 100 pb or cu pb configurations high velocity flushing prior to 16 h stagnation decreased total pb release by a factor of 12 fold for cu pb 1 6 fold for pb cu and 2 0 fold for 100 pb results support the definition of sampling protocols

introduction lead is a neurotoxin especially for young children and low level exposure has been linked with increased cardiovascular disease mortality in the united states lanphear et al 2005 2018 exposure to elevated copper 4 mg l can cause nausea vomiting and diarrhea while the long term effects are not well documented health canada 2018 who 2004 copper corrosion is mostly influenced by ph alkalinity dissolved inorganic carbon dic redox potential orp plumbing age and stagnation time prior to sampling edwards et al 1994a lagos et al 2001 schock and lytle 2011 schock and sandvig 2009 increasing the ph of water reduces the solubility of copper from coupons and pipes and therefore the concentration in water although less benefits are observed above ph 7 2 edwards et al 1994b pehkonen et al 2002 the dissolution rate of copper is also affected by the type of copper corrosion products present in the pipes lagos et al 2001 indeed the effect of chloride and sulfate on corrosion rate of copper is highly influenced by the scale materials present inside the pipes chloride increasing corrosion at first but then decreasing it as a protective layer is formed whereas the reverse phenomenon has been documented for sulfate edwards et al 1994a adding zn orthop and orthop to simulated plslr rigs decreases copper concentrations in samples collected after 30 min and 6 h of stagnation no copper precipitation was observed when extending the stagnation up to 65 h whereas precipitation occurred in untreated pipes kogo et al 2017 the addition of orthop initially decreases copper scale solubility however it also inhibits the deposition of cuprite and malachite which naturally form over decades and results in lower solubility deposits schock and sandvig 2009 finally copper rarely gets corroded as a result of galvanic corrosion as it is more noble than other metals used in plumbing components edwards et al 1994a except when reversal of the pb cu galvanic couple occurs arnold and edwards 2012 copper pipe experiments showed an initial increase in total copper concentrations with stagnation time along with a decrease in oxygen levels and followed by a decrease in copper concentrations werner et al 1994 as stagnation time increases most studies concur that an increase in dissolved copper concentrations is observed as materials dissolve and is followed by a decrease in concentrations as the copper scale is building up and there is precipitation hidmi and edwards 1999 merkel et al 2002 the duration of the increase in copper concentrations before reaching a plateau varies in the literature 6 92 h depending on experimental conditions and water quality parameters hidmi and edwards 1999 lytle and schock 2000 merkel et al 2002 however in cases where an oxidant residual was still present at the end of the stagnation period increases in copper levels were observed lytle and schock 2000 regarding lead pipe rig experiments schock et al 1996 showed that lead concentrations aimed towards equilibrium following approximately overnight stagnation despite a variable rate of increase within the first hours of stagnation which is in agreement with mass transfer stagnation curve models kuch and wagner 1983 schock 1990 in pure lead coupons an increase of 100 μg pb l was observed at ph 7 0 between 24 and 72 h of stagnation however such a difference was not observed at ph 8 5 lytle and schock 2000 in a pilot setup made of harvested lsls with simulated plslr increasing the stagnation time from 30 min to 16 h prior to sampling resulted in an increase in dissolved lead concentrations of 28 32 for full lsls and 24 42 for partial lsls for different water qualities cartier et al 2013 similar observations were made by kogo et al 2017 after stagnation times of 30 min 6 h and 65 h in simulated plslr untreated water orthop zn orthop and sodium silicate dosing in a study conducted by wang et al 2013 lead pipes connected to copper pipes using plastic or brass connectors were left stagnating in water for 6 and 65 h with chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr conditions of 0 7 and 7 higher pb concentrations were measured after 65 h and more so in the 0 7 csmr water flushing water from the pipes decreased metal concentrations as observed in lsls after 1 and 5 min of flushing cartier et al 2011 then diffusion modelling can be used to describe lead and copper release depending on varying stagnation time however when a higher fraction of particulate cu or pb is present in the samples considerable scatter is shown in the model lytle and schock 2000 previous studies identified factors other than only stagnation time in influencing pb release at the tap flow rate is an important determinant of the release of particulate pb as highlighted by field and pilot studies with high flow rates linked to increased particulate pb release cartier et al 2012 clark et al 2014 st clair et al 2016 in a field study samples collected at high flow rates without prior stagnation were shown to release higher lead concentrations than first draw samples collected at low flow and the site specific nature of pb release was also highlighted clark et al 2014 under some water qualities in a pilot setup most of the pb release was particulate and the release of this form of pb was qualified as variable and sporadic in some distribution systems mcneill and edwards 2004 triantafyllidou et al 2007 water quality and scale composition influence the shape of the stagnation curve for both lead and copper release as a function of varying stagnation time lytle and schock 2000 hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 oxidation rate changes with chlorine residual a lag phase was observed at the beginning of stagnation and followed by a rapid oxidation liu et al 2008 the oxidation rate of hydrocerussite commonly found in lsls desantis et al 2018 is a determining factor for the concentration of lead in water in dissolution experiments using minium pb3o4 in the presence of free chlorine guo et al 2016 observed an immediate lead dissolution which is in agreement with previous experiments the objectives of this study were 1 to determine how different water qualities impacted the passivation of new copper pipe when simulating a partial lsl replacement 2 to analyze the impact of stagnation time on total dissolved and particulate lead and copper concentrations in full and partial lsls at pilot scale 3 to determine how changing the water quality affects the release of lead and copper using different stagnation times for sampling 4 to investigate the impact of high velocity flushing on total dissolved and particulate pb release in a simulated partial lsl and 5 to determine the implications of different stagnation time on lead and copper concentrations regarding exposure and sampling protocols 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot setup excavated lsls from the distribution system of the city of montreal were installed in a flow through pilot fed by water from the same distribution system as detailed in cartier et al 2013 and in doré et al 2019 under normal conditions the setup was operated 8 h per day 5 days per week without stagnation exceeding 72 h at a flow rate of 5 lpm 0 4 0 6 m s depending on pipe diameter per pipe 30 psi the pilot was run with harvested lsls over one year and after that plslr were simulated for a fraction 2 3 of the lsls in the pilot by connecting the lsls to a new copper pipe using a red brass compression fitting cartier et al 2013 resulting in three different pipe configurations the pipe configurations tested included 1 a 100 pb lsl of 3 m with no compression fitting 2 a partial lsl with a 1 8 m new copper pipe type m connected upstream of a 0 6 m aged lsl using a compression fitting cu pb configuration 3 a partial lsl with an aged lsl 0 6 m connected downstream of a new copper pipe 1 8 m using a compression fitting pb cu configuration the three configurations installed represent respectively an lsl without replacement 100 pb a plslr completed by the utility cu pb or by the homeowner pb cu as described in cartier et al 2013 and in doré et al 2019 different water qualities were tested in the pilot for lsls with an internal diameter i d of 16 mm including 1 control condition csmr 0 9 ph 7 9 alk 90 mg caco3 l dic of 20 mg c l at 20 c no chlorine residual 2 addition of sulfate as na2so4 csmr 0 3 3 orthophosphate addition at 1 mg p l with ph re stabilisation to 7 9 and 4 increase in ph to 8 3 by dosing naoh a fifth condition consisted of smaller i d lsls 13 mm under control conditions and for which soldered red brass fittings were used for the plslr configurations 2 2 sampling for lead and copper lead and copper concentrations from the three pipe configurations tested in the pilot were monitored by repeated sampling after 16 h of stagnation 16hs over 155 weeks after plslr simulation to investigate the impact of plslr over long term a hundred weeks after plslr additional sampling was performed over 7 11 weeks after varying stagnation times including 6 24 48 and 72 h as well as two weeks stagnation and repeated three times finally samples were collected in two sampling campaing after 30 min stagnation and 9 times under flowing conditions 0 min stagnation batches of sampling were separated by a period of 4 6 weeks during which the pilot was operated under normal conditions to allow the pipes to recover from the changes in operation before any sampling event water flow was modified to ensure that fresh water was brought to each section of the pilot to avoid contamination from upstream pipes as described in cartier et al 2013 and doré et al 2019 water directly from the storage tank was fed into each section of the pilot cu pb 100 pb and pb cu sampling valves were then flushed for at least 30 s at a flow rate of 5 lpm in order to remove particles that may have accumulated between sampling events then during 30 min each section of the pilot were operated at 5 lpm water was allowed to sit for the pre determined stagnation time pressure was maintained within each pipe rig throughout the duration of the stagnation sampling was carried out under the same flow rate as under operation except for the smaller diameter pipes for which a flow rate of 15 lpm was elected sampling performed under flowing conditions is detailed elsewhere doré et al 2019 in all cases to ensure that all water in contact with the lead and copper pipes was sampled a 2 l sample was collected finally for a period of 7 weeks the smaller diameter pipes were operated under high flow rate 15 lpm 1 9 m s for a period of 1 h followed by 6 h under normal flow rate 5 lpm 0 6 m s and by second period of high flow rate 1 h grab samples were collected during periods of high and normal flow rates dissolved metals were measured after filtering a 40 ml aliquot on a 0 45 μm pvdf filter samples for total and dissolved metals were acidified with 0 5 hno3 directly in the sampling bottle for at least 24 h at room temperature and then 0 5 hcl was added to obtain the appropriate matrix metal concentrations were measured in an iso179025 certified laboratory using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms detection limits were of 0 11 μg cu l and 0 02 μg pb l other water quality monitoring ph cl2 dissolved oxygen toc turbidity chloride sulfate and phosphate is described in cartier et al 2013 and in doré et al 2019 average concentrations of copper and lead in the water feeding the pilot were respectively of 29 2 μg cu l and 0 1 μg pb l 2 3 determination of lead and copper release rates for each pipe configuration and water quality tested in the pilot setup a release rate μg h was estimated from the data obtained from the stagnation trials a first release rate was calculated by fitting a linear equation for the data obtained under conditions of flowing and stagnation of 0 5 6 and 16 h then a second linear equation was fitted to obtain the release rate for stagnation times ranging between 24 h and 2 weeks 2 4 scale analysis scales present inside the full and partial lsls were sampled depending on corrosion zones in partial lsls and were then analyzed by powder xrd to identify major crystalline minerals present as detailed in desantis et al 2018 and schock et al 2008 2 5 statistical analysis statistica statsoft version 13 3 was used to carry out non parametrical statistical analysis kruskal wallis anova differences were considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise 3 results and discussion one of the key concerns raised with partial lsl replacements plslrs is the enhanced release of particulate lead pbpart and its contribution to exposure including acute exposure at the tap cartier et al 2012 cartier et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 mcneill and edwards 2004 st clair et al 2016 triantafyllidou et al 2007 following partial lsl replacements a new source of copper is added to the plumbing which could raise concerns of elevated copper concentrations trends for the release of all forms of pb and cu can be examined after both short 0 5 16 h stagnation that can occur during normal water usage in residential buildings and after prolonged stagnations 24 336 h that are representative of extended inoccupancy periods 3 1 copper concentrations after plslr simulation following plslr simulation and after 16 h stagnation copper concentrations decreased from week 20 155 after simulation of partial lsl replacements for both plslr configurations and for all water qualities fig 1 the formation of a passivating film is expected after the installation of cu pipes in a distribution system with the highest solubility associated with new un passivated pipes edwards et al 2002 lagos et al 2001 schock et al 1995 turek et al 2011 copper concentrations in water are determined by the scales and their solubility formed at the interface between the pipe and the water schock and lytle 2011 for example the solubility of cupric solids can be 10 1 000x greater than cuprous oxide or hydroxide lytle and schock 2000 which can impact the concentrations of copper in water a brief investigation of the scale composition present in this pilot by powder xrd revealed that the dominant mineral present in crystalline form in all pipes was cuprite cuo2 with some presence of cu ii such as tenorite cuo malachite cu2co3 oh 2 and traces of posnjakite cu4 so4 oh 6 h2o median concentrations were clearly highest for the smaller diameter 16 mm pipes and trended downward after week 104 globally decreasing by 1 6 fold cu pb and 1 7 fold pb cu to account for the lower dilution in the smaller diameter median masses of copper released from the cu pb configuration over the whole period were compared to the control condition and found to be similar 815 8 213 5 μg cu for the 16 mm vs 798 7 178 3 μg cu for the 22 mm interestingly median masses of copper were significantly lower in the small diameter pipe in the pb cu configuration 487 9 87 5 μg cu for the 16 mm vs 803 7 180 8 μg cu for the 22 mm p 0 001 with the exception of the smaller diameter pipe in the cu pb configuration in the first 104 weeks 90th percentile cu concentrations remained well below 2 000 μg cu l after 16hs which is the new health based maximum acceptable concentration mac proposed by health canada 2018 and who 2017 however not even the addition of orthop reduced copper concentrations below the california phg of 300 μg cu l as 90th percentile values reached 415 1 μg cu l and 394 1 μg cu l for the cu pb and pb cu configuration respectively the modest increase of ph from 7 9 to 8 3 decreased median cu concentrations by 42 44 in both plslr configurations in agreement with the low solubility of cuo schock et al 1995 one of the minerals detected a similar decrease in copper concentrations associated to an increase in ph ph 7 15 to 7 8 alk 200 mg caco3 l was observed at bench scale in new copper pipes edwards et al 2011 and in copper coupons in contact with synthetic water pehkonen et al 2002 the addition of sulfate to decrease the csmr from 0 9 to 0 3 did not influence cu release in agreement with findings from schock et al 1995 stating that sulfate complexes are not likely to be significant for cuprosolvency however in copper pipes connected to pb pipes at bench scale kogo et al 2017 related an increase in csmr to an increase in copper concentrations after 30 min and 6 h of stagnation copper concentrations in presence of orthop remained quasi constant throughout the duration of the experiment with 90th percentile concentrations of 441 4 and 394 1 μg cu l 104 weeks before the plslr simulation for the cu pb and pb cu configurations respectively and of 415 1 and 463 4 μg cu l after 104 weeks the addition of orthop was the most efficient treatment to reduce copper concentrations in both plslr configurations after 16hs with median concentrations 3 9 fold cu pb and 3 6 fold pb cu lower than concentrations for the control condition the addition of orthop has been shown to cause a rapid decrease of cu concentrations in similar water quality in coupon pehkonen et al 2002 pilot edwards et al 2002 and full scale schock and sandvig 2009 testing dosing 1 mg p l of orthop showed a similar decrease in copper concentrations in a pipe rig it however required a dose of 2 mg p l to decrease concentrations below 1 300 μg cu l edwards et al 2011 utilities which added orthop for the control of lead concentrations also witnessed an initial decrease in copper levels shortly after the onset of the added corrosion control treatment schock and sandvig 2009 3 2 effect of stagnation time on copper concentrations copper concentrations measured in the 2 l samples were adjusted to reflect the concentration of water stagnating in the copper pipe section 362 684 ml as triplicate stagnation trials were conducted over a period of 40 weeks the sampling period was sufficiently long to provide time for scales to age aging of the copper pipes in the pilot is expected to promote the formation of cuprite cuo2 and then malachite cu2co3 oh 2 and tenorite cuo ives and rawson 1962 schock and lytle 2011 fig s1 shows the variability of the copper concentrations between sampling events for duplicate pipes as a function of stagnation time indeed copper concentrations released for the control condition and the orthop in the cu pb configuration follow similar trends for a given sampling event flowing to 72 h however different long term trends of copper concentrations are observed after extended 336 h of stagnation for the same pipe during one sampling event between duplicate pipes between events and between water qualities the application of orthop stabilizes the concentrations of dissolved copper cudiss as these concentrations are clearly more stable throughout the sampling period even after long stagnation times as compared to the control condition fig s1 b and d for nearly all water qualities tested concentrations of total dissolved and particulate copper cutotal cudiss and cupart increase sharply within the first 16 h of stagnation fig 2 for cu pb fig 3 for pb cu a similar increase was also observed for total copper over 20 25 h by lytle and schock 2000 in a pipe loop fed by hard softened and untreated groundwaters while the maximum was observed after only 10 h for a new pipe rig with similar water quality alkalinity of 89 mg caco3 l ph 7 3 merkel et al 2002 after the sharp initial increase copper concentrations tend to fluctuate for all water qualities with a few pipes showing peak concentrations after 336 h as the duration of stagnation increases dissolution and precipitation of copper can both occur no trend of decreasing concentrations with extended stagnation following a werner characteristic curve was systematically observed this is in contrast to sharp decreases 90 reported by lytle and schock 2000 after 72 92 h dissolved oxygen 0 4 mg o2 l or after 60 72 h merkel et al 2002 merkel and pehkonen 2006 dissolved oxygen concentrations in the pilot after stagnation ranged from 3 0 to 11 7 mg o2 l reflecting the oversaturation in the distributed water in the pilot in the presence of orthop edwards et al 2002 observed an increase in copper concentrations by 2 fold from 8 to 72 h in a pipe rigs which is consistent with the 1 4 fold increase between 6 and 72 h for both partial configurations orthop treated pipes in this study the impact of the induced water quality changes can also be assessed by comparing the release rates of cutotal cudiss and cupart μg cu h presented in table 1 overall the rate of increase in cudiss can be well correlated for the first 16 h of stagnation r2 range 0 54 0 95 for all but the control pb cu pipes resulting rates of release vary widely from 8 3 to 40 3 μg cutotal h depending on water quality the rate of increase of cutotal concentrations in the pipe μg cu h is comparable for the control and small diameter pipes for the cu pb but not for the pb cu reflecting the larger mass released in the cu pb configuration fig 1 the release of cudiss is the main contributor to cutotal in the cu pb configuration 74 89 and to a lesser degree for the pb cu configuration 65 94 the contributions from cupart could only be correlated as a function of stagnation time for the cu pb configuration showing modest values ranging from 1 19 to 10 3 μg cupart h for long term stagnation ranging from 16 h to 2 weeks release rates could not be quantified because of the high variability in cu concentrations except for the ph 8 3 cu pb and pb cu and the addition of orthop cu pb r2 0 58 for those conditions estimated rates show that copper release represent less than 6 1 of the rates observed during the first 16 h however cudiss remained most dominant over time during extended stagnation 48 83 overall orthop and increased ph 8 3 treatment were most effective to decrease all forms of copper after both short and extended stagnation which could be expected based on preferred scale minerals formed indeed solids such as cu3 po4 2 form in the presence of orthop which have a lower solubility than cu oh 2 explaining the lower copper concentrations measured edwards et al 2002 increasing ph from 7 9 to 8 3 will also lower the solubility of cu ii and malachite at low dic such as in the test water schock and lytle 2011 as the pilot included brass fittings it is possible that the red brass compression fittings present in the pilot contributed to copper levels in the water furthermore copper release could be reduced if the copper pipe is galvanically protected when acting as the cathode in the galvanic couple pb cu and cu brass desantis et al 2018 however a reversal of the galvanic couple is possible under specific water quality promoting the formation of low solubility pb iv solids arnold and edwards 2012 desantis et al 2018 3 3 effect of stagnation time on lead concentrations as stagnation increases lead concentrations are expected to rise first rapidly and then taper off to reach a quasi equilibrium after about 15 h in agreement with mass transfer stagnation curve models derived from lead pipe rigs ph 6 8 alkalinity 10 mg caco3 l and ph 7 2 alkalinity 213 mg caco3 l when soluble lead is the dominant form kuch and wagner 1983 schock 1990 triantafyllidou et al 2007 lead concentrations in water after stagnation are determined by the composition of the scale pb iv solids being less soluble than pb ii products schock and lytle 2011 triantafyllidou et al 2015 and depend on the contribution of pbpart cartier et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 preliminary analysis of the scales in the pipe rig revealed the dominance of the pb ii compounds as crystalline forms cerussite pbco3 and hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 which are both very soluble figs s2 and s3 show detailed results per replicate pipe for 100 pb and cu pb configurations for control and orthop conditions over the repeat stagnation trials extending over 40 weeks unlike observations on the variability of copper release over time lead release for a given pipe was found to be stable however significant variability was noted between replicate pipe concentrations either in the full lsl or plslr configurations the variability between replicate pipes most probably reflect heterogeneity of scales of the harvested lead pipes from the distribution system of the city in contrast to the uniform initial surfaces of newly installed copper piping 3 3 1 100 pb configuration for all conditions tested total dissolved and particulate lead pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart released from 100 pb pipes fig 4 follow the same trend of increasing concentrations as a function of stagnation time a sharper increase is observed at short stagnation times 16 h rapid increase in concentrations is expected to be followed by a plateau after 16hs as predicted by solubility modelling kuch and wagner 1983 and as verified for different water qualities and corrosion treatment edwards and mcneill 2002 for stagnation times up to 16 h median lead concentrations were the lowest for the orthop condition as compared to the smaller diameter pipes showing differences ranging from 6 4 to 9 8 fold for pbtotal 8 2 14 4 fold for pbdiss and 2 7 7 3 fold for pbpart the maximum pb concentrations were generally measured after 16hs for all conditions tested and reached a median of 777 6 μg pbtotal l in the small diameter 13 mm pb pipe despite an apparent increase in pb concentrations flowing and 30 min stagnation samples results were not significantly different p 0 05 however 30 min stagnation concentrations were significantly lower p 0 1 than those after 16 h for all conditions but the addition of orthop for which a significant increase was only observed after 2 weeks lytle and schock 2000 reported also small differences after 24 and 72 h of stagnation using lead coupons exposed to ph 8 5 water the trends in the particulate lead fraction as stagnation increases can be observed on fig 5 a showing wide variations of fractions at any given time for a pipe corresponding to the sporadic release of particles captured by the 0 45 μm filters nevertheless a clear trend of smaller yet variable particulate fractions was measured in flowing samples 13 2 36 6 and to a lesser extent in 30 min stagnation samples 14 4 84 4 for all conditions tested a clear trend of increased particulate fraction after 6 h of stagnation was only observed for the orthop and small diameter conditions as particulate fractions increased from a median of 30 2 and 33 5 after 0 30 min to 56 6 and 54 2 after 6 h respectively our findings are consistent with elevated fractions of 58 78 2 h stagnation and up to 46 flowing reported for 1 mg p l orthop at ph 7 5 in newly aged lead pipes xie and giammar 2011 for other conditions ph 8 3 sulfate and control fractions remained steady in flowing samples and throughout stagnation ranging from 12 5 to 16 9 in the orthop condition it must be noted that the high particulate fraction corresponds to a concentration of pbpart lower than with other conditions fig 4c depending on water quality pbtotal release rates vary widely 7 6 37 0 μg pbtotal h within the first 16 h of stagnation with the worst release in the small diameter pipe table 2 similar to what was observed for copper the lowest lead release rates are observed after the addition of orthop with dissolved lead release rates 2 fold lower than for the control condition 0 16hs dissolved lead concentrations from 100 pb pipes can be well correlated r2 0 80 and accounted for 13 61 of the pbtotal release rate table 2 the release of particulate lead could not be correlated because of its high intrinsic variability fig 5c most probably caused by the sporadic detachment of pbpart from the scales as observed in fig 4c when considering stagnation extending from 24 to 336 h much smaller pbdiss release rates were observed representing less than 6 2 of the rates observed during the first 16 h r2 0 46 0 82 the release of pbtotal during extended stagnation are poorly correlated r2 0 54 again because of the random nature of pbpart detachment as with copper concentrations for extended stagnation total lead release rates are harder to correlate with the co occurrence of dissolution and precipitation mechanisms in the pipes stagnation curves were produced by cartier et al 2013 shortly after the simulated plslr less than 4 months reporting marked increases in both dissolved colloidal lead after extending the stagnation from 30 min to 16 h a growing proportion of pbpart was observed after 16hs for 100 lead pipes pbpart release increased by 7 27fold between 30 min and 16 h stagnation sampling while in plslr the increase of pbpart ranged from 3 to 25 fold excluding the condition at ph 8 3 3 3 2 cu pb and pb cu configurations the role of pbpart in increasing pb concentrations at the tap after extended stagnation is a key question especially in the case of partial lsl replacements it has been suggested that extending stagnation will increase the relative contribution of particulate lead in the total lead released during stagnation cartier et al 2013 in simulated plslrs the addition of the galvanic connection between the pb and the cu pipes as well as the brass fittings adds new sources for metal release as compared to 100 pb configurations previous research demonstrated the importance of the fittings in increased pb released by comparing dielectric and compression fittings the latter exacerbating the pb concentrations in simulated partial lsl replacements wang et al 2013 overall more variability in total lead concentrations can be observed in the partial lsls figs 6 and 7 than in the full lsls fig 4 this variability can be explained by the sporadic spikes of particulate lead concentrations in the samples which is reflected in the higher fraction of particulate pb fig 5b and c for cu pb and pb cu respectively a clear trend of smaller yet variable particulate fractions is found in flowing samples for all conditions 13 2 36 6 except for orthop 36 6 45 8 extremely high median particulate fractions were observed after any stagnation 30 min 2 weeks for the orthop 68 92 3 and small diameter 31 7 89 0 conditions for other conditions ph 8 3 and control particulate fractions also increased after stagnation it was however less so for the sulfate condition 21 6 43 4 in the case of the orthop condition it can be noted that the high particulate fraction corresponds to elevated concentrations of pbpart unlike observations with 100 pb pipes as with copper in partial lsls and lead in full lsls pbtotal concentrations increased and then reached a plateau and slightly fluctuated for stagnation times greater than 16 h figs 7 and 8 despite an apparent increase in concentrations flowing and 30 min stagnation samples were not significantly different p 0 05 overall only flowing samples were significantly lower p 0 1 than those measured after 16 h for all conditions and all pbtotal concentrations were highly variable after more than 6 16 h of stagnation and not significantly distinct during extended stagnation precipitation and dissolution of different forms of lead can occur as the water quality in the pipe change with the depletion of dissolved oxygen and oxidants lytle and schock 2000 similar fluctuations after 6 h stagnation were observed in simulated plslr under control orthop and silicate addition conditions kogo et al 2017 the addition of orthop decreased pbtotal the most in both plslr configurations mainly through its action on pbdiss figs 6 and 7 these findings are in agreement with the short term trends 4 months after partial replacement showing a 3 25 fold pbpart increase between stagnation times of 30 min and 16 h cartier et al 2013 after an extended period of operation of 155 weeks pbpart concentrations increased by a factor of 2 8 25 fold except for the sulfate addition 1 0 fold and the ph 8 3 73 fold conditions in the pb cu configuration the pbtotal release rate is higher during the first 16 h of stagnation and then tappers off with increased stagnation times table 2 the additional sources of lead in the partial lsls could explain the lower r2 for certain water qualities depending on water quality pbtotal release rates from plslrs vary widely 0 3 100 4 μg pbtotal h within the first 16 h of stagnation with the orthop condition systematically the highest table 2 dissolved lead concentrations from partial lsls can be well correlated r2 0 41 0 82 unlike pbtotal or pbpart concentrations because of the high intrinsic variability of pbpart figs 6c and 7c when corrected for the length of lead pipe in contact with water the dissolved lead release in the partials with only 60 cm of lsl were 43 150 higher than for 100 pb pipes of 300 cm in stark contrast with observations for the 100 pb pipes pb release rates for partial lsls were dominated by particulate lead release dissolved lead rates during the first 16 h for the cu pb configuration represent indeed a minor proportion 15 4 30 3 of the pbtotal release rates accounting for less than 1 for the orthop condition table 2 the intensified release of both forms of pb after partial replacement can be attributed mainly to galvanic corrosion as reported by doré et al 2019 who differentiated lead release from the galvanic connection from non galvanic surfaces nevertheless the brass fittings could have contributed to pb concentrations after extended stagnation 65 72 h lytle and schock 2000 triantafyllidou and edwards 2007 wang et al 2013 3 4 impact of high velocity flushing adjusting the operational flow of the pilot from 5 to 15 lpm resulted in drastic increases in median total 5 2 fold and particulate pb 78 fold for the cu pb small diameter configuration fig 8a and b tripling the flow rate had however a less important impact for the 100 pb 1 2 fold and the pb cu 0 9 fold configurations to simulate the impact of higher water usage or preventive high velocity flushing such as performed after plslr on the accumulation of particulate lead additional testing was conducted at the end of the pilot operation period high velocity flushing at 15 lpm 1 9 m s was conducted twice a day for 7 weeks lead release after 16 h of stagnation before and after the high velocity flushing trials are compared in fig 8c and d for 16 h stagnation samples after stagnation 16hs median total pb concentrations decreased by 1 6 fold pb cu to 12 fold cu pb while median particulate pb decreased by up to 24 fold high velocity flushing therefore appears to be an effective tool to reduce the accumulated particulate lead in a service line therefore flushing decreased the mobilized particulate lead levels under flowing conditions but even more so after extended stagnation from 192 to 7 9 μg pbpart l however these observations also show that systematic flushing prior to stagnation leads to an underestimation of lead at the tap and supports the proscription of flushing in regulatory protocols 3 5 implications for exposure to lead and copper copper concentrations were always below the 300 μg cu l california phg for flowing samples however after only 30 min of stagnation all samples exceeded this threshold for the smaller diameter pipes and frequent exceedances of the proposed health based level of 2 000 μg cu l were observed after 16hs for the cu pb configuration 13 58 samples all stagnation times exceeded 2 000 μg cu l it is important to note that these elevated copper concentrations were measured in relatively short pipes 1 8 m even after 155 weeks of operation it raises the potential of large volumes of copper with elevated concentrations reaching the tap when copper piping is used for premise plumbing avoiding these elevated concentrations would require prolonged flushing before concentrations are lowered as observed in large buildings doré et al 2018 for the pipes treated with the addition of orthop maximum concentrations never exceeded 1 000 μg cu l and only 8 58 cu pb and 11 58 pb cu samples exceeded 300 μg cu l exceedances of maximum recommended levels of 5 and 10 μg l pb are more ubiquitous amongst stagnation times for all water qualities tested similar to trends reported in schools and large buildings doré et al 2018 lead concentrations in lsls exceeded recommended levels in few flushed samples small diameter pipes and in nearly all samples collected after only 30 min of stagnation the plslr observations in this study represent worst case scenarios in terms of exposure to elevated pb concentrations because they include very high contributions from the galvanic connection in the partial lsls doré et al 2019 however in pipe concentrations measured in this study could be present in longer lsls typically present in distribution systems deshommes et al 2017 after 6 h of stagnation which is realistic in a household after overnight or after workday the masses of pb release from the lead pipe volumes 80 603 ml exceeded 175 μg pb in 26 of samples with at least one high occurrence for each condition tested if consumed at the tap it would correspond to an acute exposure threshold uscpsc 2005 as presented in previous studies conducted in schools large buildings and in households with lsls deshommes et al 2012 doré et al 2018 triantafyllidou and edwards 2010 3 6 implications for lead and copper sampling the various stagnation times and targeted levels currently being used for lead and copper sampling determine the concentrations that are detected at the tap if sampling results are compared to a set standard the selection of the stagnation duration before collecting the sample is critical major differences exist in the various guidelines and standards regarding sampling protocols used for the detection of lead and copper especially the duration of stagnation preflush prior stagnation and the selection of the sampling volume table s1 stagnation time used prior to sampling can therefore have repercussions on the concentrations measured cartier et al 2011 the stagnation time used prior to sampling will impact the percentage of houses with exceedances in lead or copper concentrations in a distribution system as reported in schools and large buildings doré et al 2018 a very short stagnation period will lead to an under evaluation of the exceedances and of the exposure to potential elevated lead levels at the tap and even more so for copper sampling targeted towards the detection of lead sources is also likely to miss the sources of copper as its leaching rate is slower than lead depending on the scales present inside the pipes different stagnation times should be considered depending on the objectives of sampling if the intention is to measure peak concentrations to which the consumer may be exposed metal concentrations after typical and prolonged stagnation should be targeted in the case of lead even the lower 10th percentile concentrations exceeded regulated levels 10 μg pb l within the first 30 min of stagnation except for the 100 pb pipe treated with orthop however after the same stagnation time maximum copper concentrations did not exceed the aesthetic objective of 1 000 μg cu l and few water qualities pipe configuration exceeded the phg of california 300 μg cu l therefore a 30 min stagnation prior to sampling would not detect households at risk of elevated copper concentrations for copper only 90th percentiles of the smaller diameter pipes and the control condition cu pb exceeded 1 000 μg cu l after 6 h stagnation for most water qualities and pipe configurations lead and copper median total concentrations increased between 6 and 16 h of stagnation tables 3 and 4 however between stagnation times of 16 and 24 h in multiple instances a slight decrease in median concentrations was observed probably due to onset of deposition of copper in some water qualities and depending on the type of scale deposits present a longer stagnation time has been shown to underestimate the maximum concentration of copper lytle and schock 2000 this difference between how lead and copper concentrations vary during extended stagnation can therefore have monitoring implications schock and lemieux 2010 comparing 6 h stagnation samples and 16 h stagnation samples lytle and schock 2000 found a 35 difference in lead increases and a 270 in the case of copper depending on the age of the copper pipes finally temperature has been shown to have a reverse impact on copper and lead concentrations with cold water representing a higher risk of elevated copper release unlike lead masters et al 2016 to assess typical exposure stagnation times representative of the time between usages in a household should be used such as the 30 min stagnation or random day time sampling system wide van den hoven and slaats 2006 composite sampling is the best approach to measure exposure but is only feasible for research purposes van den hoven and slaats 2006 4 conclusion dissolved lead and copper concentrations can be well correlated for the first 16 h of stagnation in full and partial lsls under different water qualities the addition of orthop decreased copper concentrations in partial lsls independently of the duration of stagnation prior to sampling for the period of 155 weeks of experimentation in full lsls it was also the most effective treatment in reducing total lead concentrations the increase rates of dissolved lead and copper during stagnation can be better correlated than those for particulate lead and copper increasing the sampling flow rate from 5 to 15 lpm drastically increased particulate lead release in cu pb configurations 78 fold while having almost no impact for the 100 pb pipe or pb cu configurations high velocity flushing prior to 16 h stagnation decreased total pb release by 12 fold for cu pb 1 6 fold for pb cu and 2 0 fold for 100 pb showing that flushing prior to stagnation should be proscribed stagnation time prior to sampling should reflect the differences in kinetic dissolution of lead and copper sampling should be targeted for the detection of either pb or cu as measuring both metals in the same sample is sub optimal in light of the results obtained acknowledgements this study was

lsl and two configurations of partial lsls cu pb and pb cu results show different trends for lead and copper maximum lead concentrations were reached in 16 h while copper concentrations continued to increase over 336 h lead release rates were also the highest in the first 16 h of stagnation and were strongly impacted by water quality and the configuration of plslr cu pb vs pb cu increasing the sampling flow rate from 5 to 15 lpm drastically increased the particulate lead release 78 fold in pb cu configurations this effect was however not observed in 100 pb or cu pb configurations high velocity flushing prior to 16 h stagnation decreased total pb release by a factor of 12 fold for cu pb 1 6 fold for pb cu and 2 0 fold for 100 pb results support the definition of sampling protocols

introduction lead is a neurotoxin especially for young children and low level exposure has been linked with increased cardiovascular disease mortality in the united states lanphear et al 2005 2018 exposure to elevated copper 4 mg l can cause nausea vomiting and diarrhea while the long term effects are not well documented health canada 2018 who 2004 copper corrosion is mostly influenced by ph alkalinity dissolved inorganic carbon dic redox potential orp plumbing age and stagnation time prior to sampling edwards et al 1994a lagos et al 2001 schock and lytle 2011 schock and sandvig 2009 increasing the ph of water reduces the solubility of copper from coupons and pipes and therefore the concentration in water although less benefits are observed above ph 7 2 edwards et al 1994b pehkonen et al 2002 the dissolution rate of copper is also affected by the type of copper corrosion products present in the pipes lagos et al 2001 indeed the effect of chloride and sulfate on corrosion rate of copper is highly influenced by the scale materials present inside the pipes chloride increasing corrosion at first but then decreasing it as a protective layer is formed whereas the reverse phenomenon has been documented for sulfate edwards et al 1994a adding zn orthop and orthop to simulated plslr rigs decreases copper concentrations in samples collected after 30 min and 6 h of stagnation no copper precipitation was observed when extending the stagnation up to 65 h whereas precipitation occurred in untreated pipes kogo et al 2017 the addition of orthop initially decreases copper scale solubility however it also inhibits the deposition of cuprite and malachite which naturally form over decades and results in lower solubility deposits schock and sandvig 2009 finally copper rarely gets corroded as a result of galvanic corrosion as it is more noble than other metals used in plumbing components edwards et al 1994a except when reversal of the pb cu galvanic couple occurs arnold and edwards 2012 copper pipe experiments showed an initial increase in total copper concentrations with stagnation time along with a decrease in oxygen levels and followed by a decrease in copper concentrations werner et al 1994 as stagnation time increases most studies concur that an increase in dissolved copper concentrations is observed as materials dissolve and is followed by a decrease in concentrations as the copper scale is building up and there is precipitation hidmi and edwards 1999 merkel et al 2002 the duration of the increase in copper concentrations before reaching a plateau varies in the literature 6 92 h depending on experimental conditions and water quality parameters hidmi and edwards 1999 lytle and schock 2000 merkel et al 2002 however in cases where an oxidant residual was still present at the end of the stagnation period increases in copper levels were observed lytle and schock 2000 regarding lead pipe rig experiments schock et al 1996 showed that lead concentrations aimed towards equilibrium following approximately overnight stagnation despite a variable rate of increase within the first hours of stagnation which is in agreement with mass transfer stagnation curve models kuch and wagner 1983 schock 1990 in pure lead coupons an increase of 100 μg pb l was observed at ph 7 0 between 24 and 72 h of stagnation however such a difference was not observed at ph 8 5 lytle and schock 2000 in a pilot setup made of harvested lsls with simulated plslr increasing the stagnation time from 30 min to 16 h prior to sampling resulted in an increase in dissolved lead concentrations of 28 32 for full lsls and 24 42 for partial lsls for different water qualities cartier et al 2013 similar observations were made by kogo et al 2017 after stagnation times of 30 min 6 h and 65 h in simulated plslr untreated water orthop zn orthop and sodium silicate dosing in a study conducted by wang et al 2013 lead pipes connected to copper pipes using plastic or brass connectors were left stagnating in water for 6 and 65 h with chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr conditions of 0 7 and 7 higher pb concentrations were measured after 65 h and more so in the 0 7 csmr water flushing water from the pipes decreased metal concentrations as observed in lsls after 1 and 5 min of flushing cartier et al 2011 then diffusion modelling can be used to describe lead and copper release depending on varying stagnation time however when a higher fraction of particulate cu or pb is present in the samples considerable scatter is shown in the model lytle and schock 2000 previous studies identified factors other than only stagnation time in influencing pb release at the tap flow rate is an important determinant of the release of particulate pb as highlighted by field and pilot studies with high flow rates linked to increased particulate pb release cartier et al 2012 clark et al 2014 st clair et al 2016 in a field study samples collected at high flow rates without prior stagnation were shown to release higher lead concentrations than first draw samples collected at low flow and the site specific nature of pb release was also highlighted clark et al 2014 under some water qualities in a pilot setup most of the pb release was particulate and the release of this form of pb was qualified as variable and sporadic in some distribution systems mcneill and edwards 2004 triantafyllidou et al 2007 water quality and scale composition influence the shape of the stagnation curve for both lead and copper release as a function of varying stagnation time lytle and schock 2000 hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 oxidation rate changes with chlorine residual a lag phase was observed at the beginning of stagnation and followed by a rapid oxidation liu et al 2008 the oxidation rate of hydrocerussite commonly found in lsls desantis et al 2018 is a determining factor for the concentration of lead in water in dissolution experiments using minium pb3o4 in the presence of free chlorine guo et al 2016 observed an immediate lead dissolution which is in agreement with previous experiments the objectives of this study were 1 to determine how different water qualities impacted the passivation of new copper pipe when simulating a partial lsl replacement 2 to analyze the impact of stagnation time on total dissolved and particulate lead and copper concentrations in full and partial lsls at pilot scale 3 to determine how changing the water quality affects the release of lead and copper using different stagnation times for sampling 4 to investigate the impact of high velocity flushing on total dissolved and particulate pb release in a simulated partial lsl and 5 to determine the implications of different stagnation time on lead and copper concentrations regarding exposure and sampling protocols 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot setup excavated lsls from the distribution system of the city of montreal were installed in a flow through pilot fed by water from the same distribution system as detailed in cartier et al 2013 and in doré et al 2019 under normal conditions the setup was operated 8 h per day 5 days per week without stagnation exceeding 72 h at a flow rate of 5 lpm 0 4 0 6 m s depending on pipe diameter per pipe 30 psi the pilot was run with harvested lsls over one year and after that plslr were simulated for a fraction 2 3 of the lsls in the pilot by connecting the lsls to a new copper pipe using a red brass compression fitting cartier et al 2013 resulting in three different pipe configurations the pipe configurations tested included 1 a 100 pb lsl of 3 m with no compression fitting 2 a partial lsl with a 1 8 m new copper pipe type m connected upstream of a 0 6 m aged lsl using a compression fitting cu pb configuration 3 a partial lsl with an aged lsl 0 6 m connected downstream of a new copper pipe 1 8 m using a compression fitting pb cu configuration the three configurations installed represent respectively an lsl without replacement 100 pb a plslr completed by the utility cu pb or by the homeowner pb cu as described in cartier et al 2013 and in doré et al 2019 different water qualities were tested in the pilot for lsls with an internal diameter i d of 16 mm including 1 control condition csmr 0 9 ph 7 9 alk 90 mg caco3 l dic of 20 mg c l at 20 c no chlorine residual 2 addition of sulfate as na2so4 csmr 0 3 3 orthophosphate addition at 1 mg p l with ph re stabilisation to 7 9 and 4 increase in ph to 8 3 by dosing naoh a fifth condition consisted of smaller i d lsls 13 mm under control conditions and for which soldered red brass fittings were used for the plslr configurations 2 2 sampling for lead and copper lead and copper concentrations from the three pipe configurations tested in the pilot were monitored by repeated sampling after 16 h of stagnation 16hs over 155 weeks after plslr simulation to investigate the impact of plslr over long term a hundred weeks after plslr additional sampling was performed over 7 11 weeks after varying stagnation times including 6 24 48 and 72 h as well as two weeks stagnation and repeated three times finally samples were collected in two sampling campaing after 30 min stagnation and 9 times under flowing conditions 0 min stagnation batches of sampling were separated by a period of 4 6 weeks during which the pilot was operated under normal conditions to allow the pipes to recover from the changes in operation before any sampling event water flow was modified to ensure that fresh water was brought to each section of the pilot to avoid contamination from upstream pipes as described in cartier et al 2013 and doré et al 2019 water directly from the storage tank was fed into each section of the pilot cu pb 100 pb and pb cu sampling valves were then flushed for at least 30 s at a flow rate of 5 lpm in order to remove particles that may have accumulated between sampling events then during 30 min each section of the pilot were operated at 5 lpm water was allowed to sit for the pre determined stagnation time pressure was maintained within each pipe rig throughout the duration of the stagnation sampling was carried out under the same flow rate as under operation except for the smaller diameter pipes for which a flow rate of 15 lpm was elected sampling performed under flowing conditions is detailed elsewhere doré et al 2019 in all cases to ensure that all water in contact with the lead and copper pipes was sampled a 2 l sample was collected finally for a period of 7 weeks the smaller diameter pipes were operated under high flow rate 15 lpm 1 9 m s for a period of 1 h followed by 6 h under normal flow rate 5 lpm 0 6 m s and by second period of high flow rate 1 h grab samples were collected during periods of high and normal flow rates dissolved metals were measured after filtering a 40 ml aliquot on a 0 45 μm pvdf filter samples for total and dissolved metals were acidified with 0 5 hno3 directly in the sampling bottle for at least 24 h at room temperature and then 0 5 hcl was added to obtain the appropriate matrix metal concentrations were measured in an iso179025 certified laboratory using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms detection limits were of 0 11 μg cu l and 0 02 μg pb l other water quality monitoring ph cl2 dissolved oxygen toc turbidity chloride sulfate and phosphate is described in cartier et al 2013 and in doré et al 2019 average concentrations of copper and lead in the water feeding the pilot were respectively of 29 2 μg cu l and 0 1 μg pb l 2 3 determination of lead and copper release rates for each pipe configuration and water quality tested in the pilot setup a release rate μg h was estimated from the data obtained from the stagnation trials a first release rate was calculated by fitting a linear equation for the data obtained under conditions of flowing and stagnation of 0 5 6 and 16 h then a second linear equation was fitted to obtain the release rate for stagnation times ranging between 24 h and 2 weeks 2 4 scale analysis scales present inside the full and partial lsls were sampled depending on corrosion zones in partial lsls and were then analyzed by powder xrd to identify major crystalline minerals present as detailed in desantis et al 2018 and schock et al 2008 2 5 statistical analysis statistica statsoft version 13 3 was used to carry out non parametrical statistical analysis kruskal wallis anova differences were considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise 3 results and discussion one of the key concerns raised with partial lsl replacements plslrs is the enhanced release of particulate lead pbpart and its contribution to exposure including acute exposure at the tap cartier et al 2012 cartier et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 mcneill and edwards 2004 st clair et al 2016 triantafyllidou et al 2007 following partial lsl replacements a new source of copper is added to the plumbing which could raise concerns of elevated copper concentrations trends for the release of all forms of pb and cu can be examined after both short 0 5 16 h stagnation that can occur during normal water usage in residential buildings and after prolonged stagnations 24 336 h that are representative of extended inoccupancy periods 3 1 copper concentrations after plslr simulation following plslr simulation and after 16 h stagnation copper concentrations decreased from week 20 155 after simulation of partial lsl replacements for both plslr configurations and for all water qualities fig 1 the formation of a passivating film is expected after the installation of cu pipes in a distribution system with the highest solubility associated with new un passivated pipes edwards et al 2002 lagos et al 2001 schock et al 1995 turek et al 2011 copper concentrations in water are determined by the scales and their solubility formed at the interface between the pipe and the water schock and lytle 2011 for example the solubility of cupric solids can be 10 1 000x greater than cuprous oxide or hydroxide lytle and schock 2000 which can impact the concentrations of copper in water a brief investigation of the scale composition present in this pilot by powder xrd revealed that the dominant mineral present in crystalline form in all pipes was cuprite cuo2 with some presence of cu ii such as tenorite cuo malachite cu2co3 oh 2 and traces of posnjakite cu4 so4 oh 6 h2o median concentrations were clearly highest for the smaller diameter 16 mm pipes and trended downward after week 104 globally decreasing by 1 6 fold cu pb and 1 7 fold pb cu to account for the lower dilution in the smaller diameter median masses of copper released from the cu pb configuration over the whole period were compared to the control condition and found to be similar 815 8 213 5 μg cu for the 16 mm vs 798 7 178 3 μg cu for the 22 mm interestingly median masses of copper were significantly lower in the small diameter pipe in the pb cu configuration 487 9 87 5 μg cu for the 16 mm vs 803 7 180 8 μg cu for the 22 mm p 0 001 with the exception of the smaller diameter pipe in the cu pb configuration in the first 104 weeks 90th percentile cu concentrations remained well below 2 000 μg cu l after 16hs which is the new health based maximum acceptable concentration mac proposed by health canada 2018 and who 2017 however not even the addition of orthop reduced copper concentrations below the california phg of 300 μg cu l as 90th percentile values reached 415 1 μg cu l and 394 1 μg cu l for the cu pb and pb cu configuration respectively the modest increase of ph from 7 9 to 8 3 decreased median cu concentrations by 42 44 in both plslr configurations in agreement with the low solubility of cuo schock et al 1995 one of the minerals detected a similar decrease in copper concentrations associated to an increase in ph ph 7 15 to 7 8 alk 200 mg caco3 l was observed at bench scale in new copper pipes edwards et al 2011 and in copper coupons in contact with synthetic water pehkonen et al 2002 the addition of sulfate to decrease the csmr from 0 9 to 0 3 did not influence cu release in agreement with findings from schock et al 1995 stating that sulfate complexes are not likely to be significant for cuprosolvency however in copper pipes connected to pb pipes at bench scale kogo et al 2017 related an increase in csmr to an increase in copper concentrations after 30 min and 6 h of stagnation copper concentrations in presence of orthop remained quasi constant throughout the duration of the experiment with 90th percentile concentrations of 441 4 and 394 1 μg cu l 104 weeks before the plslr simulation for the cu pb and pb cu configurations respectively and of 415 1 and 463 4 μg cu l after 104 weeks the addition of orthop was the most efficient treatment to reduce copper concentrations in both plslr configurations after 16hs with median concentrations 3 9 fold cu pb and 3 6 fold pb cu lower than concentrations for the control condition the addition of orthop has been shown to cause a rapid decrease of cu concentrations in similar water quality in coupon pehkonen et al 2002 pilot edwards et al 2002 and full scale schock and sandvig 2009 testing dosing 1 mg p l of orthop showed a similar decrease in copper concentrations in a pipe rig it however required a dose of 2 mg p l to decrease concentrations below 1 300 μg cu l edwards et al 2011 utilities which added orthop for the control of lead concentrations also witnessed an initial decrease in copper levels shortly after the onset of the added corrosion control treatment schock and sandvig 2009 3 2 effect of stagnation time on copper concentrations copper concentrations measured in the 2 l samples were adjusted to reflect the concentration of water stagnating in the copper pipe section 362 684 ml as triplicate stagnation trials were conducted over a period of 40 weeks the sampling period was sufficiently long to provide time for scales to age aging of the copper pipes in the pilot is expected to promote the formation of cuprite cuo2 and then malachite cu2co3 oh 2 and tenorite cuo ives and rawson 1962 schock and lytle 2011 fig s1 shows the variability of the copper concentrations between sampling events for duplicate pipes as a function of stagnation time indeed copper concentrations released for the control condition and the orthop in the cu pb configuration follow similar trends for a given sampling event flowing to 72 h however different long term trends of copper concentrations are observed after extended 336 h of stagnation for the same pipe during one sampling event between duplicate pipes between events and between water qualities the application of orthop stabilizes the concentrations of dissolved copper cudiss as these concentrations are clearly more stable throughout the sampling period even after long stagnation times as compared to the control condition fig s1 b and d for nearly all water qualities tested concentrations of total dissolved and particulate copper cutotal cudiss and cupart increase sharply within the first 16 h of stagnation fig 2 for cu pb fig 3 for pb cu a similar increase was also observed for total copper over 20 25 h by lytle and schock 2000 in a pipe loop fed by hard softened and untreated groundwaters while the maximum was observed after only 10 h for a new pipe rig with similar water quality alkalinity of 89 mg caco3 l ph 7 3 merkel et al 2002 after the sharp initial increase copper concentrations tend to fluctuate for all water qualities with a few pipes showing peak concentrations after 336 h as the duration of stagnation increases dissolution and precipitation of copper can both occur no trend of decreasing concentrations with extended stagnation following a werner characteristic curve was systematically observed this is in contrast to sharp decreases 90 reported by lytle and schock 2000 after 72 92 h dissolved oxygen 0 4 mg o2 l or after 60 72 h merkel et al 2002 merkel and pehkonen 2006 dissolved oxygen concentrations in the pilot after stagnation ranged from 3 0 to 11 7 mg o2 l reflecting the oversaturation in the distributed water in the pilot in the presence of orthop edwards et al 2002 observed an increase in copper concentrations by 2 fold from 8 to 72 h in a pipe rigs which is consistent with the 1 4 fold increase between 6 and 72 h for both partial configurations orthop treated pipes in this study the impact of the induced water quality changes can also be assessed by comparing the release rates of cutotal cudiss and cupart μg cu h presented in table 1 overall the rate of increase in cudiss can be well correlated for the first 16 h of stagnation r2 range 0 54 0 95 for all but the control pb cu pipes resulting rates of release vary widely from 8 3 to 40 3 μg cutotal h depending on water quality the rate of increase of cutotal concentrations in the pipe μg cu h is comparable for the control and small diameter pipes for the cu pb but not for the pb cu reflecting the larger mass released in the cu pb configuration fig 1 the release of cudiss is the main contributor to cutotal in the cu pb configuration 74 89 and to a lesser degree for the pb cu configuration 65 94 the contributions from cupart could only be correlated as a function of stagnation time for the cu pb configuration showing modest values ranging from 1 19 to 10 3 μg cupart h for long term stagnation ranging from 16 h to 2 weeks release rates could not be quantified because of the high variability in cu concentrations except for the ph 8 3 cu pb and pb cu and the addition of orthop cu pb r2 0 58 for those conditions estimated rates show that copper release represent less than 6 1 of the rates observed during the first 16 h however cudiss remained most dominant over time during extended stagnation 48 83 overall orthop and increased ph 8 3 treatment were most effective to decrease all forms of copper after both short and extended stagnation which could be expected based on preferred scale minerals formed indeed solids such as cu3 po4 2 form in the presence of orthop which have a lower solubility than cu oh 2 explaining the lower copper concentrations measured edwards et al 2002 increasing ph from 7 9 to 8 3 will also lower the solubility of cu ii and malachite at low dic such as in the test water schock and lytle 2011 as the pilot included brass fittings it is possible that the red brass compression fittings present in the pilot contributed to copper levels in the water furthermore copper release could be reduced if the copper pipe is galvanically protected when acting as the cathode in the galvanic couple pb cu and cu brass desantis et al 2018 however a reversal of the galvanic couple is possible under specific water quality promoting the formation of low solubility pb iv solids arnold and edwards 2012 desantis et al 2018 3 3 effect of stagnation time on lead concentrations as stagnation increases lead concentrations are expected to rise first rapidly and then taper off to reach a quasi equilibrium after about 15 h in agreement with mass transfer stagnation curve models derived from lead pipe rigs ph 6 8 alkalinity 10 mg caco3 l and ph 7 2 alkalinity 213 mg caco3 l when soluble lead is the dominant form kuch and wagner 1983 schock 1990 triantafyllidou et al 2007 lead concentrations in water after stagnation are determined by the composition of the scale pb iv solids being less soluble than pb ii products schock and lytle 2011 triantafyllidou et al 2015 and depend on the contribution of pbpart cartier et al 2013 deshommes et al 2010 preliminary analysis of the scales in the pipe rig revealed the dominance of the pb ii compounds as crystalline forms cerussite pbco3 and hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 which are both very soluble figs s2 and s3 show detailed results per replicate pipe for 100 pb and cu pb configurations for control and orthop conditions over the repeat stagnation trials extending over 40 weeks unlike observations on the variability of copper release over time lead release for a given pipe was found to be stable however significant variability was noted between replicate pipe concentrations either in the full lsl or plslr configurations the variability between replicate pipes most probably reflect heterogeneity of scales of the harvested lead pipes from the distribution system of the city in contrast to the uniform initial surfaces of newly installed copper piping 3 3 1 100 pb configuration for all conditions tested total dissolved and particulate lead pbtotal pbdiss and pbpart released from 100 pb pipes fig 4 follow the same trend of increasing concentrations as a function of stagnation time a sharper increase is observed at short stagnation times 16 h rapid increase in concentrations is expected to be followed by a plateau after 16hs as predicted by solubility modelling kuch and wagner 1983 and as verified for different water qualities and corrosion treatment edwards and mcneill 2002 for stagnation times up to 16 h median lead concentrations were the lowest for the orthop condition as compared to the smaller diameter pipes showing differences ranging from 6 4 to 9 8 fold for pbtotal 8 2 14 4 fold for pbdiss and 2 7 7 3 fold for pbpart the maximum pb concentrations were generally measured after 16hs for all conditions tested and reached a median of 777 6 μg pbtotal l in the small diameter 13 mm pb pipe despite an apparent increase in pb concentrations flowing and 30 min stagnation samples results were not significantly different p 0 05 however 30 min stagnation concentrations were significantly lower p 0 1 than those after 16 h for all conditions but the addition of orthop for which a significant increase was only observed after 2 weeks lytle and schock 2000 reported also small differences after 24 and 72 h of stagnation using lead coupons exposed to ph 8 5 water the trends in the particulate lead fraction as stagnation increases can be observed on fig 5 a showing wide variations of fractions at any given time for a pipe corresponding to the sporadic release of particles captured by the 0 45 μm filters nevertheless a clear trend of smaller yet variable particulate fractions was measured in flowing samples 13 2 36 6 and to a lesser extent in 30 min stagnation samples 14 4 84 4 for all conditions tested a clear trend of increased particulate fraction after 6 h of stagnation was only observed for the orthop and small diameter conditions as particulate fractions increased from a median of 30 2 and 33 5 after 0 30 min to 56 6 and 54 2 after 6 h respectively our findings are consistent with elevated fractions of 58 78 2 h stagnation and up to 46 flowing reported for 1 mg p l orthop at ph 7 5 in newly aged lead pipes xie and giammar 2011 for other conditions ph 8 3 sulfate and control fractions remained steady in flowing samples and throughout stagnation ranging from 12 5 to 16 9 in the orthop condition it must be noted that the high particulate fraction corresponds to a concentration of pbpart lower than with other conditions fig 4c depending on water quality pbtotal release rates vary widely 7 6 37 0 μg pbtotal h within the first 16 h of stagnation with the worst release in the small diameter pipe table 2 similar to what was observed for copper the lowest lead release rates are observed after the addition of orthop with dissolved lead release rates 2 fold lower than for the control condition 0 16hs dissolved lead concentrations from 100 pb pipes can be well correlated r2 0 80 and accounted for 13 61 of the pbtotal release rate table 2 the release of particulate lead could not be correlated because of its high intrinsic variability fig 5c most probably caused by the sporadic detachment of pbpart from the scales as observed in fig 4c when considering stagnation extending from 24 to 336 h much smaller pbdiss release rates were observed representing less than 6 2 of the rates observed during the first 16 h r2 0 46 0 82 the release of pbtotal during extended stagnation are poorly correlated r2 0 54 again because of the random nature of pbpart detachment as with copper concentrations for extended stagnation total lead release rates are harder to correlate with the co occurrence of dissolution and precipitation mechanisms in the pipes stagnation curves were produced by cartier et al 2013 shortly after the simulated plslr less than 4 months reporting marked increases in both dissolved colloidal lead after extending the stagnation from 30 min to 16 h a growing proportion of pbpart was observed after 16hs for 100 lead pipes pbpart release increased by 7 27fold between 30 min and 16 h stagnation sampling while in plslr the increase of pbpart ranged from 3 to 25 fold excluding the condition at ph 8 3 3 3 2 cu pb and pb cu configurations the role of pbpart in increasing pb concentrations at the tap after extended stagnation is a key question especially in the case of partial lsl replacements it has been suggested that extending stagnation will increase the relative contribution of particulate lead in the total lead released during stagnation cartier et al 2013 in simulated plslrs the addition of the galvanic connection between the pb and the cu pipes as well as the brass fittings adds new sources for metal release as compared to 100 pb configurations previous research demonstrated the importance of the fittings in increased pb released by comparing dielectric and compression fittings the latter exacerbating the pb concentrations in simulated partial lsl replacements wang et al 2013 overall more variability in total lead concentrations can be observed in the partial lsls figs 6 and 7 than in the full lsls fig 4 this variability can be explained by the sporadic spikes of particulate lead concentrations in the samples which is reflected in the higher fraction of particulate pb fig 5b and c for cu pb and pb cu respectively a clear trend of smaller yet variable particulate fractions is found in flowing samples for all conditions 13 2 36 6 except for orthop 36 6 45 8 extremely high median particulate fractions were observed after any stagnation 30 min 2 weeks for the orthop 68 92 3 and small diameter 31 7 89 0 conditions for other conditions ph 8 3 and control particulate fractions also increased after stagnation it was however less so for the sulfate condition 21 6 43 4 in the case of the orthop condition it can be noted that the high particulate fraction corresponds to elevated concentrations of pbpart unlike observations with 100 pb pipes as with copper in partial lsls and lead in full lsls pbtotal concentrations increased and then reached a plateau and slightly fluctuated for stagnation times greater than 16 h figs 7 and 8 despite an apparent increase in concentrations flowing and 30 min stagnation samples were not significantly different p 0 05 overall only flowing samples were significantly lower p 0 1 than those measured after 16 h for all conditions and all pbtotal concentrations were highly variable after more than 6 16 h of stagnation and not significantly distinct during extended stagnation precipitation and dissolution of different forms of lead can occur as the water quality in the pipe change with the depletion of dissolved oxygen and oxidants lytle and schock 2000 similar fluctuations after 6 h stagnation were observed in simulated plslr under control orthop and silicate addition conditions kogo et al 2017 the addition of orthop decreased pbtotal the most in both plslr configurations mainly through its action on pbdiss figs 6 and 7 these findings are in agreement with the short term trends 4 months after partial replacement showing a 3 25 fold pbpart increase between stagnation times of 30 min and 16 h cartier et al 2013 after an extended period of operation of 155 weeks pbpart concentrations increased by a factor of 2 8 25 fold except for the sulfate addition 1 0 fold and the ph 8 3 73 fold conditions in the pb cu configuration the pbtotal release rate is higher during the first 16 h of stagnation and then tappers off with increased stagnation times table 2 the additional sources of lead in the partial lsls could explain the lower r2 for certain water qualities depending on water quality pbtotal release rates from plslrs vary widely 0 3 100 4 μg pbtotal h within the first 16 h of stagnation with the orthop condition systematically the highest table 2 dissolved lead concentrations from partial lsls can be well correlated r2 0 41 0 82 unlike pbtotal or pbpart concentrations because of the high intrinsic variability of pbpart figs 6c and 7c when corrected for the length of lead pipe in contact with water the dissolved lead release in the partials with only 60 cm of lsl were 43 150 higher than for 100 pb pipes of 300 cm in stark contrast with observations for the 100 pb pipes pb release rates for partial lsls were dominated by particulate lead release dissolved lead rates during the first 16 h for the cu pb configuration represent indeed a minor proportion 15 4 30 3 of the pbtotal release rates accounting for less than 1 for the orthop condition table 2 the intensified release of both forms of pb after partial replacement can be attributed mainly to galvanic corrosion as reported by doré et al 2019 who differentiated lead release from the galvanic connection from non galvanic surfaces nevertheless the brass fittings could have contributed to pb concentrations after extended stagnation 65 72 h lytle and schock 2000 triantafyllidou and edwards 2007 wang et al 2013 3 4 impact of high velocity flushing adjusting the operational flow of the pilot from 5 to 15 lpm resulted in drastic increases in median total 5 2 fold and particulate pb 78 fold for the cu pb small diameter configuration fig 8a and b tripling the flow rate had however a less important impact for the 100 pb 1 2 fold and the pb cu 0 9 fold configurations to simulate the impact of higher water usage or preventive high velocity flushing such as performed after plslr on the accumulation of particulate lead additional testing was conducted at the end of the pilot operation period high velocity flushing at 15 lpm 1 9 m s was conducted twice a day for 7 weeks lead release after 16 h of stagnation before and after the high velocity flushing trials are compared in fig 8c and d for 16 h stagnation samples after stagnation 16hs median total pb concentrations decreased by 1 6 fold pb cu to 12 fold cu pb while median particulate pb decreased by up to 24 fold high velocity flushing therefore appears to be an effective tool to reduce the accumulated particulate lead in a service line therefore flushing decreased the mobilized particulate lead levels under flowing conditions but even more so after extended stagnation from 192 to 7 9 μg pbpart l however these observations also show that systematic flushing prior to stagnation leads to an underestimation of lead at the tap and supports the proscription of flushing in regulatory protocols 3 5 implications for exposure to lead and copper copper concentrations were always below the 300 μg cu l california phg for flowing samples however after only 30 min of stagnation all samples exceeded this threshold for the smaller diameter pipes and frequent exceedances of the proposed health based level of 2 000 μg cu l were observed after 16hs for the cu pb configuration 13 58 samples all stagnation times exceeded 2 000 μg cu l it is important to note that these elevated copper concentrations were measured in relatively short pipes 1 8 m even after 155 weeks of operation it raises the potential of large volumes of copper with elevated concentrations reaching the tap when copper piping is used for premise plumbing avoiding these elevated concentrations would require prolonged flushing before concentrations are lowered as observed in large buildings doré et al 2018 for the pipes treated with the addition of orthop maximum concentrations never exceeded 1 000 μg cu l and only 8 58 cu pb and 11 58 pb cu samples exceeded 300 μg cu l exceedances of maximum recommended levels of 5 and 10 μg l pb are more ubiquitous amongst stagnation times for all water qualities tested similar to trends reported in schools and large buildings doré et al 2018 lead concentrations in lsls exceeded recommended levels in few flushed samples small diameter pipes and in nearly all samples collected after only 30 min of stagnation the plslr observations in this study represent worst case scenarios in terms of exposure to elevated pb concentrations because they include very high contributions from the galvanic connection in the partial lsls doré et al 2019 however in pipe concentrations measured in this study could be present in longer lsls typically present in distribution systems deshommes et al 2017 after 6 h of stagnation which is realistic in a household after overnight or after workday the masses of pb release from the lead pipe volumes 80 603 ml exceeded 175 μg pb in 26 of samples with at least one high occurrence for each condition tested if consumed at the tap it would correspond to an acute exposure threshold uscpsc 2005 as presented in previous studies conducted in schools large buildings and in households with lsls deshommes et al 2012 doré et al 2018 triantafyllidou and edwards 2010 3 6 implications for lead and copper sampling the various stagnation times and targeted levels currently being used for lead and copper sampling determine the concentrations that are detected at the tap if sampling results are compared to a set standard the selection of the stagnation duration before collecting the sample is critical major differences exist in the various guidelines and standards regarding sampling protocols used for the detection of lead and copper especially the duration of stagnation preflush prior stagnation and the selection of the sampling volume table s1 stagnation time used prior to sampling can therefore have repercussions on the concentrations measured cartier et al 2011 the stagnation time used prior to sampling will impact the percentage of houses with exceedances in lead or copper concentrations in a distribution system as reported in schools and large buildings doré et al 2018 a very short stagnation period will lead to an under evaluation of the exceedances and of the exposure to potential elevated lead levels at the tap and even more so for copper sampling targeted towards the detection of lead sources is also likely to miss the sources of copper as its leaching rate is slower than lead depending on the scales present inside the pipes different stagnation times should be considered depending on the objectives of sampling if the intention is to measure peak concentrations to which the consumer may be exposed metal concentrations after typical and prolonged stagnation should be targeted in the case of lead even the lower 10th percentile concentrations exceeded regulated levels 10 μg pb l within the first 30 min of stagnation except for the 100 pb pipe treated with orthop however after the same stagnation time maximum copper concentrations did not exceed the aesthetic objective of 1 000 μg cu l and few water qualities pipe configuration exceeded the phg of california 300 μg cu l therefore a 30 min stagnation prior to sampling would not detect households at risk of elevated copper concentrations for copper only 90th percentiles of the smaller diameter pipes and the control condition cu pb exceeded 1 000 μg cu l after 6 h stagnation for most water qualities and pipe configurations lead and copper median total concentrations increased between 6 and 16 h of stagnation tables 3 and 4 however between stagnation times of 16 and 24 h in multiple instances a slight decrease in median concentrations was observed probably due to onset of deposition of copper in some water qualities and depending on the type of scale deposits present a longer stagnation time has been shown to underestimate the maximum concentration of copper lytle and schock 2000 this difference between how lead and copper concentrations vary during extended stagnation can therefore have monitoring implications schock and lemieux 2010 comparing 6 h stagnation samples and 16 h stagnation samples lytle and schock 2000 found a 35 difference in lead increases and a 270 in the case of copper depending on the age of the copper pipes finally temperature has been shown to have a reverse impact on copper and lead concentrations with cold water representing a higher risk of elevated copper release unlike lead masters et al 2016 to assess typical exposure stagnation times representative of the time between usages in a household should be used such as the 30 min stagnation or random day time sampling system wide van den hoven and slaats 2006 composite sampling is the best approach to measure exposure but is only feasible for research purposes van den hoven and slaats 2006 4 conclusion dissolved lead and copper concentrations can be well correlated for the first 16 h of stagnation in full and partial lsls under different water qualities the addition of orthop decreased copper concentrations in partial lsls independently of the duration of stagnation prior to sampling for the period of 155 weeks of experimentation in full lsls it was also the most effective treatment in reducing total lead concentrations the increase rates of dissolved lead and copper during stagnation can be better correlated than those for particulate lead and copper increasing the sampling flow rate from 5 to 15 lpm drastically increased particulate lead release in cu pb configurations 78 fold while having almost no impact for the 100 pb pipe or pb cu configurations high velocity flushing prior to 16 h stagnation decreased total pb release by 12 fold for cu pb 1 6 fold for pb cu and 2 0 fold for 100 pb showing that flushing prior to stagnation should be proscribed stagnation time prior to sampling should reflect the differences in kinetic dissolution of lead and copper sampling should be targeted for the detection of either pb or cu as measuring both metals in the same sample is sub optimal in light of the results obtained acknowledgements this study was

19121,microbially induced concrete corrosion micc is a major deterioration affecting sewers worldwide micc is not uniform on sewer inner walls and often occurs at hot spots such as crown and tidal regions which are critical to determine sewer service life especially concrete corrosion in tidal regions is complicated due to the fluctuation of wastewater levels and the hydraulic scouring effects the traditional methodology of corrosion monitoring also limits the study of the tidal corrosion in this study by using a combination of various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the development of corrosion the formation of corrosion products and the variation of microbial communities in tidal regions were investigated systematically the physical chemical characteristics in tidal regions varied with the distance from the wastewater surface above the wastewater more severe corrosion was detected with a closer distance to wastewater producing gypsum as the major corrosion products the microbial succession in tidal regions occurred with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria initially and shifting to the predominant colonization of mycobacterium when ph reached around 1 the heterotrophic bacteria i e mycobacterium and bacillus were likely responsible for the observed corrosion due to the potential capability in generating sulfuric acid the applications of advanced mineral and microbial analytical techniques were demonstrated effective in improving the understanding of concrete sewer corrosion graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer corrosion concrete mineral liberation analysis microbial community 1 introduction sewer networks are critical urban infrastructures of modern societies performing the safe transport of sewage from domestic and industrial sites to treatment facilities however concrete corrosion caused by the biogenic sulfuric acid derived from the oxidation of gaseous hydrogen sulfide is a major deteriorating process in sewer systems grengg et al 2017 liu et al 2017 parker 1947 the u s environmental protection agency epa states that microbially induced concrete corrosion micc can reduce the 50 100 year expected sewer service life to less than 10 years bowker et al 1992 causing annual economic losses of over tens of billions of dollars worldwide corrosion of concrete sewers is a complex process usually proceeding with the initial acidification by carbonation co2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s and then progressing to more damaging chemical reactions between the biogenic sulfuric acid and cementitious materials jiang et al 2014b 2016 on the inner wall of sewers the micc is not uniform and often occurs at hot spots such as the crown region at the ceiling of sewers and the tidal region which is imminently above the wastewater level islander et al 1991 jiang et al 2014a 2015 the crown region is mainly exposed to sewer atmosphere and is only periodically wetted during high sewage flows in contrast the tidal region is frequently inundated by wastewater resulting in more variable redox conditions distinctive corrosion morphologies and evidence of rapid corrosion rates can be obvious in these crown and tidal regions in gravity sewers although previous investigations of micc have focused more on the crown regions cayford et al 2017 joseph et al 2012 ling et al 2015 mori et al 1992 vollertsen et al 2008 some recent studies found that the corrosion can be more severe at the tidal regions jiang et al 2014a our long term 4 years studies using laboratory corrosion chambers confirmed that the partially submerged concrete coupons simulating the tidal region showed much higher levels of corrosion than coupons located in the gas phase that were simulating the crown region jiang et al 2014a additionally our recent study demonstrated that frequent wetting by wastewater flooding and spraying could enhance sewer corrosion rates jiang et al 2016 likely in tidal regions the more frequent replenishment of moisture nutrients and microbial inoculum by wastewater will occur compared to other wall locations further away from the wastewater level because of the faster corrosion the service life of partially filled concrete sewer pipes could be largely determined by the corrosion occurring in tidal regions rather than in crown regions thus the detailed corrosion processes are required to improve the understanding of sewer corrosion and aid in optimization of sewer management strategies however the specific corrosion reactions the potentially distinct microbial communities and the effects of wastewater on tidal corrosion have not been thoroughly investigated many previous studies on microbial communities have relied on random and non replicate samples without systematic site selections islander et al 1991 ling et al 2014 which unfortunately limits the interpretation and insights that could be made of sewer corrosion vincke et al 2001 for the first time attempted to differentiate the microbial communities between the crown side and bottom of sewers while some differences were detected the details of the community compositions were limited as the relatively restricted molecular method of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge was used recently cayford et al 2017 further delineated the variations of the microbial communities in ceiling wall and tidal zones it was reported that tidal communities were distinct from those in other samples with eight bacterial orders and one archaeal order detected in the tidal zone however the detailed knowledge of the microorganisms there were limited especially in comparison with what was known of communities at the crowns and walls further away from the wastewater while these studies performing microbial community profiling are providing new insights the detailed community analysis at the tidal regions is yet to be determined considering the multiple effects of sewer gas wastewater and the potential activities of distinct bacteria at tidal regions it is likely that physical chemical conditions and corrosion products specific to that region would occur of the regions exposed to the sewer atmosphere it was demonstrated that the tidal regions had the highest moisture content and levels of nitrogen organic carbon and sulfur cayford et al 2017 however correlations between the physical chemical conditions of the region and the corrosion process are poorly understood and characterization of corrosion products which is required to determine the actual corrosion reactions and roles of microbial activities has been largely missing this study aims to help comprehend the corrosion in tidal regions of reinforced concrete sewers through investigating the development of corrosion the formation of corrosion products and the variation of microbial communities with time and location to simulate the tidal regions concrete coupons were partially submerged in wastewater in a pilot scale gravity sewer pipe with 700 1100 ppm of h2s for 6 months the characteristics of concrete corrosion products and bacterial communities were analyzed using various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing illumina at two time points spanning 6 months the localized corrosion variability was delineated together with the effects of the wastewater on the corrosion processes in addition the corrosion products and microbial communities on reinforcing steel rebar surface were also determined the outcomes from this thorough investigation of tidal corrosion can be utilized to mitigate sewer corrosion through the optimization of sewer constructions and operations 2 methods and materials 2 1 pilot sewer and exposure conditions the experiments were conducted in a pilot scale sewer system located at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the pilot sewer system consists of two sets of 100 mm internal diameter id pvc pressure lines and two sets of 225 mm id pvc gravity lines figure si 1 with each line having a workable length of 300 m each line is suspended by adjustable saddles to adjust the overall slope for sampling purposes the gravity lines have sampling ports figure si 2 installed on both lines at distances of 1 30 55 270 and 300 m from the influent tanks the pilot sewer system is controlled by a programmable logic controller plc and the operation state is manipulated using the lab view lab view 2014 real time in this study two parallel ports port a and b on two separate gravity lines at the distance of 270 m from the influent were used for duplicate exposure experiments during the exposure period 6 months the system was at a slope of 0 56 raw wastewater was pumped to the inlets of both gravity lines at a pump rate of 200 l min the wastewater flow velocity was about 0 71 m s in each pipe the wastewater depth in the gravity lines was 2 3 cm the typical characteristics of the wastewater fed to the lines were determined table 1 for the analysis of dissolved sulfide and sulfate 1 5 ml of wastewater was filtered 0 22 μm membrane into 0 5 ml preserving solution of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob samples were analyzed within 24 h on an ion chromatograph ic with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 jiang et al 2011 to determine dissolved methane 5 ml of wastewater was filtered 0 22 μm membrane into vacuumed bd vacutainer tubes the gas liquid equilibrium in the tubes was achieved overnight methane in the gas phase was measured by gas chromatography shimadzu gc 9a equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the concentrations of methane in wastewater were calculated using mass balance and henry s law jiang et al 2011 the analytical methods for other parameters in table 1 were presented in tables si 1 besides the detailed daily average values of biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod conductivity ph and temperature of wastewater were also monitored by the liquiid station zaps technology america figure si 3 the gaseous h2s concentrations and gas temperature in the gravity lines were monitored using an odalog detector type 2 app tek international pty ltd brendale australia with a measuring range of h2s between 0 and 2000 ppm the relative humidity rh of the sewer gas was monitored using a hand held humidity meter hm70 vaisala finland 2 2 concrete coupons the concrete coupons were prepared from already corroded concrete sewer slabs obtained from sydney water corporation australia details of the coupon preparation are described elsewhere jiang et al 2014a 2014b briefly the coupons were cut to approximately 100 mm length 70 mm width 70 mm thickness and washed by high pressure water to remove any existing concrete corrosion layer and any surface contamination the washed coupons were immediately dried in an oven thermotec 2000 contherm at 60 c for 3 days four concrete coupons were simultaneously partially submerged in wastewater inside of the gravity lines i e coupon a1 and a2 in port a coupon b1 and b2 in port b figure si 4 in particular coupon b1 had a plain round reinforcing steel bar rebar with a nominal diameter of 12 mm that was embedded with about 2 cm thickness of concrete cover figure si 4 for each coupon the original internal surface of the sewer slab was partially submerged in the wastewater which was called the exposed surface figure si 4 as demonstrated by previous studies jiang et al 2014a 2015 this arrangement well simulated the position of the sewer tidal region a location highly susceptible to micc cayford et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 mori et al 1992 2 3 corrosion monitoring and corrosion sample collection after exposure in the gravity lines the exposed surfaces of the coupons simulating the tidal regions were utilized for corrosion monitoring and sample collection to differentiate the localized physical chemical corrosion characteristics and positioning of microbial communities at the tidal regions the exposed surface was divided into different areas these were an area above the wastewater level ww and 0 2 cm below the top edge of the coupon top an area 0 2 cm above the wastewater level aw an area below the wastewater level bw and a rebar cross section rb only for coupon b1 section 3 2 as the aw areas were closer to the ww than the top areas they were frequently inundated by the wastewater resulting in an alternative aerobic and anaerobic condition which is a typical characteristic of tidal regions coupon a1 b1 and coupon a2 b2 were retrieved after 3 and 6 months of exposure respectively in particular after the monitoring and sampling of coupon a1 it was put back to port a just for a display purpose the macro level corrosion morphology of each coupon was photographed for visual inspection the surface ph was measured at the areas top aw ww bw and rb respectively section 3 2 using a flat surface ph electrode extech ph150c concrete ph kit extech instruments as previously described jiang et al 2014a 2015 further the surface corrosion layer was destructively sampled according to the specific areas defined above the corrosion products were carefully scraped with a sterile blade directly into sterile 50 ml falcon tubes respectively large aggregates were removed to obtain only loose concrete corrosion products one third of the corrosion products were used for moisture measurement song et al 2017 scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and x ray diffraction xrd analysis the moisture measurements were performed by weighing each sample before and after drying to a constant weight at 105 c the remaining corrosion products were used for microbial analysis as specified in section 2 4 and 2 5 respectively after the corrosion layer removal the coupons were further washed with high pressure water then five spots on the top aw and bw areas on the exposed surfaces were chosen respectively to determine the average coupon thickness of each area the coupon thickness loss of each area was then calculated by subtracting the average thickness after washing from the original thickness before exposure 2 4 sem eds and xrd analysis to identify the physical chemical characteristics of concrete corrosion products sem eds and xrd measurements were conducted on corrosion layers taken from top aw bw and rb areas the surface morphology and elemental composition of the corrosion products were examined by sem jeol jsm 6610 america which was equipped with a detector oxford 50mm2 x max sdd x ray that enabled simultaneous imaging and elemental analysis at high count rates with 125 ev energy resolutions the edax software edax ametek inc was utilized at a frame resolution of 1024 800 with a dwell time of 200 s frame to collect 16 frames for each region of interest the spot locations for elemental analysis were not random but chosen by examining the backscattered electron image bse which was typically used to identify the boundaries of mineral phases jiang et al 2014b the quantification of each individual eds spot analysis in wt was performed against mineral standards by using the mineralogical database http webmineral com as utilized before grengg et al 2017 before the test the samples were dried in a vacuum oven semsa oven 718 at 60 c for 8 h and then coated twice by the carbon coater quorum q150t uk following the three heavy burst mode to obtain the carbon thickness of 30 40 nm for samples of rebar rusts these were carefully vacuum dried at room temperature for 12 h coated with carbon 30 40 nm and analyzed immediately after sampling to avoid the advent of further oxidation the mineral compositions of the corrosion products were determined by xrd bruker d8 advance mkii which used a cu anode as the primary x ray beam source x rays were generated at 40 kv and 40 ma with 2 0 min as the scanning speed and 2θ 10 100 as the scanning range for the rebar rust samples micro xrd was utilized as an accurate method for the identification of localized compositions without the need to destroy samples into powders during the preparation grengg et al 2017 a rigaku smartlab micro diffraction system with a rotating cu anode 9 kw and micro focus optics was used to carry out point mineralogical analysis on the rust surface x rays were generated at 45 kv and 200 ma with 0 798 s step as the scanning speed 4499 counts as the scanning step and 2θ 20 110 as the scanning range diffraction patterns were processed using the rigaku pdxl2 data processing software version 2 3 1 0 the composition identifications were carried out using gade software version 5 and pdf 2 crystal structure database 2 5 microbial community analysis the microbial community analysis was conducted to corrosion products obtained from top aw bw and rb areas and also to wastewater and sediment samples taken directly from inside the gravity ports figure si 2 all samples were stored at 80 c before analysis due to the expected low levels of microorganisms and inhibitory molecules to pcr in the corrosion samples li et al 2017 cell extraction from the corrosion products was carried out prior to dna extraction as previously described jiang et al 2016 the cell extraction procedure includes sonication to loosen the cells from the corrosion products concentrating the cells from a sucrose gradient and then washing and centrifuging the cells gradually following that the total dna was extracted from the cell pellet using the fastdna spin kit for soil to perform 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing illumina extracted dna samples were provided to the australia center for ecogenomics ace brisbane australia pcr amplifications were conducted in q5 hot start high fidelity 2x master mix new england biolabs in standard pcr conditions modified universal primers 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc 3 were used to target the v6v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene which were efficient to detect the microorganisms inducing concrete corrosion in sewers cayford et al 2017 grengg et al 2017 the resulting pcr amplicons were purified using agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter then the purified dna was indexed with unique 8 bp barcodes using the illumina nextera xt 384 sample index kit a d illumina fc 131 1002 in standard pcr conditions with q5 hot start high fidelity 2x master mix the indexed amplicons were pooled together in equimolar concentrations and sequenced on miseq sequencing system illumina using paired end 2 300bp sequencing with v3 chemistry at ace according to manufacturer s protocol sequences were quality filtered and dereplicated using the qiime version 1 7 0 qiime org script split libraries py with the homopolymer filter deactivated and checked for chimeras against the greengenes database using uchime ver 3 0 617 sequences were treated following the procedures using qiime scripts with the default settings 1 sequences were clustered at 97 similarity into operational taxonomic units otus 2 cluster representatives were selected 3 greengenes taxonomy was assigned to the cluster representatives using blast 4 tables with the abundance of different otus and their taxonomic assignments in each sample were generated α diversity within each sample was computed from the normalized data sets by phylogenetic diversity whole tree index in qiime jiang et al 2016 then the richness and evenness of communities were determined through the rarefaction and rank abundance analysis respectively β diversity was also computed from the trimmed taxonomic data sets using qiime differences in the composition of microbial communities were visualized using principal component analysis pca based on the weighted unifrac metric differences in the structure of microbial communities were visualized by a heat map via r version 2 15 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual inspection of the coupons during the exposure period of concrete coupons the sewer gas had the rh of 85 100 temperature of 20 35 c and gaseous h2s levels of 700 1100 ppm which represented a typical h2s concentration in sewers and also facilitated measurable corrosion within a reasonable timeframe i e exposure time of a few months the gas conditions in these two gravity lines were parallel the difference of gas temperature h2s and rh between these two lines were within 1 c 50 ppm and 5 respectively from visual inspections it was evident that the concrete coupons corroded severely during the relatively short exposure period within 6 months fig 1 on the side surfaces of each coupon an obvious wastewater level line ww was observed a sharp contrast of corrosion morphology was evident between the area above and below the ww in particular at the top area comparatively desiccated 29 3 water content and friable corrosion layers were seen at the aw area the corrosion products were thicker brown paste like and highly moisturized 39 8 water content there was evidence of washing off of the corrosion products leaving the aggregates uncovered which was likely caused by the scouring force of the flowing wastewater immediately at the ww the surface faded into a black viscous layer where less corrosion products but more biofilm growth was evident section 3 4 surface conditions observed in the bw areas were similar to those detected at the ww the visual inspections demonstrated that the tidal regions corroded badly and quickly consistent with the findings of the laboratory scale studies conducted in the corrosion chambers jiang et al 2014a 2015 2016 and other reports islander et al 1991 li et al 2017 in contrast in a real sewer system in sydney cayford et al 2017 it was seen that the tidal regions had less accumulation of corrosion products this difference might be due to the occurrence of very frequent flooding caused by the specific flow dynamics of that sewer in our coupons the localized variability of corrosion morphologies indicated that sampling positions would have considerable effects on the physical chemical properties of the corrosion products consequently for systematic studies of sewer corrosion it is important to articulate operational conditions and locations of sample collections 3 2 corrosion losses and surface ph significant concrete corrosion losses were detected from the coupons after the exposure periods in the gravity lines the regional thickness losses after 3 months were 3 5 mm top 5 6 mm aw and 1 2 mm bw respectively and these reached around 4 6 mm top 8 10 mm aw and 1 2 mm bw after six months for bw areas the losses were mainly detected after 3 months of exposure likely due to the fluctuating wastewater level in the pilot sewer pipe during that time part of the bw areas close to the wastewater level ww was potentially exposed to the sewer gas phase occasionally and thus subjected to the micc process such fluctuation of wastewater was avoided and thus during the second 3 months of exposure no corrosion was evidenced at the bw areas a faster corrosion was observed at the aw area than the top area the average corrosion losses of top and aw areas of coupons in the pilot sewer system 700 1100 ppm of h2s were compared with the results obtained from the corrosion chamber 50 ppm of h2s these losses were about 2 3 times figure si 5 of those that occurred on coupons being partially submerged in laboratory corrosion chambers for the same time periods jiang et al 2014a further compared with the corrosion losses of crown regions in previous studies morton and chen 1989 parker 1965 wells and melchers 2015 the thickness losses of the top areas in this study were evidently higher tables si 2 the much higher h2s concentrations 700 1100 ppm would be a significant contributor as h2s is a determining factor for concrete corrosion rates in sewers in addition the rapid corrosion detected here may also be attributed to the pre corroded conditions of the coupons that had an exposed surface ph starting around 7 8 this condition would favor the colonization of neutrophilic sulfur oxidizing microorganisms followed by the colonization of acidophilic sulfur oxidizing microorganisms when the ph was further reduced to 3 5 islander et al 1991 the effects of flowing wastewater should also be critical providing abundant nutrients and moisture to facilitate the more active biological acid generation during the corrosion process the lowering of ph on concrete surfaces occurred due to h2s itself and then more substantially by the sulfuric acid produced by the bacterial oxidation of h2s and its anions consequently the surface ph is regarded as a good indicator of the corrosion development jiang et al 2014a 2014b 2015 joseph et al 2012 during the exposure the ph values decreased considerably on the coupon surfaces fig 2 this was especially observed in the areas above the wastewater level top aw where the ph reached 2 5 4 after 3 months and further decreased to 1 2 after 6 months such low ph levels were consistent with ranges observed in the previous studies of micc where various sob were detected jiang et al 2014a 2015 aw had the lowest ph of the coupon regions around 1 and this coincided with the fast corrosion occurring there at the bw area the ph was measured to be 5 6 5 higher than the ph above the ww but lower than the wastewater ph of around 7 for the exposed rebar cross section figure si 4 the ph was around 4 which was likely influenced by the surrounding acidic concrete corrosion layer however it should be noted that surface ph of concrete is a result of various factors including the microbial activities and multiple effects of wastewater as reported previously it is an instantaneous indicator of the corrosion status at a certain time point and should be evaluated with other parameters jiang et al 2016 3 3 characterization of corrosion products 3 3 1 microstructure and elemental compositions of concrete corrosion products differences in microstructures of concrete corrosion products were detected at different regions on the exposed surfaces fig 3 and figure si 6 in the top area the corrosion products were either loosely scattered on aggregates fig 3a or piled up on the intact cement matrix fig 3b depending on the localized proportions of cement and aggregates the well crystalized particles typically flake like parallelogram or hexagon in shape should be mainly gypsum which is recognized as one of the major concrete corrosion products in sewers jiang et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2017 however these particles were none uniform in size possibly revealing the variations in the corrosion and precipitation processes of the cementitious materials the crystallographic shape of gypsum likely corresponded with the precipitation rates controlled by the oversaturation of the pore fluids the higher the growth rates the less dominant was the crystallographic shape of the minerals compared to the top area the particles observed in the aw area fig 3c were smaller and of more uniform sizes together with the blurry composition boundaries as shown in the bse image fig 3c these mineral changes may also be attributed to the effects of hydraulic shaping and mixing of the wastewater flow as one recent study confirmed the hydraulic strength of wastewater could scour the corrosion products as well as the biofilm on concrete surface jiang et al 2016 in addition some distinct transparent rhombus crystals were also observed at the aw area fig 3d these crystals appeared to be wrapped in colloidal films which might be microbial colonies or biofilm in the corrosion layer further in the bw area no evident concrete corrosion particles were observed except for some amorphous materials attached to the concrete surface figure si 6 the major elements o ca si s and fe table 2 were detected by eds in the selected spots on the coupon surfaces fig 3 it was evident that the crystalized corrosion products red circles in fig 3 mainly consisted of o ca and s in the order of highest to lowest weight percentages respectively si was mostly detected at areas showing aggregates yellow circles in fig 3 however there was no evidence of al in the corrosion products indicating that the particles were mainly gypsum caso4 2h2o rather than ettringite cao 3 al2o3 caso4 3 32h2o of which al is a major component joseph et al 2012 by using the mineralogical database gypsum was also confirmed as the major corrosion products together with the formation of anhydrite and basanite of which the levels of crystal water were different these elemental results were consistent with the microstructure detected fig 3 a c presumably the absence of ettringite could be explained by the extremely low ph 1 2 at the coupon surface previous studies demonstrated that the ph boundary of instability of ettringite was at roughly 10 7 gabrisová et al 1991 grengg et al 2018 jiang et al 2014a b further demonstrated that ettringite is mostly distributed further away from the concrete surface due to the higher ph within the depth of the corrosion layer it was seen that sulfur levels varied on the exposed coupon surfaces these were 10 at bw 10 15 at top and 20 at aw high sulfur levels have previously been reported at sewer tidal regions cayford et al 2017 in this study the highest sulfur content was detected in the aw area possibly attributed to both biotic and abiotic processes in addition to the chemical oxidation of hydrogen sulfide the large amounts of sulfur formation evident as the piled up concrete corrosion products fig 3c could be resulting from the intense micc in particular extremely high levels of sulfur were detected in the transparent rhombus crystals green circles in fig 3d which is one of the typical shapes of elemental sulfur potentially these crystals were produced by the activities of non acidic sob cayford et al 2017 3 3 2 microstructure and elemental compositions of rebar corrosion products a layered structure of rust was detected on the rebar cross section rb fig 3 e f which was different from the unconsolidated and uniform appearance of typical iron oxides song et al 2017 the layered structure consisted of a compact base layer some evenly distributed scale like blocks were found on the surface of the base layer together with some particles that were dispersedly nucleating on the top fig 3e these particles were globular plate like or honeycomb like crystals similar to the micro morphology of iron oxides documented by previous studies ma et al 2009 eds of the rebar rusts suggested that the rusts were mainly comprised of fe o and s indicating the coexistence of iron oxides sulfides or sulfates tables si 3 as well under prevailing high iron contents the varied brightness occurred in different regions in the bse images probably indicated the different iron contents in the compact base layer and the surface layer wong et al 2010 specifically the compact base layer pink circles in fig 3 was high in fe and s but low in o 8 while the surface layer blue circles in fig 3 had higher o contents 15 30 this might be caused by the transformation of iron sulfides that formed from the rebar corrosion to iron oxides due to higher oxygen availability at the surface 3 3 3 crystalized compositions of concrete and rebar corrosion products the crystalized compositions of concrete corrosion products were determined using xrd analysis the results further demonstrated that the dominant concrete corrosion products at the tidal regions were gypsum fig 4 particularly gypsum was also detected in the bw areas which confirmed the corrosion process there this result further explained the corrosion losses in bw areas which was 1 2 mm as mentioned in section 3 2 caco3 was also produced above the ww due to the carbonation process some organic matter cholic acid c7h12o4 for instance was detected in areas aw and bw likely this was residual from the wastewater micro xrd spot analysis figure si 7 showed that various forms of iron sulfides were major compositions of the rebar rusts additionally iron oxides or hydroxides were scattered at the rust surface together with a small amount of iron sulfate and iron chlorides considering that rebar within concrete are extremely crucial for the mechanical strength and structural integrity of reinforced sewers further investigations of rebar corrosion in sewers are required to understand the corrosion development and its correlation with sewer environmental factors 3 4 microbial communities analysis microbial community compositions were determined by 16s rrna gene sequencing this was performed to look for correlations between community compositions and the differences in corrosion rates and mineral morphologies among localized regions of the exposed coupon surfaces sequence data was readily obtained from the aw and bw areas demonstrated by the relatively high numbers of tags sequences and otus detected there figure si 8 however there were difficulties in extracting sufficient yields of qualified dna for subsequent gene sequencing from samples more distant from the wastewater li et al 2017 accordingly the samples obtained from the top area of coupon a1 and b1 were mixed together in order to be successfully sequenced after 3 months exposure sequencing was conducted successfully to samples obtained from the top area of coupon a2 and b2 respectively after 6 months exposure examination of the microbial richness rarefaction and evenness rank abundance figure si 9 showed that the community complexity varied depending on the region with the highest diversity occurring in the bw area and decreasing to the top area bw aw top the higher species richness observed in the aw area in comparison to the top area is likely due to the effects of more frequent wastewater inoculation cayford et al 2017 vincke et al 2001 analysis of the variation in microbial community compositions was performed to detect clustering and relatedness among the samples with respect to the different sampling locations figure si 10 after 3 months exposure there was discernible difference between the communities above top aw and below the wastewater level bw sediment and wastewater samples clustered together which were relatively closer to the bw samples the samples above wastewater level top aw and rb had very similar microbial community structures however after 6 months the communities were more separated between samples from top and aw with the latter moving closer to bw communities detailed information of the relative abundance of the predominant microbial types top 10 genera in fig 5 top 35 genera in figure si 11 further confirmed that the dominant types above wastewater level changed with the exposure time in the areas above the wastewater level top and aw the corrosion community detected after 3 months exposure was mainly composed of the acidithiobacillus genus these are obligate aerobic acidophilic and autotrophic bacteria and are frequently isolated as sob from sewer concrete corrosion samples li et al 2017 the dominance of acidithiobacillus in sewer corrosion environments has been consistently reported in many previous studies using both culture dependent and molecular techniques islander et al 1991 ling et al 2014 2015 santo domingo et al 2011 vincke et al 2001 one of our studies further elucidated its major occurrence in concrete sewer corrosion process under conditions of frequent wastewater inoculations jiang et al 2016 however on our coupons the abundance of the acidithiobacillus decreased from the top area top 87 7 to the aw area aw a 53 2 aw b 33 6 fig 5 instead the abundances of other bacteria including lactobacillus goldstein et al 2015 salmonella and escherichia shigella falkow et al 1963 that are recognized as normal human gastrointestinal flora and staphylococcus sergelidis et al 2014 and listeria dailey et al 2015 that usually exist in food products were observed to increase from top to aw areas possibly these were derived from the wastewater itself instead of being directly relevant to sewer corrosion reactions the tidal regions that were alternatively aerobic and anaerobic provided a favorable habitat for most of those facultative anaerobic bacteria another genus bacillus was also detected with an increasing abundance top 1 4 aw a 4 6 aw b 8 6 towards the wastewater level bacillus spp are heterotrophic and some are capable of sulfur compound oxidation cayford et al 2017 sergelidis et al 2014 the heterotrophic microorganisms detected here may play an important role in the micc environment by scavenging organic compounds that can be inhibitory to sulfur oxidizing autotrophs jiang et al 2016 during the corrosion initiation of the first 3 months the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and heterotrophic bacteria was likely important for the colonization near the tidal regions of the concrete coupons in contrast to above after 6 months exposure acidithiobacillus was only evidently detected in top areas top a 12 7 top b 43 1 with the abundance decreasing significantly compared to those in the first 3 months instead mycobacterium was detected at notable abundancies i e 25 6 for top a 7 3 for top b 78 2 for aw a and 73 0 for aw b in particular no significant amount of acidithiobacillus 0 06 0 08 was found in aw areas anymore implying the take over of mycobacterium in tidal regions previously the acidophilic mycobacterium was mainly reported to have a heterotrophic role as an organic scavenger in micc nica et al 2000 recent studies improved the knowledge claiming that they might be able to perform sulfur oxidation in sewer environments cayford et al 2017 grengg et al 2017 li et al 2017 our recent research further demonstrated that heterotrophic bacteria i e mycobacterium and acidiphilium were more abundant in the concrete samples inoculated by wastewater than those without inoculation jiang et al 2016 however in those studies the amount of mycobacterium were quite limited while the conventional sob were prevalent likely suggesting that the coexistence of abundant sob and relatively low amount of heterotrophic bacteria are necessary in the corrosion process on the contrary in this study the relatively predominant colonization of mycobacterium without conventional sob at aw areas was observed after 6 months further the decreasing ph 0 8 1 2 in aw areas even lower than the ph in top areas 1 5 1 9 likely suggested that they might be able to produce acid and induce corrosion when the corrosion progressed severely this microbial structural change at tidal regions could be largely due to wastewater the nutrients in wastewater in particular the organic compounds may favor the colonization of the heterotrophic microbes while inhibiting the autotrophic types however the heterotrophic bacteria types might vary depending on the exposure conditions including the exposure time wastewater quality the level of h2s types of concrete and so on the present study for instance showed that with the decreasing abundance of bacillus due to continuous wastewater inoculation mycobacterium might take over the organic scavenger role during the succession of corrosion communities the bw microbial communities were quite close to those from the sediment and wastewater dominated by the genera macellibacteroides desulfobacter and bacteroides the desulfobacter consists of sulfur reducing anaerobes which were previously detected in deposition layers on real sewer walls at the gas liquid interface cayford et al 2017 the other two genera can be dominant in activated sludge serving as the key functional genera in anaerobic environments yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 other genera such as zoogloea and clostridium were also observed in bw samples and these contain species that are constituents of multi species biofilms in sewage systems pantaléon et al 2014 for the rebar rusts the major bacteria include bacillus lactobacillus salmonella escherichia shigella staphylococcus and listeria there is no previous report about the microbiome of the rebar corrosion in sewers the roles of these detected microbes in the rebar corrosion processes need further investigations to determine whether they are consistent and functional in the rebar corrosion process collectively these results demonstrated that the dominant microorganisms varied at different regions and the corrosion microbiome evolved with the development of corrosion at the same time point the variations in communities at different areas possibly reflected the varied redox conditions of these regions the bw being predominantly anaerobic in comparison to the alternating aerobic anaerobic environment of the aw and the mostly aerobic conditions of the top additionally the wastewater would play a significant role in shaping the microbial community structures by direct inoculation and providing necessary nutrients and microelements for the cultivation of the heterotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria at the 3 month exposure the coexistence of autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria was likely important for the colonization near the tidal regions when the ph of coupon surfaces decreased from 2 5 to 4 to around 1 after 6 months of exposure the predominance of mycobacterium bacteria and the absence of conventional autotrophic sob suggested mycobacterium as the potential corrosion inducer in tidal regions this study for the first time suggested the significance of mycobacterium in micc in tidal regions in sewers jiang et al 2016 ling et al 2015 nica et al 2000 santo domingo et al 2011 vincke et al 2001 however further studies are required to determine whether this is consistent in other sewer systems as well as the specific metabolic pathways and functions of mycobacterium in the corrosion process 3 5 implication for sewer corrosion monitoring and management this study clearly characterized the physical chemical conditions and corrosion products in the tidal region of concrete sewers interestingly they were correlated with the succession of microorganisms starting with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria and ending with the predominant colonization of mycobacterium bacteria 75 after 6 months this phenomenon would be affected by the imminent vicinity of concrete surface to wastewater the conditions here include high water content abundant organics and nutrients continuous microbial inoculation and persistent and gradual removal of corrosion products which altogether contribute to the severe corrosion in the tidal regions this study provides insights for better monitoring of sewers using the improved knowledge of the corrosion hot spots regular monitoring of the whole sewer system might be reduced to the focused monitoring of tidal regions at many sewer sites sites with high turbulent conditions or h2s formation also need frequent monitoring for signs of corrosion besides some of the current corrosion management techniques for controlling bacteria activities would be improved by focusing on the distinct microbial community components of the tidal regions furthermore as a constant flow depth in sewers could lead to greater corrosion sewers with these characteristics should be closely monitored nevertheless further case and field studies should be conducted to confirm the high corrosion rates in tidal regions in gravity concrete sewers 4 conclusions the distinct corrosion in tidal regions of reinforced concrete sewer was investigated by analyzing the corrosion products and bacterial communities using various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing this has led to the following key findings 1 the tidal regions in sewers corrode quickly and severely with corrosion rates physical chemical properties and macro micro level corrosion morphologies varying with the distance from the wastewater level the major concrete corrosion products are gypsum rather than ettringite 2 the area right above the wastewater level is the most susceptible to concrete corrosion in partially filled concrete sewer pipes characterized with the fast mass loss low surface ph high levels of moisture and sulfur and small but uniform sized corrosion particles 3 the microbial succession in tidal regions occurs with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria initially and the predominant colonization of mycobacterium bacteria when ph drops to around 1 the heterotrophic bacteria i e mycobacterium and bacillus may contain species that are capable of sulfuric acid generation 4 wastewater plays a critical role for accelerating tidal corrosion by the effects of consistent hydraulic action supply of water and substrates and inoculation which may have contributed to the succession of heterotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria 5 the combinations of advanced mineral and microbial analytical techniques

19121,microbially induced concrete corrosion micc is a major deterioration affecting sewers worldwide micc is not uniform on sewer inner walls and often occurs at hot spots such as crown and tidal regions which are critical to determine sewer service life especially concrete corrosion in tidal regions is complicated due to the fluctuation of wastewater levels and the hydraulic scouring effects the traditional methodology of corrosion monitoring also limits the study of the tidal corrosion in this study by using a combination of various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the development of corrosion the formation of corrosion products and the variation of microbial communities in tidal regions were investigated systematically the physical chemical characteristics in tidal regions varied with the distance from the wastewater surface above the wastewater more severe corrosion was detected with a closer distance to wastewater producing gypsum as the major corrosion products the microbial succession in tidal regions occurred with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria initially and shifting to the predominant colonization of mycobacterium when ph reached around 1 the heterotrophic bacteria i e mycobacterium and bacillus were likely responsible for the observed corrosion due to the potential capability in generating sulfuric acid the applications of advanced mineral and microbial analytical techniques were demonstrated effective in improving the understanding of concrete sewer corrosion graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer corrosion concrete mineral liberation analysis microbial community 1 introduction sewer networks are critical urban infrastructures of modern societies performing the safe transport of sewage from domestic and industrial sites to treatment facilities however concrete corrosion caused by the biogenic sulfuric acid derived from the oxidation of gaseous hydrogen sulfide is a major deteriorating process in sewer systems grengg et al 2017 liu et al 2017 parker 1947 the u s environmental protection agency epa states that microbially induced concrete corrosion micc can reduce the 50 100 year expected sewer service life to less than 10 years bowker et al 1992 causing annual economic losses of over tens of billions of dollars worldwide corrosion of concrete sewers is a complex process usually proceeding with the initial acidification by carbonation co2 and hydrogen sulfide h2s and then progressing to more damaging chemical reactions between the biogenic sulfuric acid and cementitious materials jiang et al 2014b 2016 on the inner wall of sewers the micc is not uniform and often occurs at hot spots such as the crown region at the ceiling of sewers and the tidal region which is imminently above the wastewater level islander et al 1991 jiang et al 2014a 2015 the crown region is mainly exposed to sewer atmosphere and is only periodically wetted during high sewage flows in contrast the tidal region is frequently inundated by wastewater resulting in more variable redox conditions distinctive corrosion morphologies and evidence of rapid corrosion rates can be obvious in these crown and tidal regions in gravity sewers although previous investigations of micc have focused more on the crown regions cayford et al 2017 joseph et al 2012 ling et al 2015 mori et al 1992 vollertsen et al 2008 some recent studies found that the corrosion can be more severe at the tidal regions jiang et al 2014a our long term 4 years studies using laboratory corrosion chambers confirmed that the partially submerged concrete coupons simulating the tidal region showed much higher levels of corrosion than coupons located in the gas phase that were simulating the crown region jiang et al 2014a additionally our recent study demonstrated that frequent wetting by wastewater flooding and spraying could enhance sewer corrosion rates jiang et al 2016 likely in tidal regions the more frequent replenishment of moisture nutrients and microbial inoculum by wastewater will occur compared to other wall locations further away from the wastewater level because of the faster corrosion the service life of partially filled concrete sewer pipes could be largely determined by the corrosion occurring in tidal regions rather than in crown regions thus the detailed corrosion processes are required to improve the understanding of sewer corrosion and aid in optimization of sewer management strategies however the specific corrosion reactions the potentially distinct microbial communities and the effects of wastewater on tidal corrosion have not been thoroughly investigated many previous studies on microbial communities have relied on random and non replicate samples without systematic site selections islander et al 1991 ling et al 2014 which unfortunately limits the interpretation and insights that could be made of sewer corrosion vincke et al 2001 for the first time attempted to differentiate the microbial communities between the crown side and bottom of sewers while some differences were detected the details of the community compositions were limited as the relatively restricted molecular method of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge was used recently cayford et al 2017 further delineated the variations of the microbial communities in ceiling wall and tidal zones it was reported that tidal communities were distinct from those in other samples with eight bacterial orders and one archaeal order detected in the tidal zone however the detailed knowledge of the microorganisms there were limited especially in comparison with what was known of communities at the crowns and walls further away from the wastewater while these studies performing microbial community profiling are providing new insights the detailed community analysis at the tidal regions is yet to be determined considering the multiple effects of sewer gas wastewater and the potential activities of distinct bacteria at tidal regions it is likely that physical chemical conditions and corrosion products specific to that region would occur of the regions exposed to the sewer atmosphere it was demonstrated that the tidal regions had the highest moisture content and levels of nitrogen organic carbon and sulfur cayford et al 2017 however correlations between the physical chemical conditions of the region and the corrosion process are poorly understood and characterization of corrosion products which is required to determine the actual corrosion reactions and roles of microbial activities has been largely missing this study aims to help comprehend the corrosion in tidal regions of reinforced concrete sewers through investigating the development of corrosion the formation of corrosion products and the variation of microbial communities with time and location to simulate the tidal regions concrete coupons were partially submerged in wastewater in a pilot scale gravity sewer pipe with 700 1100 ppm of h2s for 6 months the characteristics of concrete corrosion products and bacterial communities were analyzed using various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing illumina at two time points spanning 6 months the localized corrosion variability was delineated together with the effects of the wastewater on the corrosion processes in addition the corrosion products and microbial communities on reinforcing steel rebar surface were also determined the outcomes from this thorough investigation of tidal corrosion can be utilized to mitigate sewer corrosion through the optimization of sewer constructions and operations 2 methods and materials 2 1 pilot sewer and exposure conditions the experiments were conducted in a pilot scale sewer system located at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia the pilot sewer system consists of two sets of 100 mm internal diameter id pvc pressure lines and two sets of 225 mm id pvc gravity lines figure si

installed on both lines at distances of 1 30 55 270 and 300 m from the influent tanks the pilot sewer system is controlled by a programmable logic controller plc and the operation state is manipulated using the lab view lab view 2014 real time in this study two parallel ports port a and b on two separate gravity lines at the distance of 270 m from the influent were used for duplicate exposure experiments during the exposure period 6 months the system was at a slope of 0 56 raw wastewater was pumped to the inlets of both gravity lines at a pump rate of 200 l min the wastewater flow velocity was about 0 71 m s in each pipe the wastewater depth in the gravity lines was 2 3 cm the typical characteristics of the wastewater fed to the lines were determined table 1 for the analysis of dissolved sulfide and sulfate 1 5 ml of wastewater was filtered 0 22 μm membrane into 0 5 ml preserving solution of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob samples were analyzed within 24 h on an ion chromatograph ic with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 jiang et al 2011 to determine dissolved methane 5 ml of wastewater was filtered 0 22 μm membrane into vacuumed bd vacutainer tubes the gas liquid equilibrium in the tubes was achieved overnight methane in the gas phase was measured by gas chromatography shimadzu gc 9a equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the concentrations of methane in wastewater were calculated using mass balance and henry s law jiang et al 2011 the analytical methods for other parameters in table 1 were presented in tables si 1 besides the detailed daily average values of biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod conductivity ph and temperature of wastewater were also monitored by the liquiid station zaps technology

were prepared from already corroded concrete sewer slabs obtained from sydney water corporation australia details of the coupon preparation are described elsewhere jiang et al 2014a 2014b briefly the coupons were cut to approximately 100 mm length 70 mm width 70 mm thickness and washed by high pressure water to remove any existing concrete corrosion layer and any surface contamination the washed coupons were immediately dried in an oven thermotec 2000 contherm at 60 c for 3 days four concrete coupons were simultaneously partially submerged in wastewater inside of the gravity lines i e coupon a1 and a2 in port a coupon b1 and b2 in port b figure si 4 in particular coupon b1 had a plain round reinforcing steel bar rebar with a nominal diameter of 12 mm that was embedded with about 2 cm thickness of concrete cover figure si 4 for each coupon the original internal surface of the sewer slab was partially submerged in the wastewater which was called the exposed surface figure si 4 as demonstrated by previous studies jiang et al 2014a 2015 this arrangement well simulated the position of the sewer tidal region a location highly susceptible to micc cayford et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 mori et al 1992 2 3 corrosion monitoring and corrosion sample collection after exposure in the gravity lines the exposed surfaces of the coupons simulating the tidal regions were utilized for corrosion monitoring and sample collection to differentiate the localized physical chemical corrosion characteristics and positioning of microbial communities at the tidal regions the exposed surface was divided into different areas these were an area above the wastewater level ww and 0 2 cm below the top edge of the coupon top an area 0 2 cm above the wastewater level aw an area below the wastewater level bw and a rebar cross section rb only for coupon b1 section 3 2 as the aw areas were closer to the ww than the top areas they were frequently inundated by the wastewater resulting in an alternative aerobic and anaerobic condition which is a typical characteristic of tidal regions coupon a1 b1 and coupon a2 b2 were retrieved after 3 and 6 months of exposure respectively in particular after the monitoring and sampling of coupon a1 it was put back to port a just for a display purpose the macro level corrosion morphology of each coupon was photographed for visual inspection the surface ph was measured at the areas top aw ww bw and rb respectively section 3 2 using a flat surface ph electrode extech ph150c concrete ph kit extech instruments as previously described jiang et al 2014a 2015 further the surface corrosion layer was destructively sampled according to the specific areas defined above the corrosion products were carefully scraped with a sterile blade directly into sterile 50 ml falcon tubes respectively large aggregates were removed to obtain only loose concrete corrosion products one third of the corrosion products were used for moisture measurement song et al 2017 scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and x ray diffraction xrd analysis the moisture measurements were performed by weighing each sample before and after drying to a constant weight at 105 c the remaining corrosion products were used for microbial analysis as specified in section 2 4 and 2 5 respectively after the corrosion layer removal the coupons were further washed with high pressure water then five spots on the top aw and bw areas on the exposed surfaces were chosen respectively to determine the average coupon thickness of each area the coupon thickness loss of each area was then calculated by subtracting the average thickness after washing from the original thickness before exposure 2 4 sem eds and xrd analysis to identify the physical chemical characteristics of concrete corrosion products sem eds and xrd measurements were conducted on corrosion layers taken from top aw bw and rb areas the surface morphology and elemental composition of the corrosion products were examined by sem jeol jsm 6610 america which was equipped with a detector oxford 50mm2 x max sdd x ray that enabled simultaneous imaging and elemental analysis at high count rates with 125 ev energy resolutions the edax software edax ametek inc was utilized at a frame resolution of 1024 800 with a dwell time of 200 s frame to collect 16 frames for each region of interest the spot locations for elemental analysis were not random but chosen by examining the backscattered electron image bse which was typically used to identify the boundaries of mineral phases jiang et al 2014b the quantification of each individual eds spot analysis in wt was performed against mineral standards by using the mineralogical database http webmineral com as utilized before grengg et al 2017 before the test the samples were dried in a vacuum oven semsa oven 718 at 60 c for 8 h and then coated twice by the carbon coater quorum q150t uk following the three heavy burst mode to obtain the carbon thickness of 30 40 nm for samples of rebar rusts these were carefully vacuum dried at room temperature for 12 h coated with carbon 30 40 nm and analyzed immediately after sampling to avoid the advent of further oxidation the mineral compositions of the corrosion products were determined by xrd bruker d8 advance mkii which used a cu anode as the primary x ray beam source x rays were generated at 40 kv and 40 ma with 2 0 min as the scanning speed and 2θ 10 100 as the scanning range for the rebar rust samples micro xrd was utilized as an accurate method for the identification of localized compositions without the need to destroy samples into powders during the preparation grengg et al 2017 a rigaku smartlab micro diffraction system with a rotating cu anode 9 kw and micro focus optics was used to carry out point mineralogical analysis on the rust surface x rays were generated at 45 kv and 200 ma with 0 798 s step as the scanning speed 4499 counts as the scanning step and 2θ 20 110 as the scanning range diffraction patterns were processed using the rigaku pdxl2 data processing software version 2 3 1 0 the composition identifications were carried out using gade software version 5 and pdf 2 crystal structure database 2 5 microbial community analysis the microbial community analysis was conducted to corrosion products obtained from top aw bw and rb areas and also to wastewater and sediment samples taken directly from inside the gravity ports figure si 2 all samples were stored at 80 c before analysis due to the expected low levels of microorganisms and inhibitory molecules to pcr in the corrosion samples li et al 2017 cell extraction from the corrosion products was carried out prior to dna extraction as previously described jiang et al 2016 the cell extraction procedure includes sonication to loosen the cells from the corrosion products concentrating the cells from a sucrose gradient and then washing and centrifuging the cells gradually following that the total dna was extracted from the cell pellet using the fastdna spin kit for soil to perform 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing illumina extracted dna samples were provided to the australia center for ecogenomics ace brisbane australia pcr amplifications were conducted in q5 hot start high fidelity 2x master mix new england biolabs in standard pcr conditions modified universal primers 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc 3 were used to target the v6v8 regions of the 16s rrna gene which were efficient to detect the microorganisms inducing concrete corrosion in sewers cayford et al 2017 grengg et al 2017 the resulting pcr amplicons were purified using agencourt ampure xp beads beckman coulter then the purified dna was indexed with unique 8 bp barcodes using the illumina nextera xt 384 sample index kit a d illumina fc 131 1002 in standard pcr conditions with q5 hot start high fidelity 2x master mix the indexed amplicons were pooled together in equimolar concentrations and sequenced on miseq sequencing system illumina using paired end 2 300bp sequencing with v3 chemistry at ace according to manufacturer s protocol sequences were quality filtered and dereplicated using the qiime version 1 7 0 qiime org script split libraries py with the homopolymer filter deactivated and checked for chimeras against the greengenes database using uchime ver 3 0 617 sequences were treated following the procedures using qiime scripts with the default settings 1 sequences were clustered at 97 similarity into operational taxonomic units otus 2 cluster representatives were selected 3 greengenes taxonomy was assigned to the cluster representatives using blast 4 tables with the abundance of different otus and their taxonomic assignments in each sample were generated α diversity within each sample was computed from the normalized data sets by phylogenetic diversity whole tree index in qiime jiang et al 2016 then the richness and evenness of communities were determined through the rarefaction and rank abundance analysis respectively β diversity was also computed from the trimmed taxonomic data sets using qiime differences in the composition of microbial communities were visualized using principal component analysis pca based on the weighted unifrac metric differences in the structure of microbial communities were visualized by a heat map via r version 2 15 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual inspection of the coupons during the exposure period of concrete coupons the sewer gas had the rh of 85 100 temperature of 20 35 c and gaseous h2s levels of 700 1100 ppm which represented a typical h2s concentration in sewers and also facilitated measurable corrosion within a reasonable timeframe i e exposure time of a few months the gas conditions in these two gravity lines were parallel the difference of gas temperature h2s and rh between these two lines were within 1 c 50 ppm and 5 respectively from visual inspections it was evident that the concrete coupons corroded severely during the relatively short exposure period within 6 months fig 1 on the side surfaces of each coupon an obvious wastewater level line ww was observed a sharp contrast of corrosion morphology was evident between the area above and below the ww in particular at the top area comparatively desiccated 29 3 water content and friable corrosion layers were seen at the aw area the corrosion products were thicker brown paste like and highly moisturized 39 8 water content there was evidence of washing off of the corrosion products leaving the aggregates uncovered which was likely caused by the scouring force of the flowing wastewater immediately at the ww the surface faded into a black viscous layer where less corrosion products but more biofilm growth was evident section 3 4 surface conditions observed in the bw areas were similar to those detected at the ww the visual inspections demonstrated that the tidal regions corroded badly and quickly consistent with the findings of the laboratory scale studies conducted in the corrosion chambers jiang et al 2014a 2015 2016 and other reports islander et al 1991 li et al 2017 in contrast in a real sewer system in sydney cayford et al 2017 it was seen that the tidal regions had less accumulation of corrosion products this difference might be due to the occurrence of very frequent flooding caused by the specific flow dynamics of that sewer in our coupons the localized variability of corrosion morphologies indicated that sampling positions would have considerable effects on the physical chemical properties of the corrosion products consequently for systematic studies of sewer corrosion it is important to articulate operational conditions and locations of sample collections 3 2 corrosion losses and surface ph significant concrete corrosion losses were detected from the coupons after the exposure periods in the gravity lines the regional thickness losses after 3 months were 3 5 mm top 5 6 mm aw and 1 2 mm bw respectively and these reached around 4 6 mm top 8 10 mm aw and 1 2 mm bw after six months for bw areas the losses were mainly detected after 3 months of exposure likely due to the fluctuating wastewater level in the pilot sewer pipe during that time part of the bw areas close to the wastewater level ww was potentially exposed to the sewer gas phase occasionally and thus subjected to the micc process such fluctuation of wastewater was avoided and thus during the second 3 months of exposure no corrosion was evidenced at the bw areas a faster corrosion was observed at the aw area than the top area the average corrosion losses of top and aw areas of coupons in the pilot sewer system 700 1100 ppm of h2s were compared with the results obtained from the corrosion chamber 50 ppm of h2s these losses were about 2 3 times figure si 5 of those that occurred on coupons being partially submerged in laboratory corrosion chambers for the same time periods jiang et al 2014a further compared with the corrosion losses of crown regions in previous studies morton and chen 1989 parker 1965 wells and melchers 2015 the thickness losses of the top areas in this study were evidently higher tables si 2 the much higher h2s concentrations 700 1100 ppm would be a significant contributor as h2s is a determining factor for concrete corrosion rates in sewers in addition the rapid corrosion detected here may also be attributed to the pre corroded conditions of the coupons that had an exposed surface ph starting around 7 8 this condition would favor the colonization of neutrophilic sulfur oxidizing microorganisms followed by the colonization of acidophilic sulfur oxidizing microorganisms when the ph was further reduced to 3 5 islander et al 1991 the effects of flowing wastewater should also be critical providing abundant nutrients and moisture to facilitate the more active biological acid generation during the corrosion process the lowering of ph on concrete surfaces occurred due to h2s itself and then more substantially by the sulfuric acid produced by the bacterial oxidation of h2s and its anions consequently the surface ph is regarded as a good indicator of the corrosion development jiang et al 2014a 2014b 2015 joseph et al 2012 during the exposure the ph values decreased considerably on the coupon surfaces fig 2 this was especially observed in the areas above the wastewater level top aw where the ph reached 2 5 4 after 3 months and further decreased to 1 2 after 6 months such low ph levels were consistent with ranges observed in the previous studies of micc where various sob were detected jiang et al 2014a 2015 aw had the lowest ph of the coupon regions around 1 and this coincided with the fast corrosion occurring there at the bw area the ph was measured to be 5 6 5 higher than the ph above the ww but lower than the wastewater ph of around 7 for the exposed rebar cross section figure si 4 the ph was around 4 which was likely influenced by the surrounding acidic concrete corrosion layer however it should be noted that surface ph of concrete is a result of various factors including the microbial activities and multiple effects of wastewater as reported previously it is an instantaneous indicator of the corrosion status at a certain time point and should be evaluated with other parameters jiang et al 2016 3 3 characterization of corrosion products 3 3 1 microstructure and elemental compositions of concrete corrosion products differences in microstructures of concrete corrosion products were detected at different regions on the exposed surfaces fig 3 and figure si 6 in the top area the corrosion products were either loosely scattered on aggregates fig 3a or piled up on the intact cement matrix fig 3b depending on the localized proportions of cement and aggregates the well crystalized particles typically flake like parallelogram or hexagon in shape should be mainly gypsum which is recognized as one of the major concrete corrosion products in sewers jiang et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2017 however these particles were none uniform in size possibly revealing the variations in the corrosion and precipitation processes of the cementitious materials the crystallographic shape of gypsum likely corresponded with the precipitation rates controlled by the oversaturation of the pore fluids the higher the growth rates the less dominant was the crystallographic shape of the minerals compared to the top area the particles observed in the aw area fig 3c were smaller and of more uniform sizes together with the blurry composition boundaries as shown in the bse image fig 3c these mineral changes may also be attributed to the effects of hydraulic shaping and mixing of the wastewater flow as one recent study confirmed the hydraulic strength of wastewater could scour the corrosion products as well as the biofilm on concrete surface jiang et al 2016 in addition some distinct transparent rhombus crystals were also observed at the aw area fig 3d these crystals appeared to be wrapped in colloidal films which might be microbial colonies or biofilm in the corrosion layer further in the bw area no evident concrete corrosion particles were observed except for some amorphous materials attached to the concrete surface figure si 6 the major elements o ca si s and fe table 2 were detected by eds in the selected spots on the coupon surfaces fig 3 it was evident that the crystalized corrosion products red circles in fig 3 mainly consisted of o ca and s in the order of highest to lowest weight percentages respectively si was mostly detected at areas showing aggregates yellow circles in fig 3 however there was no evidence of al in the corrosion products indicating that the particles were mainly gypsum caso4 2h2o rather than ettringite cao 3 al2o3 caso4 3 32h2o of which al is a major component joseph et al 2012 by using the mineralogical database gypsum was also confirmed as the major corrosion products together with the formation of anhydrite and basanite of which the levels of crystal water were different these elemental results were consistent with the microstructure detected fig 3 a c presumably the absence of ettringite could be explained by the extremely low ph 1 2 at the coupon surface previous studies demonstrated that the ph boundary of instability of ettringite was at roughly 10 7 gabrisová et al 1991 grengg et al 2018 jiang et al 2014a b further demonstrated that ettringite is mostly distributed further away from the concrete surface due to the higher ph within the depth of the corrosion layer it was seen that sulfur levels varied on the exposed coupon surfaces these were 10 at bw 10 15 at top and 20 at aw high sulfur levels have previously been reported at sewer tidal regions cayford et al 2017 in this study the highest sulfur content was detected in the aw area possibly attributed to both biotic and abiotic processes in addition to the chemical oxidation of hydrogen sulfide the large amounts of sulfur formation evident as the piled up concrete corrosion products fig 3c could be resulting from the intense micc in particular extremely high levels of sulfur were detected in the transparent rhombus crystals green circles in fig 3d which is one of the typical shapes of elemental sulfur potentially these crystals were produced by the activities of non acidic sob cayford et al 2017 3 3 2 microstructure and elemental compositions of rebar corrosion products a layered structure of rust was detected on the rebar cross section rb fig 3 e f which was different from the unconsolidated and uniform appearance of typical iron oxides song et al 2017 the layered structure consisted of a compact base layer some evenly distributed scale like blocks were found on the surface of the base layer together with some particles that were dispersedly nucleating on the top fig 3e these particles were globular plate like or honeycomb like crystals similar to the micro morphology of iron oxides documented by previous studies ma et al 2009 eds of the rebar rusts suggested that the rusts were mainly comprised of fe o and s indicating the coexistence of iron oxides sulfides or sulfates tables si 3 as well under prevailing high iron contents the varied brightness occurred in different regions in the bse images probably indicated the different iron contents in the compact base layer and the surface layer wong et al 2010 specifically the compact base layer pink circles in fig 3 was high in fe and s but low in o 8 while the surface layer blue circles in fig 3 had higher o contents 15 30 this might be caused by the transformation of iron sulfides that formed from the rebar corrosion to iron oxides due to higher oxygen availability at the surface 3 3 3 crystalized compositions of concrete and rebar corrosion products the crystalized compositions of concrete corrosion products were determined using xrd analysis the results further demonstrated that the dominant concrete corrosion products at the tidal regions were gypsum fig 4 particularly gypsum was also detected in the bw areas which confirmed the corrosion process there this result further explained the corrosion losses in bw areas which was 1 2 mm as mentioned in section 3 2 caco3 was also produced above the ww due to the carbonation process some organic matter cholic acid c7h12o4 for instance was detected in areas aw and bw likely this was residual from the wastewater micro xrd spot analysis figure si 7 showed that various forms of iron sulfides were major compositions of the rebar rusts additionally iron oxides or hydroxides were scattered at the rust surface together with a small amount of iron sulfate and iron chlorides considering that rebar within concrete are extremely crucial for the mechanical strength and structural integrity of reinforced sewers further investigations of rebar corrosion in sewers are required to understand the corrosion development and its correlation with sewer environmental factors 3 4 microbial communities analysis microbial community compositions were determined by 16s rrna gene sequencing this was performed to look for correlations between community compositions and the differences in corrosion rates and mineral morphologies among localized regions of the exposed coupon surfaces sequence data was readily obtained from the aw and bw areas demonstrated by the relatively high numbers of tags sequences and otus detected there figure si 8 however there were difficulties in extracting sufficient yields of qualified dna for subsequent gene sequencing from samples more distant from the wastewater li et al 2017 accordingly the samples obtained from the top area of coupon a1 and b1 were mixed together in order to be successfully sequenced after 3 months exposure sequencing was conducted successfully to samples obtained from the top area of coupon a2 and b2 respectively after 6 months exposure examination of the microbial richness rarefaction and evenness rank abundance figure si 9 showed that the community complexity varied depending on the region with the highest diversity occurring in the bw area and decreasing to the top area bw aw top the higher species richness observed in the aw area in comparison to the top area is likely due to the effects of more frequent wastewater inoculation cayford et al 2017 vincke et al 2001 analysis of the variation in microbial community compositions was performed to detect clustering and relatedness among the samples with respect to the different sampling locations figure si 10 after 3 months exposure there was discernible difference between the communities above top aw and below the wastewater level bw sediment and wastewater samples clustered together which were relatively closer to the bw samples the samples above wastewater level top aw and rb had very similar microbial community structures however after 6 months the communities were more separated between samples from top and aw with the latter moving closer to bw communities detailed information of the relative abundance of the predominant microbial types top 10 genera in fig 5 top 35 genera in figure si 11 further confirmed that the dominant types above wastewater level changed with the exposure time in the areas above the wastewater level top and aw the corrosion community detected after 3 months exposure was mainly composed of the acidithiobacillus genus these are obligate aerobic acidophilic and autotrophic bacteria and are frequently isolated as sob from sewer concrete corrosion samples li et al 2017 the dominance of acidithiobacillus in sewer corrosion environments has been consistently reported in many previous studies using both culture dependent and molecular techniques islander et al 1991 ling et al 2014 2015 santo domingo et al 2011 vincke et al 2001 one of our studies further elucidated its major occurrence in concrete sewer corrosion process under conditions of frequent wastewater inoculations jiang et al 2016 however on our coupons the abundance of the acidithiobacillus decreased from the top area top 87 7 to the aw area aw a 53 2 aw b 33 6 fig 5 instead the abundances of other bacteria including lactobacillus goldstein et al 2015 salmonella and escherichia shigella falkow et al 1963 that are recognized as normal human gastrointestinal flora and staphylococcus sergelidis et al 2014 and listeria dailey et al 2015 that usually exist in food products were observed to increase from top to aw areas possibly these were derived from the wastewater itself instead of being directly relevant to sewer corrosion reactions the tidal regions that were alternatively aerobic and anaerobic provided a favorable habitat for most of those facultative anaerobic bacteria another genus bacillus was also detected with an increasing abundance top 1 4 aw a 4 6 aw b 8 6 towards the wastewater level bacillus spp are heterotrophic and some are capable of sulfur compound oxidation cayford et al 2017 sergelidis et al 2014 the heterotrophic microorganisms detected here may play an important role in the micc environment by scavenging organic compounds that can be inhibitory to sulfur oxidizing autotrophs jiang et al 2016 during the corrosion initiation of the first 3 months the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and heterotrophic bacteria was likely important for the colonization near the tidal regions of the concrete coupons in contrast to above after 6 months exposure acidithiobacillus was only evidently detected in top areas top a 12 7 top b 43 1 with the abundance decreasing significantly compared to those in the first 3 months instead mycobacterium was detected at notable abundancies i e 25 6 for top a 7 3 for top b 78 2 for aw a and 73 0 for aw b in particular no significant amount of acidithiobacillus 0 06 0 08 was found in aw areas anymore implying the take over of mycobacterium in tidal regions previously the acidophilic mycobacterium was mainly reported to have a heterotrophic role as an organic scavenger in micc nica et al 2000 recent studies improved the knowledge claiming that they might be able to perform sulfur oxidation in sewer environments cayford et al 2017 grengg et al 2017 li et al 2017 our recent research further demonstrated that heterotrophic bacteria i e mycobacterium and acidiphilium were more abundant in the concrete samples inoculated by wastewater than those without inoculation jiang et al 2016 however in those studies the amount of mycobacterium were quite limited while the conventional sob were prevalent likely suggesting that the coexistence of abundant sob and relatively low amount of heterotrophic bacteria are necessary in the corrosion process on the contrary in this study the relatively predominant colonization of mycobacterium without conventional sob at aw areas was observed after 6 months further the decreasing ph 0 8 1 2 in aw areas even lower than the ph in top areas 1 5 1 9 likely suggested that they might be able to produce acid and induce corrosion when the corrosion progressed severely this microbial structural change at tidal regions could be largely due to wastewater the nutrients in wastewater in particular the organic compounds may favor the colonization of the heterotrophic microbes while inhibiting the autotrophic types however the heterotrophic bacteria types might vary depending on the exposure conditions including the exposure time wastewater quality the level of h2s types of concrete and so on the present study for instance showed that with the decreasing abundance of bacillus due to continuous wastewater inoculation mycobacterium might take over the organic scavenger role during the succession of corrosion communities the bw microbial communities were quite close to those from the sediment and wastewater dominated by the genera macellibacteroides desulfobacter and bacteroides the desulfobacter consists of sulfur reducing anaerobes which were previously detected in deposition layers on real sewer walls at the gas liquid interface cayford et al 2017 the other two genera can be dominant in activated sludge serving as the key functional genera in anaerobic environments yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 other genera such as zoogloea and clostridium were also observed in bw samples and these contain species that are constituents of multi species biofilms in sewage systems pantaléon et al 2014 for the rebar rusts the major bacteria include bacillus lactobacillus salmonella escherichia shigella staphylococcus and listeria there is no previous report about the microbiome of the rebar corrosion in sewers the roles of these detected microbes in the rebar corrosion processes need further investigations to determine whether they are consistent and functional in the rebar corrosion process collectively these results demonstrated that the dominant microorganisms varied at different regions and the corrosion microbiome evolved with the development of corrosion at the same time point the variations in communities at different areas possibly reflected the varied redox conditions of these regions the bw being predominantly anaerobic in comparison to the alternating aerobic anaerobic environment of the aw and the mostly aerobic conditions of the top additionally the wastewater would play a significant role in shaping the microbial community structures by direct inoculation and providing necessary nutrients and microelements for the cultivation of the heterotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria at the 3 month exposure the coexistence of autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria was likely important for the colonization near the tidal regions when the ph of coupon surfaces decreased from 2 5 to 4 to around 1 after 6 months of exposure the predominance of mycobacterium bacteria and the absence of conventional autotrophic sob suggested mycobacterium as the potential corrosion inducer in tidal regions this study for the first time suggested the significance of mycobacterium in micc in tidal regions in sewers jiang et al 2016 ling et al 2015 nica et al 2000 santo domingo et al 2011 vincke et al 2001 however further studies are required to determine whether this is consistent in other sewer systems as well as the specific metabolic pathways and functions of mycobacterium in the corrosion process 3 5 implication for sewer corrosion monitoring and management this study clearly characterized the physical chemical conditions and corrosion products in the tidal region of concrete sewers interestingly they were correlated with the succession of microorganisms starting with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria and ending with the predominant colonization of mycobacterium bacteria 75 after 6 months this phenomenon would be affected by the imminent vicinity of concrete surface to wastewater the conditions here include high water content abundant organics and nutrients continuous microbial inoculation and persistent and gradual removal of corrosion products which altogether contribute to the severe corrosion in the tidal regions this study provides insights for better monitoring of sewers using the improved knowledge of the corrosion hot spots regular monitoring of the whole sewer system might be reduced to the focused monitoring of tidal regions at many sewer sites sites with high turbulent conditions or h2s formation also need frequent monitoring for signs of corrosion besides some of the current corrosion management techniques for controlling bacteria activities would be improved by focusing on the distinct microbial community components of the tidal regions furthermore as a constant flow depth in sewers could lead to greater corrosion sewers with these characteristics should be closely monitored nevertheless further case and field studies should be conducted to confirm the high corrosion rates in tidal regions in gravity concrete sewers 4 conclusions the distinct corrosion in tidal regions of reinforced concrete sewer was investigated by analyzing the corrosion products and bacterial communities using various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture independent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing this has led to the following key findings 1 the tidal regions in sewers corrode quickly and severely with corrosion rates physical chemical properties and macro micro level corrosion morphologies varying with the distance from the wastewater level the major concrete corrosion products are gypsum rather than ettringite 2 the area right above the wastewater level is the most susceptible to concrete corrosion in partially filled concrete sewer pipes characterized with the fast mass loss low surface ph high levels of moisture and sulfur and small but uniform sized corrosion particles 3 the microbial succession in tidal regions occurs with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic sob and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria initially and the predominant colonization of mycobacterium bacteria when ph drops to around 1 the heterotrophic bacteria i e mycobacterium and bacillus may contain species that are capable of sulfuric acid generation 4 wastewater plays a critical role for accelerating tidal corrosion by the effects of consistent hydraulic action supply of water and substrates and inoculation which may have contributed to the succession of heterotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria 5 the combinations of advanced mineral and microbial analytical techniques

19122,the competitive removal of pb2 and malachite green mg from water by three magnetic phosphate nanocomposites fe3o4 ba3 po4 2 fe3o4 sr5 po4 3 oh and fe3o4 sr5xba3x po4 3 oh namely fbp fsp and fsbp respectively was systematically investigated compared with fe3o4 f nanoparticle temperature and adsorbent dosage for competitive removal were optimized to be 20 c and 0 05 g in 50 ml the kinetic and isothermal adsorption results were fitted well with the pseudo second order model and langmuir model respectively in the competitive removal process fsp showed a high affinity to pb2 202 8 mg g while fbp possessed high selectivity for mg 175 4 mg g and fsbp was effective at simultaneous removal of pb2 and mg with a capacity of 143 7 and 90 9 mg g respectively the magnetic contents in nanocomposites allow magnetic separation of materials from the water after treatment we proposed that the simultaneous removal mechanism by fsbp was due to ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 in the lattice and then the formation of hydrogen bonds between po4 3 outside the material s surface and positively charged hydrogen in mg this study indicates the potential of these phosphate nanocomposites to be used as effective materials for selective or simultaneous removal of pb2 and mg from water graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic phosphate nanocomposites selective removal simultaneous removal mechanism water treatment 1 introduction with the rapid development of industrialization large amounts of heavy metal ions and organic dyes have been released into water systems lian et al 2013 these contaminants are highly toxic posing a significant threat to aquatic life and human beings jia et al 2015 as one of the most toxic heavy metals pb2 contamination always arouses public concern song et al 2018 different nano structured materials have been widely reported for removing pb2 from aqueous solutions including grafted and crosslinked chitosan nanoparticles ge et al 2016 2

al 2016 mg oh 2 supported nanoscale zero valent iron liu et al 2015 and functionalized carboxylate ferroxane nanoparticles moattari et al 2015 however the materials for pb2 removal from metallurgy electroplating wastewater which usually has lower ph values were still insufficient water contamination by malachite green mg a commonly used cationic dye is attracting increasing attention sun et al 2015 limited types of nanomaterials have been reported for mg removal such as a magnetic reduced graphene oxide zeolitic imidazolate framework self assembled nanocomposite lin and lee 2016 cuprous iodide cupric oxide nano composite loaded on activated carbon nekouei et al 2016 zns cu np ac activated carbon dastkhoon et al 2015 sodium dodecyl sulfate modified gamma al2o3 nanoparticles mohammadifar et al 2015 and nano iron oxide loaded alginate microspheres soni et al 2014 the nanomaterials mentioned above have shown promising potential for removal of pb2 or mg from wastewater individually however there is a need for nanomaterials that can simultaneously remove metals and organic dies such as pb2 and mg from aquatic systems wang and ariyanto 2007 zhang et al 2018 this could happen with mixed industrial wastes from electroplating and textile discharges it should be noted that the co existence of different pollutants is considered to be one of the most dangerous sources of environmental pollution deng et al 2013 and multi component removal studies are useful to identify the competitive performance of several pollutants and play an important role for the proper design and operation of water purification processes dil et al 2017 sharifpour et al 2018 when two or more pollutants are present in solution the removal efficiency of particular contaminant may increase or decrease or remain unchanged dil et al 2017 therefore it is significant to understand the underlying mechanisms and predict the removal efficiency for other pollutants in our previous work we prepared strontium phosphate hybrid nanorod sr5 po4 3 oh and srhpo4 by a simple one pot hydrothermal method the competitive removal of pb2 and mg from water by this material was also studied in detail zhang et al 2017 however it was difficult to separate these strontium phosphate nanorods from solution after treatment resulting in the potential risk of secondary pollution from residual strontium phosphate hybrid nanorods left after treatment hence the objective of the current study is to investigate the competitive removal of pb2 and mg by magnetic phosphate nanocomposites fe3o4 sr5 po4 3 oh henceforth fsp as well as two other materials fe3o4 ba3 po4 2 and fe3o4 sr5xba3x po4 3 oh fbp and fsbp respectively for comparison the removal efficiency of pb2 and mg by pure fe3o4 f nano crystalline clusters was also evaluated since these clusters are at the core of fsp fbp and fsbp the effects of temperature and adsorbent dosage on the competitive removal were studied the kinetics and thermodynamics for competitive removal were systematically analyzed by several models importantly the competitive removal mechanism for selective or dual removal of pb2 and mg by these materials were elucidated which make it a significant study for multifunctional materials in treatment of water with complex contamination 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o ethylene glycol eg sodium acetate polyethylene glycol 2000 peg2000 strontium nitrate barium nitrate cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab lead nitrate sodium phosphate sodium nitrate sodium sulfate sodium chloride nitric acid sodium hydroxide and malachite green mg were all purchased from shanghai sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china ctab and sodium phosphate were used as versatile soft template and precipitant respectively all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without any further purification the chemical structure of mg is shown in fig s1 2 2 preparation of materials the f spherical nano crystalline clusters 100 500 nm were prepared using a solvothermal method firstly 1 35 g fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 40 ml eg to form an orange solution subsequently naac 3 6 g and peg2000 1 g were added followed by vigorously stirring for 30 min afterward the mixture was sealed in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 c for 8 h before cooling to room temperature finally the black powder was rinsed with ethanol several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 6 h briefly the fbp fsp fsbp composites were prepared by mixing 1 96 g barium nitrate 1 59 g strontium nitrate 0 98 g barium nitrate and 0 79 g strontium nitrate respectively with 0 06 g f spherical clusters and 0 01 g ctab in 40 ml of deionized di water under stirring to form solution 1 solution 2 was prepared by adding 0 82 g sodium phosphate into 10 ml of di water at 40 c with continuous stirring for 30 min solution 2 was slowly poured into solution 1 with continuous stirring for 30 min the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 ml teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave reactor sealed and maintained at 180 c for 8 h as the autoclave cooled to room temperature the powder was washed with di water and then with ethanol five times finally the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 4 h and the yield was 1 3 g with a yield ratio of 85 the resulting magnetic content of f in fbp fsp fsbp was calculated to be around 4 6 wt 2 3 batch experiments since no obvious interferences were observed in the uv spectrum of mg and pb2 fig s2 a mixed solution of pb2 and mg with initial concentration at 500 mg l each was prepared in di water the mixed solution ph was adjusted to 5 0 by 0 01 m hno3 to avoid the hydrolysis or precipitation of pb2 batch experiments for removing pb2 and mg were carried out in beaker with a capacity of 100 ml under mechanic stirring at 200 rpm generally 0 05 g fsp fbp fsbp f was mixed into 50 ml solution containing pb2 and mg with initial concentrations at 500 mg l each with mechanic stirring for 60 min at 20 c and ph 5 0 at predetermined time intervals 0 120 min 1 ml of the suspension was sampled then filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane diluted following by analysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icpaes optima 2100 perkinelmer usa and uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu model uv1700 japan to determine the concentration of pb2 and mg respectively all tests were repeated three times and the mean results used for further analysis the removal capacities for pb2 and mg are calculated as follows mostafa et al 2016 1 q e c 0 c e v w m where q e is the removal capacity at equilibrium mmol g c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of pb2 or mg mg l respectively v is the volume of solutions l w is the dosage of fsp fbp fsbp f used g and m is the molecular weight of pb2 or mg g mol 2 4 characterization morphology of the obtained materials were studied on a hitachi limited model s 4800 japan field emission scanning electron microscope sem with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained on a bruker model axs d8 germany advance x ray diffract meter with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm the brunauer emmett teller bet method was applied to obtain the specific surface area of materials with an asap 2020 m micromeritics at 100 c the functional groups on the materials were examined via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet6700 thermo usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was performed on an axis utltradld instrument japan all xps spectra were calibrated using the binding energy be of c 1s 284 8 ev as the reference 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of temperature and dosage as shown in fig 1 a and b for the competitive removal of pb2 and mg there was a slight increase in pb2 removal by fsp fsbp f as temperature increased from 10 to 50 c while a negligible change was observed for mg removal by all the materials this indicates that the removal process of pb2 and mg from mixture is not completely thermodynamically controlled but kinetically controlled zhang et al 2012 therefore no specific temperature control is needed to enhance the removal process which is beneficial regarding to the operation cost fsp possessed a high affinity to pb2 from mixture as it exhibited the highest removal capacity for pb2 0 85 mmol g and lowest for mg 0 18 mmol g fbp showed a negligible removal ability of pb2 but the highest capacity for mg 0 55 mmol g implying a high selectivity of mg from mixture fsbp showed high capacity for both pb2 0 86 mmol g and mg 0 25 mmol g at 30 c indicating the potential application in mixed contaminated wastewater clean up the as prepared f showed a high removal capacity for mg 0 45 mmol g but low removal capacity for pb2 0 08 mmol g the existence of f in fsp fbp and fsbp contributed to the removal of mg from the mixture to some extent in order to better understand the removal thermodynamic several thermodynamic parameters which are related to temperature were studied the values of δh δg and δs were calculated from the following equations and are tabulated in table 1 zare et al 2018 2 k d q e c e 3 δ g r t l n k d 4 ln k d δ s r δ h r t where k d is the distribution coefficient ml g r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is absolute temperature k δh j mol and δs j mol k are enthalpy and entropy changes respectively the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of ln k d vs 1 t as showed in fig s3 the negative δg values for both pb2 and mg indicate that the adsorption process is thermodynamically spontaneous with an increase in temperature table 1 the absolute value of δg for all these materials increases slowly indicating that the adsorption process is more favorable at higher temperature the positive δh values approve the endothermic nature of the adsorption process the positive values of δs indicate an increase in the randomness at the adsorbent and adsorbate interface which reveals a good affinity of all these materials towards pb2 and mg similar results were also found in other materials gao et al 2013 zare et al 2018 as shown in fig 1c and d the removal capacity rapidly decreased with increasing adsorbent dosage and then the trend slowed down when dosage was above 0 05 g which was similar to other reports adeogun and babu 2015 jiang et al 2016 you et al 2018 compared to the individual removal of pb2 or mg at the dosage of 0 01 g fig s4 the removal capacities for pb2 from the mixture decreased slightly by 5 5 for fsp 11 1 for fsbp 0 for both f and fbp but the removal capacities for mg from the mixture decreased obviously by 18 2 for fbp 28 6 for f 31 4 for fsbp and 20 for fsp this indicated that there was a competitive sorption between pb2 and mg and limited number of reactive sites on the surface of the materials had a greater influence in the removal of mg 3 2 adsorption kinetics removal efficiency of pb2 and mg from the mixture increased gradually with a longer exposure time and equilibrium was reached within 60 min fig s5 hence the exposure time of the subsequent experiments were set to be 60 min notably compared with individual removal of pb2 or mg fig s6 the decrease on removal capacity of pb2 in competitive removal was less than that of mg by fsp and fsbp especially fsp the differences were smaller when higher dosage was applied since there would be more available sites for competitive removal huang et al 2016 in order to further study the kinetics of competitive removal of pb2 and mg from mixture by these materials three kinetic models were considered figs 2 and s6 pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models fbp was not included in the subsequent analysis for pb2 removal due to its negligible pb2 removal capacity pseudo first order kinetic equation lee et al 2011 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k 1 is the constant rate g mg min q e mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and q t mg g is the adsorption amount at time t min pseudo second order kinetic model xiao et al 2018 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg min is the constant rate intra particle diffusion model beltrame et al 2018 7 q t k i d t 0 5 c where k id mg g min0 5 is the rate constant and c mg g is intercept which reflects the boundary layer thickness for the removal of pb2 from the mixture by fsp fsbp and f the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted the data better fig 2 a than the pseudo first order model fig s7a it suggests that the interaction between pb2 and the nanocomposites was the rate limiting step yan et al 2011 the calculated pb2 adsorption capacity from the pseudo second order model by fsp fsbp and f was 202 84 mg g 0 98 mmol g 143 68 mg g 0 69 mmol g and 23 65 mg g 0 11 mmol g respectively table 2 which was similar to the experimental results fsbp showed the highest kinetic constant k 2 among these materials table 2 the increased surface energy resulting from structure deformation and structure periodicity reduction when the sr sites in the lattice are replaced by ba with a different atomic size li et al 2015 may contribute to the higher capacity during the competitive removal process pb2 ions likely first occupy the available active sites on the surface of fsbp and then are immobilized via the ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 for the competitive removal of mg from the mixture fig 2b and table 3 the kinetic data by all the materials agreed better with the pseudo second order model r 2 0 999 than the pseudo first order model fig s7b the calculated competitive removal capacity of mg based on the pseudo second order model was 208 33 mg g 0 57 mmol g for fbp 175 44 mg g 0 48 mmol g for f 90 91 mg g 0 25 mmol g for fsbp and 65 15 mg g 0 18 mmol g for fsp this implies that the ba sites in the phosphate materials are primarily responsible for organic dye removal based on these results fsbp showed good capability to simultaneously remove pb2 and mg from water the higher removal capacity and kinetic constant k 2 for pb2 than that for mg removed by fsbp tables 2 and 3 indicates faster approach of pb2 to occupy the available active sites on the surface of fsbp multiple stages were observed in the plots of q t versus t 0 5 for competitive removal of pb2 and mg fig 2c and d suggesting that intra particle diffusion was not the sole rate limiting step huo and yan 2012 the k id 1 k id 2 and k id 3 refer to the diffusion rates at different stages during the removal process the first period k id 1 is the solute transport from the bulk solution to the boundary layer film presented on the adsorbent surface reis et al 2011 the second step k id 2 is the diffusion of solute molecules through the boundary layer film after which the adsorbates reach the surface of the adsorbent reis et al 2011 the last step k id 3 is intra particle diffusion when the adsorbates migrate into the porous structure wang et al 2015 as shown in tables 2 and 3 the kinetic rates for competitive removal of pb2 and mg by all these materials followed the order of k id 1 k id 2 k id 3 with a smaller weight and size compared to mg pb2 can transport from the boundary layer film to the material s surface more easily therefore the second stage was shorter for pb2 removal compared to mg removal for fsp and fsbp fig 2 the third step of the removal of pb2 by fsbp exhibited a longer period than that by fsp and f this could be explained by two reasons a pb2 needs to first migrate into material s lattice to initial the ion exchange between pb2 with sr2 while the larger mg molecule only adheres to surface of the material b fsbp possesses a more porous structure fig s8 with the highest bjh adsorption cumulative pore volume 0 78 0 26 and 0 11 cm3 g for fsbp fsp and fbp respectively it should be noted that all the c values referring to the boundary layer thickness were none zero tables 2 and 3 implying that intra particle diffusion was not the only rate limiting mechanism in the adsorption process marrakchi et al 2017 the increased c values for the three stages were due to the increase of the boundary layer s thickness and the driving force associated with the initial concentrations of pb2 or mg beltrame et al 2018 pezoti jr et al 2014 3 3 adsorption isotherm as shown in fig s9 all the obtained plots show the l langmuir type adsorption isotherm according to the giles classification system giles et al 1974 indicating a relatively high affinity between adsorbates and fsp fbp fsbp f wan et al 2010 in the low concentration range the values of q e for all materials increased linearly with increased equilibrium concentration c e which may be ascribed to the high driving force provided by high initial concentrations to overcome the transfer resistance fu et al 2015 however the linear growth of the q e values was retarded at higher c e range as most of effective sites had been occupied by saturated pb2 or dye molecules similar to other reports ansari et al 2017 hu et al 2018 in the current study the q e values for removal of pb2 from the mixture followed the order of fsp fsbp f fbp higher content of sr in fsp was beneficial to the effective ion exchange between sr2 and pb2 chu et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 leading to the highest removal capacity of pb2 by fsp however the q e value for removal of mg showed the opposite order fbp 0 46 mmol g f 0 42 mmol g fsbp 0 26 mmol g fsp 0 17 mmol g the highest q e value of mg by fbp may be ascribed to the effective interaction between ba and mg zhang et al 2017 the removal of both mg and pb2 by f may be due to the electrostatic interaction between pollutants and feoh groups on the surface rajput et al 2016 therefore for removal of mg from mixture the content of these nanomaterials is more crucial to the removal capacity than the surface area of the materials fsp 58 9 m2 g fsbp 45 3 m2 g f 23 7 m2 g fbp 14 8 m2 g the langmuir equation is mainly used for describing monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous surface of adsorbent wang et al 2016 in addition the binding sites are finite with the same affinity to adsorbate and there is no interaction between adsorbates bhattacharyya and ray 2014 the equation is as follows 8 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where q m is the maximum sorption capacity mg g k l l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant the separation factor r l is a dimensionless parameter that controls the favorability of sorption using the equation pourjavadi et al 2016 9 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where the adsorption can be irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 the freundlich model is to describe multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surface under various non ideal conditions yazdanbakhsh et al 2010 this model can be expressed by the following equation 10 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f mg g l mg n and n are freundlich equilibrium constants which are indicators of the adsorption capacity and distribution respectively langmiur and freundlich models were used to further describe the interactive behavior between materials and pollutants ma et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 a and b similarly fbp was excluded for pb2 removal due to its negligible removal capacity of pb2 the calculated q m tables 4 and 5 for pb2 and mg from mixture agreed well with the experimental capacities of these materials fig s9 fsp showed the highest q m for the removal of pb2 with the lowest r l and lowest q m for the removal of mg yet with the highest r l from the mixture implying high affinity to pb2 f possessed high q m for mg removal but low q m for pb2 removal all the 1 n values in tables 4 and 5 were less than one further implying a favorable removal process however the correlation coefficient values r 2 for freundlich isotherm for all the materials are a little lower than those of the langmuir isotherm tables 4 and 5 indicating that the adsorption occurs as the monolayer dye adsorbs onto the homogenous material surface yazdanbakhsh et al 2010 3 4 mechanism of simultaneous removal the pristine fsbp are nanorods with a length of 300 nm fig 4 a while the reclaimed fsbp after treatment have changed their shape to sticky clusters composed of short rods and particles with a smaller size of 50 100 nm fig 4b the change of shape and size may be due to the existence of pollutants in fsbp which can be supported by the newly found pb 2 62 in the reclaimed fsbp fig 4c moreover some small peaks marked arrows in fig 5 in the xrd patterns which were ascribed to the lead related phosphate chu et al 2018 ma et al 1995 were observed in reclaimed fsbp confirming the replacement of sr by pb in fsbp s lattice compared to the pristine f fig 4d the surface of reclaimed f fig 4e became fuzzy and sticky which may be also ascribed to the adsorbed pollutants no obvious change can be found in the xrd patterns of f before and after treatment fig 5 implying that pb2 ions were immobilized on the surface of f instead of entering into lattice of fe3o4 crystals as a result 57 of adsorbed pb2 ions were found re leaching from the surface of f into water after 10 h there is a concern of inducing secondary pollution to the water system as the released pb2 ions possess a high toxicity to aquatic life and human beings song et al 2018 a higher percentage of n 5 63 at in f than that in fsbp 0 12 at indicates that more mg can be adsorbed on the surface of f which agrees well with the removal capacities fig s9 it should be noted that the element leaching of ba from fbp and fsbp into solution in the removal process was 1 9 and 1 7 mg l respectively which is below the usepa maximum contaminant level 2 0 mg l for ba in drinking water some of the ft ir characteristic peaks of mg marked arrows were found in the used fsbp but not in pristine fsbp fig 6 demonstrating the existence of mg in the reclaimed fsbp the peaks at 1637 cm 1 1558 cm 1 1438 cm 1 1407 cm 1 1321 cm 1 and 1273 cm 1 may be characterized to the vibrations of c c stretching n h bending benzene ring c h bending of methyl c n and c n stretching respectively lee et al 2011 leng et al 2015 sun et al 2015 wei et al 2014 the peaks at 885 2 cm 1 761 2 cm 1 and 677 9 cm 1 can be ascribed to aromatic c h bending wei et al 2014 they showed obvious shifts compared with pristine mg in addition broadening of peaks at 1637 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 were observed in used fsbp these changes of shift and broadening of peaks suggested the possible chemical interactions e g hydrogen bonding ahmed and jhung 2017 between pollutants and fsbp no obvious change was found in the ft ir spectra of f before and after treatment fig 6 the peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1047 cm 1 can be attributed to c n stretching and c h bending respectively implying the existence of mg in reclaimed f it should be noted that even more n was found in the reclaimed f than that in reclaimed fsbp according to eds results fig 4 but less groups ascribed to mg were found in ft ir spectrum of reclaimed f fig 6 it suggested that the interaction between f and mg may be weak physical bonding which was also supported by the fact that after staying in water for 10 h more leaching of adsorbed mg was found from reclaimed f 42 than that from reclaimed fsbp 15 the unstable binding between mg and f would limit its application due to the potential secondary pollution the phosphate in fsbp played a significant role in the stable immobilization of pb2 and mg while the content of f in fsbp was mainly responsible for magnetic separation of fsbp from water after treatment as shown in fig 7 a and b the newly found pb peaks pb 4p pb 4d and pb 4f and the decreased sr 3d peak signal in xps spectra demonstrated that pb2 was immobilized mainly by replacing sr in the lattice of fsbp the increased c peaks c 1s and c 2s confirmed the existence of mg in the used fsbp fig 7a the newly detected n 1s peak fig 7c which can be ascribed to be c n group in mg showed no obvious shift compared to pristine mg suggesting that the n containing groups were not responsible for strong bonding which can lead to electron density change mashtalir et al 2014 as shown in fig 7d the high resolution o 1s spectra before and after removal can be deconvoluted into the two peaks as indicated the peak ascribed to po4 3 was shifted to the low binding energy implying a different electron density at oxygen in p o pb mg linkages compared to p o sr ba sudarsan et al 2002 on the other hand the peak ascribed to ba sr o showed no obvious shift slight shift and peak area decrease were found in sr 3d fig 7e after application which may be due to the replacement of sr by pb in the lattice the unchanged position of ba 3d spectra fig 7f implied that the ba element was not involved in the chemical interaction therefore the mechanism of simultaneously removing pb2 and mg by fsbp is proposed to be ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 in the lattice as well as the hydrogen bonds between po4 3 on surface of fsbp and positively charged hydrogen group of mg 4 conclusions in this work the competitive removal of pb2 and mg from water by three magnetic phosphate nanocomposites fsp fbp and fsbp was investigated in detail and compared to the removal of the magnetic iron oxide core f effects of temperature and adsorbent dosage were studied to optimize the removal processes kinetic and isothermal were studied with three kinetic models and two isothermal models fsp and fbp showed a high selectivity of pb2 and mg from mixture respectively while fsbp can effectively remove both pb2 and mg from mixture the phosphate in these nanocomposites was mainly responsible for the removal performance while the magnetic characteristics provided by f enhance the magnetic separation of the pollutant laden nanocomposites from water after treatment the mechanism of simultaneous removal by fsbp was proposed to be the ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 in the lattice and the hydrogen bonds between po4 3 on surface of fsbp and positively charged hydrogen group of mg it demonstrated the

19122,the competitive removal of pb2 and malachite green mg from water by three magnetic phosphate nanocomposites fe3o4 ba3 po4 2 fe3o4 sr5 po4 3 oh and fe3o4 sr5xba3x po4 3 oh namely fbp fsp and fsbp respectively was systematically investigated compared with fe3o4 f nanoparticle temperature and adsorbent dosage for competitive removal were optimized to be 20 c and 0 05 g in 50 ml the kinetic and isothermal adsorption results were fitted well with the pseudo second order model and langmuir model respectively in the competitive removal process fsp showed a high affinity to pb2 202 8 mg g while fbp possessed high selectivity for mg 175 4 mg g and fsbp was effective at simultaneous removal of pb2 and mg with a capacity of 143 7 and 90 9 mg g respectively the magnetic contents in nanocomposites allow magnetic separation of materials from the water after treatment we proposed that the simultaneous removal mechanism by fsbp was due to ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 in the lattice and then the formation of hydrogen bonds between po4 3 outside the material s surface and positively charged hydrogen in mg this study indicates the potential of these phosphate nanocomposites to be used as effective materials for selective or simultaneous removal of pb2 and mg from water graphical abstract image 1 keywords magnetic phosphate nanocomposites selective removal simultaneous removal mechanism water treatment 1 introduction with the rapid development of industrialization large amounts of heavy metal ions and organic dyes have been released into water systems lian et al 2013 these contaminants are highly toxic posing a significant threat to aquatic life and human beings jia et al 2015 as one of the most toxic heavy metals pb2 contamination always arouses public concern song et al 2018 different nano structured materials have been widely reported for removing pb2 from aqueous solutions including grafted and crosslinked chitosan nanoparticles ge et al 2016 2 hydroxyethylammonium sulfonate immobilized on gamma fe2o3 nanoparticles khani et al 2016 co 2mo 6 ldh mostafa et al 2016 metal organic framework derived nanoporous adsorbents of zno znfe2o4 c chen et al 2016 mg oh 2 supported nanoscale zero valent iron liu et al 2015 and functionalized carboxylate ferroxane nanoparticles moattari et al 2015 however the materials for pb2 removal from metallurgy electroplating wastewater which usually has lower ph values were still insufficient water contamination by malachite green mg a commonly used cationic dye is attracting increasing attention sun et al 2015 limited types of nanomaterials have been reported for mg removal such as a magnetic reduced graphene oxide zeolitic imidazolate framework self assembled nanocomposite lin and lee 2016 cuprous iodide cupric oxide nano composite loaded on activated carbon nekouei et al 2016 zns cu np ac activated carbon dastkhoon et al 2015 sodium dodecyl sulfate modified gamma al2o3 nanoparticles mohammadifar et al 2015 and nano iron oxide loaded alginate microspheres soni et al 2014 the nanomaterials mentioned above have shown promising potential for removal of pb2 or mg from wastewater individually however there is a need for nanomaterials that can simultaneously remove metals and organic dies such as pb2 and mg from aquatic systems wang and ariyanto 2007 zhang et al 2018 this could happen with mixed industrial wastes from electroplating and textile discharges it should be noted that the co existence of different pollutants is considered to be one of the most dangerous sources of environmental pollution deng et al 2013 and multi component removal studies are useful to identify the competitive performance of several pollutants and play an important role for the proper design and operation of water purification processes dil et al 2017 sharifpour et al 2018 when two or more pollutants are present in solution the removal efficiency of particular contaminant may increase or decrease or remain unchanged dil et al 2017 therefore it is significant to understand the underlying mechanisms and predict the removal efficiency for other pollutants in our previous work we prepared strontium phosphate hybrid nanorod sr5 po4 3 oh and srhpo4 by a simple one pot hydrothermal method the competitive removal of pb2 and mg from water by this material was also studied in detail zhang et al 2017 however it was difficult to separate these strontium phosphate nanorods from solution after treatment resulting in the potential risk of secondary pollution from residual strontium phosphate hybrid nanorods left after treatment hence the objective of the current study is to investigate the competitive removal of pb2 and mg by magnetic phosphate nanocomposites fe3o4 sr5 po4 3 oh henceforth fsp as well as two other materials fe3o4 ba3 po4 2 and fe3o4 sr5xba3x po4 3 oh fbp and fsbp respectively for comparison the removal efficiency of pb2 and mg by pure fe3o4 f nano crystalline clusters was also evaluated since these clusters are at the core of fsp fbp and fsbp the effects of temperature and adsorbent dosage on the competitive removal were studied the kinetics and thermodynamics for competitive removal were systematically analyzed by several models importantly the competitive removal mechanism for selective or dual removal of pb2 and mg by these materials were elucidated which make it a significant study for multifunctional materials in treatment of water with complex contamination 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o ethylene glycol eg sodium acetate polyethylene glycol 2000 peg2000 strontium nitrate barium nitrate cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab lead nitrate sodium phosphate sodium nitrate sodium sulfate sodium chloride nitric acid sodium hydroxide and malachite green mg were all purchased from shanghai sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china ctab and sodium phosphate were used as versatile soft template and precipitant respectively all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without any further purification the chemical structure of mg is shown in fig s1 2 2 preparation of materials the f spherical nano crystalline clusters 100 500 nm were prepared using a solvothermal method firstly 1 35 g fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 40 ml eg to form an orange solution subsequently naac 3 6 g and peg2000 1 g were added followed by vigorously stirring for 30 min afterward the mixture was sealed in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 c for 8 h before cooling to room temperature finally the black powder was rinsed with ethanol several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 6 h briefly the fbp fsp fsbp composites were prepared by mixing 1 96 g barium nitrate 1 59 g strontium nitrate 0 98 g barium nitrate and 0 79 g strontium nitrate respectively with 0 06 g f spherical clusters and 0 01 g ctab in 40 ml of deionized di water under stirring to form solution 1 solution 2 was prepared by adding 0 82 g sodium phosphate into 10 ml of di water at 40 c with continuous stirring for 30 min solution 2 was slowly poured into solution 1 with continuous stirring for 30 min the mixed solution was transferred into a 100 ml teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave reactor sealed and maintained at 180 c for 8 h as the autoclave cooled to room temperature the powder was washed with di water and then with ethanol five times finally the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 4 h and the yield was 1 3 g with a yield ratio of 85 the resulting magnetic content of f in fbp fsp fsbp was calculated to be around 4 6 wt 2 3 batch experiments since no obvious interferences were observed in the uv spectrum of mg and pb2 fig s2 a mixed solution of pb2 and mg with initial concentration at 500 mg l each was prepared in di water the mixed solution ph was adjusted to 5 0 by 0 01 m hno3 to avoid the hydrolysis or precipitation of pb2 batch experiments for removing pb2 and mg were carried out in beaker with a capacity of 100 ml under mechanic stirring at 200 rpm generally 0 05 g fsp fbp fsbp f was mixed into 50 ml solution containing pb2 and mg with initial concentrations at 500 mg l each with mechanic stirring for 60 min at 20 c and ph 5 0 at predetermined time intervals 0 120 min 1 ml of the suspension was sampled then filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane diluted following by analysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icpaes optima 2100 perkinelmer usa and uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu model uv1700 japan to determine the concentration of pb2 and mg respectively all tests were repeated three times and the mean results used for further analysis the removal capacities for pb2 and mg are calculated as follows mostafa et al 2016 1 q e c 0 c e v w m where q e is the removal capacity at equilibrium mmol g c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of pb2 or mg mg l respectively v is the volume of solutions l w is the dosage of fsp fbp fsbp f used g and m is the molecular weight of pb2 or mg g mol 2 4 characterization morphology of the obtained materials were studied on a hitachi limited model s 4800 japan field emission scanning electron microscope sem with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained on a bruker model axs d8 germany advance x ray diffract meter with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm the brunauer emmett teller bet method was applied to obtain the specific surface area of materials with an asap 2020 m micromeritics at 100 c the functional groups on the materials were examined via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet6700 thermo usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was performed on an axis utltradld instrument japan all xps spectra were calibrated using the binding energy be of c 1s 284 8 ev as the reference 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of temperature and dosage as shown in fig 1 a and b for the competitive removal of pb2 and mg there was a slight increase in pb2 removal by fsp fsbp f as temperature increased from 10 to 50 c while a negligible change was observed for mg removal by all the materials this indicates that the removal process of pb2 and mg from mixture is not completely thermodynamically controlled but kinetically controlled zhang et al 2012 therefore no specific temperature control is needed to enhance the removal process which is beneficial regarding to the operation cost fsp possessed a high affinity to pb2 from mixture as it exhibited the highest removal capacity for pb2 0 85 mmol g and lowest for mg 0 18 mmol g fbp showed a negligible removal ability of pb2 but the highest capacity for mg 0 55 mmol g implying a high selectivity of mg from mixture fsbp showed high capacity for both pb2 0 86 mmol g and mg 0 25 mmol g at 30 c indicating the potential application in mixed contaminated wastewater clean up the as prepared f showed a high removal capacity for mg 0 45 mmol g but low removal capacity for pb2 0 08 mmol g the existence of f in fsp fbp and fsbp contributed to the removal of mg from the mixture to some extent in order to better understand the removal thermodynamic several thermodynamic parameters which are related to temperature were studied the values of δh δg and δs were calculated from the following equations and are tabulated in table 1 zare et al 2018 2 k d q e c e 3 δ g r t l n k d 4 ln k d δ s r δ h r t where k d is the distribution coefficient ml g r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is absolute temperature k δh j mol and δs j mol k are enthalpy and entropy changes respectively the values of δh and δs were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of ln k d vs 1 t as showed in fig s3 the negative δg values for both pb2 and mg indicate that the adsorption process is thermodynamically spontaneous with an increase in temperature table 1 the absolute value of δg for all these materials increases slowly indicating that the adsorption process is more favorable at higher temperature the positive δh values approve the endothermic nature of the adsorption process the positive values of δs indicate an increase in the randomness at the adsorbent and adsorbate interface which reveals a good affinity of all these materials towards pb2 and mg similar results were also found in other materials gao et al 2013 zare et al 2018 as shown in fig 1c and d the removal capacity rapidly decreased with increasing adsorbent dosage and then the trend slowed down when dosage was above 0 05 g which was similar to other reports adeogun and babu 2015 jiang et al 2016 you et al 2018 compared to the individual removal of pb2 or mg at the dosage of 0 01 g fig s4 the removal capacities for pb2 from the mixture decreased slightly by 5 5 for fsp 11 1 for fsbp 0 for both f and fbp but the removal capacities for mg from the mixture decreased obviously by 18 2 for fbp 28 6 for f 31 4 for fsbp and 20 for fsp this indicated that there was a competitive sorption between pb2 and mg and limited number of reactive sites on the surface of the materials had a greater influence in the removal of mg 3 2 adsorption kinetics removal efficiency of pb2 and mg from the mixture increased gradually with a longer exposure time and equilibrium was reached within 60 min fig s5 hence the exposure time of the subsequent experiments were set to be 60 min notably compared with individual removal of pb2 or mg fig s6 the decrease on removal capacity of pb2 in competitive removal was less than that of mg by fsp and fsbp especially fsp the differences were smaller when higher dosage was applied since there would be more available sites for competitive removal huang et al 2016 in order to further study the kinetics of competitive removal of pb2 and mg from mixture by these materials three kinetic models were considered figs 2 and s6 pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models fbp was not included in the subsequent analysis for pb2 removal due to its negligible pb2 removal capacity pseudo first order kinetic equation lee et al 2011 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k 1 is the constant rate g mg min q e mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and q t mg g is the adsorption amount at time t min pseudo second order kinetic model xiao et al 2018 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg min is the constant rate intra particle diffusion model beltrame et al 2018 7 q t k i d t 0 5 c where k id mg g min0 5 is the rate constant and c mg g is intercept which reflects the boundary layer thickness for the removal of pb2 from the mixture by fsp fsbp and f the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted the data better fig 2 a than the pseudo first order model fig s7a it suggests that the interaction between pb2 and the nanocomposites was the rate limiting step yan et al 2011 the calculated pb2 adsorption capacity from the pseudo second order model by fsp fsbp and f was 202 84 mg g 0 98 mmol g 143 68 mg g 0 69 mmol g and 23 65 mg g 0 11 mmol g respectively table 2 which was similar to the experimental results fsbp showed the highest kinetic constant k 2 among these materials table 2 the increased surface energy resulting from structure deformation and structure periodicity reduction when the sr sites in the lattice are replaced by ba with a different atomic size li et al 2015 may contribute to the higher capacity during the competitive removal process pb2 ions likely first occupy the available active sites on the surface of fsbp and then are immobilized via the ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 for the competitive removal of mg from the mixture fig 2b and table 3 the kinetic data by all the materials agreed better with the pseudo second order model r 2 0 999 than the pseudo first order model fig s7b the calculated competitive removal capacity of mg based on the pseudo second order model was 208 33 mg g 0 57 mmol g for fbp 175 44 mg g 0 48 mmol g for f 90 91 mg g 0 25 mmol g for fsbp and 65 15 mg g 0 18 mmol g for fsp this implies that the ba sites in the phosphate materials are primarily responsible for organic dye removal based on these results fsbp showed good capability to simultaneously remove pb2 and mg from water the higher removal capacity and kinetic constant k 2 for pb2 than that for mg removed by fsbp tables 2 and 3 indicates faster approach of pb2 to occupy the available active sites on the surface of fsbp multiple stages were observed in the plots of q t versus t 0 5 for competitive removal of pb2 and mg fig 2c and d suggesting that intra particle diffusion was not the sole rate limiting step huo and yan 2012 the k id 1 k id 2 and k id 3 refer to the diffusion rates at different stages during the removal process the first period k id 1 is the solute transport from the bulk solution to the boundary layer film presented on the adsorbent surface reis et al 2011 the second step k id 2 is the diffusion of solute molecules through the boundary layer film after which the adsorbates reach the surface of the adsorbent reis et al 2011 the last step k id 3 is intra particle diffusion when the adsorbates migrate into the porous structure wang et al 2015 as shown in tables 2 and 3 the kinetic rates for competitive removal of pb2 and mg by all these materials followed the order of k id 1 k id 2 k id 3 with a smaller weight and size compared to mg pb2 can transport from the boundary layer film to the material s surface more easily therefore the second stage was shorter for pb2 removal compared to mg removal for fsp and fsbp fig 2 the third step of the removal of pb2 by fsbp exhibited a longer period than that by fsp and f this could be explained by two reasons a pb2 needs to first migrate into material s lattice to initial the ion exchange between pb2 with sr2 while the larger mg molecule only adheres to surface of the material b fsbp possesses a more porous structure fig s8 with the highest bjh adsorption cumulative pore volume 0 78 0 26 and 0 11 cm3 g for fsbp fsp and fbp respectively it should be noted that all the c values referring to the boundary layer thickness were none zero tables 2 and 3 implying that intra particle diffusion was not the only rate limiting mechanism in the adsorption process marrakchi et al 2017 the increased c values for the three stages were due to the increase of the boundary layer s thickness and the driving force associated with the initial concentrations of pb2 or mg beltrame et al 2018 pezoti jr et al 2014 3 3 adsorption isotherm as shown in fig s9 all the obtained plots show the l langmuir type adsorption isotherm according to the giles classification system giles et al 1974 indicating a relatively high affinity between adsorbates and fsp fbp fsbp f wan et al 2010 in the low concentration range the values of q e for all materials increased linearly with increased equilibrium concentration c e which may be ascribed to the high driving force provided by high initial concentrations to overcome the transfer resistance fu et al 2015 however the linear growth of the q e values was retarded at higher c e range as most of effective sites had been occupied by saturated pb2 or dye molecules similar to other reports ansari et al 2017 hu et al 2018 in the current study the q e values for removal of pb2 from the mixture followed the order of fsp fsbp f fbp higher content of sr in fsp was beneficial to the effective ion exchange between sr2 and pb2 chu et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 leading to the highest removal capacity of pb2 by fsp however the q e value for removal of mg showed the opposite order fbp 0 46 mmol g f 0 42 mmol g fsbp 0 26 mmol g fsp 0 17 mmol g the highest q e value of mg by fbp may be ascribed to the effective interaction between ba and mg zhang et al 2017 the removal of both mg and pb2 by f may be due to the electrostatic interaction between pollutants and feoh groups on the surface rajput et al 2016 therefore for removal of mg from mixture the content of these nanomaterials is more crucial to the removal capacity than the surface area of the materials fsp 58 9 m2 g fsbp 45 3 m2 g f 23 7 m2 g fbp 14 8 m2 g the langmuir equation is mainly used for describing monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous surface of adsorbent wang et al 2016 in addition the binding sites are finite with the same affinity to adsorbate and there is no interaction between adsorbates bhattacharyya and ray 2014 the equation is as follows 8 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where q m is the maximum sorption capacity mg g k l l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant the separation factor r l is a dimensionless parameter that controls the favorability of sorption using the equation pourjavadi et al 2016 9 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where the adsorption can be irreversible r l 0 favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 the freundlich model is to describe multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surface under various non ideal conditions yazdanbakhsh et al 2010 this model can be expressed by the following equation 10 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f mg g l mg n and n are freundlich equilibrium constants which are indicators of the adsorption capacity and distribution respectively langmiur and freundlich models were used to further describe the interactive behavior between materials and pollutants ma et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 a and b similarly fbp was excluded for pb2 removal due to its negligible removal capacity of pb2 the calculated q m tables 4 and 5 for pb2 and mg from mixture agreed well with the experimental capacities of these materials fig s9 fsp showed the highest q m for the removal of pb2 with the lowest r l and lowest q m for the removal of mg yet with the highest r l from the mixture implying high affinity to pb2 f possessed high q m for mg removal but low q m for pb2 removal all the 1 n values in tables 4 and 5 were less than one further implying a favorable removal process however the correlation coefficient values r 2 for freundlich isotherm for all the materials are a little lower than those of the langmuir isotherm tables 4 and 5 indicating that the adsorption occurs as the monolayer dye adsorbs onto the homogenous material surface yazdanbakhsh et al 2010 3 4 mechanism of simultaneous removal the pristine fsbp are nanorods with a length of 300 nm fig 4 a while the reclaimed fsbp after treatment have changed their shape to sticky clusters composed of short rods and particles with a smaller size of 50 100 nm fig 4b the change of shape and size may be due to the existence of pollutants in fsbp which can be supported by the newly found pb 2 62 in the reclaimed fsbp fig 4c moreover some small peaks marked arrows in fig 5 in the xrd patterns which were ascribed to the lead related phosphate chu et al 2018 ma et al 1995 were observed in reclaimed fsbp confirming the replacement of sr by pb in fsbp s lattice compared to the pristine f fig 4d the surface of reclaimed f fig 4e became fuzzy and sticky which may be also ascribed to the adsorbed pollutants no obvious change can be found in the xrd patterns of f before and after treatment fig 5 implying that pb2 ions were immobilized on the surface of f instead of entering into lattice of fe3o4 crystals as a result 57 of adsorbed pb2 ions were found re leaching from the surface of f into water after 10 h there is a concern of inducing secondary pollution to the water system as the released pb2 ions possess a high toxicity to aquatic life and human beings song et al 2018 a higher percentage of n 5 63 at in f than that in fsbp 0 12 at indicates that more mg can be adsorbed on the surface of f which agrees well with the removal capacities fig s9 it should be noted that the element leaching of ba from fbp and fsbp into solution in the removal process was 1 9 and 1 7 mg l respectively which is below the usepa maximum contaminant level 2 0 mg l for ba in drinking water some of the ft ir characteristic peaks of mg marked arrows were found in the used fsbp but not in pristine fsbp fig 6 demonstrating the existence of mg in the reclaimed fsbp the peaks at 1637 cm 1 1558 cm 1 1438 cm 1 1407 cm 1 1321 cm 1 and 1273 cm 1 may be characterized to the vibrations of c c stretching n h bending benzene ring c h bending of methyl c n and c n stretching respectively lee et al 2011 leng et al 2015 sun et al 2015 wei et al 2014 the peaks at 885 2 cm 1 761 2 cm 1 and 677 9 cm 1 can be ascribed to aromatic c h bending wei et al 2014 they showed obvious shifts compared with pristine mg in addition broadening of peaks at 1637 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 were observed in used fsbp these changes of shift and broadening of peaks suggested the possible chemical interactions e g hydrogen bonding ahmed and jhung 2017 between pollutants and fsbp no obvious change was found in the ft ir spectra of f before and after treatment fig 6 the peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1047 cm 1 can be attributed to c n stretching and c h bending respectively implying the existence of mg in reclaimed f it should be noted that even more n was found in the reclaimed f than that in reclaimed fsbp according to eds results fig 4 but less groups ascribed to mg were found in ft ir spectrum of reclaimed f fig 6 it suggested that the interaction between f and mg may be weak physical bonding which was also supported by the fact that after staying in water for 10 h more leaching of adsorbed mg was found from reclaimed f 42 than that from reclaimed fsbp 15 the unstable binding between mg and f would limit its application due to the potential secondary pollution the phosphate in fsbp played a significant role in the stable immobilization of pb2 and mg while the content of f in fsbp was mainly responsible for magnetic separation of fsbp from water after treatment as shown in fig 7 a and b the newly found pb peaks pb 4p pb 4d and pb 4f and the decreased sr 3d peak signal in xps spectra demonstrated that pb2 was immobilized mainly by replacing sr in the lattice of fsbp the increased c peaks c 1s and c 2s confirmed the existence of mg in the used fsbp fig 7a the newly detected n 1s peak fig 7c which can be ascribed to be c n group in mg showed no obvious shift compared to pristine mg suggesting that the n containing groups were not responsible for strong bonding which can lead to electron density change mashtalir et al 2014 as shown in fig 7d the high resolution o 1s spectra before and after removal can be deconvoluted into the two peaks as indicated the peak ascribed to po4 3 was shifted to the low binding energy implying a different electron density at oxygen in p o pb mg linkages compared to p o sr ba sudarsan et al 2002 on the other hand the peak ascribed to ba sr o showed no obvious shift slight shift and peak area decrease were found in sr 3d fig 7e after application which may be due to the replacement of sr by pb in the lattice the unchanged position of ba 3d spectra fig 7f implied that the ba element was not involved in the chemical interaction therefore the mechanism of simultaneously removing pb2 and mg by fsbp is proposed to be ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 in the lattice as well as the hydrogen bonds between po4 3 on surface of fsbp and positively charged hydrogen group of mg 4 conclusions in this work the competitive removal of pb2 and mg from water by three magnetic phosphate nanocomposites fsp fbp and fsbp was investigated in detail and compared to the removal of the magnetic iron oxide core f effects of temperature and adsorbent dosage were studied to optimize the removal processes kinetic and isothermal were studied with three kinetic models and two isothermal models fsp and fbp showed a high selectivity of pb2 and mg from mixture respectively while fsbp can effectively remove both pb2 and mg from mixture the phosphate in these nanocomposites was mainly responsible for the removal performance while the magnetic characteristics provided by f enhance the magnetic separation of the pollutant laden nanocomposites from water after treatment the mechanism of simultaneous removal by fsbp was proposed to be the ion exchange between pb2 and sr2 in the lattice and the hydrogen bonds between po4 3 on surface of fsbp and positively charged hydrogen group of mg it demonstrated the promising application of the magnetic phosphate nanocomposites for treating multi pollutants wastewater declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

19123,n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is a chloramine disinfection by product and its formation in drinking waters can increase due to the addition of cationic polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac polydadmac is a cationic polymer added as a coagulant or coagulant aid to enhance turbidity removal during sedimentation and filtration this paper answers two central questions to understanding the nature of the ndma precursors in polydadmac first what is the reactivity of different molecular weight mw fractions of polydadmac with chloramines ndma formation potential ndmafp and kinetic experiments with chloramines were conducted for non fractionated raw and size excluded fractions 3k 3 10k and 10k da of polydadmac the lower mw fraction 3k da of polydadmac solutions was responsible for forming 64 6 of the ndma despite containing only 8 7 and 9 8 of the carbon or nitrogen present in the bulk polymer the chloramine demand kinetics of the lowest mw fraction were also 2 faster than the higher mw fractions therefore in a water treatment application the lower mw polydadmac likely contributes to most of the ndma attributed to the use of polydadmac the second question was can 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr be used to characterize the molecular structures in polydadmac that react with chloramines a peak for 1h nmr dimethylamine dma a known low mw ndma precursor was found in a commercial polydadmac solution and decreased upon chloramination the estimated dma alone could not account for the observed ndmafp indicating the presence of other low mw precursors diffusion order spectroscopy dosy nmr also showed multiple lower mw organics in polydadmac that change upon chloramination including a 1 5 decrease in mw suggesting chloramines cleave cc or cn bonds these reactions may produce intermediates responsible for ndma formation polymer manufacturers could use nmr to synthesize polydadmac with less dma and other low mw compounds that produce ndma upon chloramination graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosodimethylamine size fractionation nuclear magnetic resonance chloramination polydadmac 1 introduction nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps are an emerging concern at drinking water treatment plants bond et al 2011 hanigan et al 2015 krasner et al 2013 leavey roback et al 2016 wu et al 2015 chloramine disinfection yields lower trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas compared with free chlorine mitch and sedlak 2004 schreiber and mitch 2006 however ndma formation is higher using chloramine than free chlorine ndma is a potent human carcinogen and is under consideration for regulation by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2006 numerous sources of ndma precursors exist in watersheds and are thought to be related to algae agricultural runoff and discharge of treated wastewater hanigan et al 2012 krasner et al 2012 mitch and sedlak 2004 mitch et al 2008 shen and andrews 2011 2013 however in plant precursors for ndma also exist and may be easier to control than watershed precursors cationic treatment polymers e g polyamines polyacrylamide pam and polydadmac are used as coagulants or dewatering aids in drinking water treatment and increase ndma formation upon chloramination krasner et al 2012 padhye et al 2011 wilczak et al 2003 park et al 2009 found that polyamines produce more ndma than polydadmac for polyamines the tertiary amines terminating polymer chains are suspected to play a role in ndma formation in polydadmac which lacks tertiary amines degradation of the quaternary amine ring may accounts for the ndma formation pam produces substantially less ndma than polydadmac in accordance with its lack of dimethylamine dma functional groups mitch and sedlak 2002 schreiber and mitch 2006 however pam has weak charge neutralization properties for particle coagulation and thus cannot be used as coagulants in water treatment facilities an et al 2017 in the usa the majority of drinking water treatment plants use polydadmac rather than other cationic polymers a suggested route for polydadmac to produce ndma involves hofmann elimination occurring at the β h to the quaternary amine which leads to a tertiary amine through cleavage from the α c to the n the tertiary amine is subsequently attacked by monochloramine or dichloramine to yield dma padhye et al 2011 previous research park et al 2015 also studied ndma formation from polydadmac and polyamines during chloramination and proposed that tertiary amines degrade to secondary amines by electrophilic substitution from chlorine to the electron pair of tertiary amine in this process nitrosamine formation could be explained by nucleophilic substitution between chloramine and secondary amine the manufacturing process has also been proposed as a source of ndma precursors such as dma or other impurities kemper et al 2010 and altering the polymer manufacturing process could significantly reduce n nitrosamine formation for example treating polymers with alkylating agents such as methyl iodide mei may convert chloramine reactive tertiary amine impurities to less reactive quaternary ammonium groups and reduce ndma formation from polydadmac and epi dma zeng et al 2016 other work suggested substituting the quaternary n in polydadmac with phosphorus which forms less or no ndma zeng et al 2014 this paper seeks to answer two central questions to understanding the nature of the ndma precursors in polydadmac 1 what is the reactivity of different mw fractions of polydadmac with chloramines and 2 can 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr be used to characterize the molecular structures in polydadmac that react with chloramines it was hypothesized that lower mw polydadmac fractions are enriched in nitrogen and will disproportionately contribute to ndma formation when compared with higher mw fractions 2 materials and methods 2 1 polymer reagents

the bulk polymer 226 15 ng l with the highest ndma concentration 144 11 ng l occurring in the lowest mw fraction 3k da the carbon nitrogen ratio c n of each fraction is also reported in table 1 non fractionated polydadmac had a ratio of 6 4 mgc mgn which is close to the theoretical c n of 6 9 for polydadmac c8h16ncl n c n ratios of the 3k and 3 10k da were not significantly different from the non fractionated polymer p 0 05 while the 10k da fraction had excess carbon c n 8 2 the lower mw fraction 3k da contained 8 7 and 9 8 of the carbon and nitrogen in the bulk solution respectively the low mw fraction 3k da resulted in ndma formation of 144 11 ng l which was 64 6 of the amount formed in the non fractionated sample the fraction 10k da was responsible for the least amount of ndma formation this finding agreed with previous results by park et al 2009 which found the low mw compounds are the biggest contributors to ndma precursor load fig 1 compares ndmafp reactivity for each fraction relative to the carbon or nitrogen present the bulk polymer produced 58 ngndma mgc and 370 ngndma mgn p 0 05 the 3k da fraction showed a greatest p 0 05 normalized reactivity 422 ngndma mgc and 2526 ngndma mgn the reactivity of 3 10k da fraction is also high producing about 226 ngndma mgc and 1263 ngndma mgn the reactivity is fairly low for the 10k da fraction 9 ngndma mgc and 71 ngndma mgn a possible hypothesis is that the lower mw fraction contains impurities from the polydadmac manufacturing process that are n enriched and have a greater ndma yield than the intended polymer chain park et al 2015 3 2 ndma formation kinetics figs 2 and 3 show ndma formation and monochloramine decay kinetics for the reaction between polydadmac and monochloramine ndma formation reached a maximum level after 60 h doc concentrations for non fractionated sample the 3k 3 10k and 10k da polymer fractions were 3 93 0 34 0 21 and 3 38 mg l respectively approximately 55 of the ndma formed within 10 h for the bulk polymer 64 of the ndma formed in 10 h for the 3k da fraction compared to 20 and 11 for the 3 10k and 10k da fractions respectively the trends in monochloramine decay rates were consistent with ndma formation higher ndma formation occurred in the bulk polymer which had the fastest chloramine decay as shown in fig 3 chloramine decay was fit using a pseudo first order model and k decay values are summarized in table 1 and fig 3 the 3k da fraction had the fastest degradation rate 2 10 3 h 1 which indicates that components of the lower mw polydadmac fraction are reacting with chloramines furthermore although in some cases greater chloramine organic n ratios result in greater ndma formed from the same sample our kinetics experiments show that the greater reactivity of the 3k da fraction was unlikely attributed to this phenomenon this is demonstrated by the greater chloramine decay rate despite significantly lower organic c and n concentrations in these samples if greater ndmafp in the 3k da sample was an artifact of greater chloramine organic n ratio that was due to multiple step reaction we would expect slow chloramine decay kinetics ndma kinetic data was fit by a previously published model zhang et al 2016 that implicitly accounts for the presence of mono and di chloramines and the chloramine decay rate as shown in eqn 1 1 d p d t k a p p p n h 2 c l where nh2cl total chloramine residual concentration at time t x2028 mg l p ndma precursor concentration at time t mg l model fits predicted ndma formation kinetics and are shown in fig 2 values for k app and r2 are summarized in table 1 the k app ranged from 0 02 to 0 08 m 1s 1 which was similar to those previously reported for wastewater lake river and groundwater in arizona and iowa as seen in table s1 chen and valentine 2006 zhang et al 2016 thus this could imply that the ndma formation mechanisms from polydadmac are similar to other previously studied precursors prior publications support the notion of a rate limiting step in ndma formation that is independent of the precursors related to wastewater lake river and groundwater however the observation that k app is similar 0 08 vs 0 09 m 1s 1 for non fractionated and 3k da polymer fraction and 4 higher than the 3 10k or 10k da fraction could suggest slightly different pathways between low molecular weight compounds in the unfractionated solution and 3k da fractions vs the higher mw compounds present in the other fractions the similarity in ndmafp yields and k app for the non fractionated solution and 3k da fraction suggest that the lower mw fraction is the dominant source of ndma precursors in polydadmac 3 3 nmr results for polydadmac upon chloramination nmr was used to investigate differences in polydadmac mw fractions to aid in identifying potential ndma precursors fig 4 a shows the 1h nmr spectra of the polydadmac sample before and after chloramination four peaks were observed which are consistent with different h position in polydadmac at 3 3 3 25 3 18 ppm and there was an unexpected peak with a 1h resonance of 2 74 ppm that is consistent with the structure of dma chen et al 2014 simpson et al 2012 jiang et al 2010 upon chloramination only the 2 74 ppm peak was decreased or nearly eliminated dma is a known ndma precursor although its molar yield is 1 zeng et al 2014 2016 we did not quantify dma but a 1 molar yield would correspond to 6 ngndma mgc or 37 ngndma mgn much lower in fractionated samples as shown in fig 1 the 3k da fraction had a higher response at 2 74 ppm than the bulk polymer as shown in fig 4b and the peak partially degraded upon chloramine exposure there are four carbons in the polydadmac repeating chain that are associated with the four peaks in the 13c nmr spectra fig 5 similar to the 1h nmr the dma peak in the 13c nmr nearly disappeared upon exposure to monochloramine fig 4b the dampening of the dma resonance peak indicates that dma reacted with chloramine and based on published reaction mechanisms mitch and sedlak 2004 mitch et al 2008 formed some ndma the ratios among the other four peaks changed upon chloramination the methyl group c1 was unchanged carbons at positions c2 c3 and c4 on the dadmac backbone all decreased as shown in fig 5 suggesting ring cleavage or other degradation of the polymer zeng et al 2014 2016 previously applied methyl iodide to polydadmac solutions which resulted in a significant decrease in their ndmafp it was hypothesized that polydadmac initially contains some tertiary amine groups which are alkylated by methyl iodide converting the tertiary amines to quaternary amines the success of the 13c nmr approach here may allow for future researchers to answer this question future work may attempt to correlate the c2 peak with ndmafp where a smaller peak would be expected to represent greater tertiary amine structures additionally future research may conduct nmr before and after application of methyl iodide it would be expected that if tertiary amines present in the initial solutions were the cause of ndma a reduction in c2 peak area would well represent the reduction in ndmafp this approach would require quantitative nmr which was outside the scope of this study finally dosy nmr spectroscopy was performed to characterize the molecular mass of macromolecules such as polydadmac in solution fig 6 shows the dosy spectra of polydadmac before and after chloramination the calculated diffusion coefficient of polydadmac increased after chloramination from 0 16 to 0 28 10 10 m2 s molecules with large mw have lower diffusion coefficients and dosy nmr demonstrated that the mw of polydadmac compositions shifted towards smaller mw fragments after chloramination this supports a scheme where chloramines are cleaving bonds within polydadmac leading to lower mw by products however this alone does not suggest these by products form ndma 4 conclusions this research provided experimental evidence to answer two central questions first what is the reactivity of different mw fractions of polydadmac with chloramines the lower mw fraction 3k da had higher ndmafp reactivity than higher mw fractions of the bulk polydadmac solution approximately 64 ndma was formed by mw 3k da fraction in polydadmac upon chloramination the highest reactivity of the mw fractions when normalized to both c and n was from mw 3k da fraction in which the ndma yields were 422 ngndma mgc and 2526 ngndma mgn respectively a second order ndma formation model of reactions between polydadmac and monochloramine was developed to calculate k app values for k app fell within a narrow range 0 02 0 08 m 1s 1 k app for the lower mw fraction 3k da was 0 08 m 1s 1 and exhibited the fastest reaction upon chloramination the fraction 3k da also exhibited the fastest monochloramine degradation rate 2 10 3 h 1 the work demonstrates that lower mw impurities in polydadmac are responsible for a significant portion of ndma formation upon contact with chloramines the high mw fraction is intended to aid in coagulation and is likely well removed during coagulation but the lower mw fraction may persist after sedimentation where it could account for the majority of ndma formation upon chloramination in some cases chloramines are added prior to coagulation under those conditions both the higher and lower mw fraction may be contributing to ndma formation the second question was can 1h and 13c nmr be used to characterize the molecular structures in polydadmac that react with chloramines nmr showed that the reaction between polydadmac and nh2cl led to a possible shift of methyl groups the intensity of dma as a component in the polydadmac solution decreased according to the 1h and 13c nmr results which could be regarded as significant evidence for ndma formation during chloramination and provides evidence that dma was very likely to be one of the precursors for ndma formation although it is not likely to be the only precursor based on reactivity furthermore dosy nmr results indicated that the mw of polydadmac decreased after chloramination which increased the potential for polydadmac to react and possibly opened ring structures that allow for subsequent reactions to yield ndma various opportunities based on current research now exist to reduce the ndmafp of polymer solutions chemical alkylating treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing ndmafp but may significantly disrupt the manufacturing process exchanging n in the polymer is also a novel approach but adds organic p to the distribution system based on research in the work dialysis of produced polymer may be an additional option for manufactures to reduce the ndmafp of commercial polydadmac we hypothesize that dehydrating the polymer by solvent exchange into a non polar solvent may be an effective approach to separate the low mw impurities solution phase while producing a solvent insoluble pure high mw

19123,n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is a chloramine disinfection by product and its formation in drinking waters can increase due to the addition of cationic polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac polydadmac is a cationic polymer added as a coagulant or coagulant aid to enhance turbidity removal during sedimentation and filtration this paper answers two central questions to understanding the nature of the ndma precursors in polydadmac first what is the reactivity of different molecular weight mw fractions of polydadmac with chloramines ndma formation potential ndmafp and kinetic experiments with chloramines were conducted for non fractionated raw and size excluded fractions 3k 3 10k and 10k da of polydadmac the lower mw fraction 3k da of polydadmac solutions was responsible for forming 64 6 of the ndma despite containing only 8 7 and 9 8 of the carbon or nitrogen present in the bulk polymer the chloramine demand kinetics of the lowest mw fraction were also 2 faster than the higher mw fractions therefore in a water treatment application the lower mw polydadmac likely contributes to most of the ndma attributed to the use of polydadmac the second question was can 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr be used to characterize the molecular structures in polydadmac that react with chloramines a peak for 1h nmr dimethylamine dma a known low mw ndma precursor was found in a commercial polydadmac solution and decreased upon chloramination the estimated dma alone could not account for the observed ndmafp indicating the presence of other low mw precursors diffusion order spectroscopy dosy nmr also showed multiple lower mw organics in polydadmac that change upon chloramination including a 1 5 decrease in mw suggesting chloramines cleave cc or cn bonds these reactions may produce intermediates responsible for ndma formation polymer manufacturers could use nmr to synthesize polydadmac with less dma and other low mw compounds that produce ndma upon chloramination graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosodimethylamine size fractionation nuclear magnetic resonance chloramination polydadmac 1 introduction nitrogenous

disinfection yields lower trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas compared with free chlorine mitch and sedlak 2004 schreiber and mitch 2006 however ndma formation is higher using chloramine than free chlorine ndma is a potent human carcinogen and is under consideration for regulation by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2006 numerous sources of ndma precursors exist in watersheds and are thought to be related to algae agricultural runoff and discharge of treated wastewater hanigan et al 2012 krasner et al 2012 mitch and sedlak 2004 mitch et al 2008 shen and andrews 2011 2013 however in plant precursors for ndma also exist and may be easier to control than watershed precursors cationic treatment polymers e g polyamines polyacrylamide pam and polydadmac are used as coagulants or dewatering aids in drinking water treatment and increase ndma formation upon chloramination krasner et al 2012 padhye et al 2011 wilczak et al 2003 park et al 2009 found that polyamines produce more ndma than polydadmac for polyamines the tertiary amines terminating polymer chains are suspected to play a role in ndma formation in polydadmac which lacks tertiary amines degradation of the quaternary amine ring may accounts for the ndma formation pam produces substantially less ndma than polydadmac in accordance with its lack of dimethylamine dma functional groups mitch and sedlak 2002 schreiber and mitch 2006 however pam has weak charge neutralization properties for particle coagulation and thus cannot be used as coagulants in water treatment facilities an et al 2017 in the usa the majority of drinking water treatment plants use polydadmac rather than other cationic polymers a suggested route for polydadmac to produce ndma involves hofmann elimination occurring at the β h to the quaternary amine which leads to a tertiary amine through cleavage from the α c to the n the tertiary amine is subsequently attacked by monochloramine or dichloramine to yield dma padhye et al 2011 previous research park et al 2015 also studied ndma formation from polydadmac and polyamines during chloramination and proposed that tertiary amines degrade to secondary amines by electrophilic substitution from chlorine to the electron pair of tertiary amine in this process nitrosamine formation could be explained by nucleophilic substitution between chloramine and secondary amine the manufacturing process has also been proposed as a source of ndma precursors such as dma or other impurities kemper et al 2010 and altering the polymer manufacturing process could significantly reduce n nitrosamine formation for example treating polymers with alkylating agents such as methyl iodide mei may convert chloramine reactive tertiary amine impurities to less reactive quaternary ammonium groups and reduce ndma formation from polydadmac and epi dma zeng et al 2016 other work suggested substituting the quaternary n in polydadmac with phosphorus which forms less or no ndma zeng et al 2014 this paper seeks to answer two central questions to understanding the nature of the ndma precursors in polydadmac 1 what is the reactivity of different mw fractions of polydadmac with chloramines and 2 can 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr be used to characterize the molecular structures in polydadmac that react with chloramines it was hypothesized that lower mw polydadmac fractions are enriched in nitrogen and will disproportionately contribute to ndma formation when compared with higher mw fractions 2 materials and methods 2 1 polymer reagents

the only precursor based on reactivity furthermore dosy nmr results indicated that the mw of polydadmac decreased after chloramination which increased the potential for polydadmac to react and possibly opened ring structures that allow for subsequent reactions to yield ndma various opportunities based on current research now exist to reduce the ndmafp of polymer solutions chemical alkylating treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing ndmafp but may significantly disrupt the manufacturing process exchanging n in the polymer is also a novel approach but adds organic p to the distribution system based on research in the work dialysis of produced polymer may be an additional option for manufactures to reduce the ndmafp of commercial polydadmac we hypothesize that dehydrating the polymer by solvent exchange into a non polar solvent may be an effective approach to separate the low mw impurities solution phase while producing a solvent insoluble pure high mw

sciences chinese academy of sciences beijing 100085 china corresponding author waste activated sludge was contains many anionic functional groups which can interact with heavy metal ions through electrostatic action and complexation reactions the transition metals adsorbed in was can catalyze sludge pyrolysis in anaerobic conditions and improve structural properties of organic matter in this work a multistage was utilization process for preparing the carbon based fenton like catalysis materials is proposed more specifically was is firstly used as an adsorbent for heavy metals cu and ni removal and then complexes are converted into heterogeneous fenton like carbon based catalysts through oxygen free pyrolysis the mechanisms of interactions between extracellular polymeric substances eps and metals are investigated and the physicochemical properties of sludge based carbons sbc are comprehensively characterized using varies techniques it is found that was is an excellent adsorbent for cu and ni removal which is mainly due to the coordination and electrostatic interactions between eps and heavy metals cu and ni adsorbed in was significantly improved the porous structure of sbc both adsorption and catalytic oxidization of cu ni sbc contribute the removal of e2 in real wastewater the e2 removal mechanism is explored by electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr analysis and it is found that both of o2 and oh radicals are responsible for e2 degradation in cu ii sbc h2o2 while o2 radicals contributes to e2 degradation in ni ii sbc h2o2 system so the former performed better than the latter in total removal of e2 besides cu ii and cu i are both formed in cu ii sbc during the oxidation process while only ni ii is found in the ni ii sbc h2o2 process confirming that different catalytic oxidation reactions are occurred in the cu ii sbc h2o2 and ni ii sbc h2o2 processes this study facilitates a great strategy to the sludge multi stage circulating utilization and a better understanding about the role of the cu ni existed in sbc during the estrogens removal process graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge was sludge based carbons sbc adsorption catalysis 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is generated during the primary treatment and subsequent biological treatment of wastewater ren et al 2004 it contains various organic and inorganic material including cells extracellular polymeric substances eps and inorganic minerals such as sio2 cao and mgo as well as many transition metals fe co as and other species which are considered as pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency gong et al 2014 was is increasingly produced around the world and the increased was production creates a huge challenges in the field of wastewater treatment engineering traditional was management and disposal techniques include aerobic and anaerobic digestion followed by landfilling fertilizer usage incineration and land application fytili et al 2008 besides anaerobic digestion has been widely used for stabilization of organic fraction of was and biogas production carrère et al 2010 however the accumulation of undesirable substances in was such as toxic contaminants and heavy metals which may subsequently enter the food chain and thus endanger human health has led to the restriction of land use of wastewater sludge in many countries yuan et al 2017 many researchers have investigated sustainable management of was treatment systems over the past decades especially in terms of safety sustainability quality recovery and cost effectiveness kelessidis et al 2012 duan et al 2012 smith et al 2009 and techniques such as combustion wet oxidation pyrolysis gasification and co combustion of was with other materials for further use as an energy source have also attracted extensive attention fytili et al 2008 heavy metals are well known to be toxic and can be accumulated in plants animals and eventually in humans because they are not removed by conventional biological decomposition treatments qi et al 2011 among the heavy metals copper arsenites nickel iron and zinc are the most common and because of the harm they can cause to humans and the environment they are usually regulated according to specific guidelines victoria epa et al 2004 nzwwa 2003 precipitation and ion exchange are used to remove heavy metals from wastewater sharma et al 2017 but these methods require high chemical dosages and complicated operating procedures thus there is some urgency to the development of a more economical process and improving environmentally sustainable treatment of wastewater that contains heavy metals eps is an important component of was they are mainly composed of proteins polysaccharides and humic substances sheng et al 2010 wingender et al 1999 eps not only forms three dimensional architectures for cell adhesion onto surface but also makes up a freely dissolved associated with microbial ecosystem services zhen et al 2009 since eps contains many anionic functional groups such as carboxy phosphate phenols and hydroxy groups it generally shows strong binding capacity for heavy metals liu et al 2001 joshi et al 2009 sharma et al 2017 eps and metals can form complexes with proteins and humic substances in eps and the toxicity of harmful chemicals like heavy metals to microorganisms in was can be alleviated through adsorption and coordination reactions of eps fractions zhen et al 2009 shou et al 2018 rozada et al 2008 reduction and rejection kang et al 2013 2017 islam et al 2004 moreover previous studies showed that cu2 bound with the oxygen atom in the carboxyl groups in eps molecules was the main mechanism of adsorption process and the binding process was proven to be exothermic and thermodynamically favorable sheng et al 2013 sludge pyrolysis is regarded as a carbon neutral sludge management process gong et al 2014 smith et al 2009 it has increasingly gained attention because it can stabilize heavy metals in the solid carbonaceous residue and convert organic fractions into renewable liquid fuels chemical raw materials and carbon yuan et al 2017 sludge based carbon sbc is widely used as an adsorbent to remove various pollutants such as dyes and heavy metals kumar et al 2017 many studies of sbc have shown that a high degree of meso porosity facilitates the uptake of dyes rio et al 2005 roazada et al 2003 found that methylene blue is effectively adsorbed by sbc and that removal efficiency is enhanced as temperature increases however sbc is less effective in removing hydrophilic organic substances that have a low n octanol water partition coefficient k ow and small molecular substances with limited surface areas for example phenol uptake by sbc has been found to be relatively low due to the small size of the phenol molecule 0 62 nm przepiorski et al 2006 but previous studies showed that the highest phenol uptake rate for sbc was 182 mg g which indicated that a favorable surface chemistry might overcome the limitation of inadequate porosity rio et al 2005 the incorporation of transition metals might accelerate catalytic pyrolysis of was and improve the porosity of sbc and transition metals in sbc could also act as fenton like catalysts to remove various organic contaminants substances kumar et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 kaang et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 the objective of this study is to integrate heavy metals containing wastewater treatment with preparation of multi functional sbc through catalytic pyrolysis of was for removal of organic contaminants since was are rich in extracellular polymeric substances eps which has strong cation exchange capacity yu et al 2010 copper and nickel irons are adopted as the target heavy metals adsorption kinetics and efficiency of was for metals removal of them were investigated and variation of distribution and composition eps in sludge were explored by using 3d eem and eps analysis the stern volmer quenching k sv and association complex formation k a constant of heavy metals adsorption by eps were calculated through fluorescence quenching combined stern volmer experiments in order to gain a mechanistic understanding brunner emmet teller bet measurements and fourier transforming infrared spectrum ft ir are utilized to investigate the surface areas and functional groups of sbc respectively to further get the insight of the catalytic mechanisms of sbc h2o2 cu ii ni ii system x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and

malvern panalytical uk in addition the kinetics of cu ii ni ii adsorption by was are investigated with a controlled reaction time in the range 5 240 min was containing the heavy metals is dewatered by

the method of lowry peterson et al 1977 and the detailed procedure could be seen in section s1 2 of supporting information in addition the distribution and composition of eps in the sludge were analyzed using an fp 6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an emission range from 220 to 550 and an excitation range from 200 to 400 nm the spectra was recorded at a scan speed of 12 000 nm min using emission and excitation slit bandwidths by 5 nm jasco japan fluorescence quenching experiments were conducted for quantitative analysis of the metal eps interaction in the was at various heavy

sbc was produced by anaerobic pyrolysis at 600 c for 1 h in a tube furnace with temperature programming at a heating rate of 5 c min after pyrolysis the sbc was ground into fine particles for further characterization and used in wastewater treatment 2 5 characterization of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc functional groups of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc were analyzed using a thermo nicolet nexus 670 ft ir spectrophotometer thermo fisher usa the spectrophotometer was monitored in the range 4000 400 cm 1 the crystal structures of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc were analyzed using a d8 focus x ray diffractometer xrd bruker axs d8 focus germany with a diffraction angle in the range 10 80 thermogravimetric analysis of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc was performed using a sta 409 pc luxx simultaneous thermal analyzer

was observed using a cm12 transmission electron microscope tem philips netherlands with an acceleration voltage of 80 kv and magnification of 1 5 105 before tem the cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc were ultrasonically treated with absolute ethyl alcohol for 0 5 h and dried on a copper grid at room temperature the samples were then dried and coated with gold and a zeiss sigma hd scanning electron

scientific usa was used to investigate the species content and valence states of the metals in the sbc 2 6 other analytical methods concentrations of cu ii and ni ii were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in addition the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition by cu ii ni ii sbc were investigated ai et al 2016 hagelin weaver et al 2004 using the enzyme activity definition that one unit of enzyme catalyzes the activity related to the breakdown of 1 μmol of h2o2 per minute under given conditions biesinger et al 2009 the concentration of residual h2o2 in the cu ii ni ii sbc catalytic system was determined by titanium salt spectrophotometry eisenberg et al 1943 the concentration of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs was determined using a high performance liquid

agilent usa and the analytes were chromate graphically separated on a 4 6 250 mm i d column filled with 5 μm average particle size c18 packing agilent eclipse xdb c18 usa analysis was carried out

320 nm wen et al 2006 and the detailed methods for the pre preparation of the samples were provided in section s1 3 supporting information free radicals generated in the cu ii ni ii sbc h2o2 system were identified with electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr ai et al 2017 and the detailed methods for the determination was given in section s1 4 of supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 was adsorption for cu ii and ni ii removal 3 1 1 adsorption kinetics and isotherms eps in was has great impacts on the speciation and toxicity of metals in biological wastewater treatment due to their high binding capacities and the metal irons could be removed after they were bound to biopolymers in was sheng et al 2013 the influence of contact reaction time on cu ii and ni ii adsorption by was is presented in fig 1 a a fast adsorption was observed and the adsorption equilibrium reached within 90 min for both cu ii and ni ii and the maximum adsorption efficiency reached by 116 16 mg g for cu ii and 108 29 mg g for ni ii respectively moreover the heavy metals adsorption isotherm of was experiments was also investigated by choosing different initial heavy metals concentration range from 100 to 4000 mg l as shown in fig 1 b the values of q o and n were calculated using the langmuir and freundlich equations chung et al 2015 respectively and it was found that both cu ii and ni ii adsorption could be fitted better with the freundlich equation as shown in table 2 and fig s1 supporting information the results showed that cu ii was more easily to be absorbed by was with 1 n of 0 5655 which was less than that of ni ii 1 n of 0 6837 reed et al 1993 but the maximum adsorption q o of cu ii could reach at 166 39 mg g while 118 76 mg g for ni ii adsorption therefore it could be indicated that the heavy metals adsorption efficiency was determined by two factors including 1 n and q o mg g cu ii was more easily to be absorbed into was as well as higher metals adsorption into was in comparison to ni ii that was to say cu ii was more easily to be contacted with eps and exhibited stronger binding ability and capacity to eps than ni ii it was likely that the difference in atomic orbital of cu ii and ni ii resulted in distinct contact reaction rate and adsorption capacity of eps for heavy metals maki et al 1964 and the detailed reason of such phenomenon would be presented in the further discussions 3 1 2 characterization of eps in cu ii ni ii adsorption in order to determine the binding mechanisms of eps with cu ii ni ii effects of heavy metals dosage on zeta potential zp of was experiments was carried out in fig 2 it was found that the zp of was increased with increasing heavy metals dosage it was mainly related to electrostatic neutralization between heavy metals with was moreover the results showed that cu ii had more obvious impact on zp of was than ni ii indicating that cu ii had stronger binding capacity with extracellular polymeric substances eps in was than ni ii besides the eps composition have important effects on coordination of eps and transition metals and heavy metals can cause fluorescence quenching of biopolymers which can be readily and fast characterized by 3d eem shou et al 2018 hence extracellular polymeric substances eps distribution and composition under adsorption were also investigated using 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid dns assays lowry method and 3d eem characterization as shown in fig 3 and fig s2 supporting information it was obvious that two peaks were identified in 3d eem fluorescence spectra peaks at ex em of 280 370 nm and 225 335 nm were related to the tryptophan protein tpn and aromatic protein apn respectively chen et al 2003 and it was found that fluorescent intensity of protein like substances in bonding eps l eps and tb eps fractions were decreased with increasing cu ii ni ii concentrations besides as depicted in fig 3 concentrations of protein polysaccharide in tb eps and lb eps especially protein like substances were decreased under cu and ni adsorption indicating that a more compact floc structure was formed and eps was more difficult to be extracted with physical methods under this condition these results demonstrated that the interaction between bound eps especially protein like substances and heavy metals was responsible for heavy metals removal it was reported that interactions electrostatic neutralization and coordination reactions between metals and eps enhanced the binding strength of eps for microbial cells sheng et al 2013 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 consequently resulting in decrease in concentrations of both protein and polysaccharide concentration in tb eps and lb eps fractions wei et al 2017 however there was no obvious changes in s eps it was likely that the component of the s eps was mainly composed by small molecular weight substance while bonding eps was mainly associated with large molecular weight proteins jain et al 2015 and large molecular weight biopolymers had higher coordination ability for heavy metals therefore in order to get further understand of the heavy metals coordination with eps in was the stern volmer quenching k sv and association complex formation k a constant of heavy metals adsorption by eps were calculated through fluorescence quenching combined stern volmer experiments as shown in fig 4 and table 3 it was found that both of cu ii and ni ii metals coordination for apn phase was stronger than for tpn and the k sv and k a were 1 1830 0 1140 103 l mol for apn and 0 5706 0 1140 103 l mol for tpn respectively it was mainly because that the molecular weight of apn was much higher than that of tpn jain et al 2015 gill et al 1989 and heavy metals had stronger coordination capacity to larger molecular weight substances hence both of the k sv and k a of apn were higher than that of tpn furthermore based on eq 2 see in 2 3 2 fig 4 c and d showed good linear correlations between log f 0 f f and log q the number of bonding site n was 1 2781 0 7732 for cu eps complex and 0 3017 0 3307 for ni eps complex respectively the values of n is more close to 1 0 indicating a more single bonding site in eps and more heavy metals adsorption efficiency shou et al 2018 and it was found that the number bonding sites of cu eps complex was more close to 1 based on the intercept of correlation of cu ni eps complex log k a the k a of cu ii ni ii eps complex was calculated to be 2 4168 1 1177 103 l mol for apn and 2 5537 3 1208 103 l mol for tpn reconfirming that cu2 eps coordination was stronger as discussed above the cu ii adsorption in was slightly higher than ni ii adsorption hence the explanation to the different of heavy metals adsorption efficiency could be that the cu ii had stronger coordination and more bonding sites n to eps than ni ii and these two factors resulted in the changes of heavy metals adsorption by eps in was 3 2 characterization of cu ii ni ii sbc 3 2 1 morphological properties of cu ii ni ii sbc as mentioned above the cu ii and ni ii have been successfully incorporated into the was as presented in fig 5 a an obvious increase in brunner emmett teller bet surface area of cu ii ni ii sbc was observed in comparison to original was 23 33 m2 g and the bet surface area of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc were 82 79 m2 g and 73 52 m2 g respectively while the bet surface area of none metals sbc was just 54 99 m2 g table s3 in supporting information these results indicated that cu ii and ni ii adsorbed in was significantly improved surface area and porosity of sbc by functioning as pyrolytic catalysts which might play an important role in subsequent applications in water treatment and the was morphologies under sem analysis was presented in fig 5 b f it could be clearly observed that the raw was had a relatively smooth surface and loose structure seen in fig 5 b however the was showed a more compact structure by incorporating cu ii ni ii as shown in fig 5 c and e after carbonization treatment the higher degree of fragmentation on cu ii ni ii sbc surfaces could be observed in fig 5 d and f in addition as depicted in fig 6 it could be clearly observed that elemental content of cu and ni was increased obviously in cu sbc b and ni sbc c in the comparison with raw was a indicating the cu ni content in sbc was increased with the transition metals adsorption and carbonization process of was and table s1 supporting information displayed that the elemental content of cu ii and ni ii in sbc could reach at 20 57 and 4 13 using tem eds analysis respectively with the discussions above it could be indicated that cu ii and ni ii were adsorbed into was effectively and the introducing of cu ii and ni ii to was could promote the porous structure of cu ii ni ii sbc with the pyrolysis process besides tem was used to observe the changes in morphological properties of the raw was and cu ii ni ii sbc it could be seen that raw was showed a gel like structure as seen in fig 7 a and b however the more porous structure was presented in was after incorporating with cu ii and ni as shown in fig 7 c and d but was was more smooth and regular when incorporated with ni ii as displayed in fig 7 e indicating the heavy metals adsorption caused changes in microstructure of was in addition more plentiful pores were observed in both of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc after the was pyrolysis treatment as shown in fig 7 d and f and it was consistent with the results of bet analysis the presence of transition metals cu and ni in was significantly improved the porous structure of sbc with the increased porous surfaces of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc the pollutants might be more easily to be absorbed onto the surfaces and pores of sludge carbons 3 2 2 chemical properties of cu ii ni ii sbc the weight mass of materials were characterized using a thermo gravimetric analyze tga and the results were shown in fig 8 a it could be clearly observed that the mass content of was and cu ii ni ii sbc were decreased with the increasing temperature and most of h2o molecules and organics were almost decomposed when the temperature reached at 600 c moreover it was indicated that the weight of cu ii ni ii sbc increased and accounted for 46 66 and 47 77 of original sludge while was just maintained 31 04 of sludge at the temperature of 1200 c it was likely that heavy metals in the form of oxides were retained in sbc and thus resulted in the increase of carbon based materials content the xrd patterns of cu ii ni ii sbc specimens are shown in fig 8 b it can be seen that a distinct diffraction peaks appeared at 26 54 of was cu sbc and ni sbc which is likely attributed to sio2 jia et al 2008 and the chemical composition of was cu sbc and ni sbc are matched according to xrd standard card as shown in fig s3 of supporting information the results showed that 11 kinds of mineral phases were detected in was but 5 and 6 mineral phases for cu sbc and ni sbc as shown in fig s3 it can be indicated that most of minerals were converted after the carbonization process characteristic peaks of sio2 phase was clearly observed in was cu sbc and ni sbc revealing that pyrolysis had no obvious effects on the crystalline structure of sio2 in was it was noted that the characteristic peaks of copper and nickel oxides were not detected in xrd patterns thus both of them were presented as amorphous states moreover the functional groups of cu ii ni ii sbc was determined through ft ir characterization as depicted in fig 8 c and d there was no obvious differences between cu ii was ni ii was and sbc materials for raw was and cu ii ni ii was the characteristic transmittance at 3435 3429 cm 1 and 1655 1643 cm 1 detected were related to stretching brand of oh cotuguo et al 2005 in addition the sharp transmittance of the bands at 541 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibrations bands of cu h ni h bonds which were features of hydrated cuo or nio particles ardelean et al 2008 davar et al 2009 and the characteristic transmittance at 2929 2923 cm 1 and 1378 1384 cm 1 could be assigned to asymmetric and symmetric c h and c o stretching motions of organics vibrations mao et al 2008 the cu ii ni ii sbc still exhibited two characteristic stretching bands at 1655 1643 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 as same as cu ii ni ii was but the sharp transmittance intensity decreased significantly after pyrolysis treatment it was attributable to dehydration process in the high temperature pyrolysis which had removed most of h2o molecules since the characteristic transmittance at 3435 3429 cm 1 related to the h2o molecule had almost disappeared additionally fig 8 c and d presented that there was no characteristic transmittance at 2929 2923 cm 1 and 1378 1384 cm 1 existed in cu ii ni ii sbc indicating that organics were decomposed and removed after carbonization these results demonstrated that bound water and organics substances had been effectively decomposed and cu ii ni ii sbc were successfully prepared through pyrolysis process 3 3 catalytic capacity of cu ii ni ii sbc 3 3 1 17β estrogen e2 removal through cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc catalysis in this paper h2o2 decomposition kinetics by cu ii ni ii sbcs were studied in fig s4 of supporting information it was found that cu ii sbc had better catalytic performance than ni ii sbc since h2o2 decomposition per minute could achieve at 76 5 mmol l 1 with cu ii sbc but just reached at 23 8 mmol l 1 by ni ii sbc in order to further evaluate the catalytic oxidation performance in e2 degradation the e2 removal efficiency at varying conditions involving cu ii ni ii sbc adsorption a range of cu ii ni ii sbc dosage and cu ii ni ii sbc to h2o2 molar ratio as a function of initial e2 concentration 800 μg l in the presence of smp were investigated and the results were presented in fig 9 e2 adsorption in the cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc system reached at 50 58 and 52 89 fig 9 a respectively however the total removal efficiency of e2 was improved to 100 and 79 in cu sbc h2o2 and ni ii sbc h2o2 systems fig 9 b respectively both adsorption and catalytic oxidation contributed to e2 removal in cu ii ni ii sbcs h2o2 systems therefore the catalytic oxidation effect on e2 could be calculated as 50 in cu ii sbc ii h2o2 and 27 in ni ii sbc h2o2 as shown in fig 9 b besides it was found that e2 removal was slightly increased with the dosage of h2o2 as depicted in fig 9 c and d in addition effects of initial substrate e2 concentration on e2 removal efficiency was also evaluated at varying estrogens e2 concentrations in range of 0 5 mg l to 5 mg l as seen in fig s5 of supporting information and the results showed that the initial substrate concentration had more effects on ni ii sbc performance than cu ii sbc the e2 removal efficiency in ni ii sbc h2o2 system declined with the increasing concentration of e2 and the e2 removal efficiency was 33 60 at e2 concentration of 5 mg l by contract there was no obvious changes in e2 removal efficiency in cu ii sbc h2o2 system and e2 removal efficiency was stabilized at 92 08 these results demonstrated that the cu ii sbc had better performance than ni ii sbc in e2 removal 3 3 2 changes in soluble microbial products smp under fenton like oxidation in order to evaluate the changes in smp under fenton like oxidation process which presents oxidative degradation efficiency of e2 in cu ni sbcs catalyzed h2o2 systems cod removal at different reaction conditions were shown in fig 10 a it was found that both of the adsorption and catalytic oxidation treatment of sbc had no obvious impact on cod concentration however the chemical composition of smp was significantly changed after sbcs treatment according to three dimensional fluorescence analysis see in fig 10 b table s2 and fig s6 of supporting information the fluorescent peak at ex em 280nm 310 nm was related to e2 as depicted in table s2 chen et al 2003 it was found that the fluorescent intensity of e2 was decreased from 9414 0 to 4388 0 and 4905 0 with addition of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc and further decreased to 1475 0 and 1645 0 when h2o2 at the dosage of 600 mg l was added moreover the fluorescent intensity of the fulvic acid fa was decreased from 2018 0 to 1525 0 and 1566 0 in cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc system and further decreased to 329 5 and 738 9 in the presence of h2o2 likewise the fluorescent intensity of aromatic proteins apn at ex em of 225nm 335 nm and tryptophan proteins tpn at ex em of 280nm 335 nm were decreased from 2845 0 to 2830 0 1848 0 and 7593 0 to 3279 0 2977 0 in cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc system respectively and further reduced to 179 9 576 4 and 249 7 760 9 with the addition of h2o2 as depicted in table s2 it was noted that the cu ii ni ii sbc performed better in both adsorption and catalytic oxidation on removal of protein like substances apn and tpn in comparison to fa it was mainly due to that the fa was more chemically stable and resistant to oxidative treatment than proteins 3 4 mechanism of catalysis by sbc functional materials 3 4 1 active radicals measurements the esr spin trapping technique was utilized to detect the radicals generating during the reaction between h2o2 with cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc as depicted in fig 11 b there was no dmpo oh spin adducts detected in the condition of pure h2o of ni ii sbc catalytic system but dmpo oh spin adducts was detected in the same condition of cu ii sbc catalytic system as seen in fig 11 a it was likely that o2 was unstable in aqueous solution and easily rapidly decomposed into oh and the reaction rate of dmpo with oh was much faster than that of o2 radicals yin et al 2009 hence it was difficult to detect the dmpo o2 peaks although it was formed in the reaction process dikalov et al 1999 in order to further verify whether o2 was formed during the reaction process between cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc with h2o2 c4h9oh instead of h2o was used to slow down the decomposition rate of o2 radicals yu et al 2018 as depicted in fig 11 while cu ii sbc or ni ii sbc with h2o2 were reacted in c4h9oh system there was dmpo o2 spin adducts detected in both of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc catalytic systems since the oh were quenched in c4h9oh solution huvaere et al 2010 meanwhile in ch3oh system dmpo oh spin adducts could be detected in cu ii sbc h2o2 system and dmpo o2 spin adducts were observed in ni ii sbc h2o2 in aqueous solution the signal intensity of dmpo o2 was weakened in ni ii sbc h2o2 and it could not be detected in cu ii sbc h2o2 system while the signal peak of oh radical was detected in cu ii sbc h2o2 system therefore both o2 and oh radicals are responsible for e2 degradation in cu ii sbc h2o2 while only o2 radicals contributes to e2 degradation in ni ii sbc h2o2 system moreover it was reported that oh radicals were more effective than o2 radicals in the removal organic contaminants in aqueous solution yin et al 2009 guo et al 2011 the cu ii sbc performed better in catalytic oxidation than ni ii sbc in e2 degradation since there was more oh radicals generated in the system of cu ii sbc h2o2 than ni ii sbc h2o2 3 4 2 xps of cu ii ni ii sbc functional materials xps was used to characterize the valence band change of the metals in cu ii ni ii sbc to gain insight into the reaction in the cu ii ni ii sbc h2o2 process the copper in cu ii oxidation gave a shakeup satellite peak at binding energy 10 ev higher than that of cu 2p3 2 excitation which was not observed in cu ii was or cu ii sbc oxidation this figure is usually used to distinguish between cu ii and low valence copper it represents cu i and cu 0 liu et al 2012 in the spectrum shown in fig 12 a a satellite peak was observed at binding energy of 933 638 ev and the binding energy of cu 2p3 2 was split into binding energy of 932 7 and 934 88 ev after pyrolysis in the spectrum of cu ii sbc recovered from e2 decomposition experiments a satellite peak was observed at binding energy of 952 56 ev which is 17 68 ev higher than the cu2p3 2 excitation 934 88 ev and the satellite peak of binding energy for cu 2p3 2 932 7 ev decreased to 930 35 ev these results showed that cu i was formed during pyrolysis and cu ii and low valence copper were formed during e2 degradation process the valence band change of ni ii sbc was shown in fig 12 d fig 12 e and fig 12 f representing ni ii was ni ii sbc and recovered ni ii sbc after catalysis for nio the o 1s spectral component was found at 530 78 ev see fig s8 a biesinger et al 2009 suggested that a major o 1s peak was approximately 30 of total o 1s spectral area at the binding energy of 531 1ev it has been indicated that it might have been due to defects within the oxide crystal hagelin weaver et al 2004 and recent studies on oxide films grown under exposure only to o2 suggested that it was likely to have been an nio or an ni oh 2 structure biesinger et al 2009 there was a strong peak at 531 85 ev see fig s7 a which was probably the ni oh 2 structure meanwhile the satellite peak of binding energy for ni 2p3 2 was observed at 852 39 ev in fig 12 d shown as ni ii as reported in a previous study biesinger et al 2009 with a small satellite peak at 862 51 ev it is likely to be ni oh 2 when considered with the o 1s xps spectra see fig s8 the satellite peak at 852 39 ev decreased to 849 90 ev after pyrolysis and the satellite peak at 862 51 ev decreased to 860 66 ev as shown in fig 12 e the results for o 1s were shown in fig s7 b where the satellite peak observed at 531 85 ev 0 4 ev also decreased about 20 indicating pyrolysis had removed most h2o molecules and reduced ni oh 2 in order to investigate the catalysis of ni ii sbc we also analyzed the valence band changes of recovered ni ii sbc after catalytic oxidation a split peak was observed which might have been resulted from the reaction between ni ii sbc and h2o2 which significantly influenced the main ni 2p shapes however it was difficult to accurately determine the valence band changes during catalysis in the ni ii sbc h2o2 process due to the complexity of multiple splitting shake up and plasmon loss the introduction of ni ii sbc into sewage water restored the satellite peak observed at 531 85 ev as shown in fig s7 c this was due to the ni ii sbc catalysis increasing the h2o2 content of ni oh 2 as discussed above the main functional shapes of ni 2p in the catalysis were ni ii and the satellite peak of ni ii was split into more satellite peaks because of the e2 decomposition 3 4 3 the mechanisms of e2 decomposition in the cu ii ni ii sbc h2o2 process the sbc preparation and e2 degradation process could be summarized in fig 13 the was was used for cu ni containing wastewater treatment and the cu ni absorbed was was further used for the cu ni sbc preparation for estrogens removal from wastewater it was proposed that the e2 and h2o2 molecules were absorbed on the porous surface of cu ii ni ii sbc since the surfaces of cu ii ni ii sbc were rich in plentiful oxygen containing functional groups h and oh groups and the hydrogen bond interaction between h oh groups with e2 molecules made them easier to be absorbed onto the surfaces of cu ii ni ii sbc then the reaction was involved into the catalytic process the absorbed e2 was oxidized into smaller molecules by intermediate radical products of oh and o2 generated from cu ii sbc h2o2 system catalytic i or o2 radicals generated in the process of ni ii sbc catalytic ii catalyzed peroxidation based on the characterization of esr eventually degraded e2 into other by products and oh or o2 radicals could further oxidize the smaller organic molecules as well as desorption of organic molecules and h2o2 from the surfaces of cu ii ni ii sbc 4 conclusions a novel waste activated sludge was multistage utilization process that integrated the heavy metals containing wastewater treatment and preparation of sludge based carbon materials through pyrolysis was proposed in this study some conclusions can be drawn as follow the coordination reactions between cu2 ni2 and eps resulted in high heavy metal adsorption at 116 16 mg g for cu ii and 106 29 mg g for ni ii and the coordination constants k a of cu ii ni ii eps complexes were calculated to be 2 4168 1 1177 103 l mol for apn and 2 5537 3 1208 103 l mol for tpn respectively the cu ni adsorbed in was could act as catalysts of pyrolysis and significantly improve the porous structure of sbcs which is beneficial to the adsorption of pollutants onto the surfaces and pores of sludge carbons the 17β estrogen e2 removal with cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc adsorption reached at 50 58 and 52 89 and further increased to 100 and 79 with addition of h2o2 at the dosage of 600 mg l in cu ii sbc h2o2 and ni ii sbc h2o2 respectively both adsorption and oxidation were responsible for removal of e2 in wastewater esr analysis indicated that the major contributing active radicals generated in the cu ii sbc catalytic system was both of o2 and oh radicals while the main active radicals generated in the ni ii sbc catalytic system was o2 radical in addition the valence variation of cu ii sbc demonstrated that cu i formed in the pyrolysis process and cu 0 and cu i formed in the catalytic process in the existence of h2o2 however the main function of ni 2p shapes was only ni ii detected in the process of e2 degradation in terms of the valence variation of ni ii sbc analysis and the satellite peak of ni ii had splinted into several satellite peaks after the application in wastewater due to the h2o2 decomposition in conclusion this work developed an eco friendly method to recycle the wastes produced in wastewater treatment and it was a very promising in

sciences chinese academy of sciences beijing 100085 china corresponding author waste activated sludge was contains many anionic functional groups which can interact with heavy metal ions through electrostatic action and complexation reactions the transition metals adsorbed in was can catalyze sludge pyrolysis in anaerobic conditions and improve structural properties of organic matter in this work a multistage was utilization process for preparing the carbon based fenton like catalysis materials is proposed more specifically was is firstly used as an adsorbent for heavy metals cu and ni removal and then complexes are converted into heterogeneous fenton like carbon based catalysts through oxygen free pyrolysis the mechanisms of interactions between extracellular polymeric substances eps and metals are investigated and the physicochemical properties of sludge based carbons sbc are comprehensively characterized using varies techniques it is found that was is an excellent adsorbent for cu and ni removal which is mainly due to the coordination and electrostatic interactions between eps and heavy metals cu and ni adsorbed in was significantly improved the porous structure of sbc both adsorption and catalytic oxidization of cu ni sbc contribute the removal of e2 in real wastewater the e2 removal mechanism is explored by electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr analysis and it is found that both of o2 and oh radicals are responsible for e2 degradation in cu ii sbc h2o2 while o2 radicals contributes to e2 degradation in ni ii sbc h2o2 system so the former performed better than the latter in total removal of e2 besides cu ii and cu i are both formed in cu ii sbc during the oxidation process while only ni ii is found in the ni ii sbc h2o2 process confirming that different catalytic oxidation reactions are occurred in the cu ii sbc h2o2 and ni ii sbc h2o2 processes this study facilitates a great strategy to the sludge multi stage circulating utilization and a better understanding about the role of the cu ni existed in sbc during the estrogens removal process graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge was sludge based carbons sbc adsorption catalysis 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is generated during the primary treatment and subsequent biological treatment of wastewater ren et al 2004 it contains various organic and inorganic material including cells extracellular polymeric substances eps and inorganic minerals such as sio2 cao and mgo as well as many transition metals fe co as and other species which are considered as pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency gong et al 2014 was is increasingly produced around the world and the increased was production creates a huge challenges in the field of wastewater treatment engineering traditional was management and disposal techniques include aerobic and anaerobic digestion followed by landfilling fertilizer usage incineration and land application fytili et al 2008 besides anaerobic digestion has been widely used for stabilization of organic fraction of was and biogas production carrère et al 2010 however the accumulation of undesirable substances in was such as toxic contaminants and heavy metals which may subsequently enter the food chain and thus endanger human health has led to the restriction of land use of wastewater sludge in many countries yuan et al 2017 many researchers have investigated sustainable management of was treatment systems over the past decades especially in terms of safety sustainability quality recovery and cost effectiveness kelessidis et al 2012 duan et al 2012 smith et al 2009 and techniques such as combustion wet oxidation pyrolysis gasification and co combustion of was with other materials for further use as an energy source have also attracted extensive attention fytili et al 2008 heavy metals are well known to be toxic and can be accumulated in plants animals and eventually in humans because they are not removed by conventional biological decomposition treatments qi et al 2011 among the heavy metals copper arsenites nickel iron and zinc are the most common and because of the harm they can cause to humans and the environment they are usually regulated according to specific guidelines victoria epa et al 2004 nzwwa 2003 precipitation and ion exchange are used to remove heavy metals from wastewater sharma et al 2017 but these methods require high chemical dosages and complicated operating procedures thus there is some urgency to the development of a more economical process and improving environmentally sustainable treatment of wastewater that contains heavy metals eps is an important component of was they are mainly composed of proteins polysaccharides and humic substances sheng et al 2010 wingender et al 1999 eps not only forms three dimensional architectures for cell adhesion onto surface but also makes up a freely dissolved associated with microbial ecosystem services zhen et al 2009 since eps contains many anionic functional groups such as carboxy phosphate phenols and hydroxy groups it generally shows strong binding capacity for heavy metals liu et al 2001 joshi et al 2009 sharma et al 2017 eps and metals can form complexes with proteins and humic substances in eps and the toxicity of harmful chemicals like heavy metals to microorganisms in was can be alleviated through adsorption and coordination reactions of eps fractions zhen et al 2009 shou et al 2018 rozada et al 2008 reduction and rejection kang et al 2013 2017 islam et al 2004 moreover previous studies showed that cu2 bound with the oxygen atom in the carboxyl groups in eps molecules was the main mechanism of adsorption process and the binding process was proven to be exothermic and thermodynamically favorable sheng et al 2013 sludge pyrolysis is regarded as a carbon neutral sludge management process gong et al 2014 smith et al 2009 it has increasingly gained attention because it can stabilize heavy metals in the solid carbonaceous residue and convert organic fractions into renewable liquid fuels chemical raw materials and carbon yuan et al 2017 sludge based carbon sbc is widely used as an adsorbent to remove various pollutants such as dyes and heavy metals kumar et al 2017 many studies of sbc have shown that a high degree of meso porosity facilitates the uptake of dyes rio et al 2005 roazada et al 2003 found that methylene blue is effectively adsorbed by sbc and that removal efficiency is enhanced as temperature increases however sbc is less effective in removing hydrophilic organic substances that have a low n octanol water partition coefficient k ow and small molecular substances with limited surface areas for example phenol uptake by sbc has been found to be relatively low due to the small size of the phenol molecule 0 62 nm przepiorski et al 2006 but previous studies showed that the highest phenol uptake rate for sbc was 182 mg g which indicated that a favorable surface chemistry might overcome the limitation of inadequate porosity rio et al 2005 the incorporation of transition metals might accelerate catalytic pyrolysis of was and improve the porosity of sbc and transition metals in sbc could also act as fenton like catalysts to remove various organic contaminants substances kumar et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 kaang et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 the objective of this study is to integrate heavy metals containing wastewater treatment with preparation of multi functional sbc through catalytic pyrolysis of was for removal of organic contaminants since was are rich in extracellular polymeric substances eps which has strong cation exchange capacity yu et al 2010 copper and nickel irons are adopted as the target heavy metals adsorption kinetics and efficiency of was for metals removal of them were investigated and variation of distribution and composition eps in sludge were explored by using 3d eem and eps analysis the stern volmer quenching k sv and association complex formation k a constant of heavy metals adsorption by eps were calculated through fluorescence quenching combined stern volmer experiments in order to gain a mechanistic understanding brunner emmet teller bet measurements and fourier transforming infrared spectrum ft ir are utilized to investigate the surface areas and functional groups of sbc respectively to further get the insight of the catalytic mechanisms of sbc h2o2 cu ii ni ii system x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and

using emission and excitation slit bandwidths by 5 nm jasco japan fluorescence quenching experiments were conducted for quantitative analysis of the metal eps interaction in the was at various heavy

was observed using a cm12 transmission electron microscope tem philips netherlands with an acceleration voltage of 80 kv and magnification of 1 5 105 before tem the cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc were ultrasonically treated with absolute ethyl alcohol for 0 5 h and dried on a copper grid at room temperature the samples were then dried and coated with gold and a zeiss sigma hd scanning electron

scientific usa was used to investigate the species content and valence states of the metals in the sbc 2 6 other analytical methods concentrations of cu ii and ni ii were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in addition the kinetics of h2o2 decomposition by cu ii ni ii sbc were investigated ai et al 2016 hagelin weaver et al 2004 using the enzyme activity definition that one unit of enzyme catalyzes the activity related to the breakdown of 1 μmol of h2o2 per minute under given conditions biesinger et al 2009 the concentration of residual h2o2 in the cu ii ni ii sbc catalytic system was determined by titanium salt spectrophotometry eisenberg et al 1943 the concentration of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs was determined using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with a fluorescence detector fld ai et al 2017 specifically agilent lc pump series 1220 agilent ca usa was equipped with a standard auto sampler injector g4290c agilent usa and the analytes were chromate graphically separated on a 4 6 250 mm i d column filled with 5 μm average particle size c18 packing agilent eclipse xdb c18 usa analysis was carried out

320 nm wen et al 2006 and the detailed methods for the pre preparation of the samples were provided in section s1 3 supporting information free radicals generated in the cu ii ni ii sbc h2o2 system were identified with electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr ai et al 2017 and the detailed methods for the determination was given in section s1 4 of supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 was adsorption for cu ii and ni ii removal 3 1 1 adsorption kinetics and isotherms eps in was has great impacts on the speciation and toxicity of metals in biological wastewater treatment due to their high binding capacities and the metal irons could be removed after they were bound to biopolymers in was sheng et al 2013 the influence of contact reaction time on cu ii and ni ii adsorption by was is presented in fig 1 a a fast adsorption was observed and the adsorption equilibrium reached within 90 min for both cu ii and ni ii and the maximum adsorption efficiency reached by 116 16 mg g for cu ii and 108 29 mg g for ni ii respectively moreover the heavy metals adsorption isotherm of was experiments was also investigated by choosing different initial heavy metals concentration range from 100 to 4000 mg l as shown in fig 1 b the values of q o and n were calculated using the langmuir and freundlich equations chung et al 2015 respectively and it was found that both cu ii and ni ii adsorption could be fitted better with the freundlich equation as shown in table 2 and fig s1 supporting information the results showed that cu ii was more easily to be absorbed by was with 1 n of 0 5655 which was less than that of ni ii 1 n of 0 6837 reed et al 1993 but the maximum adsorption q o of cu ii could reach at 166 39 mg g while 118 76 mg g for ni ii adsorption therefore it could be indicated that the heavy metals adsorption efficiency was determined by two factors including 1 n and q o mg g cu ii was more easily to be absorbed into was as well as higher metals adsorption into was in comparison to ni ii that was to say cu ii was more easily to be contacted with eps and exhibited stronger binding ability and capacity to eps than ni ii it was likely that the difference in atomic orbital of cu ii and ni ii resulted in distinct contact reaction rate and adsorption capacity of eps for heavy metals maki et al 1964 and the detailed reason of such phenomenon would be presented in the further discussions 3 1 2 characterization of eps in cu ii ni ii adsorption in order to determine the binding mechanisms of eps with cu ii ni ii effects of heavy metals dosage on zeta potential zp of was experiments was carried out in fig 2 it was found that the zp of was increased with increasing heavy metals dosage it was mainly related to electrostatic neutralization between heavy metals with was moreover the results showed that cu ii had more obvious impact on zp of was than ni ii indicating that cu ii had stronger binding capacity with extracellular polymeric substances eps in was than ni ii besides the eps composition have important effects on coordination of eps and transition metals and heavy metals can cause fluorescence quenching of biopolymers which can be readily and fast characterized by 3d eem shou et al 2018 hence extracellular polymeric substances eps distribution and composition under adsorption were also investigated using 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid dns assays lowry method and 3d eem characterization as shown in fig 3 and fig s2 supporting information it was obvious that two peaks were identified in 3d eem fluorescence spectra peaks at ex em of 280 370 nm and 225 335 nm were related to the tryptophan protein tpn and aromatic protein apn respectively chen et al 2003 and it was found that fluorescent intensity of protein like substances in bonding eps l eps and tb eps fractions were decreased with increasing cu ii ni ii concentrations besides as depicted in fig 3 concentrations of protein polysaccharide in tb eps and lb eps especially protein like substances were decreased under cu and ni adsorption indicating that a more compact floc structure was formed and eps was more difficult to be extracted with physical methods under this condition these results demonstrated that the interaction between bound eps especially protein like substances and heavy metals was responsible for heavy metals removal it was reported that interactions electrostatic neutralization and coordination reactions between metals and eps enhanced the binding strength of eps for microbial cells sheng et al 2013 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 consequently resulting in decrease in concentrations of both protein and polysaccharide concentration in tb eps and lb eps fractions wei et al 2017 however there was no obvious changes in s eps it was likely that the component of the s eps was mainly composed by small molecular weight substance while bonding eps was mainly associated with large molecular weight proteins jain et al 2015 and large molecular weight biopolymers had higher coordination ability for heavy metals therefore in order to get further understand of the heavy metals coordination with eps in was the stern volmer quenching k sv and association complex formation k a constant of heavy metals adsorption by eps were calculated through fluorescence quenching combined stern volmer experiments as shown in fig 4 and table 3 it was found that both of cu ii and ni ii metals coordination for apn phase was stronger than for tpn and the k sv and k a were 1 1830 0 1140 103 l mol for apn and 0 5706 0 1140 103 l mol for tpn respectively it was mainly because that the molecular weight of apn was much higher than that of tpn jain et al 2015 gill et al 1989 and heavy metals had stronger coordination capacity to larger molecular weight substances hence both of the k sv and k a of apn were higher than that of tpn furthermore based on eq 2 see in 2 3 2 fig 4 c and d showed good linear correlations between log f 0 f f and log q the number of bonding site n was 1 2781 0 7732 for cu eps complex and 0 3017 0 3307 for ni eps complex respectively the values of n is more close to 1 0 indicating a more single bonding site in eps and more heavy metals adsorption efficiency shou et al 2018 and it was found that the number bonding sites of cu eps complex was more close to 1 based on the intercept of correlation of cu ni eps complex log k a the k a of cu ii ni ii eps complex was calculated to be 2 4168 1 1177 103 l mol for apn and 2 5537 3 1208 103 l mol for tpn reconfirming that cu2 eps coordination was stronger as discussed above the cu ii adsorption in was slightly higher than ni ii adsorption hence the explanation to the different of heavy metals adsorption efficiency could be that the cu ii had stronger coordination and more bonding sites n to eps than ni ii and these two factors resulted in the changes of heavy metals adsorption by eps in was 3 2 characterization of cu ii ni ii sbc 3 2 1 morphological properties of cu ii ni ii sbc as mentioned above the cu ii and ni ii have been successfully incorporated into the was as presented in fig 5 a an obvious increase in brunner emmett teller bet surface area of cu ii ni ii sbc was observed in comparison to original was 23 33 m2 g and the bet surface area of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc were 82 79 m2 g and 73 52 m2 g respectively while the bet surface area of none metals sbc was just 54 99 m2 g table s3 in supporting information these results indicated that cu ii and ni ii adsorbed in was significantly improved surface area and porosity of sbc by functioning as pyrolytic catalysts which might play an important role in subsequent applications in water treatment and the was morphologies under sem analysis was presented in fig 5 b f it could be clearly observed that the raw was had a relatively smooth surface and loose structure seen in fig 5 b however the was showed a more compact structure by incorporating cu ii ni ii as shown in fig 5 c and e after carbonization treatment the higher degree of fragmentation on cu ii ni ii sbc surfaces could be observed in fig 5 d and f in addition as depicted in fig 6 it could be clearly observed that elemental content of cu and ni was increased obviously in cu sbc b and ni sbc c in the comparison with raw was a indicating the cu ni content in sbc was increased with the transition metals adsorption and carbonization process of was and table s1 supporting information displayed that the elemental content of cu ii and ni ii in sbc could reach at 20 57 and 4 13 using tem eds analysis respectively with the discussions above it could be indicated that cu ii and ni ii were adsorbed into was effectively and the introducing of cu ii and ni ii to was could promote the porous structure of cu ii ni ii sbc with the pyrolysis process besides tem was used to observe the changes in morphological properties of the raw was and cu ii ni ii sbc it could be seen that raw was showed a gel like structure as seen in fig 7 a and b however the more porous structure was presented in was after incorporating with cu ii and ni as shown in fig 7 c and d but was was more smooth and regular when incorporated with ni ii as displayed in fig 7 e indicating the heavy metals adsorption caused changes in microstructure of was in addition more plentiful pores were observed in both of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc after the was pyrolysis treatment as shown in fig 7 d and f and it was consistent with the results of bet analysis the presence of transition metals cu and ni in was significantly improved the porous structure of sbc with the increased porous surfaces of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc the pollutants might be more easily to be absorbed onto the surfaces and pores of sludge carbons 3 2 2 chemical properties of cu ii ni ii sbc the weight mass of materials were characterized using a thermo gravimetric analyze tga and the results were shown in fig 8 a it could be clearly observed that the mass content of was and cu ii ni ii sbc were decreased with the increasing temperature and most of h2o molecules and organics were almost decomposed when the temperature reached at 600 c moreover it was indicated that the weight of cu ii ni ii sbc increased and accounted for 46 66 and 47 77 of original sludge while was just maintained 31 04 of sludge at the temperature of 1200 c it was likely that heavy metals in the form of oxides were retained in sbc and thus resulted in the increase of carbon based materials content the xrd patterns of cu ii ni ii sbc specimens are shown in fig 8 b it can be seen that a distinct diffraction peaks appeared at 26 54 of was cu sbc and ni sbc which is likely attributed to sio2 jia et al 2008 and the chemical composition of was cu sbc and ni sbc are matched according to xrd standard card as shown in fig s3 of supporting information the results showed that 11 kinds of mineral phases were detected in was but 5 and 6 mineral phases for cu sbc and ni sbc as shown in fig s3 it can be indicated that most of minerals were converted after the carbonization process characteristic peaks of sio2 phase was clearly observed in was cu sbc and ni sbc revealing that pyrolysis had no obvious effects on the crystalline structure of sio2 in was it was noted that the characteristic peaks of copper and nickel oxides were not detected in xrd patterns thus both of them were presented as amorphous states moreover the functional groups of cu ii ni ii sbc was determined through ft ir characterization as depicted in fig 8 c and d there was no obvious differences between cu ii was ni ii was and sbc materials for raw was and cu ii ni ii was the characteristic transmittance at 3435 3429 cm 1 and 1655 1643 cm 1 detected were related to stretching brand of oh cotuguo et al 2005 in addition the sharp transmittance of the bands at 541 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibrations bands of cu h ni h bonds which were features of hydrated cuo or nio particles ardelean et al 2008 davar et al 2009 and the characteristic transmittance at 2929 2923 cm 1 and 1378 1384 cm 1 could be assigned to asymmetric and symmetric c h and c o stretching motions of organics vibrations mao et al 2008 the cu ii ni ii sbc still exhibited two characteristic stretching bands at 1655 1643 cm 1 and 1051 cm 1 as same as cu ii ni ii was but the sharp transmittance intensity decreased significantly after pyrolysis treatment it was attributable to dehydration process in the high temperature pyrolysis which had removed most of h2o molecules since the characteristic transmittance at 3435 3429 cm 1 related to the h2o molecule had almost disappeared additionally fig 8 c and d presented that there was no characteristic transmittance at 2929 2923 cm 1 and 1378 1384 cm 1 existed in cu ii ni ii sbc indicating that organics were decomposed and removed after carbonization these results demonstrated that bound water and organics substances had been effectively decomposed and cu ii ni ii sbc were successfully prepared through pyrolysis process 3 3 catalytic capacity of cu ii ni ii sbc 3 3 1 17β estrogen e2 removal through cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc catalysis in this paper h2o2 decomposition kinetics by cu ii ni ii sbcs were studied in fig s4 of supporting information it was found that cu ii sbc had better catalytic performance than ni ii sbc since h2o2 decomposition per minute could achieve at 76 5 mmol l 1 with cu ii sbc but just reached at 23 8 mmol l 1 by ni ii sbc in order to further evaluate the catalytic oxidation performance in e2 degradation the e2 removal efficiency at varying conditions involving cu ii ni ii sbc adsorption a range of cu ii ni ii sbc dosage and cu ii ni ii sbc to h2o2 molar ratio as a function of initial e2 concentration 800 μg l in the presence of smp were investigated and the results were presented in fig 9 e2 adsorption in the cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc system reached at 50 58 and 52 89 fig 9 a respectively however the total removal efficiency of e2 was improved to 100 and 79 in cu sbc h2o2 and ni ii sbc h2o2 systems fig 9 b respectively both adsorption and catalytic oxidation contributed to e2 removal in cu ii ni ii sbcs h2o2 systems therefore the catalytic oxidation effect on e2 could be calculated as 50 in cu ii sbc ii h2o2 and 27 in ni ii sbc h2o2 as shown in fig 9 b besides it was found that e2 removal was slightly increased with the dosage of h2o2 as depicted in fig 9 c and d in addition effects of initial substrate e2 concentration on e2 removal efficiency was also evaluated at varying estrogens e2 concentrations in range of 0 5 mg l to 5 mg l as seen in fig s5 of supporting information and the results showed that the initial substrate concentration had more effects on ni ii sbc performance than cu ii sbc the e2 removal efficiency in ni ii sbc h2o2 system declined with the increasing concentration of e2 and the e2 removal efficiency was 33 60 at e2 concentration of 5 mg l by contract there was no obvious changes in e2 removal efficiency in cu ii sbc h2o2 system and e2 removal efficiency was stabilized at 92 08 these results demonstrated that the cu ii sbc had better performance than ni ii sbc in e2 removal 3 3 2 changes in soluble microbial products smp under fenton like oxidation in order to evaluate the changes in smp under fenton like oxidation process which presents oxidative degradation efficiency of e2 in cu ni sbcs catalyzed h2o2 systems cod removal at different reaction conditions were shown in fig 10 a it was found that both of the adsorption and catalytic oxidation treatment of sbc had no obvious impact on cod concentration however the chemical composition of smp was significantly changed after sbcs treatment according to three dimensional fluorescence analysis see in fig 10 b table s2 and fig s6 of supporting information the fluorescent peak at ex em 280nm 310 nm was related to e2 as depicted in table s2 chen et al 2003 it was found that the fluorescent intensity of e2 was decreased from 9414 0 to 4388 0 and 4905 0 with addition of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc and further decreased to 1475 0 and 1645 0 when h2o2 at the dosage of 600 mg l was added moreover the fluorescent intensity of the fulvic acid fa was decreased from 2018 0 to 1525 0 and 1566 0 in cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc system and further decreased to 329 5 and 738 9 in the presence of h2o2 likewise the fluorescent intensity of aromatic proteins apn at ex em of 225nm 335 nm and tryptophan proteins tpn at ex em of 280nm 335 nm were decreased from 2845 0 to 2830 0 1848 0 and 7593 0 to 3279 0 2977 0 in cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc system respectively and further reduced to 179 9 576 4 and 249 7 760 9 with the addition of h2o2 as depicted in table s2 it was noted that the cu ii ni ii sbc performed better in both adsorption and catalytic oxidation on removal of protein like substances apn and tpn in comparison to fa it was mainly due to that the fa was more chemically stable and resistant to oxidative treatment than proteins 3 4 mechanism of catalysis by sbc functional materials 3 4 1 active radicals measurements the esr spin trapping technique was utilized to detect the radicals generating during the reaction between h2o2 with cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc as depicted in fig 11 b there was no dmpo oh spin adducts detected in the condition of pure h2o of ni ii sbc catalytic system but dmpo oh spin adducts was detected in the same condition of cu ii sbc catalytic system as seen in fig 11 a it was likely that o2 was unstable in aqueous solution and easily rapidly decomposed into oh and the reaction rate of dmpo with oh was much faster than that of o2 radicals yin et al 2009 hence it was difficult to detect the dmpo o2 peaks although it was formed in the reaction process dikalov et al 1999 in order to further verify whether o2 was formed during the reaction process between cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc with h2o2 c4h9oh instead of h2o was used to slow down the decomposition rate of o2 radicals yu et al 2018 as depicted in fig 11 while cu ii sbc or ni ii sbc with h2o2 were reacted in c4h9oh system there was dmpo o2 spin adducts detected in both of cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc catalytic systems since the oh were quenched in c4h9oh solution huvaere et al 2010 meanwhile in ch3oh system dmpo oh spin adducts could be detected in cu ii sbc h2o2 system and dmpo o2 spin adducts were observed in ni ii sbc h2o2 in aqueous solution the signal intensity of dmpo o2 was weakened in ni ii sbc h2o2 and it could not be detected in cu ii sbc h2o2 system while the signal peak of oh radical was detected in cu ii sbc h2o2 system therefore both o2 and oh radicals are responsible for e2 degradation in cu ii sbc h2o2 while only o2 radicals contributes to e2 degradation in ni ii sbc h2o2 system moreover it was reported that oh radicals were more effective than o2 radicals in the removal organic contaminants in aqueous solution yin et al 2009 guo et al 2011 the cu ii sbc performed better in catalytic oxidation than ni ii sbc in e2 degradation since there was more oh radicals generated in the system of cu ii sbc h2o2 than ni ii sbc h2o2 3 4 2 xps of cu ii ni ii sbc functional materials xps was used to characterize the valence band change of the metals in cu ii ni ii sbc to gain insight into the reaction in the cu ii ni ii sbc h2o2 process the copper in cu ii oxidation gave a shakeup satellite peak at binding energy 10 ev higher than that of cu 2p3 2 excitation which was not observed in cu ii was or cu ii sbc oxidation this figure is usually used to distinguish between cu ii and low valence copper it represents cu i and cu 0 liu et al 2012 in the spectrum shown in fig 12 a a satellite peak was observed at binding energy of 933 638 ev and the binding energy of cu 2p3 2 was split into binding energy of 932 7 and 934 88 ev after pyrolysis in the spectrum of cu ii sbc recovered from e2 decomposition experiments a satellite peak was observed at binding energy of 952 56 ev which is 17 68 ev higher than the cu2p3 2 excitation 934 88 ev and the satellite peak of binding energy for cu 2p3 2 932 7 ev decreased to 930 35 ev these results showed that cu i was formed during pyrolysis and cu ii and low valence copper were formed during e2 degradation process the valence band change of ni ii sbc was shown in fig 12 d fig 12 e and fig 12 f representing ni ii was ni ii sbc and recovered ni ii sbc after catalysis for nio the o 1s spectral component was found at 530 78 ev see fig s8 a biesinger et al 2009 suggested that a major o 1s peak was approximately 30 of total o 1s spectral area at the binding energy of 531 1ev it has been indicated that it might have been due to defects within the oxide crystal hagelin weaver et al 2004 and recent studies on oxide films grown under exposure only to o2 suggested that it was likely to have been an nio or an ni oh 2 structure biesinger et al 2009 there was a strong peak at 531 85 ev see fig s7 a which was probably the ni oh 2 structure meanwhile the satellite peak of binding energy for ni 2p3 2 was observed at 852 39 ev in fig 12 d shown as ni ii as reported in a previous study biesinger et al 2009 with a small satellite peak at 862 51 ev it is likely to be ni oh 2 when considered with the o 1s xps spectra see fig s8 the satellite peak at 852 39 ev decreased to 849 90 ev after pyrolysis and the satellite peak at 862 51 ev decreased to 860 66 ev as shown in fig 12 e the results for o 1s were shown in fig s7 b where the satellite peak observed at 531 85 ev 0 4 ev also decreased about 20 indicating pyrolysis had removed most h2o molecules and reduced ni oh 2 in order to investigate the catalysis of ni ii sbc we also analyzed the valence band changes of recovered ni ii sbc after catalytic oxidation a split peak was observed which might have been resulted from the reaction between ni ii sbc and h2o2 which significantly influenced the main ni 2p shapes however it was difficult to accurately determine the valence band changes during catalysis in the ni ii sbc h2o2 process due to the complexity of multiple splitting shake up and plasmon loss the introduction of ni ii sbc into sewage water restored the satellite peak observed at 531 85 ev as shown in fig s7 c this was due to the ni ii sbc catalysis increasing the h2o2 content of ni oh 2 as discussed above the main functional shapes of ni 2p in the catalysis were ni ii and the satellite peak of ni ii was split into more satellite peaks because of the e2 decomposition 3 4 3 the mechanisms of e2 decomposition in the cu ii ni ii sbc h2o2 process the sbc preparation and e2 degradation process could be summarized in fig 13 the was was used for cu ni containing wastewater treatment and the cu ni absorbed was was further used for the cu ni sbc preparation for estrogens removal from wastewater it was proposed that the e2 and h2o2 molecules were absorbed on the porous surface of cu ii ni ii sbc since the surfaces of cu ii ni ii sbc were rich in plentiful oxygen containing functional groups h and oh groups and the hydrogen bond interaction between h oh groups with e2 molecules made them easier to be absorbed onto the surfaces of cu ii ni ii sbc then the reaction was involved into the catalytic process the absorbed e2 was oxidized into smaller molecules by intermediate radical products of oh and o2 generated from cu ii sbc h2o2 system catalytic i or o2 radicals generated in the process of ni ii sbc catalytic ii catalyzed peroxidation based on the characterization of esr eventually degraded e2 into other by products and oh or o2 radicals could further oxidize the smaller organic molecules as well as desorption of organic molecules and h2o2 from the surfaces of cu ii ni ii sbc 4 conclusions a novel waste activated sludge was multistage utilization process that integrated the heavy metals containing wastewater treatment and preparation of sludge based carbon materials through pyrolysis was proposed in this study some conclusions can be drawn as follow the coordination reactions between cu2 ni2 and eps resulted in high heavy metal adsorption at 116 16 mg g for cu ii and 106 29 mg g for ni ii and the coordination constants k a of cu ii ni ii eps complexes were calculated to be 2 4168 1 1177 103 l mol for apn and 2 5537 3 1208 103 l mol for tpn respectively the cu ni adsorbed in was could act as catalysts of pyrolysis and significantly improve the porous structure of sbcs which is beneficial to the adsorption of pollutants onto the surfaces and pores of sludge carbons the 17β estrogen e2 removal with cu ii sbc and ni ii sbc adsorption reached at 50 58 and 52 89 and further increased to 100 and 79 with addition of h2o2 at the dosage of 600 mg l in cu ii sbc h2o2 and ni ii sbc h2o2 respectively both adsorption and oxidation were responsible for removal of e2 in wastewater esr analysis indicated that the major contributing active radicals generated in the cu ii sbc catalytic system was both of o2 and oh radicals while the main active radicals generated in the ni ii sbc catalytic system was o2 radical in addition the valence variation of cu ii sbc demonstrated that cu i formed in the pyrolysis process and cu 0 and cu i formed in the catalytic process in the existence of h2o2 however the main function of ni 2p shapes was only ni ii detected in the process of e2 degradation in terms of the valence variation of ni ii sbc analysis and the satellite peak of ni ii had splinted into several satellite peaks after the application in wastewater due to the h2o2 decomposition in conclusion this work developed an eco friendly method to recycle the wastes produced in wastewater treatment and it was a very promising in resources utilization and the transformation of wastes to treasures acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51678546 and 41630318 and
