19370,dissolved oxygen within water column is a key variable to characterize the water quality water quality modeling has been extensively developed for decades however complex biogeochemical cycles are described using a high number of parameters hence parameters uncertainty constitutes a major problem in the application of these models sensitivity analysis allows the identification of the most influential parameters in a model and a better understanding of the governing processes this paper presents a time dependent sensitivity analysis for dissolved oxygen using morris and sobol methods combined with a functional principal components analysis for dimension reduction the aim of this study is to identify the most important parameters of c rive model in different trophic contexts and to understand the biogeochemical functioning of river systems the results indicate that the maintenance respiration of phytoplankton and the photosynthetic parameters i e photosynthetic capacity the maximal photosynthesis rate and light extinction coefficients are the most influential parameters during algal blooms when the river system becomes heterotrophic the bacterial activities moderate and high temperature and the reaeration coefficients low temperature affect the most the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water column an anthropogenic effect ship navigation on variation of dissolved oxygen concentration has been identified and the role of this anthropogenic effect evolves with hydrological and trophic conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality modeling dissolved oxygen sensitivity analysis morris method sobol method principal components analysis pca 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do within water column is one of the most important variable to characterize the metabolism of a river system odum 1956 needoba et al 2012 escoffier et al 2016 and its concentration in a river system is frequently considered as a good indicator of the water

degradation of organic matters e g downstream wastewater treatment plant engender smelling and taste problems bailey and ahmadi 2014 the first water quality model was developed by streeter and phelps 1925 it is based on do for understanding the impact of organic matters rejection on water quality of a stream then more complex biogeochemical cycles such as carbon cycle and nutrients cycles were considered in the water quality modeling over the past decades billen et al 1994 garnier et al 1995 reichert et al 2001 cox 2003a flipo 2005 vilmin 2014 do concentration within water column results from multiple processes such as respiration photosynthesis sediment oxygen demand and reaeration at air water interface cox 2003b escoffier et al 2016 vilmin et al 2016b thibodeaux et al 1994 these processes have been implemented in current water quality modeling however the complex biogeochemical cycles are described using a high number of parameters flipo 2013 the high number of parameters leads to non uniqueness issue of parameter identification namely equifinality concept beven 1989 which means that different processes can produce a same or similar effect ebel and loague 2006 therefore parameter estimation and model validation remain very difficult arhonditsis and brett 2004 hence parameters uncertainty constitutes a major problem in the validation and extrapolation capabilities of models beven 1989 polus et al 2011 sensitivity analysis sa is identified to be a necessary step in the model building process jakeman et al 2006 campolongo et al 2007 sa allows the identification of the most influential parameters in a model and a better understanding of the governing processes which permits the reduction of parameters dimensionality in the optimization saltelli et al 2000 the non influential parameters are set to a fixed value factor fixing and the other parameters should be better estimated for the reduction of model output uncertainty factor prioritisation

and whitehead 2005 some sa methods used by these authors are shown in table 1 reusser et al 2011 summarized also sa methods used in hydrology and water quality modeling in literature these studies related to do identified the sensitivity of many processes algal processes sediment oxygen demand and oxygen reaeration at air water interface however the sensitivity of water quality model in contrasted hydrological and trophic contexts has not been investigated yet in this paper a synthetic river system representing the seine is simulated by a biogeochemical model c rive for 80 h with a time step of 15 min two global sensitivity analysis gsa methods are applied to c rive model in different flow and biogeochemical conditions the screening method proposed by morris 1991 and improved by campolongo et al 2007 is widely applied in literature due to its low computational cost however since the morris method is qualitative it is usually used to reduce the number of analyzed parameters in order to apply another more subtle but more costly gsa method such as the sobol method sobol 1993 the efficiency of sobol method has been investigated by tang et al 2007b a who concluded that the sobol method yielded the most robust sensitivity rankings the objectives of this study are to identify the most influential parameters of c rive model on do concentrations within the water column improve the knowledge on the biogeochemical processes at work in different hydrological and trophic contexts in the section 2 1 and 2 2 the c rive biogeochemical model is presented followed by the description of the case study section 2 3 the parameters considered in the sa are shown in the section 2 4 the sensitivity analysis methodology is described subsequently section 2 5 for the results the morris and sobol sensitivity indices during low flow in different trophic contexts are firstly given section 3 1 and 3 2 followed by those during high flow section 3 3 the selection of influential parameters and the discussion of the parameters behavior in different contexts are presented in section 4 followed by a brief conclusion section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 biogeochemical model c rive the c rive model is a c library of the rive model which has been implemented in a few numerical programs mainly riverstrahler billen et al 1994 garnier et al 1995 and prose even 1995 even et al 1998 flipo et al 2004 2007 vilmin et al 2016a b c rive simulates the cycling of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and oxygen in river systems biogeochemical cycles are simulated with a community centered or agent based model biogeochemical processes are simulated in the water column and the sediment layer the exchanges of dissolved compounds at sediment water interface are also simulated by diffusion flipo et al 2004 particulate matter sedimentation and resuspension by the energy transferred from water flow and river navigation have been developed by even et al 2004 and calibrated by vilmin et al 2015 raimonet et al 2015 have used this model to investigate the nitrites production phytoplankton heterotrophic bacteria and nitrifying bacteria are explicitly modeled by the means of growth and mortality rates weighted by organic matter and nutrients limitation the performances of the hydro ecological model prose are well characterized in vilmin et al 2016a b 2015 concerning errors on carbon nitrogen phosphorus and oxygen a simplified schema of biogeochemical processes implemented in the c rive model is shown in fig 1 2 2 mathematical modeling of c rive the dissolved oxygen concentration

a case study which mimics the seine river has been developed fig 2 and used to identify the most sensitive parameters of c rive model it is composed of a single 100 m wide cross section representative of a 1000 m long reach two compartments namely the water column and the sediment layer are simulated the upstream and downstream concentrations are set to zero which means that the case study is a lagrangian approach allowing to follow the evolution of the water quality of a water body during its motion within the seine river system 2 3 1 hydrological and biogeochemical conditions the seine river system is characterized by a temperate climate with oceanic influence maximum and minimum water flows occur in january and august respectively vilmin et al 2016b low flow periods are characterized by a discharge of 70 m 3 s the maximum discharge of 300 m 3 s is considered for high flow periods both values are representative of the observed discharge at bougival escoffier et al 2016 according to algal blooms at bougival in 2011 fig 3 three trophic states can be distinguished during low flow periods pre bloom bloom and post bloom pre bloom with few bacteria and primary producer in the water column bloom where the phytoplankton is dominant post bloom where a large amount of heterotrophic bacteria is growing in the river system following the mortality of the algal bloom for high flow periods only one scenario is considered sediments are eroded leading to an increase of dom in the water column fig 3 all the scenarii are built based on vilmin et al 2016b simulations 2 3 2 initial conditions to determine the initial conditions describing the general situation in the seine river system we extract the biogeochemical concentrations simulated for the period 2007 2012 by vilmin et al 2016a b at bougival in the seine river fig 3 the initial biogeochemical concentrations for the case study are set to the mean concentrations over the period 2007 2012 table 2 except for the highly and moderately biodegradable dissolved organic matters d o m 1 and d o m 2 temperature phytoplankton and bacterial biomass which depend on the hydrological and trophic contexts and which are extracted from the simulated values fig 3 and summarized in table 3 2 4 parameters considered in the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of 31 parameters was analyzed table 4 including 3 physical parameters related to the reaeration at air water interface and the sediment water diffusion 7 bacterial parameters associated with respiration mortality and growth rate and 21 phytoplanktonic parameters mainly related to photosynthesis respiration mortality and growth rate these 31 parameters govern the variation of do within the water column in the c rive model we account for the reaeration process through the ship navigation k n a v i g and the wind effect k w i n d only eq 3 analyzing effect of weirs will require to set up a full hydrological model which is not the purpose of this paper and could be tackled with the prose model in future works given previous researches carried out in the framework of the piren seine program https www piren seine fr garnier et al 1995 1998 1992 even et al 1998 flipo et al 2004 2007 vilmin 2014 optimal parameter values for the seine river system are available 11 parameter variation ranges are therefore obtained applying a variation of 25 around these optimum values table 4 for the remaining 20 parameters variation ranges are assessed based on literature review table 4 in addition the chemical composition of organic matter is the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 redfield et al 1963 for all simulations the sedimentary processes have been calibrated and validated by vilmin et al 2015 therefore the calibrated sedimentary parameters are considered for all simulations the release of dom into water column by erosion process has been taken into account for the selected high flow period fig 3 2 5 sensitivity analysis methodology the influence of input factors x on the model output y do concentration which is a set of curves describing the variation of do over time is analyzed based on an innovative methodology fig 4 the methodology consists of three steps first the model output is a do time series which is reduced to perform a sensitivity analysis indeed sensitivity indices are usually calculated for scalar outputs obtained from objective functions such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or the root mean square error rmse deflandre et al 2006 sincock et al 2003 nossent et al 2011 to emphasize the global sensitivity of input factors in terms of the entire model output in different contexts we propose to transform the time dependent model output of do to one or several scalar values for each simulation by applying a functional principal component analysis fpca this dimensionality reduction permits to compute a composite output value for each simulation the variations of these composite values are then analyzed using the morris screening technique to identify the most sensitive input parameters finally the non influential parameters are set to a fixed value and a variance decomposition based method the sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 is performed on the identified parameters 2 5 1 dimensionality reduction temporal sensitivity is usually calculated for the overall model performance over a period of time objective functions e g the root mean square error rmse of model outputs or the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse deflandre et al 2006 nossent et al 2011 sincock et al 2003 other authors evaluate the mean sum max of the model output directly or the model output at each time step reusser et al 2011 bailey and ahmadi 2014 by contrast the calibration is not the objective of this paper our objective is rather to identify the parameters that are the most influential on the variation of do during the time of the experiment therefore we use a functional principal components analysis fpca to transform the model output pca is a factorial method that reduces the data dimensionality with a controlled loss of information wold et al 1987 in our case the data are the multiple model outputs obtained from the differing model parameters for each scenario the fpca leads to a decomposition of the model outputs in terms of uncorrelated vectors called principal components pc the model output time series are represented by a linear combination of pc the coefficients of the linear combination are then considered for the sa we use the function prcomp in r r core team 2014 to compute the pc and select m fig 4c components which summarize at least 99 of the total model output variance in the fpca framework each principal component summarizes a temporal feature each simulation can be transformed into m values corresponding to the orthogonal projection of each model output times series onto the m principal directions components as these values summarize most of the total variability of the simulated data they can be employed for sa since the principal components are uncorrelated an indicator for sa is defined as the sum of the projected data of each simulation this indicator is used in the subsequent sensitivity analysis where a scalar is required as an output lamboni et al 2011 2 5 2 morris method the morris method morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 is a screening technique based on a discretization of the input parameters in n levels the most used and simplest screening design is called one at a time oat experiments where each parameter varies one after another the morris method performs r oat designs and measures the relative variation of the model output e elementary effect in this paper the model output is summarized by the indicator built from the pca each parameter x i i 1 p is randomly selected in the input space and the variation direction is also random the repetition r times oat allows the scanning of the full input space in practice the space of input parameters is normalized on 0 1 further we assume that the input parameters are uniformly distributed in the input space since each oat design provides p elementary effects one per parameter via p 1 points in the input space the cost of the morris method is r p 1 for r oat designs to assess the sensitivity of the input factors two indices are computed μ and σ let us denote the model function f with parameter set x and e j i the elementary effect of parameter x j for the i th repetition j 1 p and i 1 r e j i is defined as 12 e j i f x δ e j f x δ where δ is a value chosen in 1 n 1 1 1 n 1 by the user n is the number of discretization levels e j is a vector of the canonical basis for any x j selected in the input space x δ e j is always in the input space campolongo et al 2007 recommend that δ equals n 2 n 1 the indices are calculated as follows μ j 1 r i 1 r e j i mean of the absolute values of the elementary effects σ j 1 r i 1 r e j i 1 r i 1 r e j i 2 standard deviation of the elementary effects μ j estimates the overall impact of the parameter x j on the model output and σ measures the non linear and or interaction effects with other parameters to interpret the sensitivity indices μ j and σ j we draw the scatter plot μ j σ the morris method allows the classification of the parameters in three types parameters having negligible effects with small μ and σ parameters having non linear effects and or interactions with other parameters with large μ and σ parameters having linear and additive effects with large μ and small σ the morris method is adapted to models with large number of parameters it allows the reduction of the number of parameters factor fixing discarding those with negligible effects in order to use subsequently other more subtle but more costly sa methods like sobol sensitivity analysis 2 5 3 the sobol sensitivity analysis the sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 saltelli 2002 saltelli et al 2010 is based on the decomposition of the output model variance it can be used for non linear and non monotonic models and functions consider a model represented by the function 13 y f x f x 1 x p where y is the model output here dissolved oxygen concentration and x x 1 x p is the parameter set of the model it is possible to present this model by a sum of elementary functions 14 f x f 0 i 1 p f i x i i 1 p 1 j i 1 p f i j x i x j f 1 p x 1 x p if the parameters of the model x 1 x p are mutually independent and each elementary function is square integrable with a zero mean eq 15 then f 0 is the expectation of the model output y and this decomposition is unique sobol 1993 15 0 1 f i 1 i s x i 1 x i k d x i k 0 k 1 s i 1 i s 1 p the total unconditional variance of the model output y is defined as 16 v y ω p f 2 x d x f 0 2 where ω p is the space of input parameters with p dimensions the variance of each elementary function called partial variance is calculated as 17 v i 1 i s 0 1 0 1 f i 1 i s 2 x i 1 x i s d x i 1 d x i s where 1 i 1 i s p and s 1 p under the hypothesis that the input parameters are mutually independent the total unconditional variance is equal to the sum of the partial variances 18 v y i 1 p v i x i i 1 p 1 j i 1 p v i j x i x j v 1 p x 1 x p the sobol s indices are determined by the ratio of the partial variances to the total unconditional variance first order index s i v i v second order index s i j v i j v total index s t i s i j i s i j s 1 p the first order index s i indicates the individual variance contribution of the parameter x i to the total unconditional variance called also the main effect the second order index s i j explains the interaction effect between parameters x i and x j the global impact of parameter x i including the main effect and all its interactions with other parameters is given by the total index s t i if the sum of all first order indices is less than 1 the model is non additive 2 6 simulation setting and computational cost to avoid the nutrient limitation of biogeochemical processes the case study is simulated for 80 h with a time step of 15 min the mass balance is calculated every hour for the morris method each parameter range is discretized in 25 n levels and a grid jump of 13 n n 2 n 1 is used according to a test of the number of oat repetitions not shown here we repeat 1000 r times oat designs which is sufficient to obtain a stable result this repetition results in 32000 r p 1 1000 31 1 model evaluations the 17 parameters identified by the morris method are then analyzed by applying the sobol sensitivity analysis for the sobol sensitivity analysis a sample size n of 20000 is selected demanding 380000 n p 2 20000 17 2 simulations to calculate the first order and total sensitivity indices this sample size is also suitable to ensure the convergence of sensitivity index values the sensitivity indices are computed by a python package salib herman and usher 2017 the output of salib gives also the 95 confidence intervals estimated by bootstrap analysis with a resample size of 100 efron and tibshirani 1993 to decrease the computational cost a parallel computing code in python has been developed and coupled to c rive the duration of the computations is 20 min for the morris method and 4 h for the sobol sensitivity analysis with 12 processors intel r xeon r e5 2430 with a frequency of 2 50 ghz 3 results in the following paragraphs the morris method and the sobol s sensitivity analysis results are presented first the results of morris method in three trophic contexts over the low flow periods are shown section 3 1 the subsequent section section 3 2 describes the outcome of sobol sensitivity analysis over the low flow periods finally the results of sensitivity analysis during the high flow period are presented section 3 3 3 1 results of the morris method over the low flow periods 3 1 1 pre bloom during low flow in a pre bloom configuration the maximum growth rate of bacteria μ m a x h b the bacterial growth yield y h b the rate of bacteria mortality m o r t h b the optimal temperature for bacteria growth t o p t h b and the reaeration coefficient related to navigation k n a v i g are the most influential parameters fig 5 a concerning the phytoplanktonic parameters the most influential is the photosynthetic capacity α p p but its effect remains negligible for pre bloom scenario 8 sensitive parameters are identified using μ μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b k n a v i g k w i n d σ h b and v s e d h b see table 4 and section 2 2 for the definition for these parameters the most influential parameters are related to bacterial activity 6 parameters are related to bacteria and two are physical 3 1 2 bloom during a bloom parameters related to maintenance respiration r m p p and photosynthesis the photosynthetic capacity α p p the maximum algal photosynthesis rate p m a x p p the light extinction coefficients η c h l a p p and η w a t e r are the most significant parameters fig 5b the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p is as important as the light extinction coefficients the maximal growth rate μ m a x p p and mortality rate m o r t p p are insensitive in contrast to the pre bloom scenario the bacterial parameters and reaeration coefficients are less important during algal blooms the most influential bacterial parameter is the maximal growth rate μ m a x h b for bloom scenario 11 parameters are assumed to be sensitive r m p p p m a x p p α p p η c h l a p p c c h l a p p η w a t e r k n a v i g v s e d p p m o r t p p μ m a x h b and t o p t p p see table 4 and section 2 2 for the definition for these parameters 8 parameters are related to the phytoplankton two are physical parameters and only one is bacterial 3 1 3 post bloom interestingly under post bloom conditions fig 5c the same parameter distribution is observed as under pre bloom conditions the most sensitive parameters are μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b and k n a v i g no phytoplanktonic parameter has a significant effect on the variation of do in water column for post bloom scenario parameters identified are exactly the same as in pre bloom context μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b k n a v i g t o p t h b k w i n d σ h b and v s e d h b see table 4 for the definition for these parameters 6 parameters are related to bacteria and 2 to physical processes 3 1 4 the σ and μ thresholds the morris method allows the classification of the parameters in three types according to the values of σ and μ however it is usually difficult to determine the σ and μ thresholds the next section illustrates the consistency between the morris method and sobol sensitivity analysis figs 5 7 according to the parameters selected the σ and μ thresholds can be determined σ 5 μ 5 for the definition of the three areas which defines the importance and independency of each parameter see definition in section 2 5 2 those values are reported on each morris figure to ease their readability figs 5 and 7a further studies on river water quality models should be carried out to assess the universality of those values 3 2 results of the sobol sensitivity analysis over the low flow period 17 parameters are selected using the morris method among which 9 are related to phytoplankton 6 to bacteria and 2 to oxygen reaeration at the air water interface the other parameters are set to their reference value table 4 fig 6 presents the first order left and the total sensitivity indices right of sobol method the parameters are ranked by total sensitivity index s t i only the most sensitive parameters for each trophic state are shown 3 2 1 pre bloom the result of sobol sensitivity analysis for the pre bloom fig 6a indicates that the maximal growth rate for bacteria μ m a x h b is the most sensitive parameter which represents 46 of the variance of the model output s t i among which 26 is caused by the variation of μ m a x h b itself s i in other words the maximal growth rate for bacteria has an important interaction with other parameters 18 respectively the parameter ranked second is the bacterial growth yield y h b with a global impact of 35 fig 6a all bacterial parameters μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b and t o p t h b show an interaction effect s i s t i while the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g has an independent effect shown also by the morris method fig 5a the sum of all first order indices s i is less than 1 0 751 table a1 which indicates that the c rive module is not additive as can be expected for a complex environmental model the phytoplanktonic parameters have no significant influence on the variation of do concentration for pre bloom conditions the photosynthetic capacity α p p has a total sensitivity index less than 0 005 3 2 2 bloom the maintenance respiration r m p p represents 27 of the total unconditional variance of the model output followed by the photosynthetic capacity α p p with a contribution of 25 fig 6b however the energetic cost of growth r μ p p has no significant influence on the variation of do the consumption of do by phythoplankton is mainly used to support and maintain life processes within cells of organisms the third ranked parameter is the maximal photosynthesis rate with a contribution of 22 p m a x p p 19 of the variance of the simulated do result from the variation of the light extinction coefficients 11 for η c h l a p p and 8 for η w a t e r respectively the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p is also sensitive 11 the photosynthetic parameters α p p p m a x p p η and c c h l a p p account for more than 70 of the variance of the simulated do during a bloom the photosynthesis and respiration are the most important processes governing the do concentration during a bloom as can be expected the bacterial processes have no significant influence on the model output albeit the interactions between parameters are lesser during a bloom than during a pre bloom they are not negligible for α p p and p m a x p p 3 2 3 post bloom after a bloom the parameter ranking is the same as the one for pre bloom conditions the maximal growth rate μ m a x h b is the most influential parameter with a 43 contribution of the variance of the model output fig 5c the second ranked parameter is bacterial growth yield y h b with a 24 individual contribution and 7 of interactions with other parameters like pre bloom configuration the river system is heterotrophic the growth mortality and respiration processes of bacteria mainly control the do concentration within water column the values of the first order indices for bacterial parameters are less than the values of the total sensitivity indices s i s t i which proves the existence of parameter interactions however the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g has an independent effect s i s t i fig 6c which is consistent with the result of the morris method fig 5c 3 3 sensitivity analysis results during high flow period during high flow period the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g becomes the most significant parameter with a contribution of 51 to the variance of simulated do fig 7b s t furthermore the equality between the first index and the total index of k n a v i g indicates a linear effect of the reaeration coefficient k w i n d behaves the same way with a 7 contribution to the variance of simulated do the second ranked parameter is the bacterial growth yield y h b s t 27 the optimal temperature for bacteria growth t o p t h b and the maximum growth rate of bacteria μ m a x h b are also sensitive 16 and 12 respectively like the pre bloom and post bloom configurations the phytoplanktonic parameters have no significant influence on the variation of simulated do the sensitive parameters identified here are similar to those selected in pre bloom and post bloom conditions however the parameter ranking is different especially the two reaearation coefficients k n a v i g and k w i n d under high flow period this result highlights the importance of oxygen reaeration mostly controlled by human activities navigation during winter 3 4 selection of the most sensitive parameters of the c rive model we select the parameters summarizing at least 95 of the total unconditional variance of the model output for various trophic and hydrological conditions the results are presented by the polygon blue area in the figs 6 and 7 to summarize the results we distinguish two contrasted parameter selections bloom fig 6b and no bloom fig 6a c and 7b during a bloom 7 parameters are selected among which 6 parameters are related to phytoplankton and one to the optical properties of pure water r m p p α p p p m a x p p η c h l a p p c c h l a p p η w a t e r and t o p t p p and see table 4 for the definition for these parameters out of algal blooms 6 parameters can summarize more than 95 of the total variance of the model output for all conditions μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b k n a v i g and k w i n d in contrast to a bloom 2 parameters are related to oxygen reaeration and 4 to bacterial activities no phytoplantonic parameter is sensitive in conclusion 13 parameters are identified as most sensitive for c rive model 4 discussion 4 1 parameters behavior during an algal bloom during an algal bloom the maintenance respiration r m p p and the photosynthetic parameters α p p p m a x p p η c h l a p p η w a t e r are the most sensitive the bacterial and oxygen reaeration parameters have no significant effects on the variation of do concentration this outcome can be interpreted by the fact that phytoplankton metabolism is dominant and the river system is autotrophic during an algal bloom a recent study on the seine river metabolism points out that the autotrophic respiration ar contributes significantly to the ecosystem respiration er during phytoplankton bloom escoffier et al 2016 the algal respiration has been identified as the most important process during summer months by bailey and ahmadi 2014 bierman et al 1994 and cox and whitehead 2005 who mentioned the sensitivity of oxygen depletion to algal respiration we confirm this statement in our study furthermore our study highlights that the consumption of do by phythoplankton is mainly used to support and maintain life processes within cells of organisms r m p p but not by the energetic cost of the growth r μ p p eq 10 the sensitivity of photosynthetic parameters indicates that the primary productivity is the main control on do concentration during algal bloom as already mentioned by bierman et al 1994 for the mississippi river united states furthermore the light limitation on primary production in the seine river system has been reported in the literature garnier et al 2001 bierman et al 1994 also stated that dissolved oxygen concentrations appear very sensitive to changes in underwater light attenuation these studies are consistent with the sensitivity of the light extinction coefficients η c h l a p p and η w a t e r in this paper the light extinction coefficient related to suspended solid η s s p p is completely insensitive in the case of the seine river which carries few sediments with respect to large rivers delmas et al 2012 during algal blooms light availability is therefore mainly controlled by chl a concentration and not by suspended solid concentration the sensitivity of the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p is due to a strong coupling between light attenuation and chl a concentration eq 9 as the ratio of carbon to chl a widely varies and depends on species and physiological state capblancq 1982 it constitutes a factor of uncertainty in biogeochemical modeling 4 2 parameters behavior out of a algal bloom during low flow periods without algal bloom the depletion of do is mainly due to bacterial respiration as the river system is heterotrophic according to the do mass balance derived from our simulations with reference parameters the sediment oxygen demand accounts for 23 of do depletion within the water column for post bloom conditions and 37 for the pre bloom configuration these proportions are consistent with the recent study on seine river benthic dynamics carried out by vilmin et al 2016b who concluded that benthic respiration accounts for one third of the total river respiration during low flow period however no significant effect of the diffusion coefficient at the sediment water interface d s has been found in this paper indeed the benthic flux is not only controlled by d s but also by the difference of do concentrations between the water column and the sediment layer in other words controlled by the bacterial parameters μ m a x h b y h b and m o r t h b etc to summarize the effect of the sediment demand on the do in the water column cox and whitehead 2005 deflandre et al 2006 is related to the bacterial dynamics and growth in the sediment layer during high flow period the oxygen reaeration becomes the most influential process due to low water temperatures and high water velocity the variation of reaeration coefficients contributes to more than 60 of the simulated do variance fig 7b although the oxygen reaeration has been identified as one of the most influential processes for several studies cox and whitehead 2005 deflandre et al 2006 bailey and ahmadi 2014 we point out that the main control on water reaeration is the navigation k n a v i g and not the mixing due to the wind k w i n d therefore water reaeration is mostly controlled by human activities whatever the hydrological and trophic conditions figs 6 and 7b 4 3 impact of the temperature on sa as stated previously post bloom and high flow simulations are sensitive to the same parameters with a different ranking the reaeration being the most sensitive for high flow while the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is the most sensitive for post bloom the difference between those two simulations relies on the discharge and the water temperature in oder to discriminate between those forcings we simulate the post bloom and the high flow over a wide range of ambient temperatures fig 8 the total sensitivity indices for each temperature are calculated and normalized to 100 the cumulation of the total normalized sensitivity indices s t versus temperature are placed in fig 8 for 6 parameters the sensitivity of do to parameters exhibits the same dependency on water temperature for the post bloom and high flow scenarios at low temperature t 6 c the most sensitive parameter is the navigation reaeration k n a v i g while it is the maximal bacterial growth rate μ m a x h b for temperature above 15 c between 8 c and 15 c the bacterial parameters are the most sensitive without a clear dominance of one over the others 4 4 recommendations for water quality modeling although the effect of the oxygen reaeration rate is already recognized cox and whitehead 2005 deflandre et al 2006 bailey and ahmadi 2014 the reaeration process requires further investigation especially the anthropogenic effect such as navigation should be considered in water quality models used for low temperature simulations t 6 c during algal bloom this paper shows that the maintenance respiration r m p p is far more important than the energetic cost for growth r μ p p in terms of autotrophic respiration ar therefore we recommend to describe the algal respiration at least with two end members r m p p and r μ p p for water quality modeling the sensitivity of the c rive model to the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p shows the necessity of representing this ratio in water quality modeling explicitly this should improve the capabilities of the models to simulate changing conditions such as cso combined sewer overflows and their impact on the river system 5 conclusions in this investigation the aim was to study the parameters sensitivity of the c rive biogeochemical model in different trophic and hydrological contexts the time dependent sensitivity analysis is realized using morris method and sobol method combined with a fpca in general it can be concluded that the morris method and sobol sensitivity analysis combined with fpca are efficient methods to understand the behavior of the model parameters and improve the knowledge on the model processes this paper points out that the sensitivity analysis results depend on the trophic and hydrological states it also emphasizes the usefulness of performing sensitivity analysis on long temporal averages of model outputs 6 phytoplanktonic parameters and one physical parameter represents 95 of the do variance during a bloom 4 bacterial parameters and 2 reaeration coefficients have been identified as most influential out of algal bloom during a algal bloom the maintenance respiration of phytoplankton r m p p and the photosynthetic parameters α p p p m a x p p η c h l a p p and η w a t e r are the most important parameters the results of pre bloom scenario are similar to those obtained under post bloom scenario the 4 bacterial parameters μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b and one reaeration coefficient k n a v i g are the most sensitive out of algal bloom the water temperature plays an important role on the parameter ranking at low temperatures t 6 c the reaeration coefficients are the most sensitive while the bacterial activities are dominant at moderate and high water temperatures the difference between bloom and no bloom is mainly due to algal biomass hence it is necessary to perform sensitivity analysis including boundary conditions upstream concentrations rejection of wastewater treatment plants etc an anthropogenic effect ship navigation on variation of do has been identified and the role of this anthropogenic effect evolves

19370,dissolved oxygen within water column is a key variable to characterize the water quality water quality modeling has been extensively developed for decades however complex biogeochemical cycles are described using a high number of parameters hence parameters uncertainty constitutes a major problem in the application of these models sensitivity analysis allows the identification of the most influential parameters in a model and a better understanding of the governing processes this paper presents a time dependent sensitivity analysis for dissolved oxygen using morris and sobol methods combined with a functional principal components analysis for dimension reduction the aim of this study is to identify the most important parameters of c rive model in different trophic contexts and to understand the biogeochemical functioning of river systems the results indicate that the maintenance respiration of phytoplankton and the photosynthetic parameters i e photosynthetic capacity the maximal photosynthesis rate and light extinction coefficients are the most influential parameters during algal blooms when the river system becomes heterotrophic the bacterial activities moderate and

contrasted hydrological and trophic contexts has not been investigated yet in this paper a synthetic river system representing the seine is simulated by a biogeochemical model c rive for 80 h with a time step of 15 min two global sensitivity analysis gsa methods are applied to c rive model in different flow and biogeochemical conditions the screening method proposed by morris 1991 and improved by campolongo et al 2007 is widely applied in literature due to its low computational cost however since the morris method is qualitative it is usually used to reduce the number of analyzed parameters in order to apply another more subtle but more costly gsa method such as the sobol method sobol 1993 the efficiency of sobol method has been investigated by tang et al 2007b a who concluded that the sobol method yielded the most robust sensitivity rankings the objectives of this study are to identify the most influential parameters of c rive model on do concentrations within the water column

a case study which mimics the seine river has been developed fig 2 and used to identify the most sensitive parameters of c rive model it is composed of a single 100 m wide cross section representative of a 1000 m long reach two compartments namely the water column and the sediment layer are simulated the upstream and downstream concentrations are set to zero which means that the case study is a lagrangian approach allowing to follow the evolution of the water quality of a water body during its motion within the seine river system 2 3 1 hydrological and biogeochemical conditions the seine river system is characterized by a temperate climate with oceanic influence maximum and minimum water flows occur in january and august respectively vilmin et al 2016b low flow periods are characterized by a discharge of 70 m 3 s the maximum discharge of 300 m 3 s is considered for high flow periods both values are representative of the observed discharge at bougival escoffier et al 2016 according to algal blooms at bougival in 2011 fig 3 three trophic states can be distinguished during low flow periods pre bloom bloom and post bloom pre bloom with few bacteria and primary producer in the water column bloom where the phytoplankton is dominant post bloom where a large amount of heterotrophic bacteria is growing in the river system following the mortality of the algal bloom for high flow periods only one scenario is considered sediments are eroded leading to an increase of dom in the water column fig 3 all the scenarii are built based on vilmin et al 2016b simulations 2 3 2 initial conditions to determine the initial conditions describing the general situation in the seine river system we extract the biogeochemical concentrations simulated for the period 2007 2012 by vilmin et al 2016a b at bougival in the seine river fig 3 the initial biogeochemical concentrations for the case study are set to the mean concentrations over the period 2007 2012

contexts and which are extracted from the simulated values fig 3 and summarized in table 3 2 4 parameters considered in the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of 31 parameters was analyzed table 4 including 3 physical parameters related to the reaeration at air water interface and the sediment water diffusion 7 bacterial parameters associated with respiration mortality and growth rate and 21 phytoplanktonic parameters mainly related to photosynthesis respiration mortality and growth rate these 31 parameters govern the variation of do within the water column in the c rive model we account for the reaeration process through the ship navigation k n a v i g and the wind effect k w i n d only eq 3 analyzing effect of weirs will require to set up a full hydrological model which is not the purpose of this paper and could be tackled with the prose model in future works given previous researches carried out in the framework of the piren seine program https www piren seine fr garnier et al 1995 1998 1992 even et al 1998 flipo et al 2004 2007 vilmin 2014 optimal parameter values for the seine river system are available 11 parameter variation ranges are therefore obtained applying a variation of 25 around these optimum values table 4 for the remaining 20 parameters variation ranges are assessed based on literature review table 4 in addition the chemical composition of organic matter is the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 redfield et al 1963 for all simulations the sedimentary processes have been calibrated and validated by vilmin et al 2015 therefore the calibrated sedimentary parameters are considered for all simulations the release of dom into water column by erosion process has been taken into account for the selected high flow period fig 3 2 5 sensitivity analysis methodology the influence of input factors x on the model output y do concentration which is a set of curves describing the variation of do over time is analyzed based on an innovative methodology fig 4 the methodology consists of three steps first the model output is a do time series which is reduced to perform a sensitivity analysis indeed sensitivity indices are usually calculated for scalar outputs obtained from objective functions such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or the root mean square error rmse deflandre et al 2006 sincock et al 2003 nossent et al 2011 to emphasize the global sensitivity of input factors in terms of the entire model output in different contexts we propose to transform the time dependent model output of do to one or several scalar values for each simulation by applying a functional principal component analysis fpca this dimensionality reduction permits to compute a composite output value for each simulation the variations of these composite values are then analyzed using the morris screening technique to identify the most sensitive input parameters finally the non influential parameters are set to a fixed value and a variance decomposition based method the sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 is performed on the identified parameters 2 5 1 dimensionality reduction temporal sensitivity is usually calculated for the overall model performance over a period of time objective functions e g the root mean square error rmse of model outputs or the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse deflandre et al 2006 nossent et al 2011 sincock et al 2003 other authors evaluate the mean sum max of the model output directly or the model output at each time step reusser et al 2011 bailey and ahmadi 2014 by contrast the calibration is not the objective of this paper our objective is rather to identify the parameters that are the most influential on the variation of do during the time of the experiment therefore we use a functional principal components analysis fpca to transform the model output pca is a factorial method that reduces the data dimensionality with a controlled loss of information wold et al 1987 in our case the data are the multiple model outputs obtained from the differing model parameters for each scenario the fpca leads to a decomposition of the model outputs in terms of uncorrelated vectors called principal components pc the model output time series are represented by a linear combination of pc the coefficients of the linear combination are then considered for the sa we use the function prcomp in r r core team 2014 to compute the pc and select m fig 4c components which summarize at least 99 of the total model output variance in the fpca framework each principal component summarizes a temporal feature each simulation can be transformed into m values corresponding to the orthogonal projection of each model output times series onto the m principal directions components as these values summarize most of the total variability of the simulated data they can be employed for sa since the principal components are uncorrelated an indicator for sa is defined as the sum of the projected data of each simulation this indicator is used in the subsequent sensitivity analysis where a scalar is required as an output lamboni et al 2011 2 5 2 morris method the morris method morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 is a screening technique based on a discretization of the input parameters in n levels the most used and simplest screening design is called one at a time oat experiments where each parameter varies one after another the morris method performs r oat designs and measures the relative variation of the model output e elementary effect in this paper the model output is summarized by the indicator built from the pca each parameter x i i 1 p is randomly selected in the input space and the variation direction is also random the repetition r times oat allows the scanning of the full input space in practice the space of input parameters is normalized on 0 1 further we assume that the input parameters are uniformly distributed in the input space since each oat design provides p elementary effects one per parameter via p 1 points in the input space the cost of the morris method is r p 1 for r oat designs to assess the sensitivity of the input factors two indices are computed μ and σ let us denote the model function f with parameter set x and e j i the elementary effect of parameter x j for the i th repetition j 1 p and i 1 r e j i is defined as 12 e j i f x δ e j f x δ where δ is a value chosen in 1 n 1 1 1 n 1 by the user n is the number of discretization levels e j is a vector of the canonical basis for any x j selected in the input space x δ e j is always in the input space campolongo et al 2007 recommend that δ equals n 2 n 1 the indices are calculated as follows μ j 1 r i 1 r e j i mean of the absolute values of the elementary effects σ j 1 r i 1 r e j i 1 r i 1 r e j i 2 standard deviation of the elementary effects μ j estimates the overall impact of the parameter x j on the model output and σ measures the non linear and or interaction effects with other parameters to interpret the sensitivity indices μ j and σ j we draw the scatter plot μ j σ the morris method allows the classification of the parameters in three types parameters having negligible effects with small μ and σ parameters having non linear effects and or interactions with other parameters with large μ and σ parameters having linear and additive effects with large μ and small σ the morris method is adapted to models with large number of parameters it allows the reduction of the number of parameters factor fixing discarding those with negligible effects in order to use subsequently other more subtle but more costly sa methods like sobol sensitivity analysis 2 5 3 the sobol sensitivity analysis the sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 saltelli 2002 saltelli et al 2010 is based on the decomposition of the output model variance it can be used for non linear and non monotonic models and functions consider a model represented by the function 13 y f x f x 1 x p where y is the model output here dissolved oxygen concentration and x x 1 x p is the parameter set of the model it is possible to present this model by a sum of elementary functions 14 f x f 0 i 1 p f i x i i 1 p 1 j i 1 p f i j x i x j f 1 p x 1 x p if the parameters of the model x 1 x p are mutually independent and each elementary function is square integrable with a zero mean eq 15 then f 0 is the expectation of the model output y and this decomposition is unique sobol 1993 15 0 1 f i 1 i s x i 1 x i k d x i k 0 k 1 s i 1 i s 1 p the total unconditional variance of the model output y is defined as 16 v y ω p f 2 x d x f 0 2 where ω p is the space of input parameters with p dimensions the variance of each elementary function called partial variance is calculated as 17 v i 1 i s 0 1 0 1 f i 1 i s 2 x i 1 x i s d x i 1 d x i s where 1 i 1 i s p and s 1 p under the hypothesis that the input parameters are mutually independent the total unconditional variance is equal to the sum of the partial variances 18 v y i 1 p v i x i i 1 p 1 j i 1 p v i j x i x j v 1 p x 1 x p the sobol s indices are determined by the ratio of the partial variances to the total unconditional variance first order index s i v i v second order index s i j v i j v total index s t i s i j i s i j s 1 p the first order index s i indicates the individual variance contribution of the parameter x i to the total unconditional variance called also the main effect the second order index s i j explains the interaction effect between parameters x i and x j the global impact of parameter x i including the main effect and all its interactions with other parameters is given by the total index s t i if the sum of all first order indices is less than 1 the model is non additive 2 6 simulation setting and computational cost to avoid the nutrient limitation of biogeochemical processes the case study is simulated for 80 h with a time step of 15 min the mass balance is calculated every hour for the morris method each parameter range is discretized in 25 n levels and a grid jump of 13 n n 2 n 1 is used according to a test of the number of oat repetitions not shown here we repeat 1000 r times oat designs which is sufficient to obtain a stable result this repetition results in 32000 r p 1 1000 31 1 model evaluations the 17 parameters identified by the morris method are then analyzed by applying the sobol sensitivity analysis for the sobol sensitivity analysis a sample size n of 20000 is selected demanding 380000 n p 2 20000 17 2 simulations to calculate the first order and total sensitivity indices this sample size is also suitable to ensure the convergence of sensitivity index values the sensitivity indices are computed by a python package salib herman and usher 2017 the output of salib gives also the 95 confidence intervals estimated by bootstrap analysis with a resample size of 100 efron and tibshirani 1993 to decrease the computational cost a parallel computing code in python has been developed and coupled to c rive the duration of the computations is 20 min for the morris method and 4 h for the sobol sensitivity analysis with 12 processors intel r xeon r e5 2430 with a frequency of 2 50 ghz 3 results in the following paragraphs the morris method and the sobol s sensitivity analysis results are presented first the results of morris method in three trophic contexts over the low flow periods are shown section 3 1 the subsequent section section 3 2 describes the outcome of sobol sensitivity analysis over the low flow periods finally the results of sensitivity analysis during the high flow period are presented section 3 3 3 1 results of the morris method over the low flow periods 3 1 1 pre bloom during low flow in a pre bloom configuration the maximum growth rate of bacteria μ m a x h b the bacterial growth yield y h b the rate of bacteria mortality m o r t h b the optimal temperature for bacteria growth t o p t h b and the reaeration coefficient related to navigation k n a v i g are the most influential parameters fig 5 a concerning the phytoplanktonic parameters the most influential is the photosynthetic capacity α p p but its effect remains negligible for pre bloom scenario 8 sensitive parameters are identified using μ μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b k n a v i g k w i n d σ h b and v s e d h b see table 4 and section 2 2 for the definition for these parameters the most influential parameters are related to bacterial activity 6 parameters are related to bacteria and two are physical 3 1 2 bloom during a bloom parameters related to maintenance respiration r m p p and photosynthesis the photosynthetic capacity α p p the maximum algal photosynthesis rate p m a x p p the light extinction coefficients η c h l a p p and η w a t e r are the most significant parameters fig 5b the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p is as important as the light extinction coefficients the maximal growth rate μ m a x p p and mortality rate m o r t p p are insensitive in contrast to the pre bloom scenario the bacterial parameters and reaeration coefficients are less important during algal blooms the most influential bacterial parameter is the maximal growth rate μ m a x h b for bloom scenario 11 parameters are assumed to be sensitive r m p p p m a x p p α p p η c h l a p p c c h l a p p η w a t e r k n a v i g v s e d p p m o r t p p μ m a x h b and t o p t p p see table 4 and section 2 2 for the definition for these parameters 8 parameters are related to the phytoplankton two are physical parameters and only one is bacterial 3 1 3 post bloom interestingly under post bloom conditions fig 5c the same parameter distribution is observed as under pre bloom conditions the most sensitive parameters are μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b and k n a v i g no phytoplanktonic parameter has a significant effect on the variation of do in water column for post bloom scenario parameters identified are exactly the same as in pre bloom context μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b k n a v i g t o p t h b k w i n d σ h b and v s e d h b see table 4 for the definition for these parameters 6 parameters are related to bacteria and 2 to physical processes 3 1 4 the σ and μ thresholds the morris method allows the classification of the parameters in three types according to the values of σ and μ however it is usually difficult to determine the σ and μ thresholds the next section illustrates the consistency between the morris method and sobol sensitivity analysis figs 5 7 according to the parameters selected the σ and μ thresholds can be determined σ 5 μ 5 for the definition of the three areas which defines the importance and independency of each parameter see definition in section 2 5 2 those values are reported on each morris figure to ease their readability figs 5 and 7a further studies on river water quality models should be carried out to assess the universality of those values 3 2 results of the sobol sensitivity analysis over the low flow period 17 parameters are selected using the morris method among which 9 are related to phytoplankton 6 to bacteria and 2 to oxygen reaeration at the air water interface the other parameters are set to their reference value table 4 fig 6 presents the first order left and the total sensitivity indices right of sobol method the parameters are ranked by total sensitivity index s t i only the most sensitive parameters for each trophic state are shown 3 2 1 pre bloom the result of sobol sensitivity analysis for the pre bloom fig 6a indicates that the maximal growth rate for bacteria μ m a x h b is the most sensitive parameter which represents 46 of the variance of the model output s t i among which 26 is caused by the variation of μ m a x h b itself s i in other words the maximal growth rate for bacteria has an important interaction with other parameters 18 respectively the parameter ranked second is the bacterial growth yield y h b with a global impact of 35 fig 6a all bacterial parameters μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b and t o p t h b show an interaction effect s i s t i while the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g has an independent effect shown also by the morris method fig 5a the sum of all first order indices s i is less than 1 0 751 table a1 which indicates that the c rive module is not additive as can be expected for a complex environmental model the phytoplanktonic parameters have no significant influence on the variation of do concentration for pre bloom conditions the photosynthetic capacity α p p has a total sensitivity index less than 0 005 3 2 2 bloom the maintenance respiration r m p p represents 27 of the total unconditional variance of the model output followed by the photosynthetic capacity α p p with a contribution of 25 fig 6b however the energetic cost of growth r μ p p has no significant influence on the variation of do the consumption of do by phythoplankton is mainly used to support and maintain life processes within cells of organisms the third ranked parameter is the maximal photosynthesis rate with a contribution of 22 p m a x p p 19 of the variance of the simulated do result from the variation of the light extinction coefficients 11 for η c h l a p p and 8 for η w a t e r respectively the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p is also sensitive 11 the photosynthetic parameters α p p p m a x p p η and c c h l a p p account for more than 70 of the variance of the simulated do during a bloom the photosynthesis and respiration are the most important processes governing the do concentration during a bloom as can be expected the bacterial processes have no significant influence on the model output albeit the interactions between parameters are lesser during a bloom than during a pre bloom they are not negligible for α p p and p m a x p p 3 2 3 post bloom after a bloom the parameter ranking is the same as the one for pre bloom conditions the maximal growth rate μ m a x h b is the most influential parameter with a 43 contribution of the variance of the model output fig 5c the second ranked parameter is bacterial growth yield y h b with a 24 individual contribution and 7 of interactions with other parameters like pre bloom configuration the river system is heterotrophic the growth mortality and respiration processes of bacteria mainly control the do concentration within water column the values of the first order indices for bacterial parameters are less than the values of the total sensitivity indices s i s t i which proves the existence of parameter interactions however the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g has an independent effect s i s t i fig 6c which is consistent with the result of the morris method fig 5c 3 3 sensitivity analysis results during high flow period during high flow period the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g becomes the most significant parameter with a contribution of 51 to the variance of simulated do fig 7b s t furthermore the equality between the first index and the total index of k n a v i g indicates a linear effect of the reaeration coefficient k w i n d behaves the same way with a 7 contribution to the variance of simulated do the second ranked parameter is the bacterial growth yield y h b s t 27 the optimal temperature for bacteria growth t o p t h b and the maximum growth rate of bacteria μ m a x h b are also sensitive 16 and 12 respectively like the pre bloom and post bloom configurations the phytoplanktonic parameters have no significant influence on the variation of simulated do the sensitive parameters identified here are similar to those selected in pre bloom and post bloom conditions however the parameter ranking is different especially the two reaearation coefficients k n a v i g and k w i n d under high flow period this result highlights the importance of oxygen reaeration mostly controlled by human activities navigation during winter 3 4 selection of the most sensitive parameters of the c rive model we select the parameters summarizing at least 95 of the total unconditional variance of the model output for various trophic and hydrological conditions the results are presented by the polygon blue area in the figs 6 and 7 to summarize the results we distinguish two contrasted parameter selections bloom fig 6b and no bloom fig 6a c and 7b during a bloom 7 parameters are selected among which 6 parameters are related to phytoplankton and one to the optical properties of pure water r m p p α p p p m a x p p η c h l a p p c c h l a p p η w a t e r and t o p t p p and see table 4 for the definition for these parameters out of algal blooms 6 parameters can summarize more than 95 of the total variance of the model output for all conditions μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b k n a v i g and k w i n d in contrast to a bloom 2 parameters are related to oxygen reaeration and 4 to bacterial activities no phytoplantonic parameter is sensitive in conclusion 13 parameters are identified as most sensitive for c rive model 4 discussion 4 1 parameters behavior during an algal bloom during an algal bloom the maintenance respiration r m p p and the photosynthetic parameters α p p p m a x p p η c h l a p p η w a t e r are the most sensitive the bacterial and oxygen reaeration parameters have no significant effects on the variation of do concentration this outcome can be interpreted by the fact that phytoplankton metabolism is dominant and the river system is autotrophic during an algal bloom a recent study on the seine river metabolism points out that the autotrophic respiration ar contributes significantly to the ecosystem respiration er during phytoplankton bloom escoffier et al 2016 the algal respiration has been identified as the most important process during summer months by bailey and ahmadi 2014 bierman et al 1994 and cox and whitehead 2005 who mentioned the sensitivity of oxygen depletion to algal respiration we confirm this statement in our study furthermore our study highlights that the consumption of do by phythoplankton is mainly used to support and maintain life processes within cells of organisms r m p p but not by the energetic cost of the growth r μ p p eq 10 the sensitivity of photosynthetic parameters indicates that the primary productivity is the main control on do concentration during algal bloom as already mentioned by bierman et al 1994 for the mississippi river united states furthermore the light limitation on primary production in the seine river system has been reported in the literature garnier et al 2001 bierman et al 1994 also stated that dissolved oxygen concentrations appear very sensitive to changes in underwater light attenuation these studies are consistent with the sensitivity of the light extinction coefficients η c h l a p p and η w a t e r in this paper the light extinction coefficient related to suspended solid η s s p p is completely insensitive in the case of the seine river which carries few sediments with respect to large rivers delmas et al 2012 during algal blooms light availability is therefore mainly controlled by chl a concentration and not by suspended solid concentration the sensitivity of the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p is due to a strong coupling between light attenuation and chl a concentration eq 9 as the ratio of carbon to chl a widely varies and depends on species and physiological state capblancq 1982 it constitutes a factor of uncertainty in biogeochemical modeling 4 2 parameters behavior out of a algal bloom during low flow periods without algal bloom the depletion of do is mainly due to bacterial respiration as the river system is heterotrophic according to the do mass balance derived from our simulations with reference parameters the sediment oxygen demand accounts for 23 of do depletion within the water column for post bloom conditions and 37 for the pre bloom configuration these proportions are consistent with the recent study on seine river benthic dynamics carried out by vilmin et al 2016b who concluded that benthic respiration accounts for one third of the total river respiration during low flow period however no significant effect of the diffusion coefficient at the sediment water interface d s has been found in this paper indeed the benthic flux is not only controlled by d s but also by the difference of do concentrations between the water column and the sediment layer in other words controlled by the bacterial parameters μ m a x h b y h b and m o r t h b etc to summarize the effect of the sediment demand on the do in the water column cox and whitehead 2005 deflandre et al 2006 is related to the bacterial dynamics and growth in the sediment layer during high flow period the oxygen reaeration becomes the most influential process due to low water temperatures and high water velocity the variation of reaeration coefficients contributes to more than 60 of the simulated do variance fig 7b although the oxygen reaeration has been identified as one of the most influential processes for several studies cox and whitehead 2005 deflandre et al 2006 bailey and ahmadi 2014 we point out that the main control on water reaeration is the navigation k n a v i g and not the mixing due to the wind k w i n d therefore water reaeration is mostly controlled by human activities whatever the hydrological and trophic conditions figs 6 and 7b 4 3 impact of the temperature on sa as stated previously post bloom and high flow simulations are sensitive to the same parameters with a different ranking the reaeration being the most sensitive for high flow while the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is the most sensitive for post bloom the difference between those two simulations relies on the discharge and the water temperature in oder to discriminate between those forcings we simulate the post bloom and the high flow over a wide range of ambient temperatures fig 8 the total sensitivity indices for each temperature are calculated and normalized to 100 the cumulation of the total normalized sensitivity indices s t versus temperature are placed in fig 8 for 6 parameters the sensitivity of do to parameters exhibits the same dependency on water temperature for the post bloom and high flow scenarios at low temperature t 6 c the most sensitive parameter is the navigation reaeration k n a v i g while it is the maximal bacterial growth rate μ m a x h b for temperature above 15 c between 8 c and 15 c the bacterial parameters are the most sensitive without a clear dominance of one over the others 4 4 recommendations for water quality modeling although the effect of the oxygen reaeration rate is already recognized cox and whitehead 2005 deflandre et al 2006 bailey and ahmadi 2014 the reaeration process requires further investigation especially the anthropogenic effect such as navigation should be considered in water quality models used for low temperature simulations t 6 c during algal bloom this paper shows that the maintenance respiration r m p p is far more important than the energetic cost for growth r μ p p in terms of autotrophic respiration ar therefore we recommend to describe the algal respiration at least with two end members r m p p and r μ p p for water quality modeling the sensitivity of the c rive model to the ratio of carbon to chl a c c h l a p p shows the necessity of representing this ratio in water quality modeling explicitly this should improve the capabilities of the models to simulate changing conditions such as cso combined sewer overflows and their impact on the river system 5 conclusions in this investigation the aim was to study the parameters sensitivity of the c rive biogeochemical model in different trophic and hydrological contexts the time dependent sensitivity analysis is realized using morris method and sobol method combined with a fpca in general it can be concluded that the morris method and sobol sensitivity analysis combined with fpca are efficient methods to understand the behavior of the model parameters and improve the knowledge on the model processes this paper points out that the sensitivity analysis results depend on the trophic and hydrological states it also emphasizes the usefulness of performing sensitivity analysis on long temporal averages of model outputs 6 phytoplanktonic parameters and one physical parameter represents 95 of the do variance during a bloom 4 bacterial parameters and 2 reaeration coefficients have been identified as most influential out of algal bloom during a algal bloom the maintenance respiration of phytoplankton r m p p and the photosynthetic parameters α p p p m a x p p η c h l a p p and η w a t e r are the most important parameters the results of pre bloom scenario are similar to those obtained under post bloom scenario the 4 bacterial parameters μ m a x h b y h b m o r t h b t o p t h b and one reaeration coefficient k n a v i g are the most sensitive out of algal bloom the water temperature plays an important role on the parameter ranking at low temperatures t 6 c the reaeration coefficients are the most sensitive while the bacterial activities are dominant at moderate and high water temperatures the difference between bloom and no bloom is mainly due to algal biomass hence it is necessary to perform sensitivity analysis including boundary conditions upstream concentrations rejection of wastewater treatment plants etc an anthropogenic effect ship navigation on variation of do has been identified and the role of this anthropogenic effect evolves

19371,water scarcity is becoming one of the largest problems worldwide agricultural reuse of wastewater has been considered a valuable and reliable alternative alleviating the pressure on freshwater resources in arid and semi arid regions such as the middle east inadequate microbial quality of treated wastewater is a challenge for developing countries which limits agricultural reuse of wastewater this study assessed the impact of irrigation with secondary treated wastewater stww on soil properties as well as the safety of various types of crops as compared with tap water tw irrigation through a furrow system total and fecal coliforms and escherichia coli were monitored as indicator bacteria in stww irrigated soil and harvested crops the presence of pathogenic e coli o157 salmonella and shigella was also monitored in all samples using a combination of culture and molecular methods the microbial quality of wastewater in terms of e coli concentration 4 18 log mpn 100 ml failed to meet the world health organization who recommendation for irrigation of root and leafy crops 103 and 104 e coli per 100 ml for root and leafy crops respectively no significant effects on physicochemical properties of the soil irrigated with stww was found in comparison with control plots except for electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar which were slightly higher in stww soil samples although the microbial quality of soil was affected by stww irrigation a relatively low concentration of e coli was detected in soil no microbial contamination in terms of e coli was found on harvested maize and onion e coli contamination of lettuce and spring onion was found for both irrigation schemes no stww soil or crop samples were found positive for pathogenic bacteria according to the analyzed parameters stww could be safely used as an alternative source for irrigation of root and leafy crops graphical abstract image keywords wastewater irrigation microbial quality decay physicochemical characteristics soil 1 introduction fresh water scarcity is one of the greatest environmental challenges in the 21st century and is caused in part by an uneven distribution of available water resources around the world becerra castro et al 2015 jasim et al 2016 as a consequence 40 of the total land area is classified as arid semi arid and dry sub humid becerra castro et al 2015 several factors including population growth surface water and groundwater pollution droughts and climate changes are expected to increase stress on water sources in many regions of the world in the future decades it is estimated that more than 40 of the world s population will face water stress or scarcity within the next few decades with significant impact on socio economic water and food security becerra castro et al 2015 elgallal et al 2016 who 2006 iran with an average annual precipitation less than one third of the global average 250 mm is located in one of the most arid regions in the world is facing a serious and protracted water crisis it is anticipated that the level of water resources in iran will decrease from 2025 to 816 m3 per capita from 1990 to 2025 jasim et al 2016 lehane 2014 the agricultural sector with about 70 of the total water usage is the largest user of freshwater worldwide becerra castro et al 2015 elgallal et al 2016 jasim et al 2016 in some of the countries in the middle east such as iran more than 90 of the total water withdrawal is used for agricultural activities jasim et al 2016 lehane 2014 as the communities are increasingly facing water scarcity wastewater reuse is becoming an essential and reliable component of integrated and sustainable water resource management worldwide especially in arid and semi arid areas in other words the growing water shortage and its impact on water and food security emphasize the necessity for wastewater reuse as a valuable water resource for agricultural activities becerra castro et al 2015 elgallal et al 2016 irrigation with wastewater has many economic and environmental benefits such as reduction of utilization of natural water resources reduction of chemical fertilizer usage protection of aquatic ecosystems from contamination and improvement of crop yield due to nutrient delivery however it may also result in environmental and health problems irrigation with wastewater may alter the physicochemical properties of soil and promote soil salinization salinization increases the osmotic pressure in the root zone constituting a limiting factor for the use of land for cultivation and plant growth and productivity elgallal et al 2016 salinity is evaluated via electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar which refers to infiltration problems and degree of saturation of the soil with sodium gharaibeh et al 2016 furthermore wastewater may contain pathogens that pose a threat to human health and increase the risk for bacterial parasitic and viral infections in consumers of wastewater irrigated crops bahri et al 2009 elgallal et al 2016 who 2006 several studies have assessed the microbial health risks of wastewater reuse in agricultural activities most of these studies have estimated the risk of infection based on the microbial concentration of reused wastewater without investigation into the fate of pathogenic or indicator microorganisms in the field bahri et al 2009 moazeni et al 2017 mok et al 2014 who 2006 although the microbiological characteristics of wastewater for crop irrigation is important from a public health point of view several factors potentially influence the microbial load of wastewater irrigated soil and crops and associated health risks ambient temperature and humidity rate of ultraviolet radiation soil moisture and ph antagonism with indigenous soil microorganisms method of irrigation and finally the type of plant could impact the fate and population of microorganisms in soil and on crop surfaces becerra castro et al 2015 who 2006 in the environment in particular in arid and semi arid areas uv radiation from natural sunlight could be an important factor in the process of inactivation of microorganisms bichai et al 2012 therefore for appropriate management of wastewater reuse and in order to assess the health risks associated with agricultural application of wastewater it is essential to track the fate of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms through in field experiments especially in arid and semi arid regions facing water scarcity some studies have already been published on the effect of agricultural reuse of treated municipal wastewater on the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of soil and microbial safety of the produce based on field experiments these studies reported no significant microbial effect of wastewater irrigation on crops and indicated that irrigation with treated wastewater presents no microbial risk for consumers christou et al 2014 2016 cirelli et al 2012 gatta et al 2016 li and wen 2016 lonigro et al 2016 orlofsky et al 2016 shock et al 2016 urbano et al 2017 however in most of the studies tertiary wastewater or wastewater with good microbial quality according to the world health organization who guideline 103 e coli per 100 ml who 2006 has been used through surface or subsurface drip system for crop irrigation which may be different from real field conditions in developing countries based on our knowledge very few studies have applied furrow irrigation as well as various types of crops for impact assessment of wastewater reuse lonigro et al 2016 shock et al 2016 song et al 2006 since the microbial safety of produce is affected by the type and concentration of microorganisms in wastewater climate condition irrigation method and type of plant it is crucial that the impact of wastewater reuse on soil and irrigated crops be properly evaluated through field experiments the present study was undertaken to investigate 1 the effect of irrigation with secondary treated municipal wastewater in comparison with tap water on the microbial quality of soil and crops based on in field experiments 2 the influence of environmental factors including ultraviolet index ambient temperature soil moisture and ph on e coli die off in soil 3 the effect of application of wastewater on the physicochemical properties of soil and 4 the microbial quality and safety of four types of crops including spring onion and onion as root crops maize as a fast growing crop and lettuce as a high risk concern leafy vegetable mok et al 2014 in a semi arid area that is facing a water crisis 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental field description the experiment was conducted in an open site of

central part of iran isfahan with a semi arid climate has an average annual temperature of 16 7 c and an average annual rainfall of 130 mm year climate parameters were recorded during the experimental period 2 2 experimental design in order to assess the effect of various parameters in the reuse of wastewater for agriculture the experiment was carried out over two consecutive cropping seasons from july to november 2016 cycle 1 for cultivation of lettuce and maize as summer crops and from december 2016 to june 2017 cycle 2 for cultivation of spring onion and onion as winter crops according to the common practice used in the study region the experimental design was based on the randomized use of two water qualities secondary treated wastewater stww and tap water tw three types of plants lettuce and maize in cycle 1 and onion in cycle 2 were used each in three replications as presented in fig 1 each plot comprised 7 5 m2 2 5 m 3 m and consisted of three rows with a distance of 0 4 m seeds of lettuce and maize were implanted in rows with a distance of about 0 15 m and 0 2 m respectively seeds of onion were directly sown at the soil surface stww was the effluent of a municipal treatment plant after screening and grit removal primary clarification followed by activated sludge process and finally chlorination tap water was provided through the municipal water supply system with no microbial pollution for irrigation of control plots the soil was characterized as silty loam 51 silt 30 sand 19 clay a furrow irrigation system as a common practice in the study region with an irrigation volume of 0 5 m3 plot per each irrigation event was applied irrigation of plants was performed once a weak except for the first two weeks of planting in cycle 1 in which watering was performed semi weekly 2 3 collection and preparation of samples wastewater samples were collected at every watering event throughout the crop irrigation period 5 6 h wastewater samples were analyzed for the following parameters total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrogen no3 in triplicate and temperature ph ec and microbial parameters for each irrigation event soil samples were collected before start up of irrigation and at the time of harvesting of crops cycle 1 and cycle 2 a composite soil sample consisting of three subsamples was collected from each plot by an auger from the 0 20 cm topsoil layer soil samples were also collected before and after watering of the crops throughout the growing period 80 samples for this stage a completely mixed soil sample consisting of three soil samples from a plot giving a total of 9 samples per each irrigation type was taken as stww or tw irrigated soil sample all soil samples were analyzed for ph ec and microbial parameters physicochemical analysis of soil was performed on samples collected before start up of irrigation as well as samples collected at the time of harvesting in cycle 1 for microbial analysis of soil samples 25 g of sample was added to 225 ml of sterile peptone water and then homogenized for 1 h in a shaker incubator environmental agency 2004 the sample of grown produce was taken three days after the last irrigation event for lettuce and spring onion and seven days after the last irrigation for onion and maize within each plot at least five plants were randomly selected and aseptically picked using disposable gloves for each plot the edible parts of fresh plant samples were washed with tap water crushed and then composited a certain amount of each composite sample was placed in a stomacher bag mixed with sterile peptone water 1 10 w v and homogenized for 180 s in a stomacher adams and moss 2007 crop samples were analyzed for microbial parameters all samples were collected in sterile glasses or bags and immediately transferred to the laboratory for chemical and microbiological tests 2 4 physicochemical analyses the ph and ec of stww were determined using a ph meter and an electrical conductivity meter eutech instruments singapore respectively analysis of bod5 cod tss and nitrate nitrogen was performed according to standard procedures apah 2013 the physicochemical quality of the soil including porosity total nitrogen tn organic carbon oc total potassium tk total phosphorus tp available phosphorus ap cation exchange capacity cec and sodium adsorption ratio sar were analyzed as described previously abegunrin et al 2016 miller and keeney 1982 the ph and ec of soil samples were analyzed in the 1 2 soil water extract and determined as described for wastewater samples 2 5 microbial analyses samples of stww soil and crops were analyzed for microbial parameters including total coliforms tc fecal coliforms fc e coli as indicator microorganisms and e coli o157 salmonella and shigella as pathogenic bacteria the concentration of tc fc and e coli was determined by multiple tube fermentation mtf technique as described in standard methods apah 2013 the media used included lauryl tryptose broth brilliant green lactose bile broth and ec broth for tc and fc and ec mug medium for e coli for positive samples results were reported based on the most probable number mpn of detected microorganisms per 100 ml or 100 g of sample furthermore the concentration of tc and e coli in all samples was evaluated by spreading of an appropriate sample volume of dilutions depending on the bacterial load on fluorocult lmx merck germany agar plates and incubation of plates at 37 c for 24 48 h although an enzymatic assay using lmx medium has been considered a suitable alternative to the conventional method for detection of indicator bacteria nikaeen et al 2009 our investigation showed more reliable results for the mtf technique possibly due to the analysis of higher volume of samples than the spread plate method therefore all results are presented based on the mtf analysis for detection of e coli o157 in stww 100 ml of sample was added to lauryl tryptose broth ltb as described in standard methods apah 2013 for soil and crop samples 100 ml of a 10 1 homogenate sample was prepared in peptone water containing cefixime and vancomycin liquid media were incubated at 37 c for 20 24 h followed by subculture onto sorbitol macconkey smac agar plates colorless colonies on smac were subsequently transferred into ltb mug and incubated at 35 c for 18 24 h following incubation test tubes were exposed to uv light and non fluorescent tubes were suspected as e coli o157 adams and moss 2007 apah 2013 environmental agency 2004 suspected colonies were identified by polymerase chain reaction pcr assay with specific primers table 1 for detection of salmonella spp and shigella spp 200 300 ml of stww samples were concentrated by membrane filtration 0 22 μm 47 mm in diameter millipore filters were immersed in 100 ml of peptone water for soil and crop a 10 1 homogenate of sample in peptone water 250 ml was used isolation of salmonella spp and shigella spp was done by pre enrichment in peptone water for 16 20 h at 37 c followed by a selective enrichment step in selenite cysteine broth over a period of 24 h at 37 c after enrichment aliquots of the broth medium were streak plated on xylose lysine deoxycholate xld agar and salmonella shigella ss agar adams and moss 2007 apah 2013 environmental agency 2004 following incubation on selective agar media suspected colonies were confirmed and identified with cultural and biochemical tests using triple sugar iron tsi agar urea agar base and sim medium apah 2013 for final confirmation pcr using specific primers table 1 was done on the extracted dna of the isolated colonies 2 6 dna extraction and pcr for pcr analysis isolated colonies were suspended in 100 μl of deionized water and genomic dna was extracted and used in pcr assay as described by shamsizadeh et al 2017 specific primers were used for detection of salmonella shigella and e coli o157 table 1 2 7 inactivation rate of e coli in the environment e coli an important indicator of fecal pollution was chosen as a target microorganism for estimation of the inactivation rate of microorganisms in soil in plots receiving stww the decay rate of e coli was calculated by a first order decay model rogers et al 2011 ct c0 10 0 434 kt where ct is the concentration of e coli in soil samples before the watering event c0 is the e coli concentration in soil samples on the day of the watering event k is the first order decay rate coefficient and t is the time 7 days based on the time interval between the two irrigation events the average value of k was calculated and the effect of the physicochemical parameters on the decay rate was determined by correlation analysis 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed with spss 22 0 initially normality of the data was evaluated correlations between parameters were determined by spearman s correlation analysis the mann whitney test was used to evaluate the difference of physicochemical and microbial parameters in plots irrigated with the two types of water a probability p value less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results the mean annual rainfall and temperature from july 2016 to july 2017 was 90 mm and 21 c respectively 3 1 stww quality the results of physicochemical and microbial quality testing of stww in each cycle of irrigation are presented in table 2 during the study period july 2016 to july 2017 e coli was detected in 18 25 of the stww samples significant differences were observed between the amounts of fc and e coli in the two cycles being higher in cycle 2 correlation analyses indicated that air and effluent temperature had a significant effect on the concentration of e coli in stww samples salmonella shigella and e coli o157 were not found in any of the stww samples during of study period 3 2 physicochemical characteristics of soil as shown in table 3 in all of the plots the amounts of porosity sar and ec were significantly different at first before cultivation and at the end of cycle 1 ec measurement at the end of cycle 2 also showed that the average of ec was decreased to 155 and 264 for plots irrigated with tw and stww respectively the value of cec in plots irrigated with stww was significantly higher than in plots irrigated with tw the organic matters content of stww irrigated soils increased slightly after irrigation statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the values of other parameters the ph of the soil was relatively constant in all of the plots 6 5 8 and with no change upon irrigation 3 3 microbial characteristics of soil the microbiological characteristics of soil prior to cultivation and after harvesting for each cycle are presented in table 4 in soil samples taken before irrigation e coli was not detected at the end of cycle 1 only 1 6 of the soil samples irrigated with tw was e coli positive meanwhile e coli was detected in all soil samples collected after stww irrigation a significant difference between the concentrations of fc and e coli in plots irrigated with tw and stww was observed at the end of cycle 1 at the end of cycle 2 e coli was detected in 3 6 soil samples which were all irrigated with stww values of fc and e coli in stww irrigated plots were significantly higher than those for tw irrigated plots with regard to plots irrigated with stww a significant difference was observed in the concentration of indicator bacteria between the three stages table 4 the variation in microbial quality of plots before and after irrigation with tw and stww is presented in table 5 for plots irrigated with stww the concentration of e coli was significantly higher after irrigation than before irrigation after irrigation e coli was present in significantly higher concentration in plots irrigated with stww than tw irrigated plots salmonella shigella and e coli o157 were not found in any soil samples 3 4 microbial characteristics of crop samples the microbial quality of crops irrigated with the two types of water is presented in table 6 in plots irrigated with tw e coli was detected in 2 6 of lettuce samples and 1 3 of spring onion samples with a mean concentration of 827 mpn 100 g and 12 mpn 100 g respectively in plots irrigated with stww e coli was detected in 1 6 of lettuce samples and 3 3 of spring onion samples with a mean concentration of 4000 mpn 100 g and 363 mpn 100 g respectively meanwhile e coli was not detected in any maize or onion samples the mann whitney test showed a significant difference between the values of e coli tc and fc in spring onion samples of stww irrigated plots and tw irrigated plots however no statistically significant difference between the values of indicator bacteria was observed in other crops statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the values of e coli for spring onion with maize and onion samples all the crop samples were negative for salmonella shigella and e coli o157 as for the total yield no significant difference between crops irrigated with tw and stww was observed 3 5 decay of e coli and environmental parameters the average value of k was 0 27 d 1 a significantly positive correlation was found between the rate of e coli decay k with air temperature and uv index values 4 discussion 4 1 quality of secondary treated wastewater microbial examination of wastewater revealed a high concentration of indicator bacteria in stww as the mean concentration of e coli during the study period 4 3 log mpn per 100 ml was much higher than the amount recommended by the who for wastewater reuse in irrigation of root and leafy crops 103 and 104 e coli per 100 ml for root and leafy crops respectively who 2006 the results showed that in cycle 1 5 11 of the samples had a concentration higher than 104 e coli per 100 ml for lettuce irrigation however the results showed that the microbial quality of stww is appropriate for irrigation of maize as a high growing crop 105 e coli per 100 ml who 2006 in cycle 2 a higher mean concentration of indicator bacteria was detected in stww and 9 14 and 7 14 of the samples had a concentration of e coli higher than 103 and 105 per 100 ml respectively indicating that wastewater irrigation could increase the risk of enteric pathogen infections in consumers of wastewater irrigated crops even for high growing crops who 2006 a high concentration of indicator bacteria reflects low treatment plant efficiency in terms of removing such bacteria and is probably related to the absence of tertiary treatment or inefficiency of disinfection process conventional wastewater treatment processes reduce indicator bacteria by a 2 3 log which represents a concentration of 104 105 mpn 100 ml of e coli in the effluent de sanctis et al 2017 based on the who guidelines for unrestricted wastewater irrigation the permissible annual disease risk 106 daly per person per year can be achieved by a 6 7 log unit of pathogen reduction according to the rate of pathogen die off between the time of last irrigation and consumption and normal household washing of the crops a 2 and 1 log unit reduction respectively could be considered who 2006 therefore based on the concentration of e coli in the effluent a further 1 2 log reduction for stww irrigation of root and non root salad crops would be required estimation of the annual disease burden for enteroviruses in stww from two treatment plants showed mean values exceeding the guideline value recommended by who 106 daly per person per year for wastewater irrigated lettuce consumers researchers have reported a concentration of about 106 mpn 100 ml for fc in the treatment plants moazeni et al 2017 a further reduction of microorganisms could be achieved through improvement of effluent quality using appropriate disinfection methods especially uv disinfection or application of methods such as filtration and storing wastewater effluent in reservoirs a study by de sanctis et al 2017 showed that with combination of sequencing batch biofilter granular reactors and sand filtration the concentration of e coli in wastewater effluent can be reduced to 10 mpn per 100 ml the mean concentration of e coli and fc in cycle 1 was significantly less than that of cycle 2 which may be related to effects of air and effluent temperature we did not detect any e coli o157 salmonella or shigella in wastewater samples it appears that e coli o157 is generally not detected in primary and secondary wastewater effluent bitton 2011 a typical range of 102 104 cells per 100 ml of raw wastewater was reported for salmonella spp bitton 2011 in a study in trinitapoli italy most of the secondary effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant were positive for salmonella spp gatta et al 2016 however salmonella may not be detected in treated wastewater due to removal of microorganisms by treatment processes or low prevalence of clinical and subclinical salmonella infections in the community a number of studies have reported no detection of salmonella in treated municipal wastewater cirelli et al 2012 lonigro et al 2016 as shown in table 2 the average values of physicochemical parameters of wastewater effluent were acceptable in terms of crop irrigation according to fao s guidelines ayers and westcot 1985 except for the ec which presented a slight to moderate restriction for agricultural reuse of wastewater effluent the use of wastewater with high ec values is directly related to the risk of soil salinization after a long term application of wastewater urbano et al 2017 the bod value also slightly exceeded the limit set by the epa for food crops irrigation 10 mg l bod usepa 2012 however the reported bod value may not be considered a limiting factor for crop irrigation because of the agronomic potential of organic matters presented in municipal wastewater libutti et al 2018 a study by elfanssi et al 2018 showed improved soil fertility and crop productivity after irrigation with treated wastewater 4 2 soil quality although it has been reported that wastewater irrigation could increase the values of ec and sar of irrigated soil our results showed a decrease in the amounts of ec and sar in plots irrigated with stww as well as tw table 3 a notable reduction in soil ec and sar upon irrigation with tw or stww may in part be due to salt leaching as a result of irrigation christou et al 2014 however the reduction of ec in stww irrigated plots was lower than observed in tw plots which indicates the effect of wastewater irrigation on soil ec in other words more ec values in wastewater irrigated plots could be attributed to the relatively high level of wastewater ec the study by gharaibeh et al 2016 showed that sar in clay soil irrigated with treated wastewater increased over time the results of this study also showed an increase in porosity when sar and ec decreased table 3 the results of study showed that the cec of stww irrigated plots increased which may be due to slight increase of the organic matters in soil of stww irrigated plots table 3 this finding is consistent with other studies which have reported a correlation between the cec and organic matter content of soil becerra castro et al 2015 wu et al 2015 although the organic matter content of soil increased with wastewater irrigation no sinificant diference was observed between the stww and tw irrigated plots a possible explanation is that more microbial input from wastewater influences soil microbiological activity which can induce soil organic matter losses wu et al 2013 soil ph did not change during the study a similar result was reported by rusan et al 2007 after long term irrigation of soil with wastewater similar to the study of gharaibeh et al 2016 our results showed no significant influence of wastewater irrigation on essential soil nutrients the mean concentrations of e coli tc and fc were increased after irrigation in all plots table 5 this suggests that moist soil provides suitable conditions for survival of microorganisms leading to subsequent bacterial regrowth who 2006 the results showed a significantly higher concentration of e coli in wastewater irrigated plots than in tw irrigated plots during the cultivation period and at harvesting time tables 4 and 5 this difference indicates that the microbial characteristics of soil could be affected by the quality of irrigation water and that wastewater could be considered as a contamination source of soil the increased concentration of indicator bacteria in plots irrigated with stww after cycle 2 compared with cycle 1 table 4 confirms the effect of irrigation water quality on soil properties analysis of the microbial quality of wastewater in cycle 2 showed a higher concentration of indicator bacteria table 2 which could influence the microbial quality of stww irrigated soils furthermore lower air temperature and solar radiation in cycle 2 may have increased the survivability of coliform bacteria in soil e coli was also detected in the soil samples of control plots irrigated with tw tables 4 and 5 since e coli is one of the most usual microbial indicators of fecal contamination its presence in soil irrigated with tw as reported by other investigators could be due to an external environmental source of fecal contamination such as birds and or wild and domestic animals benami et al 2013 forslund et al 2012 gatta et al 2016 presence of a large number of birds in our field could be related to the e coli contamination of tw irrigated plots benami et al 2013 investigated the presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicator organisms in soil irrigated with gray water and fresh water they suggested that the type of water had no effect on the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the study by forslund et al 2012 dna fingerprints of e coli isolates from wastewater and wastewater irrigated soil did not show identical patterns which indicates fecal contamination of soil from other environmental sources such as wildlife although the results showed that the microbial quality of the soil was affected by the microbial quality of irrigation water it should be noted that a relatively low concentration of e coli was found in stww irrigated soil samples in agreement with other studies high numbers of indicator bacteria in the irrigation wastewater did not lead to accumulation of the bacteria in soil cirelli et al 2012 gatta et al 2016 orlofsky et al 2016 throughout the entire irrigation period 10 40 analyzed soil samples irrigated with stww did either not contain e coli or had a concentration of less than 5 mpn g this is in agreement with other studies in which e coli was not detected or presented with a low frequency in wastewater irrigated soils despite relatively high levels in irrigation water beneduce et al 2017 gatta et al 2016 the study by gatta et al 2016 undertaken in a mediterranean climate showed a low concentration of fc in soil irrigated with secondary effluent whereas a high concentration of fc bacteria higher than 104 cfu 100 ml was found in wastewater they also reported that fc levels in the soil were not affected by the different irrigation treatment factors certain environmental factors contribute to the survival and die off of microorganisms in soil bahri et al 2009 li and wen 2016 the results of our study showed a significant effect of ambient temperature and the value of uv index on the decay rate of e coli in soil although a 2 log reduction of microorganisms in soil was recommended for pathogens as a result of drip irrigation bahri et al 2009 our results showed an approximate one log reduction for furrow irrigation it has been reported that drip irrigation is more efficient in terms of reducing bacterial contamination compared with furrow irrigation fonseca et al 2011 several studies have evaluated the effect of different irrigation methods on the microbial quality of soil and crops the results of these studies showed that wastewater drip irrigation especially subsurface drip can effectively reduce contamination of soil and crops and consequently associated microbial health risks fonseca et al 2011 qadir et al 2010 song et al 2006 song et al 2006 found a higher concentration of microorganisms on the soil surface of furrow irrigated plots than on subsurface drip irrigated ones as anticipated no pathogenic microorganisms were detected in soil samples a study of microbial quality as analyzed by pyrosequencing revealed absence of salmonella in soil irrigated with treated wastewater ibekwe et al 2018 a study by gatta et al 2016 showed a very low frequency of salmonella spp in soil samples irrigated with secondary wastewater sww despite a high frequency of this microorganism in sww samples furthermore they found salmonella spp in tertiary wastewater irrigated soil while it was not detected in tertiary wastewater samples they concluded that the water source cannot be the only source of contamination 4 3 microbial quality of crops foodborne disease associated with consumption of contaminated produce is a main concern when using wastewater irrigation bahri et al 2009 becerra castro et al 2015 who 2006 in the present study e coli was found in only one plot of stww irrigated lettuce while all of the three plots of spring onion were contaminated by e coli however similar to sttw irrigated soil samples e coli was also detected in tw irrigated lettuce and spring onion which indicates an external environmental source of e coli contamination such as birds and rodents which were abundantly present in the experimental field gatta et al 2016 orlofsky et al 2016 consistent with our results orlofsky et al 2016 showed no significant difference in the detection of fecal indictor bacteria on tomatoes irrigated with treated wastewater as compared with tomatoes irrigated with potable water although e coli was detected at a higher frequency in spring onion samples the contamination level of lettuce was higher which may in part be related to the higher retention capacity of irrigation water and hence a higher potential for contamination mok et al 2014 who 2006 urbano et al 2017 observed contamination of tc of the same order of magnitude in lettuce samples irrigated with treated wastewater and tap water and concluded that tc on lettuce leaves could not be attributed to the use of treated wastewater li and wen 2016 detected only few counts of e coli on the leaves of asparagus lettuce irrigated with secondary sewage effluent as anticipated e coli was not detected in any of the maize samples and this is related to the type of crop growing conditions as well as contact with wastewater or irrigated soil are important factors affect the level of fecal contamination of wastewater irrigated crops forslund et al 2012 the edible part of maize maize kernels is covered by husks which protect it from contamination furthermore since it is a high growing crop the risk of contamination by wastewater irrigation is low therefore wastewater with higher microbial loads could be applied for irrigation of this type of crops as indicated by who 105 e coli per 100 ml who 2006 in the study of drip irrigation by gatta et al 2016 no artichoke heads were positive for e coli nevertheless a high concentration of e coli was found in sww although the authors detected salmonella spp in sww and irrigated soils none of the plant or artichoke head samples were positive for salmonella spp similar results were reported with regard to the microbial quality of eggplant and tomatoes drip irrigated with treated wastewater which often had an e coli content higher than the guideline limit of who cirelli et al 2012 a study by lonigro et al 2016 revealed no or very low microbial pollution of crops and soil at harvesting time in spite of the irrigation wastewater having high microbial loads 1713 and 123429 e coli cfu per 100 ml in lagoon treated wastewater and secondary treated wastewater respectively in contrast to spring onion e coli was not detected in any of the onion samples an important factor potentially related to this difference is the longer interval between the time of last irrigation and harvesting seven days li and wen 2016 reported that an irrigation interval of more than three days reduces the risk of contamination by e coli for wastewater drip irrigated soil similar results were reported by shock et al 2016 who compared drip and furrow irrigation in the transfer of e coli to dry bulb onion based on the climate condition temperature sunlight intensity humidity and type of crop a 0 5 2 log microorganism reduction per day is achievable on crop surface after the last irrigation bahri et al 2009 none of the stww irrigated soil and crop samples contained detectable e coli o157 salmonella or shigella suggesting no infection risk by these pathogens for wastewater irrigated crops lonigro et al 2016 did not detect salmonella or cryptosporidium on vegetables and soil drip irrigated with treated municipal wastewaters a notable result from our study is that the high numbers of e coli in the stww did not lead to microbial contamination of crops especially so in the case of maize and onion moreover no significant e coli contamination was found in stww irrigated lettuce although fecal contamination level of wastewater irrigated crops is affected by the direct contact with wastewater and soil forslund et al 2012 who 2006 the results of study highlight that the climate conditions of arid and semi arid areas including high temperature low humidity and sunlight intensity could effectively inactivate microorganisms in soil and on crop surfaces in other words the climate condition of our study as a semi arid region may explain the reduction of fc and e coli levels from the stww to the soil and from the soil to the plants even under furrow irrigation method the longer time of paused irrigation prior to the harvesting of onion suggests a significant impact of this control measure on the microbial quality of stww irrigated crops lonigro et al 2016 reported that the drip irrigation system weather conditions including increased exposure to uv radiation in the summer or the low temperatures in the winter and the interval time between last watering and harvesting one week could reduce the effects of wastewater on the microbial load of crops and soil overall the analysis of experimental field results confirms that stww could be used in water scarce semi arid areas as an alternative source for the crops irrigation under in field controlled conditions since furrow irrigation was used in the present study drip irrigation as a more efficient method for reducing microorganisms in soil and on crop surface becerra castro et al 2015 fonseca et al 2011 could be considered for crop irrigation levels of microbial contamination could be further reduced by applying post harvest control measures including produce disinfection and peeling bahri et al 2009 5 conclusions secondary treatment of wastewater is a common environmental management strategy used worldwide especially in developing countries however the microbial quality of such wastewater is a public health concern for irrigation of crops eaten raw the results of this study showed that the microbial quality of stww does not meet who guidelines for irrigation of root and leafy crops although the e coli concentration in stww was mostly higher than the who guideline limits that are considered safe for crop irrigation no or negligible microbial contamination of stww irrigated crops maize onion and lettuce was observed as compared with tw irrigated crops the type of crop and the employed method for irrigation are two important factors that should be considered in the reuse of wastewater in agriculture however our results showed that the climate conditions of arid and semi arid areas could effectively contribute to the inactivation of microorganisms in soil and on crop surfaces for leafy and root crops even when using the furrow irrigation method considering the climate conditions stww could be reused as a valid alternative source for irrigation of crops in water scarce middle east region if leaving enough time between last irrigation and harvesting however more study should be conducted to evaluate the fate of enteric viruses and protozoan parasites in field conditions further public health protection and reduction of potential risks could be achieved through application of in field and post harvest control measures for reducing microorganisms including drip irrigation as well as washing disinfection and peeling of produce eaten raw acknowledgement this research was supported by the vice chancellery for research at the isfahan university of medical

19371,water scarcity is becoming one of the largest problems worldwide agricultural reuse of wastewater has been considered a valuable and reliable alternative alleviating the pressure on freshwater resources in arid and semi arid regions such as the middle east inadequate microbial quality of treated wastewater is a challenge for developing countries which limits agricultural reuse of wastewater this study assessed the impact of irrigation with secondary treated wastewater stww on soil properties as well as the safety of various types of crops as compared with tap water tw irrigation through a furrow system total and fecal coliforms and escherichia coli were monitored as indicator bacteria in stww irrigated soil and harvested crops the presence of pathogenic e coli o157 salmonella and shigella was also monitored in all samples using a combination of culture and molecular methods the microbial quality of wastewater in terms of e coli concentration 4 18 log mpn 100 ml failed to meet the world health organization who recommendation for irrigation of root and leafy crops 103 and 104 e coli per 100 ml for root and leafy crops respectively no significant effects on physicochemical properties of the soil irrigated with stww was found in comparison with control plots except for electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar which were slightly higher in stww soil samples although the microbial quality of soil was affected by stww irrigation a relatively low concentration of e coli was detected in soil no microbial contamination in terms of e coli was found on harvested maize and onion e coli contamination of lettuce and spring onion was found for both irrigation schemes no stww soil or crop samples were found positive for pathogenic bacteria according to the analyzed parameters stww could be safely used as an alternative source for irrigation of root and leafy crops graphical abstract image keywords wastewater irrigation microbial quality decay physicochemical characteristics soil 1 introduction fresh water scarcity is one of the greatest environmental challenges in the 21st century and is caused in part by an uneven distribution of available water resources around the world becerra castro et al 2015 jasim et al 2016 as a consequence 40 of the total land area is classified as arid semi arid and dry sub humid becerra castro et al 2015 several factors including population growth surface water and groundwater pollution droughts and climate changes are expected to increase stress on water sources in many regions of the world in the future decades it is estimated that more than 40 of the world s population will face water stress or scarcity within the next few decades with significant impact on socio economic water and food security becerra castro et al 2015 elgallal et al 2016 who 2006 iran with an average annual precipitation less than one third of the global average 250 mm is located in one of the most arid regions in the world is facing a serious and protracted water crisis it is anticipated that the level of water resources in iran will decrease from 2025 to 816 m3 per capita from 1990 to 2025 jasim et al 2016 lehane 2014 the agricultural sector with about 70 of the total water usage is the largest user of freshwater worldwide becerra castro et al 2015 elgallal et al 2016 jasim et al 2016 in some of the countries in the middle east such as iran more than 90 of the total water withdrawal is used for agricultural activities jasim et al 2016 lehane 2014 as the communities are increasingly facing water scarcity wastewater reuse is becoming an essential and reliable component of integrated and sustainable water resource management worldwide especially in arid and semi arid areas in other words the growing water shortage and its impact on water and food security emphasize the necessity for wastewater reuse as a valuable water resource for agricultural activities becerra castro et al 2015 elgallal et al 2016 irrigation with wastewater has many economic and environmental benefits such as reduction of utilization of natural water resources reduction of chemical fertilizer usage protection of aquatic ecosystems from contamination and improvement of crop yield due to nutrient delivery however it may also result in environmental and health problems irrigation with wastewater may alter the physicochemical properties of soil and promote soil salinization salinization increases the osmotic pressure in the root zone constituting a limiting factor for the use of land for cultivation and plant growth and productivity elgallal et al 2016 salinity is evaluated via electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar which refers to infiltration problems and degree of saturation of the soil with sodium gharaibeh et al 2016 furthermore wastewater may contain pathogens that pose a threat to human health and increase the risk for bacterial parasitic and viral infections in consumers of wastewater irrigated crops bahri et al 2009 elgallal et al 2016 who 2006 several studies have assessed the microbial health risks of wastewater reuse in agricultural activities most of these studies have estimated the risk of infection based on the microbial concentration of reused wastewater without investigation into the fate of pathogenic or indicator microorganisms in the field bahri et al 2009 moazeni et al 2017 mok et al 2014 who 2006 although the microbiological characteristics of wastewater for crop irrigation is important from a public health point of view several factors potentially influence the microbial load of wastewater irrigated soil and crops and associated health risks ambient temperature and humidity rate of ultraviolet radiation soil moisture and ph antagonism with indigenous soil microorganisms method of irrigation and finally the type of plant could impact the fate and population of microorganisms in soil and on crop surfaces becerra castro et al 2015 who 2006 in the environment in particular in arid and semi arid areas uv radiation from natural sunlight could be an important factor in the process of inactivation of microorganisms bichai et al 2012 therefore for appropriate management of wastewater reuse and in order to assess the health risks associated with agricultural application of wastewater it is essential to track the fate of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms through in field experiments especially in arid and semi arid regions facing water scarcity some studies have already been published on the effect of agricultural reuse of treated municipal wastewater on the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of soil and microbial safety of the produce based on field experiments these studies reported no significant microbial effect of wastewater irrigation on crops and indicated that irrigation with treated wastewater presents no microbial risk for consumers christou et al 2014 2016 cirelli et al 2012 gatta et al 2016 li and wen 2016 lonigro et al 2016 orlofsky et al 2016 shock et al 2016 urbano et al 2017 however in most of the studies tertiary wastewater or wastewater with good microbial quality according to the world health organization who guideline 103 e coli per 100 ml who 2006 has been used through surface or subsurface drip system for crop irrigation which may be different from real field conditions in developing countries based on our knowledge very few studies have applied furrow irrigation as well as various types of crops for impact assessment of wastewater reuse lonigro et al 2016 shock et al 2016 song et al 2006 since the microbial safety of produce is affected by the type and concentration of microorganisms in wastewater climate condition irrigation method and type of plant it is crucial that the impact of wastewater reuse on soil and irrigated crops be properly evaluated through field experiments the present study was undertaken to investigate 1 the effect of irrigation with secondary treated municipal wastewater in comparison with tap water on the microbial quality of soil and crops based on in field experiments 2 the influence of environmental factors including ultraviolet index ambient temperature soil moisture and ph on e coli die off in soil 3 the effect of application of wastewater on the physicochemical properties of soil and 4 the microbial quality and safety of four types of crops including spring onion and onion as root crops maize as a fast growing crop and lettuce as a high risk concern leafy vegetable mok et al 2014 in a semi arid area that is facing a water crisis 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental field description the experiment was conducted in an open site of a wastewater treatment plant which had not already been used for agricultural activity the wastewater treatment plant was located in isfahan 32 37ʹ 6 024ʺ n 51 43ʹ 38 983ʺ w elevation 1564 8 m in the central part of iran isfahan with a semi arid climate has an average annual temperature of 16 7 c and an average annual rainfall of 130 mm year climate parameters were recorded during the experimental period 2 2 experimental design in order to assess the effect of various parameters in the reuse of wastewater for agriculture the experiment was carried out over two consecutive cropping seasons from july to november 2016 cycle 1 for cultivation of lettuce and maize as summer crops and from december 2016 to june 2017 cycle 2 for cultivation of spring onion and onion as winter crops according to the common practice used in the study region the experimental design was based on the randomized use of two water qualities secondary treated wastewater stww and tap water tw three types of plants lettuce and maize in cycle 1 and onion in cycle 2 were used each in three replications as presented in fig 1 each plot comprised 7 5 m2 2 5 m 3 m and consisted of three rows with a distance of 0 4 m seeds of lettuce and maize were implanted in rows with a distance of about 0 15 m and 0 2 m respectively seeds of onion were directly sown at the soil surface stww was the effluent of a municipal treatment plant after screening and grit removal primary clarification followed by activated sludge process and finally chlorination tap water was provided through the municipal water supply system with no microbial pollution for irrigation of control plots the soil was characterized as silty loam 51 silt 30 sand 19 clay a furrow irrigation system as a common practice in the study region with an irrigation volume of 0 5 m3 plot per each irrigation event was applied irrigation of plants was performed once a weak except for the first two weeks of planting in cycle 1 in which watering was performed semi weekly 2 3 collection and preparation of samples wastewater samples were collected at every watering event throughout the crop irrigation period 5 6 h wastewater samples were analyzed for the following parameters total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrogen no3 in triplicate and temperature ph ec and microbial parameters for each irrigation event soil samples were collected before start up of irrigation and at the time of harvesting of crops cycle 1 and cycle 2 a composite soil sample consisting of three subsamples was collected from each plot by an auger from the 0 20 cm topsoil layer soil samples were also collected before and after watering of the crops throughout the growing period 80 samples for this stage a completely mixed soil sample consisting of three soil samples from a plot giving a total of 9 samples per each irrigation type was taken as stww or tw irrigated soil sample all soil samples were analyzed for ph ec and microbial parameters physicochemical analysis of soil was performed on samples collected before start up of irrigation as well as samples collected at the time of harvesting in cycle 1 for microbial analysis of soil samples 25 g of sample was added to 225 ml of sterile peptone water and then homogenized for 1 h in a shaker incubator environmental agency 2004 the sample of grown produce was taken three days after the last irrigation event for lettuce and spring onion and seven days after the last irrigation for onion and maize within each plot at least five plants were randomly selected and aseptically picked using disposable gloves for each plot the edible parts of fresh plant samples were washed with tap water crushed and then composited a certain amount of each composite sample was placed in a stomacher bag mixed with sterile peptone water 1 10 w v and homogenized for 180 s in a stomacher adams and moss 2007 crop samples were analyzed for microbial parameters all samples were collected in sterile glasses or bags and immediately transferred to the laboratory for chemical and microbiological tests 2 4 physicochemical analyses the ph and ec of stww were determined using a ph meter and an electrical conductivity meter eutech instruments singapore respectively analysis of bod5 cod tss and nitrate nitrogen was performed according to standard procedures apah 2013 the physicochemical quality of the soil including porosity total nitrogen tn organic carbon oc total potassium tk total phosphorus tp available phosphorus ap cation exchange capacity cec and sodium adsorption ratio sar were analyzed as described previously abegunrin et al 2016 miller and keeney 1982 the ph and ec of soil samples were analyzed in the 1 2 soil water extract and determined as described for wastewater samples 2 5 microbial analyses samples of stww soil and crops were analyzed for microbial parameters including total coliforms tc fecal coliforms fc e coli as indicator microorganisms and e coli o157 salmonella and shigella as pathogenic bacteria the concentration of tc fc and e coli was determined by multiple tube fermentation mtf technique as described in standard methods apah 2013 the media used included lauryl tryptose broth brilliant green lactose bile broth and ec broth for tc and fc and ec mug medium for e coli for positive samples results were reported based on the most probable number mpn of detected microorganisms per 100 ml or 100 g of sample furthermore the concentration of tc and e coli in all samples was evaluated by spreading of an appropriate sample volume of dilutions depending on the bacterial load on fluorocult lmx merck germany agar plates and incubation of plates at 37 c for 24 48 h although an enzymatic assay using lmx medium has been considered a suitable alternative to the conventional method for detection of indicator bacteria nikaeen et al 2009 our investigation showed more reliable results for the mtf technique possibly due to the analysis of higher volume of samples than the spread plate method therefore all results are presented based on the mtf analysis for detection of e coli o157 in stww 100 ml of sample was added to lauryl tryptose broth ltb as described in standard methods apah 2013 for soil and crop samples 100 ml of a 10 1 homogenate sample was prepared in peptone water containing cefixime and vancomycin liquid media were incubated at 37 c for 20 24 h followed by subculture onto sorbitol macconkey smac agar plates colorless colonies on smac were subsequently transferred into ltb mug and incubated at 35 c for 18 24 h following incubation test tubes were exposed to uv light and non fluorescent tubes were suspected as e coli o157 adams and moss 2007 apah 2013 environmental agency 2004 suspected colonies were identified by polymerase chain reaction pcr assay with specific primers table 1 for detection of salmonella spp and shigella spp 200 300 ml of stww samples were concentrated by membrane filtration 0 22 μm 47 mm in diameter millipore filters were immersed in 100 ml of peptone water for soil and crop a 10 1 homogenate of sample in peptone water 250 ml was used isolation of salmonella spp and shigella spp was done by pre enrichment in peptone water for 16 20 h at 37 c followed by a selective enrichment step in selenite cysteine broth over a period of 24 h at 37 c after enrichment aliquots of the broth medium were streak plated on xylose lysine deoxycholate xld agar and salmonella shigella ss agar adams and moss 2007 apah 2013 environmental agency 2004 following incubation on selective agar media suspected colonies were confirmed and identified with cultural and biochemical tests using triple sugar iron tsi agar urea agar base and sim medium apah 2013 for final confirmation pcr using specific primers table 1 was done on the extracted dna of the isolated colonies 2 6 dna extraction and pcr for pcr analysis isolated colonies were suspended in 100 μl of deionized water and genomic dna was extracted and used in pcr assay as described by shamsizadeh et al 2017 specific primers were used for detection of salmonella shigella and e coli o157 table 1 2 7 inactivation rate of e coli in the environment e coli an important indicator of fecal pollution was chosen as a target microorganism for estimation of the inactivation rate of microorganisms in soil in plots receiving stww the decay rate of e coli was calculated by a first order decay model rogers et al 2011 ct c0 10 0 434 kt where ct is the concentration of e coli in soil samples before the watering event c0 is the e coli concentration in soil samples on the day of the watering event k is the first order decay rate coefficient and t is the time 7 days based on the time interval between the two irrigation events the average value of k was calculated and the effect of the physicochemical parameters on the decay rate was determined by correlation analysis 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed with spss 22 0 initially normality of the data was evaluated correlations between parameters were determined by spearman s correlation analysis the mann whitney test was used to evaluate the difference of physicochemical and microbial parameters in plots irrigated with the two types of water a probability p value less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results the mean annual rainfall and temperature from july 2016 to july 2017 was 90 mm and 21 c respectively 3 1 stww quality the results of physicochemical and microbial quality testing of stww in each cycle of irrigation are presented in table 2 during the study period july 2016 to july 2017 e coli was detected in 18 25 of the stww samples significant differences were observed between the amounts of fc and e coli in the two cycles being higher in cycle 2 correlation analyses indicated that air and effluent temperature had a significant effect on the concentration of e coli in stww samples salmonella shigella and e coli o157 were not found in any of the stww samples during of study period 3 2 physicochemical characteristics of soil as shown in table 3 in all of the plots the amounts of porosity sar and ec were significantly different at first before cultivation and at the end of cycle 1 ec measurement at the end of cycle 2 also showed that the average of ec was decreased to 155 and 264 for plots irrigated with tw and stww respectively the value of cec in plots irrigated with stww was significantly higher than in plots irrigated with tw the organic matters content of stww irrigated soils increased slightly after irrigation statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the values of other parameters the ph of the soil was relatively constant in all of the plots 6 5 8 and with no change upon irrigation 3 3 microbial characteristics of soil the microbiological characteristics of soil prior to cultivation and after harvesting for each cycle are presented in table 4 in soil samples taken before irrigation e coli was not detected at the end of cycle 1 only 1 6 of the soil samples irrigated with tw was e coli positive meanwhile e coli was detected in all soil samples collected after stww irrigation a significant difference between the concentrations of fc and e coli in plots irrigated with tw and stww was observed at the end of cycle 1 at the end of cycle 2 e coli was detected in 3 6 soil samples which were all irrigated with stww values of fc and e coli in stww irrigated plots were significantly higher than those for tw irrigated plots with regard to plots irrigated with stww a significant difference was observed in the concentration of indicator bacteria between the three stages table 4 the variation in microbial quality of plots before and after irrigation with tw and stww is presented in table 5 for plots irrigated with stww the concentration of e coli was significantly higher after irrigation than before irrigation after irrigation e coli was present in significantly higher concentration in plots irrigated with stww than tw irrigated plots salmonella shigella and e coli o157 were not found in any soil samples 3 4 microbial characteristics of crop samples the microbial quality of crops irrigated with the two types of water is presented in table 6 in plots irrigated with tw e coli was detected in 2 6 of lettuce samples and 1 3 of spring onion samples with a mean concentration of 827 mpn 100 g and 12 mpn 100 g respectively in plots irrigated with stww e coli was detected in 1 6 of lettuce samples and 3 3 of spring onion samples with a mean concentration of 4000 mpn 100 g and 363 mpn 100 g respectively meanwhile e coli was not detected in any maize or onion samples the mann whitney test showed a significant difference between the values of e coli tc and fc in spring onion samples of stww irrigated plots and tw irrigated plots however no statistically significant difference between the values of indicator bacteria was observed in other crops statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the values of e coli for spring onion with maize and onion samples all the crop samples were negative for salmonella shigella and e coli o157 as for the total yield no significant difference between crops irrigated with tw and stww was observed 3 5 decay of e coli and environmental parameters the average value of k was 0 27 d 1 a significantly positive correlation was found between the rate of e coli decay k with air temperature and uv index values 4 discussion 4 1 quality of secondary treated wastewater microbial examination of wastewater revealed a high concentration of indicator bacteria in stww as the mean concentration of e coli during the study period 4 3 log mpn per 100 ml was much higher than the amount recommended by the who for wastewater reuse in irrigation of root and leafy crops 103 and 104 e coli per 100 ml for root and leafy crops respectively who 2006 the results showed that in cycle 1 5 11 of the samples had a concentration higher than 104 e coli per 100 ml for lettuce irrigation however the results showed that the microbial quality of stww is appropriate for irrigation of maize as a high growing crop 105 e coli per 100 ml who 2006 in cycle 2 a higher mean concentration of indicator bacteria was detected in stww and 9 14 and 7 14 of the samples had a concentration of e coli higher than 103 and 105 per 100 ml respectively indicating that wastewater irrigation could increase the risk of enteric pathogen infections in consumers of wastewater irrigated crops even for high growing crops who 2006 a high concentration of indicator bacteria reflects low treatment plant efficiency in terms of removing such bacteria and is probably related to the absence of tertiary treatment or inefficiency of disinfection process conventional wastewater treatment processes reduce indicator bacteria by a 2 3 log which represents a concentration of 104 105 mpn 100 ml of e coli in the effluent de sanctis et al 2017 based on the who guidelines for unrestricted wastewater irrigation the permissible annual disease risk 106 daly per person per year can be achieved by a 6 7 log unit of pathogen reduction according to the rate of pathogen die off between the time of last irrigation and consumption and normal household washing of the crops a 2 and 1 log unit reduction respectively could be considered who 2006 therefore based on the concentration of e coli in the effluent a further 1 2 log reduction for stww irrigation of root and non root salad crops would be required estimation of the annual disease burden for enteroviruses in stww from two treatment plants showed mean values exceeding the guideline value recommended by who 106 daly per person per year for wastewater irrigated lettuce consumers researchers have reported a concentration of about 106 mpn 100 ml for fc in the treatment plants moazeni et al 2017 a further reduction of microorganisms could be achieved through improvement of effluent quality using appropriate disinfection methods especially uv disinfection or application of methods such as filtration and storing wastewater effluent in reservoirs a study by de sanctis et al 2017 showed that with combination of sequencing batch biofilter granular reactors and sand filtration the concentration of e coli in wastewater effluent can be reduced to 10 mpn per 100 ml the mean concentration of e coli and fc in cycle 1 was significantly less than that of cycle 2 which may be related to effects of air and effluent temperature we did not detect any e coli o157 salmonella or shigella in wastewater samples it appears that e coli o157 is generally not detected in primary and secondary wastewater effluent bitton 2011 a typical range of 102 104 cells per 100 ml of raw wastewater was reported for salmonella spp bitton 2011 in a study in trinitapoli italy most of the secondary effluent samples from a wastewater treatment plant were positive for salmonella spp gatta et al 2016 however salmonella may not be detected in treated wastewater due to removal of microorganisms by treatment processes or low prevalence of clinical and subclinical salmonella infections in the community a number of studies have reported no detection of salmonella in treated municipal wastewater cirelli et al 2012 lonigro et al 2016 as shown in table 2 the average values of physicochemical parameters of wastewater effluent were acceptable in terms of crop irrigation according to fao s guidelines ayers and westcot 1985 except for the ec which presented a slight to moderate restriction for agricultural reuse of wastewater effluent the use of wastewater with high ec values is directly related to the risk of soil salinization after a long term application of wastewater urbano et al 2017 the bod value also slightly exceeded the limit set by the epa for food crops irrigation 10 mg l bod usepa 2012 however the reported bod value may not be considered a limiting factor for crop irrigation because of the agronomic potential of organic matters presented in municipal wastewater libutti et al 2018 a study by elfanssi et al 2018 showed improved soil fertility and crop productivity after irrigation with treated wastewater 4 2 soil quality although it has been reported that wastewater irrigation could increase the values of ec and sar of irrigated soil our results showed a decrease in the amounts of ec and sar in plots irrigated with stww as well as tw table 3 a notable reduction in soil ec and sar upon irrigation with tw or stww may in part be due to salt leaching as a result of irrigation christou et al 2014 however the reduction of ec in stww irrigated plots was lower than observed in tw plots which indicates the effect of wastewater irrigation on soil ec in other words more ec values in wastewater irrigated plots could be attributed to the relatively high level of wastewater ec the study by gharaibeh et al 2016 showed that sar in clay soil irrigated with treated wastewater increased over time the results of this study also showed an increase in porosity when sar and ec decreased table 3 the results of study showed that the cec of stww irrigated plots increased which may be due to slight increase of the organic matters in soil of stww irrigated plots table 3 this finding is consistent with other studies which have reported a correlation between the cec and organic matter content of soil becerra castro et al 2015 wu et al 2015 although the organic matter content of soil increased with wastewater irrigation no sinificant diference was observed between the stww and tw irrigated plots a possible explanation is that more microbial input from wastewater influences soil microbiological activity which can induce soil organic matter losses wu et al 2013 soil ph did not change during the study a similar result was reported by rusan et al 2007 after long term irrigation of soil with wastewater similar to the study of gharaibeh et al 2016 our results showed no significant influence of wastewater irrigation on essential soil nutrients the mean concentrations of e coli tc and fc were increased after irrigation in all plots table 5 this suggests that moist soil provides suitable conditions for survival of microorganisms leading to subsequent bacterial regrowth who 2006 the results showed a significantly higher concentration of e coli in wastewater irrigated plots than in tw irrigated plots during the cultivation period and at harvesting time tables 4 and 5 this difference indicates that the microbial characteristics of soil could be affected by the quality of irrigation water and that wastewater could be considered as a contamination source of soil the increased concentration of indicator bacteria in plots irrigated with stww after cycle 2 compared with cycle 1 table 4 confirms the effect of irrigation water quality on soil properties analysis of the microbial quality of wastewater in cycle 2 showed a higher concentration of indicator bacteria table 2 which could influence the microbial quality of stww irrigated soils furthermore lower air temperature and solar radiation in cycle 2 may have increased the survivability of coliform bacteria in soil e coli was also detected in the soil samples of control plots irrigated with tw tables 4 and 5 since e coli is one of the most usual microbial indicators of fecal contamination its presence in soil irrigated with tw as reported by other investigators could be due to an external environmental source of fecal contamination such as birds and or wild and domestic animals benami et al 2013 forslund et al 2012 gatta et al 2016 presence of a large number of birds in our field could be related to the e coli contamination of tw irrigated plots benami et al 2013 investigated the presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicator organisms in soil irrigated with gray water and fresh water they suggested that the type of water had no effect on the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the study by forslund et al 2012 dna fingerprints of e coli isolates from wastewater and wastewater irrigated soil did not show identical patterns which indicates fecal contamination of soil from other environmental sources such as wildlife although the results showed that the microbial quality of the soil was affected by the microbial quality of irrigation water it should be noted that a relatively low concentration of e coli was found in stww irrigated soil samples in agreement with other studies high numbers of indicator bacteria in the irrigation wastewater did not lead to accumulation of the bacteria in soil cirelli et al 2012 gatta et al 2016 orlofsky et al 2016 throughout the entire irrigation period 10 40 analyzed soil samples irrigated with stww did either not contain e coli or had a concentration of less than 5 mpn g this is in agreement with other studies in which e coli was not detected or presented with a low frequency in wastewater irrigated soils despite relatively high levels in irrigation water beneduce et al 2017 gatta et al 2016 the study by gatta et al 2016 undertaken in a mediterranean climate showed a low concentration of fc in soil irrigated with secondary effluent whereas a high concentration of fc bacteria higher than 104 cfu 100 ml was found in wastewater they also reported that fc levels in the soil were not affected by the different irrigation treatment factors certain environmental factors contribute to the survival and die off of microorganisms in soil bahri et al 2009 li and wen 2016 the results of our study showed a significant effect of ambient temperature and the value of uv index on the decay rate of e coli in soil although a 2 log reduction of microorganisms in soil was recommended for pathogens as a result of drip irrigation bahri et al 2009 our results showed an approximate one log reduction for furrow irrigation it has been reported that drip irrigation is more efficient in terms of reducing bacterial contamination compared with furrow irrigation fonseca et al 2011 several studies have evaluated the effect of different irrigation methods on the microbial quality of soil and crops the results of these studies showed that wastewater drip irrigation especially subsurface drip can effectively reduce contamination of soil and crops and consequently associated microbial health risks fonseca et al 2011 qadir et al 2010 song et al 2006 song et al 2006 found a higher concentration of microorganisms on the soil surface of furrow irrigated plots than on subsurface drip irrigated ones as anticipated no pathogenic microorganisms were detected in soil samples a study of microbial quality as analyzed by pyrosequencing revealed absence of salmonella in soil irrigated with treated wastewater ibekwe et al 2018 a study by gatta et al 2016 showed a very low frequency of salmonella spp in soil samples irrigated with secondary wastewater sww despite a high frequency of this microorganism in sww samples furthermore they found salmonella spp in tertiary wastewater irrigated soil while it was not detected in tertiary wastewater samples they concluded that the water source cannot be the only source of contamination 4 3 microbial quality of crops foodborne disease associated with consumption of contaminated produce is a main concern when using wastewater irrigation bahri et al 2009 becerra castro et al 2015 who 2006 in the present study e coli was found in only one plot of stww irrigated lettuce while all of the three plots of spring onion were contaminated by e coli however similar to sttw irrigated soil samples e coli was also detected in tw irrigated lettuce and spring onion which indicates an external environmental source of e coli contamination such as birds and rodents which were abundantly present in the experimental field gatta et al 2016 orlofsky et al 2016 consistent with our results orlofsky et al 2016 showed no significant difference in the detection of fecal indictor bacteria on tomatoes irrigated with treated wastewater as compared with tomatoes irrigated with potable water although e coli was detected at a higher frequency in spring onion samples the contamination level of lettuce was higher which may in part be related to the higher retention capacity of irrigation water and hence a higher potential for contamination mok et al 2014 who 2006 urbano et al 2017 observed contamination of tc of the same order of magnitude in lettuce samples irrigated with treated wastewater and tap water and concluded that tc on lettuce leaves could not be attributed to the use of treated wastewater li and wen 2016 detected only few counts of e coli on the leaves of asparagus lettuce irrigated with secondary sewage effluent as anticipated e coli was not detected in any of the maize samples and this is related to the type of crop growing conditions as well as contact with wastewater or irrigated soil are important factors affect the level of fecal contamination of wastewater irrigated crops forslund et al 2012 the edible part of maize maize kernels is covered by husks which protect it from contamination furthermore since it is a high growing crop the risk of contamination by wastewater irrigation is low therefore wastewater with higher microbial loads could be applied for irrigation of this type of crops as indicated by who 105 e coli per 100 ml who 2006 in the study of drip irrigation by gatta et al 2016 no artichoke heads were positive for e coli nevertheless a high concentration of e coli was found in sww although the authors detected salmonella spp in sww and irrigated soils none of the plant or artichoke head samples were positive for salmonella spp similar results were reported with regard to the microbial quality of eggplant and tomatoes drip irrigated with treated wastewater which often had an e coli content higher than the guideline limit of who cirelli et al 2012 a study by lonigro et al 2016 revealed no or very low microbial pollution of crops and soil at harvesting time in spite of the irrigation wastewater having high microbial loads 1713 and 123429 e coli cfu per 100 ml in lagoon treated wastewater and secondary treated wastewater respectively in contrast to spring onion e coli was not detected in any of the onion samples an important factor potentially related to this difference is the longer interval between the time of last irrigation and harvesting seven days li and wen 2016 reported that an irrigation interval of more than three days reduces the risk of contamination by e coli for wastewater drip irrigated soil similar results were reported by shock et al 2016 who compared drip and furrow irrigation in the transfer of e coli to dry bulb onion based on the climate condition temperature sunlight intensity humidity and type of crop a 0 5 2 log microorganism reduction per day is achievable on crop surface after the last irrigation bahri et al 2009 none of the stww irrigated soil and crop samples contained detectable e coli o157 salmonella or shigella suggesting no infection risk by these pathogens for wastewater irrigated crops lonigro et al 2016 did not detect salmonella or cryptosporidium on vegetables and soil drip irrigated with treated municipal wastewaters a notable result from our study is that the high numbers of e coli in the stww did not lead to microbial contamination of crops especially so in the case of maize and onion moreover no significant e coli contamination was found in stww irrigated lettuce although fecal contamination level of wastewater irrigated crops is affected by the direct contact with wastewater and soil forslund et al 2012 who 2006 the results of study highlight that the climate conditions of arid and semi arid areas including high temperature low humidity and sunlight intensity could effectively inactivate microorganisms in soil and on crop surfaces in other words the climate condition of our study as a semi arid region may explain the reduction of fc and e coli levels from the stww to the soil and from the soil to the plants even under furrow irrigation method the longer time of paused irrigation prior to the harvesting of onion suggests a significant impact of this control measure on the microbial quality of stww irrigated crops lonigro et al 2016 reported that the drip irrigation system weather conditions including increased exposure to uv radiation in the summer or the low temperatures in the winter and the interval time between last watering and harvesting one week could reduce the effects of wastewater on the microbial load of crops and soil overall the analysis of experimental field results confirms that stww could be used in water scarce semi arid areas as an alternative source for the crops irrigation under in field controlled conditions since furrow irrigation was used in the present study drip irrigation as a more efficient method for reducing microorganisms in soil and on crop surface becerra castro et al 2015 fonseca et al 2011 could be considered for crop irrigation levels of microbial contamination could be further reduced by applying post harvest control measures including produce disinfection and peeling bahri et al 2009 5 conclusions secondary treatment of wastewater is a common environmental management strategy used worldwide especially in developing countries however the microbial quality of such wastewater is a public health concern for irrigation of crops eaten raw the results of this study showed that the microbial quality of stww does not meet who guidelines for irrigation of root and leafy crops although the e coli concentration in stww was mostly higher than the who guideline limits that are considered safe for crop irrigation no or negligible microbial contamination of stww irrigated crops maize onion and lettuce was observed as compared with tw irrigated crops the type of crop and the employed method for irrigation are two important factors that should be considered in the reuse of wastewater in agriculture however our results showed that the climate conditions of arid and semi arid areas could effectively contribute to the inactivation of microorganisms in soil and on crop surfaces for leafy and root crops even when using the furrow irrigation method considering the climate conditions stww could be reused as a valid alternative source for irrigation of crops in water scarce middle east region if leaving enough time between last irrigation and harvesting however more study should be conducted to evaluate the fate of enteric viruses and protozoan parasites in field conditions further public health protection and reduction of potential risks could be achieved through application of in field and post harvest control measures for reducing microorganisms including drip irrigation as well as washing disinfection and peeling of produce eaten raw acknowledgement this research was supported by the vice chancellery for research at the isfahan university of medical

19372,mariculture activities and river inputs lead to coastal seawaters with dom levels that are comparable to or even higher than those in terrestrial water bodies however effects of seawater dom and especially of dom occurring in areas impacted by mariculture on photodegradation of organic micropollutants are largely unknown in this study simulated sunlight irradiation experiments were performed to probe the effects of dom extracted from mariculture impacted seawaters and from offshore areas on photodegradation of three sulfonamide antibiotics sas results show that the sas are transformed mainly by indirect photodegradation induced by triplet excited dom 3dom compared with dom from the more pristine coastal waters the dom from mariculture impacted areas undergoes less photobleaching contains higher percentage of humic like materials and higher proportions of aromatic and carbonyl structures thus the dom from mariculture areas exhibits higher rates of light absorption higher formation quantum yields of 3dom higher 3dom steady state concentrations and higher reactivity on photodegradation of the sas photochemistry of the seawater dom is different from that reported for freshwater lake dom this study highlights the importance of probing the effects of dom from coastal seawaters on photodegradation of organic micropollutants since coastal seawaters are sinks of many

transport discharge from land based sources and mariculture activities coastal waters in many regions of the world have been polluted by organic micropollutants schwarzenbach et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 wille et al 2010 among these pollutants antibiotics are of particular concern due to their widespread use and ubiquitous occurrence zhang et al 2013 wille et al 2010 zou et al 2011 na et al 2011 it was estimated that 53800 tons of antibiotics were released into the environment in china during 2013 zhang et al 2015 and most of them may finally flow into coastal waters zhang et al 2013 zou et al 2011 na et al 2011 it was reported that the total concentration of 11 antibiotics in the bohai bay of china ranged from 2 3 to 6800 ng l 1 zou et al 2011 and the total concentration of 31 antibiotics in coastal waters of the yellow sea could be as high as 212 5 ng l 1 na et al 2011 as antibiotics can exert selective pressure to environmental bacteria and promote occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes that can ultimately affect public health gao et al 2012 it is of importance to understand their behavior in the coastal waters for ecological risk assessment photochemical reaction has been proved to be a major transformation pathway for organic micropollutants in surface waters bao and niu 2015 zhou et al 2015 the photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by constituents of surface waters bao and niu 2015 zhou et al 2015 previous studies have shown that dissolved organic matter dom is a major participant in indirect photodegradation of organic pollutants zhou et al 2015 vione et al 2014 under solar irradiation dom can be excited to a singlet excited state that rapidly evolves into an excited triplet state 3dom by intersystem crossing 3dom can sensitize dissolved oxygen to form singlet oxygen 1o2 or oxidize dissolved substances leading to formation of dom vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2016a mcneill and canonica 2016 dom may lead to the generation of superoxide o2 and dismutation product hydrogen peroxide h2o2 vione et al 2014 dom photoreactions may also produce hydroxyl radicals oh zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 these reactive intermediates produced by dom could enhance photodegradation of organic micropollutants li et al 2015 2016a mcneill and canonica 2016 boreen et al 2005 certainly dom can also impede photodegradation of organic pollutants by competing for photon absorption quenching excited states of target pollutants and scavenging both oh and co3 vione et al 2014 wenk et al 2011 the specific role of dom in photodegradation of organic pollutants depends on the composition and source of dom as well as molecular orbital energy levels and electronic properties of organic pollutants guerard et al 2009a b ryan et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 although the effects of freshwater and effluent dom on photodegradation of organic micropollutants such as antibiotics have been investigated boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b ryan et al 2011 the role of marine dom on the photodegradation processes has seldom been investigated dom concentrations in seawater are generally lower than those in terrestrial water bodies and the relevant effects on photodegradation of organic pollutants were regarded as negligible pouliquen et al 2007 lunestad et al 1995 however this is not the case for coastal seawaters as dom concentrations in some coastal areas are comparable to or even higher than those in terrestrial waters al housari et al 2010 del vecchio and blough 2004 especially the effects of dom on photodegradation of pollutants should not be disregarded when considering the large areas of mariculture in coastal zones as mariculture can increase levels of dom due to residual bait animal faeces and excretions and dead organisms herbeck et al 2013 xie et al 2013 mariculture in mudflats bays epiric and deep sea areas is widely distributed along the chinese coastline it is estimated that the total area of mariculture in china is 2 3 106 hm2 in 2014 and mariculture production in china accounts for 68 of the total global mariculture production by weight china fisheries yearbook 2016 fao 2016 thus the effects of dom on photodegradation processes in coastal waters impacted by mariculture deserve special attention previous studies have revealed that photobleaching is a dominant process for dom removal from natural waters coble 2007 helms et al 2013 photobleaching can decrease uv absorbance and molecular weight of dom in oceans del vecchio and blough 2002 it is likely that properties of dom in coastal waters impacted by mariculture differ considerably from those of dom from offshore waters that undergo extensive photobleaching to investigate the effects of marine dom on photodegradation of antibiotics marine dom should be isolated from seawaters a challenge in isolating marine dom lies in the highly dilute and highly saline seawater environments vetter et al 2007 huguet et al 2009a among various techniques that can be employed to extract dom from seawaters vetter et al 2007 huguet et al 2009a mopper et al 2007 simjouw et al 2005 coupled reverse osmosis electrodialysis ro ed has been proved to achieve high yields of dom vetter et al 2007 koprivnjak et al 2009 using this technique koprivnjak et al obtained high recoveries of marine dom with atomic c n ratios and uv visible absorption spectra comparable to the corresponding properties of bulk dom in the source seawaters koprivnjak et al 2009 zhang et al have also shown that the ro ed method yielded samples that are representative of the dom in the source waters of the barataria bay zhang et al 2013 in this study the ro ed method was adopted to isolate dom from coastal waters in mariculture areas and in areas that are less impacted by mariculture effects of the extracted dom on photodegradation of three representative sulfonamide antibiotics sas sulfamethoxydiazine smd sulfamonomethoxine smm and sulfamethoxypyridazine smp that are widely used in mariculture were investigated it was estimated that in 2013 china consumed approximately 8100 tons of sas zhang et al 2015 the concentrations of sas were reported to be up to 140 and 212 ng l 1 in coastal waters of the bohai bay and the yellow sea respectively zou et al 2011 na et al 2011 results show that dom from mariculture ponds played a more significant promoting role on the photodegradation of the target sas than dom isolated from coastal waters that are less impacted by mariculture which is of importance for assessing fate and risk of antibiotics in the coastal seawaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources and purities of the chemicals used in this study are described in the supplementary material sm 2 2 sample collection and preparation as shown in fig s1 6 seawater samples were taken from mariculture ponds 1 2 3 and 4 and tidal creeks 5 and 6 and 3 seawater samples 7 8 and 9 were collected from an offshore region far from the mariculture areas samples 1 and 2 were taken from shrimp ponds 3 and 4 were from sea cucumber and polyculture of fish shellfish ponds respectively 5 and 6 were from tidal creeks that link the shrimp and sea cucumber ponds the samples 4 6 8 and 9 were employed for dom extraction the samples were collected at a depth of 0 5 m beneath the water surface and transported to laboratory immediately all the samples for dom extraction were processed within one week after the collection dom is operationally defined as the fraction of organic matter that passes through filters of 0 45 μm pore size minella et al 2011 therefore the samples were filtered sequentially through 1 0 and 0 45 μm polypropylene filters and were stored at 4 c dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn salinity ph and conductivity were measured as detailed in the table s1 2 3 dom extraction and characterization the ro ed system adopted to extract dom from the filtered seawaters is shown in fig s2 as detailed in the sm uv visible absorption spectrum of the isolated dom was measured with a hitachi u 2900 spectrophotometer fig s3 the ratio between the absorbance at 250 and 365 nm e2 e3 was calculated to track the changes in the relative size of dom molecules de laurentiis et al 2013a helms et al 2008 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was determined by normalizing the absorbance to doc concentration and used as a proxy for aromaticity of dom helms et al 2008 the spectra slope s nm 1 for the intervals of 275 295 nm 350 400 nm and 290 650 nm was calculated from the dom absorption spectra zhang et al 2013 helms et al 2008 as detailed in the sm fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were measured with a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer as detailed in the sm from the eems data the biological index bix defined as the ratio between the emission intensity at 380 nm and at 430 nm for an excitation wavelength of 310 nm bianchi et al 2011 huguet et al 2009b and the humification index hix as the ratio between the area under the emission spectra at 435 480 nm and at 300 345 nm with excitation wavelength of 255 nm bianchi et al 2011 huguet et al 2009b were calculated for two isolated dom samples 13c nmr spectra with cross polarization magic angle spinning cpmas were measured with an agilent dd2 500 nmr spectrometer fig s4 as detailed in the sm 2 4 photochemical experiments an xpa 7 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china with quartz tubes containing reaction solutions was used a 500 w medium pressure mercury lamp surrounded by 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source both medium high pressure mercury lamps and xenon lamps have been conventionally employed in environmental photochemistry experiments to simulate sunlight irradiations zhang et al 2014 boreen et al 2005 de laurentiis et al 2013a as the uv b intensity of the mercury lamps is higher than that of xenon lamps the mercury lamps can quicken the photochemical reaction rates and facilitate the photochemical mechanism studies the light intensity at the surface of the quartz tubes is shown in fig s5 a water cooling system was used to ensure a steady temperature of around 25 c in the reactor effects of cl br and hco3 ions at seawater levels on photodegradation of the sas were explored artificial seawaters were prepared using a recipe kester et al 1967 described in the sm the effects of ionic strength on the photodegradation was investigated and ionic strength of the simulated seawater was controlled by na2so4 nacl as well as an inert salt naclo4 parker et al 2013 the solutions were adjusted to desired ph values with hcl naoh the initial concentration of each target sa in the photolytic solutions was 5 μm uv visible absorption spectra of the sas are shown in fig s6 to clarify the role of 3dom oh and 1o2 in the photodegradation of the sas with the presence of marine dom scavenging experiments were performed using isoprene a quencher of 3dom ryan et al 2011 2 propanol a quencher of oh guerard et al 2009b ryan et al 2011 and nan3 a quencher of 1o2 and oh zhou et al 2015 li et al 2015 a n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment was also carried out to explore the role of 3dom li et al 2015 ryan et al 2011 all the experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was adopted as a probe to measure the formation rate of 3dom r 3dom quantum yield φ 3dom for the production of 3dom and steady state concentration of 3dom 3dom ss al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2013a sharpless et al 2014 details on the measurement of r 3dom φ 3dom 3dom ss as well as the second order rate constant for sas reaction with 3dom k sa 3dom are provided in the sm 2 5 analytical methods an agilent 1260 hplc with diode array detector and zorbax eclipse xdb c18 column 3 0 150 mm 3 5 μm was employed for quantification of the sas 2 4 6 trimethylphenol and furfuryl alcohol which is detailed in the sm and table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of the sas in coastal waters photodegradation of the three sas in artificial seawaters and coastal waters followed pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 98 p 0 05 with no remarkable concentration decrease in the dark controls over the testing time fig s8 as indicated by fig 1 compared with the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants k obs determined in artificial seawaters without dom the k obs values of the three sas were enhanced by 5 0 8 5 fold in the offshore seawater 7 8 and 9 and by 8 0 13 7 fold in the seawaters from the mariculture ponds 1 2 3 and 4 and tidal creek 5 and 6 previous studies suggested that dom is a main constituent responsible for enhanced photodegradation of sas in freshwater environments li et al 2015 2016a boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b boreen et al found that the photodegradation of sulfamethazine sulfamerazine sulfadiazine and sulfachloropyridazine in lake plain waters was significantly enhanced relative to the degradation in deionized water and proved that 3dom is involved in the photochemical process boreen et al 2005 guerard et al reported that water from a eutrophic catfish pond facilitates rapid phototransformation of sulfadimethoxine guerard et al 2009b therefore the dom in the dalian coastal waters may considerably enhance the photodegradation of the three sas and the marine 3dom can be a key species involved in the photodegradation fig 1 also indicates that the three sas especially smp are more susceptible to photodegradation in the coastal seawaters collected from the mariculture ponds and tidal creek relative to the seawaters from the offshore area p 0 05 this result suggests that marine dom from the mariculture areas has higher photosensitizing abilities on photodegradation of the three sas therefore the respective effects of the marine dom and inorganic ions on the photodegradation were further investigated 3 2 dom induced photodegradation of the sas four representative samples of dom were isolated from the mariculture pond 4 tidal creek waters 6 and offshore waters 8 and 9 recoveries of the isolated dom defined as the mass ratio of doc between the concentrated solutions and the source seawaters are 67 15 detailed in the sm koprivnjak et al obtained similar recoveries 75 12 for 16 seawater samples koprivnjak et al 2009 the isolated dom samples were freeze dried into powders as shown in fig s9 the dom from the offshore seawaters is white powder while the dom from the mariculture areas is buff powder the scaled uv visible absorption spectra of the four isolated dom samples and the source seawaters 4 6 8 and 9 from which they were isolated a 290 1 0 are shown in fig s10 the spectra are normalized to an absorbance of 1 0 at an arbitrary wavelength so that the differences in total concentrations can be removed making for a purely compositional comparison bianchi et al 2011 the four isolated dom samples and the corresponding seawaters from which they were isolated have the simillar absorption spectra therefore the isolated dom samples bear representative distributions of chromophores occurring in the source seawaters the s 290 650 values and molar c n ratios also confirm that representatives of dom in the source seawaters were isolated table s3 dom 6 was selected to probe the effects of dom from the mariculture areas on the photodegradation as can be seen from fig 2 a significant enhancement of the photodegradation rate can be observed for the sas in artificial seawater containing dom 6 relative to those in artificial seawater only p 0 05 indicating that dom from the mariculture areas is an effective photosensitizer for the photodegradation of the sas as can be seen from fig 2b addition of 2 propanol as oh quencher to the system with dom 6 did not influence the k obs values significantly implying that oh plays a minor role in the photodegradation of the three sas addition of nan3 as 1o2 and oh quencher had no effects on the k obs values of smd and smm either fig 2b suggesting that 1o2 is not important in the photodegradation of these two sas as shown in fig s11 the three sas were not degraded in the presence of thermally generated 1o2 which is formed during the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by molybdate ions böhme and brauer 1992 additionally the second order rate constants for smd smm and smp reaction with 1o2 were determined to be 3 3 0 26 105 9 2 0 10 105 and 1 8 0 13 106 m 1 s 1 respectively indicating that the three sas have low reactivity with 1o2 thus the marine dom cannot initiate photodegradation of the three sas via production of 1o2 previous studies also indicated that dom from eutrophic waters and natural water samples cannot promote photosensitized degradation of sas via the pathways involving oh and 1o2 boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b addition of isoprene a quencher of 3dom significantly retarded the photodegradation kinetics of the three sas p 0 05 fig 2b the photodegradation rates of the three sas were significantly enhanced p 0 05 in the n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment fig 2b as ground state 3o2 is a quencher of 3dom removal of dissolved oxygen by n2 sparging can decrease the quenching rate of 3dom in the system li et al 2015 2016a ryan et al 2011 these results indicate that the three sas react almost exclusively with marine 3dom previous studies reported that 3dom derived from freshwaters and effluents plays a critical role in the photodegradation of sas li et al 2016a boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b ryan et al 2011 this study further proves that 3dom derived from mariculture areas is responsible for the enhanced photodegradation of the sas besides dom ions cl br hco3 and no3 as well as ionic strength in seawaters may also affect photodegradation of organic pollutants zhou et al 2015 vione et al 2014 li et al 2016b no3 is an important determinant in photodegradation of pollutants in freshwater systems while it has little effects on photodegradation of pollutants in seawaters due to its low concentrations experiments were performed to test the effects of cl br hco3 and ionic strength zhou et al 2015 parker et al 2013 li et al 2016b grebel et al 2012 on photodegradation of the sas concentrations of cl br hco3 and ionic strength were chosen as 0 54 m 0 83 mm 2 3 mm and 0 18 m na2so4 or 0 54 m naclo4 respectively the choice of these values is motivated by the fact that the composition of seawaters is relatively constant and these levels have been reported in previous studies kester et al 1967 parker et al 2013 results indicate photodegradation rates of the three sas are similar in the presence of 0 18 m na2so4 or 0 54 m naclo4 fig s12 therefore it is proper to control ionic strength with na2so4 or naclo4 and the effect of so4 2 on the photodegradation is negligible compared with the k obs value in pure water the k obs values of smm were enhanced slightly p 0 05 in all the control matrixes without dom fig s12 the k obs values of smd were also enhanced in the simulated seawaters with ionic strength controlled by na2so4 or naclo4 p 0 05 relative to that in pure water fig s12 for smp the k obs values in the simulated with 0 54 m nacl and artificial seawaters were much higher p 0 05 than that in pure water but they were lower than that in the simulated seawater with ionic strength controlled by na2so4 fig s12 thus the effects of different ions and ionic strength on photodegradation of organic pollutants with different molecular structures are disparate according to previous study li et al 2016b ionic strength may enhance photodegradation of sas by increasing the steady state concentrations of 3sa thus cl may promote photodegradation of some sas through its ionic strength effects however cl can also inhibit photodegradation of some sas through quenching of 3sa li et al 2016b in addition cl2 may be formed in nacl solutions by reaction between cl and cl and cl can be generated through oxidation of cl by 3sa 3sa cl sa cl cl cl cl2 o2 can also be formed by reaction between sa and o2 dismutation of o2 can lead the formation of h2o2 cl2 and h2o2 formed in nacl photolytic solutions may be involved in the photodegradation of sas these processes can also partly explain the promotion effects of cl on photodegradation of some sas however the photodegradation rate of smp in the marine dom solutions fig 3 was nearly 5 times faster than that in the simulated seawater with ionic strength controlled by na2so4 fig s12 therefore the effects of ionic strength or the specific effects of ions such as cl on the photodegradation of smp are far less important than that of the dom the k obs values of smd smm and smp in seawater samples 6 were determined to be 0 74 0 03 h 1 1 1 0 04 h 1 and 3 12 0 05 h 1 respectively fig 3 in the presence of dom 6 and ionic strength controlled by nacl at 6 seawater level 0 36 m the k obs values of smd smm and smp were measured to be 0 56 0 01 h 1 0 99 0 04 h 1 and 1 9 0 04 h 1 respectively which are close to those in the source seawater 6 these results further confirm that the marine dom indeed plays a critical role in photodegradation of the sas in the coastal waters in addition the photodegradation rates of the three sas in the marine dom solution with ionic strength controlled by nacl were slightly higher compared to the marine dom solution without nacl fig 3 previous studies reported that 3dom could oxidize chloride to form radicals cl2 that may be involved in pollutant degradation parker and mitch 2016 de laurentiis et al 2013b therefore cl2 can also be formed in the current systems in the presence of both dom and nacl and may promote the photodegradation of the sas if the scavenging of 3dom by cl is not as potent as the scavenging of 3dom by o2 cl may exhibit enhancement effects on the photodegradation 3 3 effects of seawater dom from different locations as shown in fig 4 the three sas are more susceptible to photodegradation in the presence of dom from the mariculture areas dom 4 and 6 relative to those from the offshore areas dom 8 and 9 p 0 05 as 3dom is mainly responsible for photodegradation of the sas it can be assumed that the k obs values for the sas in the presence of the dom are associated with the second order rate constants for the reaction of 3dom k sa 3dom and with 3dom ss values the determined k sa 3dom values are listed in table s4 which indicates that only the k smd 3dom and k smm 3dom values for dom 6 are slightly higher than those for the dom from the offshore areas thus k sa 3dom is not a main factor responsible for the higher photoreactivity of dom from the mariculture areas relative to that from the offshore areas it deserves mentioning that the determined k sa 3dom values are the apparent rate constants as some possible side reactions have been neglected for example in the reaction systems h2o2 and o2 may also react with the target compounds moreover the phenolic functional groups within dom may act as antioxidants and reduce the partially oxidized intermediates back to the parent compounds wenk et al 2011 with the same dom concentration 10 mg c l the measured 3dom ss values for dom 4 6 8 and 9 were 8 50 0 15 10 14 5 08 0 20 10 14 2 88 0 17 10 14 and 3 36 0 44 10 14 m respectively thus the higher 3dom ss values for dom 4 and 6 relative to dom 8 and 9 can explain the higher k obs values observed for the systems containing dom 4 and 6 in the current study tmp was adopted as a probe for measuring 3dom ss many previous studies employed tmp to investigate the triplet state photochemistry of dom al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2013a sharpless et al 2014 excited state reduction potentials of 3dom are estimated to be in the range of 1 36 and 1 90 v canonica et al 2000 and tmp has a one electron oxidation potential of 1 22 v thus 3dom has sufficiently high excited state reduction potentials to oxidize tmp mcneill and canonica 2016 recently schmitt et al adopted transient absorption laser spectroscopy to observe the radical cation of n n n n tetramethyl p phenylenediamine formed through oxidation by 3dom and the method can also be employed to determine 3dom ss schmitt et al 2017 the steady state concentration of 3dom 3dom ss is associated with the rate of light absorption of dom and the formation quantum yield of 3dom de laurentiis et al 2013a sharpless and blough 2014 the rates of light absorption for dom 4 6 8 and 9 were determined to be 4 89 10 9 4 65 10 9 3 04 10 9 and 2 94 10 9 einstein l 1 s 1 respectively thus dom 4 and 6 have higher rates of light absorption relative to dom 8 and 9 due to the higher absorbance of dom 4 and 6 fig s3 the φ 3dom values for dom 4 6 8 and 9 were determined to be 8 68 0 17 10 3 5 47 0 21 10 3 4 73 0 28 10 3 and 5 71 0 72 10 3 respectively thus both the rates of light absorption and the formation quantum yields of 3dom jointly determine that the 3dom ss values for the mariculture areas are higher than those for the offshore areas timko et al reported that 3dom ss normalized to doc did not change significantly across a salinity gradient along the taylor river and florida bay transect timko et al 2014 loiselle et al reported that dom derived from submersed macrophytes in a coastal lake was less photoreactive than dom derived from phytoplankton biomass and attributed the different photoreactivity to the difference in the history of sunlight exposure loiselle et al 2012 their observations are quite different from the observations from the current study thus it can be concluded that dom photoreactivity varies with sources allochthonous or autochthonous and environmental processes e g photobleaching and microbial decomposition coble 2007 maizel et al 2017 the eem spectra for the dom samples are shown in fig 5 for the dom samples protein like materials i ii and iv were found to be the main components 57 6 71 3 table s5 which are attributed to autochthonous production associated with biological degradation of dom murphy et al 2008 salinities in the mariculture pond 4 tidal creek waters 6 and offshore region 8 and 9 were measured to be 23 7 25 1 32 3 and 32 8 respectively therefore the mariculture pond and tidal creek are impacted by terrestrial inputs since seawaters with limited freshwater influence have salinities exceeding 30 del vecchio and blough 2004 although the dom from the mariculture pond and tidal creek seawaters is affected by local terrestrial inputs the dom is still largely of autochthonous nature since the measured biological index bix and humification index hix values also indicate that the dom samples have the features of autochthonous sources detailed in the sm furthermore the dom from the mariculture pond 4 42 4 and tidal creek seawaters 6 36 9 contains higher humic like materials relative to the dom from the offshore areas 8 28 7 and 9 31 4 it needs mentioning that although eem spectra have been widely employed to characterize dom sources huguet et al 2009b de laurentiis et al 2013a murphy et al 2008 coble 1996 coble et al 1993 the method is a bit subjective in data interpretation as the same locations of peaks are not necessarily caused by the same substances thus other spectral parameters are needed to further analyze the dom samples as shown in table 1 the dom samples from the mariculture areas have lower values of e2 e3 s 275 295 and s r the ratio between s 275 295 and s 350 400 than those from the offshore areas as the values of e2 e3 s 275 295 and s r are proxies for the degree of photobleaching of dom coble 2007 helms et al 2013 helms et al 2008 it can be inferred that the dom from the mariculture areas undergoes less photobleaching than that from the offshore seawaters since photobleaching can destroy aromatic ketones that are main 3dom precursors li et al 2016a guerard et al 2009b sharpless et al 2014 sharpless and blough 2014 sharpless 2012 canonica et al 2006 it can be reasonably understood that the dom from the mariculture areas has higher carbonyl content relative to the dom from the offshore areas it deserves mentioning that the s 275 295 values are larger than the s 350 400 values which indicates that the dom samples are mainly marine in character since the opposite trend holds for terrestrially dominated dom samples helms et al 2008 the solid state cpmas 13c nmr spectra of the dom samples demonstrate that dom 4 has higher percentage of aromatic carbon and carbonyl contents than dom 8 fig s4 and table s6 it is known that suva254 values significantly correlate with dom aromaticity r 0 98 weishaar et al 2003 thus the suva254 values of the dom samples table 1 also indicate higher aromaticity of dom 4 and 6 previous studies indicated that higher contents of humic like materials and aromaticity of dom correlate positively with the formation rates of 3dom maizel et al 2017 de laurentiis et al 2012 therefore it is the higher contents of humic like materials and aromaticity of the dom from the mariculture areas that lead to higher formation rates and steady state concentrations of 3dom and correspondingly higher photoreactivity of dom 4 and 6 relative to 8 and 9 maizel et al investigated relationships between dom composition and photochemistry in lakes of diverse trophic status and found that highly aromatic structures in freshwater dom correlate positively with triplet formation rates but negatively with triplet quantum yields maizel et al 2017 in this study the samples dom 4 and 6 have higher aromaticity and relatively higher formation quantum yields of 3dom than the samples dom 8 and 9 thus the results in the current study indicate that the photochemistry of the dom from coastal waters is different from that of the freshwater lake dom as far as we know this is a first attempt to unveil the effects of dom isolated from coastal waters on photodegradation of organic micropollutants however it is still unclear whether dom from other coastal and estuarine seawaters exhibits similar photochemical reactivity which needs further investigations previous studies also indicate that the effects of a given dom from a specific source on photodegradation of different organic pollutants are disparate boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009a as hundreds to thousands of organic micropollutants have been detected in coastal environments photodegradation of these pollutants in the presence of coastal water dom needs further studies oceans cover about 71 of the earth s surface which is much larger than the surface area of terrestrial water bodies nevertheless there are much fewer environmental photochemical studies on micropollutants in seawater environments than in freshwater environments the matrix constituents of seawaters e g high ionic strength and levels of halide ions differ substantially from those of freshwaters the current study found that ionic strength can enhance the photodegradation of smp li et al reported that triplet excited sulfamethazine can oxidize halide ions to produce halogen radicals subsequently leading to chlorinated and brominated intermediates li et al 2016b parker and mitch also reported that halogen radicals formed predominantly by direct oxidation of cl and br by 3dom contribute to photooxidation in coastal and estuarine waters parker and mitch 2016 therefore more studies should focus on the environmental photochemical fate of micropollutants under seawater conditions oceans are sinks of aquatic pollutants specially although coastal areas are hotspots for biodiversity biological productivity as well as ecosystem services coastal seawaters in many regions of the world have been seriously polluted in china most of the coastal water areas along the coastline have been exploited for mariculture and the mariculture produces about 70 of the world mariculture products due to mariculture activities wastewater discharge and rivers inputs the coastal seawaters have been eutrophicated as an example it was reported that shrimp production 79 000 tonnes per year in the bohai sea and yellow sea areas caused more than 120 000 tonnes of uneaten feed discharged into the sea xie et al 2013 therefore coastal waters in mariculture and riverine areas usually contain high levels of dom this dom can have varying effects on the fate of organic micropollutants in coastal seawaters therefore the effects of coastal seawater dom on the photochemical fate of organic micropollutants deserve attention 4 conclusion in this study the effects of marine dom isolated from mariculture areas and offshore areas on photochemical behavior of three sas were investigated dom from mariculture areas shows higher reactivity than dom from offshore waters in promoting photodegradation of three sas via the pathway involving marine 3dom dom from the mariculture areas undergoes less photobleaching contains more humic like materials and more aromatic and carbonyl structures which subsequently lead to higher 3dom steady state concentrations and thus higher reactivity on photodegradation of the sas acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural

19372,mariculture activities and river inputs lead to coastal seawaters with dom levels that are comparable to or even higher than those in terrestrial water bodies however effects of seawater dom and especially of dom occurring in areas impacted by mariculture on photodegradation of organic micropollutants are largely unknown in this study simulated sunlight irradiation experiments were performed to probe the effects of dom extracted from mariculture impacted seawaters and from offshore areas on photodegradation of three sulfonamide antibiotics sas results show that the sas are transformed mainly by indirect photodegradation induced by triplet excited dom 3dom compared with dom from the more pristine coastal waters the dom from mariculture impacted areas undergoes less photobleaching contains higher percentage of humic like materials and higher proportions of aromatic and carbonyl structures thus the dom from mariculture areas exhibits higher rates of light absorption higher formation quantum yields of 3dom higher 3dom steady state concentrations and higher reactivity on photodegradation of the sas photochemistry of the seawater dom is different from that reported for freshwater lake dom this study highlights the importance of probing the effects of dom from coastal seawaters on photodegradation of organic micropollutants since coastal seawaters are sinks of many aquatic pollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords mariculture reverse osmosis electrodialysis dissolved organic matter sulfonamide antibiotics photodegradation 1 introduction due to riverine transport discharge from land based sources and mariculture activities coastal waters in many regions of the world have been polluted by organic micropollutants schwarzenbach et al 2006 zhang et al 2013 wille et al 2010 among these pollutants antibiotics are of particular concern due to their widespread use and ubiquitous occurrence zhang et al 2013 wille et al 2010 zou et al 2011 na et al 2011 it was estimated that 53800 tons of antibiotics were released into the environment in china during 2013 zhang et al 2015 and most of them may finally flow into coastal waters zhang et al 2013 zou et al 2011 na et al 2011 it was reported that the total concentration of 11 antibiotics in the bohai bay of china ranged from 2 3 to 6800 ng l 1 zou et al 2011 and the total concentration of 31 antibiotics in coastal waters of the yellow sea could be as high as 212 5 ng l 1 na et al 2011 as antibiotics can exert selective pressure to environmental bacteria and promote occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes that can ultimately affect public health gao et al 2012 it is of importance to understand their behavior in the coastal waters for ecological risk assessment photochemical reaction has been proved to be a major transformation pathway for organic micropollutants in surface waters bao and niu 2015 zhou et al 2015 the photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by constituents of surface waters bao and niu 2015 zhou et al 2015 previous studies have shown that dissolved organic matter dom is a major participant in indirect photodegradation of organic pollutants zhou et al 2015 vione et al 2014 under solar irradiation dom can be excited to a singlet excited state that rapidly evolves into an excited triplet state 3dom by intersystem crossing 3dom can sensitize dissolved oxygen to form singlet oxygen 1o2 or oxidize dissolved substances leading to formation of dom vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2016a mcneill and canonica 2016 dom may lead to the generation of superoxide o2 and dismutation product hydrogen peroxide h2o2 vione et al 2014 dom photoreactions may also produce hydroxyl radicals oh zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 these reactive intermediates produced by dom could enhance photodegradation of organic micropollutants li et al 2015 2016a mcneill and canonica 2016 boreen et al 2005 certainly dom can also impede photodegradation of organic pollutants by competing for photon absorption quenching excited states of target pollutants and scavenging both oh and co3 vione et al 2014 wenk et al 2011 the specific role of dom in photodegradation of organic pollutants depends on the composition and source of dom as well as molecular orbital energy levels and electronic properties of organic pollutants guerard et al 2009a b ryan et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 although the effects of freshwater and effluent dom on photodegradation of organic micropollutants such as antibiotics have been investigated boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b ryan et al 2011 the role of marine dom on the photodegradation processes has seldom been investigated dom concentrations in seawater are generally lower than those in terrestrial water bodies and the relevant effects on photodegradation of organic pollutants were regarded as negligible pouliquen et al 2007 lunestad et al 1995 however this is not the case for coastal seawaters as dom concentrations in some coastal areas are comparable to or even higher than those in terrestrial waters al housari et al 2010 del vecchio and blough 2004 especially the effects of dom on photodegradation of pollutants should not be disregarded when considering the large areas of mariculture in coastal zones as mariculture can increase levels of dom due to residual bait animal faeces and excretions and dead organisms herbeck et al 2013 xie et al 2013 mariculture in mudflats bays epiric and deep sea areas is widely distributed along the chinese coastline it is estimated that the total area of mariculture in china is 2 3 106 hm2 in 2014 and mariculture production in china accounts for 68 of the total global mariculture production by weight china fisheries yearbook 2016 fao 2016 thus the effects of dom on photodegradation processes in coastal waters impacted by mariculture deserve special attention previous studies have revealed that photobleaching is a dominant process for dom removal from natural waters coble 2007 helms et al 2013 photobleaching can decrease uv absorbance and molecular weight of dom in oceans del vecchio and blough 2002 it is likely that properties of dom in coastal waters impacted by mariculture differ considerably from those of dom from offshore waters that undergo extensive photobleaching to investigate the effects of marine dom on photodegradation of antibiotics marine dom should be isolated from seawaters a challenge in isolating marine dom lies in the highly dilute and highly saline seawater environments vetter et al 2007 huguet et al 2009a among various techniques that can be employed to extract dom from seawaters vetter et al 2007 huguet et al 2009a mopper et al 2007 simjouw et al 2005 coupled reverse osmosis electrodialysis ro ed has been proved to achieve high yields of dom vetter et al 2007 koprivnjak et al 2009 using this technique koprivnjak et al obtained high recoveries of marine dom with atomic c n ratios and uv visible absorption spectra comparable to the corresponding properties of bulk dom in the source seawaters koprivnjak et al 2009 zhang et al have also shown that the ro ed method yielded samples that are representative of the dom in the source waters of the barataria bay zhang et al 2013 in this study the ro ed method was adopted to isolate dom from coastal waters in mariculture areas and in areas that are less impacted by mariculture effects of the extracted dom on photodegradation of three representative sulfonamide antibiotics sas sulfamethoxydiazine smd sulfamonomethoxine smm and sulfamethoxypyridazine smp that are widely used in mariculture were investigated it was estimated that in 2013 china consumed approximately 8100 tons of sas zhang et al 2015 the concentrations of sas were reported to be up to 140 and 212 ng l 1 in coastal waters of the bohai bay and the yellow sea respectively zou et al 2011 na et al 2011 results show that dom from mariculture ponds played a more significant promoting role on the photodegradation of the target sas than dom isolated from coastal waters that are less impacted by mariculture which is of importance for assessing fate and risk of antibiotics in the coastal seawaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sources and purities of the chemicals used in this study are described in the supplementary material sm 2 2 sample collection and preparation as shown in fig s1 6 seawater samples were taken from mariculture ponds 1 2 3 and 4 and tidal creeks 5 and 6 and 3 seawater samples 7 8 and 9 were collected from an offshore region far from the mariculture areas samples 1 and 2 were taken from shrimp ponds 3 and 4 were from sea cucumber and polyculture of fish shellfish ponds respectively 5 and 6 were from tidal creeks that link the shrimp and sea cucumber ponds the samples 4 6 8 and 9 were employed for dom extraction the samples were collected at a depth of 0 5 m beneath the water surface and transported to laboratory immediately all the samples for dom extraction were processed within one week after the collection dom is operationally defined as the fraction of organic matter that passes through filters of 0 45 μm pore size minella et al 2011 therefore the samples were filtered sequentially through 1 0 and 0 45 μm polypropylene filters and were stored at 4 c dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn salinity ph and conductivity were measured as detailed in the table s1 2 3 dom extraction and characterization the ro ed system adopted to extract dom from the filtered seawaters is shown in fig s2 as detailed in the sm uv visible absorption spectrum of the isolated dom was measured with a hitachi u 2900 spectrophotometer fig s3 the ratio between the absorbance at 250 and 365 nm e2 e3 was calculated to track the changes in the relative size of dom molecules de laurentiis et al 2013a helms et al 2008 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was determined by normalizing the absorbance to doc concentration and used as a proxy for aromaticity of dom helms et al 2008 the spectra slope s nm 1 for the intervals of 275 295 nm 350 400 nm and 290 650 nm was calculated from the dom absorption spectra zhang et al 2013 helms et al 2008 as detailed in the sm fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra were measured with a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer as detailed in the sm from the eems data the biological index bix defined as the ratio between the emission intensity at 380 nm and at 430 nm for an excitation wavelength of 310 nm bianchi et al 2011 huguet et al 2009b and the humification index hix as the ratio between the area under the emission spectra at 435 480 nm and at 300 345 nm with excitation wavelength of 255 nm bianchi et al 2011 huguet et al 2009b were calculated for two isolated dom samples 13c nmr spectra with cross polarization magic angle spinning cpmas were measured with an agilent dd2 500 nmr spectrometer fig s4 as detailed in the sm 2 4 photochemical experiments an xpa 7 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china with quartz tubes containing reaction solutions was used a 500 w medium pressure mercury lamp surrounded by 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source both medium high pressure mercury lamps and xenon lamps have been conventionally employed in environmental photochemistry experiments to simulate sunlight irradiations zhang et al 2014 boreen et al 2005 de laurentiis et al 2013a as the uv b intensity of the mercury lamps is higher than that of xenon lamps the mercury lamps can quicken the photochemical reaction rates and facilitate the photochemical mechanism studies the light intensity at the surface of the quartz tubes is shown in fig s5 a water cooling system was used to ensure a steady temperature of around 25 c in the reactor effects of cl br and hco3 ions at seawater levels on photodegradation of the sas were explored artificial seawaters were prepared using a recipe kester et al 1967 described in the sm the effects of ionic strength on the photodegradation was investigated and ionic strength of the simulated seawater was controlled by na2so4 nacl as well as an inert salt naclo4 parker et al 2013 the solutions were adjusted to desired ph values with hcl naoh the initial concentration of each target sa in the photolytic solutions was 5 μm uv visible absorption spectra of the sas are shown in fig s6 to clarify the role of 3dom oh and 1o2 in the photodegradation of the sas with the presence of marine dom scavenging experiments were performed using isoprene a quencher of 3dom ryan et al 2011 2 propanol a quencher of oh guerard et al 2009b ryan et al 2011 and nan3 a quencher of 1o2 and oh zhou et al 2015 li et al 2015 a n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment was also carried out to explore the role of 3dom li et al 2015 ryan et al 2011 all the experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp was adopted as a probe to measure the formation rate of 3dom r 3dom quantum yield φ 3dom for the production of 3dom and steady state concentration of 3dom 3dom ss al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2013a sharpless et al 2014 details on the measurement of r 3dom φ 3dom 3dom ss as well as the second order rate constant for sas reaction with 3dom k sa 3dom are provided in the sm 2 5 analytical methods an agilent 1260 hplc with diode array detector and zorbax eclipse xdb c18 column 3 0 150 mm 3 5 μm was employed for quantification of the sas 2 4 6 trimethylphenol and furfuryl alcohol which is detailed in the sm and table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of the sas in coastal waters photodegradation of the three sas in artificial seawaters and coastal waters followed pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 98 p 0 05 with no remarkable concentration decrease in the dark controls over the testing time fig s8 as indicated by fig 1 compared with the pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants k obs determined in artificial seawaters without dom the k obs values of the three sas were enhanced by 5 0 8 5 fold in the offshore seawater 7 8 and 9 and by 8 0 13 7 fold in the seawaters from the mariculture ponds 1 2 3 and 4 and tidal creek 5 and 6 previous studies suggested that dom is a main constituent responsible for enhanced photodegradation of sas in freshwater environments li et al 2015 2016a boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b boreen et al found that the photodegradation of sulfamethazine sulfamerazine sulfadiazine and sulfachloropyridazine in lake plain waters was significantly enhanced relative to the degradation in deionized water and proved that 3dom is involved in the photochemical process boreen et al 2005 guerard et al reported that water from a eutrophic catfish pond facilitates rapid phototransformation of sulfadimethoxine guerard et al 2009b therefore the dom in the dalian coastal waters may considerably enhance the photodegradation of the three sas and the marine 3dom can be a key species involved in the photodegradation fig 1 also indicates that the three sas especially smp are more susceptible to photodegradation in the coastal seawaters collected from the mariculture ponds and tidal creek relative to the seawaters from the offshore area p 0 05 this result suggests that marine dom from the mariculture areas has higher photosensitizing abilities on photodegradation of the three sas therefore the respective effects of the marine dom and inorganic ions on the photodegradation were further investigated 3 2 dom induced photodegradation of the sas four representative samples of dom were isolated from the mariculture pond 4 tidal creek waters 6 and offshore waters 8 and 9 recoveries of the isolated dom defined as the mass ratio of doc between the concentrated solutions and the source seawaters are 67 15 detailed in the sm koprivnjak et al obtained similar recoveries 75 12 for 16 seawater samples koprivnjak et al 2009 the isolated dom samples were freeze dried into powders as shown in fig s9 the dom from the offshore seawaters is white powder while the dom from the mariculture areas is buff powder the scaled uv visible absorption spectra of the four isolated dom samples and the source seawaters 4 6 8 and 9 from which they were isolated a 290 1 0 are shown in fig s10 the spectra are normalized to an absorbance of 1 0 at an arbitrary wavelength so that the differences in total concentrations can be removed making for a purely compositional comparison bianchi et al 2011 the four isolated dom samples and the corresponding seawaters from which they were isolated have the simillar absorption spectra therefore the isolated dom samples bear representative distributions of chromophores occurring in the source seawaters the s 290 650 values and molar c n ratios also confirm that representatives of dom in the source seawaters were isolated table s3 dom 6 was selected to probe the effects of dom from the mariculture areas on the photodegradation as can be seen from fig 2 a significant enhancement of the photodegradation rate can be observed for the sas in artificial seawater containing dom 6 relative to those in artificial seawater only p 0 05 indicating that dom from the mariculture areas is an effective photosensitizer for the photodegradation of the sas as can be seen from fig 2b addition of 2 propanol as oh quencher to the system with dom 6 did not influence the k obs values significantly implying that oh plays a minor role in the photodegradation of the three sas addition of nan3 as 1o2 and oh quencher had no effects on the k obs values of smd and smm either fig 2b suggesting that 1o2 is not important in the photodegradation of these two sas as shown in fig s11 the three sas were not degraded in the presence of thermally generated 1o2 which is formed during the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by molybdate ions böhme and brauer 1992 additionally the second order rate constants for smd smm and smp reaction with 1o2 were determined to be 3 3 0 26 105 9 2 0 10 105 and 1 8 0 13 106 m 1 s 1 respectively indicating that the three sas have low reactivity with 1o2 thus the marine dom cannot initiate photodegradation of the three sas via production of 1o2 previous studies also indicated that dom from eutrophic waters and natural water samples cannot promote photosensitized degradation of sas via the pathways involving oh and 1o2 boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b addition of isoprene a quencher of 3dom significantly retarded the photodegradation kinetics of the three sas p 0 05 fig 2b the photodegradation rates of the three sas were significantly enhanced p 0 05 in the n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment fig 2b as ground state 3o2 is a quencher of 3dom removal of dissolved oxygen by n2 sparging can decrease the quenching rate of 3dom in the system li et al 2015 2016a ryan et al 2011 these results indicate that the three sas react almost exclusively with marine 3dom previous studies reported that 3dom derived from freshwaters and effluents plays a critical role in the photodegradation of sas li et al 2016a boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009b ryan et al 2011 this study further proves that 3dom derived from mariculture areas is responsible for the enhanced photodegradation of the sas besides dom ions cl br hco3 and no3 as well as ionic strength in seawaters may also affect photodegradation of organic pollutants zhou et al 2015 vione et al 2014 li et al 2016b no3 is an important determinant in photodegradation of pollutants in freshwater systems while it has little effects on photodegradation of pollutants in seawaters due to its low concentrations experiments were performed to test the effects of cl br hco3 and ionic strength zhou et al 2015 parker et al 2013 li et al 2016b grebel et al 2012 on photodegradation of the sas concentrations of cl br hco3 and ionic strength were chosen as 0 54 m 0 83 mm 2 3 mm and 0 18 m na2so4 or 0 54 m naclo4 respectively the choice of these values is motivated by the fact that the composition of seawaters is relatively constant and these levels have been reported in previous studies kester et al 1967 parker et al 2013 results indicate photodegradation rates of the three sas are similar in the presence of 0 18 m na2so4 or 0 54 m naclo4 fig s12 therefore it is proper to control ionic strength with na2so4 or naclo4 and the effect of so4 2 on the photodegradation is negligible compared with the k obs value in pure water the k obs values of smm were enhanced slightly p 0 05 in all the control matrixes without dom fig s12 the k obs values of smd were also enhanced in the simulated seawaters with ionic strength controlled by na2so4 or naclo4 p 0 05 relative to that in pure water fig s12 for smp the k obs values in the simulated with 0 54 m nacl and artificial seawaters were much higher p 0 05 than that in pure water but they were lower than that in the simulated seawater with ionic strength controlled by na2so4 fig s12 thus the effects of different ions and ionic strength on photodegradation of organic pollutants with different molecular structures are disparate according to previous study li et al 2016b ionic strength may enhance photodegradation of sas by increasing the steady state concentrations of 3sa thus cl may promote photodegradation of some sas through its ionic strength effects however cl can also inhibit photodegradation of some sas through quenching of 3sa li et al 2016b in addition cl2 may be formed in nacl solutions by reaction between cl and cl and cl can be generated through oxidation of cl by 3sa 3sa cl sa cl cl cl cl2 o2 can also be formed by reaction between sa and o2 dismutation of o2 can lead the formation of h2o2 cl2 and h2o2 formed in nacl photolytic solutions may be involved in the photodegradation of sas these processes can also partly explain the promotion effects of cl on photodegradation of some sas however the photodegradation rate of smp in the marine dom solutions fig 3 was nearly 5 times faster than that in the simulated seawater with ionic strength controlled by na2so4 fig s12 therefore the effects of ionic strength or the specific effects of ions such as cl on the photodegradation of smp are far less important than that of the dom the k obs values of smd smm and smp in seawater samples 6 were determined to be 0 74 0 03 h 1 1 1 0 04 h 1 and 3 12 0 05 h 1 respectively fig 3 in the presence of dom 6 and ionic strength controlled by nacl at 6 seawater level 0 36 m the k obs values of smd smm and smp were measured to be 0 56 0 01 h 1 0 99 0 04 h 1 and 1 9 0 04 h 1 respectively which are close to those in the source seawater 6 these results further confirm that the marine dom indeed plays a critical role in photodegradation of the sas in the coastal waters in addition the photodegradation rates of the three sas in the marine dom solution with ionic strength controlled by nacl were slightly higher compared to the marine dom solution without nacl fig 3 previous studies reported that 3dom could oxidize chloride to form radicals cl2 that may be involved in pollutant degradation parker and mitch 2016 de laurentiis et al 2013b therefore cl2 can also be formed in the current systems in the presence of both dom and nacl and may promote the photodegradation of the sas if the scavenging of 3dom by cl is not as potent as the scavenging of 3dom by o2 cl may exhibit enhancement effects on the photodegradation 3 3 effects of seawater dom from different locations as shown in fig 4 the three sas are more susceptible to photodegradation in the presence of dom from the mariculture areas dom 4 and 6 relative to those from the offshore areas dom 8 and 9 p 0 05 as 3dom is mainly responsible for photodegradation of the sas it can be assumed that the k obs values for the sas in the presence of the dom are associated with the second order rate constants for the reaction of 3dom k sa 3dom and with 3dom ss values the determined k sa 3dom values are listed in table s4 which indicates that only the k smd 3dom and k smm 3dom values for dom 6 are slightly higher than those for the dom from the offshore areas thus k sa 3dom is not a main factor responsible for the higher photoreactivity of dom from the mariculture areas relative to that from the offshore areas it deserves mentioning that the determined k sa 3dom values are the apparent rate constants as some possible side reactions have been neglected for example in the reaction systems h2o2 and o2 may also react with the target compounds moreover the phenolic functional groups within dom may act as antioxidants and reduce the partially oxidized intermediates back to the parent compounds wenk et al 2011 with the same dom concentration 10 mg c l the measured 3dom ss values for dom 4 6 8 and 9 were 8 50 0 15 10 14 5 08 0 20 10 14 2 88 0 17 10 14 and 3 36 0 44 10 14 m respectively thus the higher 3dom ss values for dom 4 and 6 relative to dom 8 and 9 can explain the higher k obs values observed for the systems containing dom 4 and 6 in the current study tmp was adopted as a probe for measuring 3dom ss many previous studies employed tmp to investigate the triplet state photochemistry of dom al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2013a sharpless et al 2014 excited state reduction potentials of 3dom are estimated to be in the range of 1 36 and 1 90 v canonica et al 2000 and tmp has a one electron oxidation potential of 1 22 v thus 3dom has sufficiently high excited state reduction potentials to oxidize tmp mcneill and canonica 2016 recently schmitt et al adopted transient absorption laser spectroscopy to observe the radical cation of n n n n tetramethyl p phenylenediamine formed through oxidation by 3dom and the method can also be employed to determine 3dom ss schmitt et al 2017 the steady state concentration of 3dom 3dom ss is associated with the rate of light absorption of dom and the formation quantum yield of 3dom de laurentiis et al 2013a sharpless and blough 2014 the rates of light absorption for dom 4 6 8 and 9 were determined to be 4 89 10 9 4 65 10 9 3 04 10 9 and 2 94 10 9 einstein l 1 s 1 respectively thus dom 4 and 6 have higher rates of light absorption relative to dom 8 and 9 due to the higher absorbance of dom 4 and 6 fig s3 the φ 3dom values for dom 4 6 8 and 9 were determined to be 8 68 0 17 10 3 5 47 0 21 10 3 4 73 0 28 10 3 and 5 71 0 72 10 3 respectively thus both the rates of light absorption and the formation quantum yields of 3dom jointly determine that the 3dom ss values for the mariculture areas are higher than those for the offshore areas timko et al reported that 3dom ss normalized to doc did not change significantly across a salinity gradient along the taylor river and florida bay transect timko et al 2014 loiselle et al reported that dom derived from submersed macrophytes in a coastal lake was less photoreactive than dom derived from phytoplankton biomass and attributed the different photoreactivity to the difference in the history of sunlight exposure loiselle et al 2012 their observations are quite different from the observations from the current study thus it can be concluded that dom photoreactivity varies with sources allochthonous or autochthonous and environmental processes e g photobleaching and microbial decomposition coble 2007 maizel et al 2017 the eem spectra for the dom samples are shown in fig 5 for the dom samples protein like materials i ii and iv were found to be the main components 57 6 71 3 table s5 which are attributed to autochthonous production associated with biological degradation of dom murphy et al 2008 salinities in the mariculture pond 4 tidal creek waters 6 and offshore region 8 and 9 were measured to be 23 7 25 1 32 3 and 32 8 respectively therefore the mariculture pond and tidal creek are impacted by terrestrial inputs since seawaters with limited freshwater influence have salinities exceeding 30 del vecchio and blough 2004 although the dom from the mariculture pond and tidal creek seawaters is affected by local terrestrial inputs the dom is still largely of autochthonous nature since the measured biological index bix and humification index hix values also indicate that the dom samples have the features of autochthonous sources detailed in the sm furthermore the dom from the mariculture pond 4 42 4 and tidal creek seawaters 6 36 9 contains higher humic like materials relative to the dom from the offshore areas 8 28 7 and 9 31 4 it needs mentioning that although eem spectra have been widely employed to characterize dom sources huguet et al 2009b de laurentiis et al 2013a murphy et al 2008 coble 1996 coble et al 1993 the method is a bit subjective in data interpretation as the same locations of peaks are not necessarily caused by the same substances thus other spectral parameters are needed to further analyze the dom samples as shown in table 1 the dom samples from the mariculture areas have lower values of e2 e3 s 275 295 and s r the ratio between s 275 295 and s 350 400 than those from the offshore areas as the values of e2 e3 s 275 295 and s r are proxies for the degree of photobleaching of dom coble 2007 helms et al 2013 helms et al 2008 it can be inferred that the dom from the mariculture areas undergoes less photobleaching than that from the offshore seawaters since photobleaching can destroy aromatic ketones that are main 3dom precursors li et al 2016a guerard et al 2009b sharpless et al 2014 sharpless and blough 2014 sharpless 2012 canonica et al 2006 it can be reasonably understood that the dom from the mariculture areas has higher carbonyl content relative to the dom from the offshore areas it deserves mentioning that the s 275 295 values are larger than the s 350 400 values which indicates that the dom samples are mainly marine in character since the opposite trend holds for terrestrially dominated dom samples helms et al 2008 the solid state cpmas 13c nmr spectra of the dom samples demonstrate that dom 4 has higher percentage of aromatic carbon and carbonyl contents than dom 8 fig s4 and table s6 it is known that suva254 values significantly correlate with dom aromaticity r 0 98 weishaar et al 2003 thus the suva254 values of the dom samples table 1 also indicate higher aromaticity of dom 4 and 6 previous studies indicated that higher contents of humic like materials and aromaticity of dom correlate positively with the formation rates of 3dom maizel et al 2017 de laurentiis et al 2012 therefore it is the higher contents of humic like materials and aromaticity of the dom from the mariculture areas that lead to higher formation rates and steady state concentrations of 3dom and correspondingly higher photoreactivity of dom 4 and 6 relative to 8 and 9 maizel et al investigated relationships between dom composition and photochemistry in lakes of diverse trophic status and found that highly aromatic structures in freshwater dom correlate positively with triplet formation rates but negatively with triplet quantum yields maizel et al 2017 in this study the samples dom 4 and 6 have higher aromaticity and relatively higher formation quantum yields of 3dom than the samples dom 8 and 9 thus the results in the current study indicate that the photochemistry of the dom from coastal waters is different from that of the freshwater lake dom as far as we know this is a first attempt to unveil the effects of dom isolated from coastal waters on photodegradation of organic micropollutants however it is still unclear whether dom from other coastal and estuarine seawaters exhibits similar photochemical reactivity which needs further investigations previous studies also indicate that the effects of a given dom from a specific source on photodegradation of different organic pollutants are disparate boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009a as hundreds to thousands of organic micropollutants have been detected in coastal environments photodegradation of these pollutants in the presence of coastal water dom needs further studies oceans cover about 71 of the earth s surface which is much larger than the surface area of terrestrial water bodies nevertheless there are much fewer environmental photochemical studies on micropollutants in seawater environments than in freshwater environments the matrix constituents of seawaters e g high ionic strength and levels of halide ions differ substantially from those of freshwaters the current study found that ionic strength can enhance the photodegradation of smp li et al reported that triplet excited sulfamethazine can oxidize halide ions to produce halogen radicals subsequently leading to chlorinated and brominated intermediates li et al 2016b parker and mitch also reported that halogen radicals formed predominantly by direct oxidation of cl and br by 3dom contribute to photooxidation in coastal and estuarine waters parker and mitch 2016 therefore more studies should focus on the environmental photochemical fate of micropollutants under seawater conditions oceans are sinks of aquatic pollutants specially although coastal areas are hotspots for biodiversity biological productivity as well as ecosystem services coastal seawaters in many regions of the world have been seriously polluted in china most of the coastal water areas along the coastline have been exploited for mariculture and the mariculture produces about 70 of the world mariculture products due to mariculture activities wastewater discharge and rivers inputs the coastal seawaters have been eutrophicated as an example it was reported that shrimp production 79 000 tonnes per year in the bohai sea and yellow sea areas caused more than 120 000 tonnes of uneaten feed discharged into the sea xie et al 2013 therefore coastal waters in mariculture and riverine areas usually contain high levels of dom this dom can have varying effects on the fate of organic micropollutants in coastal seawaters therefore the effects of coastal seawater dom on the photochemical fate of organic micropollutants deserve attention 4 conclusion in this study the effects of marine dom isolated from mariculture areas and offshore areas on photochemical behavior of three sas were investigated dom from mariculture areas shows higher reactivity than dom from offshore waters in promoting photodegradation of three sas via the pathway involving marine 3dom dom from the mariculture areas undergoes less photobleaching contains more humic like materials and more aromatic and carbonyl structures which subsequently lead to higher 3dom steady state concentrations and thus higher reactivity on photodegradation of the sas acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural

lime was injected if neutralization needed all tests were carried out at room temperature and in natural ph all experiments were repeated three times the step by step approach was used to determine the optimal conditions for reducing srf in this method one of the parameters is variable and other factors are constant this method is used when the parameters are independent of each other in the fenton method retention time and concentration of iron and peroxide hydrogen were considered as main factors at first a concentration of iron and peroxide hydrogen were determined at a fixed retention time and then optimum retention time was determined in constant amounts of iron and peroxide hydrogen in the electrochemical retention time and voltage were the main parameters at the constant voltages the impact of retention time was investigated for electrochemical fenton method voltage retention time and dosage of iron and peroxide hydrogen were the main factors which were determined by the step by step approach table 2 presents the range of main parameters in processes 2 2 2 eps extraction and analysis the sludge sample in a 50 ml tube was centrifuged centrifuge model biofuge primo r at 6000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was separated as soluble eps the remaining sludge at the bottom of the tube was re suspended in 50 ml sodium chloride 0 05 w v that was heated at 70 c this suspension was mixed by a vortex mixer for 10 min and then was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was collected as loosely bound eps lb eps the residual sludge at the end of the tube was re suspended again in 50 ml sodium chloride 0 05 w v and was heated at 80 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was collected as tightly bound eps tb eps dai et al 2017 the extracted soluble eps lb eps and tb eps were analyzed for doc dissolved organic carbon protein pn and polysaccharide ps before pn ps and doc analyses the samples were filtered by a 0 45 μm ptfe filter the doc was measured by a toc analyzer shimadzu tocv cph the pn was specified by the lowry method using bovine serum albumin as the standard bollag et al 1996 and ps was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 2 2 3 bound water bound water was measured according to a centrifugation method explained by jin et al 2004 thirty five milliliters of the sludge sample was centrifuged at 1057 g for 10 min and the supernatant was separated water amount of remaining sludge at the end of the tube was measured by desiccating sludge sample in an oven at 105 c overnight and was considered as bound water content xiao et al 2017b 2 2 4 other methods in order to measure fe cod total coliform ds and ttf 3500 fe 2520d 9221 2540 and

211 mastersizer and zetasizer nano malvern instruments ltd uk were used to measure the ph size of particles and zeta potential respectively also a filter press eriez laboratory equipment l02 001 u s a was used for sludge dewatering near the electrodes ph was measured by using ph paper ph universal paper merck germany 3 results 3 1 fenton process at first the effect of fe2 and h2o2 concentrations on srf was investigated fig 1 a constant conditions time 20 min initial ph 6 87 0 1 shows when fe2 or h2o2 dosage is zero changes in srf is inconsiderable less than 4 because radical hydroxyl oh is not produced according to reaction 1 where h2o2 50 mg g ds fe2 increase from 0 to 100 mg g ds which lead to srf reduction 37 by increasing h2o2 and fe2 concentration to over 100 mg g ds reaction 2 and 3 brillas et al 2009 gholikandi and masihi 2015 happened that had a negative influence on srf reduction the maximum reduction of srf 62 3 was observed at concentration of h2o2 75 mg g ds and fe2 50 mg g ds fe2 h2o2 0 66 previous studies reported that the optimum ratio of fe2 h2o2 was in the range of 0 6 0 8 yu et al 2016 he et al 2015 fig 1b constant conditions initial ph 6 87 0 1 fe2 50 mg g ds h2o2 75 mg g ds demonstrates the effect of time on ph srf and ttf the maximum decrease of srf 85 3 3 and ttf 54 6 3 happened in the retention time of 40 min but during the time of 40 60 min srf and ttf didn t vary significantly fig 1b shows the ph changes before neutralization too sludge ph decreased from 6 87 0 2 to 3 1 0 1 by fenton process which is in agreement with previous studies bishop et al 1968 walling 1975 in all experiments the dosage of lime for neutralization was 30 5 mg g ds which improved the conditioning of sludge so that 5 7 of srf reduction was related to lime neutralization 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 2 fe2 oh fe3 oh 3 h2o2 oh oh2 h2o 3 2 electrochemical electrolysis process fig 2 a shows the influence of electrolysis voltage and retention time on srf increasing voltage and retention time resulting in srf reduction and we observed that maximum reduction of srf was between 5 and 15 v and the retention time of 15 25 min fig 2a which were similar to the results of yuan et al 2011 in order to accurate voltage determination in the range of 5 15 v the supplementary experiments were carried out fig 2b fig 2b shows that the maximum reduction of srf 14 5 0 5 occurred at the voltage 11 v and retention time 20 min the final ph was 6 7 0 05 after the electrochemical conditioning efficiency of electrochemical on srf is reduced because of cell disruption occurrence of floc structures and formation of smaller particles of sludge fig 2c at the electrolysis voltage 25 v and retention time 30 min emir and erdincler 2006 feng et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 reducing the sludge particle size has a negative effect on conditioning particles which are lower than 10 μm have a severe impact on the sludge dewatering liming et al 2009 fig 2c shows that increasing electrolysis voltage and retention time lead to the formation of fine sludge particles between 0 4 μm and 2 μm new peak to approve the bacterial cell destruction soluble cod and total coliforms were performed table 3 destructing cell wall of the microorganisms leads to live bacteria reduction the penetration of the intracellular material into the supernatant of sludge and increase of soluble organic matter table 3 illustrates that in the electrolysis voltage 25 v and retention time 30 min the soluble cod increased and total coliform decreased so it can be concluded that the cell wall has been destroyed and in the optimum condition voltage 11 v and retention time 20 min a variation of soluble cod total coliform and particles size are not considerable 3 3 electrochemical fenton process effective parameters h2o2 fe2 retention time and electrolysis voltage of electrochemical fenton method on the srf of sludge presented in this section according to the optimum range 5 v voltage 15 v and 15 min retention time 25 min of the electrochemical method voltage and retention time investigated due to a negative effect on the conditioning out of this range fig 3 a indicates the effect of fe2 and h2o2 dosage on srf constant conditions initial ph 6 95 0 1 retention time 15 min electrolysis voltage 5 v in fe2 0 and h2o2 0 srf reduction was 11 8 3 which is related to the electrochemical effect and by increasing fe2 and h2o2 dosage from 0 to 15 mg g ds and 0 25 mg g ds respectively the srf declined 67 4 3 the ratio of fe2 h2o2 0 6 is similar to previous studies gholikandi et al 2014b 2015 and the additional concentration of fe2 and h2o2 had no remarkable effects on srf fig 3b constant conditions initial ph 6 95 0 1 fe2 15 mg g ds h2o2 25 mg g ds shows the impact of electrolysis voltage and retention time on srf in the optimal ranges were obtained from fig 2a on the other hand to optimize energy consumption exact determination of the voltage and time by fig 3b is required maximum reduction of srf 93 8 3 reached in the electrolysis voltage 11 v and retention time 20 min that the contribution of the electrochemical method in srf reduction was 14 5 the energy consumed for per kilogram ds of sludge is 143 5 w for 11 5 0 5 g ds in 0 5 l sludge voltage 11 v i current density 450 30 ma time 20 min the ph and ttf variations with time are shown in fig 3c constant conditions initial ph 6 95 0 1 fe2 15 mg g ds h2o2 25 mg g ds retention time 20min electrolysis voltage 11 v ttf and ph decreased from 270 13 to 65 3 s and 6 95 0 15 to 6 63 0 15 respectively changing in ph was less than 5 therefore electrochemical fenton method didn t require neutralization table 4 illustrates optimal conditions in the fenton electrochemical and electrochemical fenton methods 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of methods on particles size distribution of sludge fig 4 presents the influence of fenton electrochemical and electrochemical fenton processes on particles size distribution of sludge which is obtained under optimal conditions of table 4 in the fenton method d10 a diameter that 10 of sludge particles cross from it d50 a diameter that 50 of sludge particles cross from it and d90 a diameter that 90 of sludge particles cross from it decreased from 8 2 to 4 6 μm reducing 43 9 39 8 to 27 2 μm reducing 31 6 and 81 1 to 68 8 reducing 15 1 μm respectively the hydroxyl radical produced based on reaction 1 destroys the cell wall of organisms and floc that leads to fine particles production in sludge conditioned by fenton process neyens et al 2004 tony et al 2008 he et al 2015 also ph reduction during the fenton process fig 1b leads to decrease floc size wang et al 2017 as the conditioned sludge particles with fenton are smaller than anaerobically digested sludge conditioning to centrifuge and belt filter press might be inappropriate by this method yu et al 2016 but it is suitable for filter press liu et al 2013 the electrochemical procedure decreased d10 d50 and d90 insignificantly less than 10 the electrochemical fenton process reduced d10 7 3 d50 6 5 and d90 6 2 conditioning of sludge with electrochemical fenton method does not have a significant impact on the size of sludge particles which is an advantage of that versus fenton method there are two reasons that why particle size in fenton decreases more than one in electrochemical fenton first in the fenton procedure ph decreased considerably fig 1b which causes desorption of flocs but in the electrochemical fenton method ph decreased inconsiderably fig 3c second chemicals consumption iron and peroxide hydrogen in fenton is more than the electrochemical fenton 3 times therefore radical hydroxyl production in the fenton is more than the electrochemical fenton described in supplementary file radical hydroxyl is the main factor in the production of the sludge fine particles conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton method is suitable for the filter press due to the lacking formation of large sludge particles rather than anaerobically digested sludge 4 2 the influence of procedures on bound water and zeta potential of sludge fig 5 displays the impact of conditioning on bound water and zeta potential under optimal conditions of table 4 elimination of bound water is the principal step to demote sludge water content xiao et al 2017a on the other hand zeta potential negative reduction massive sludge flocs are formed and dewatering enhances gholikandi et al 2018 the bound water and zeta potential negative by the fenton process were reduced from 4 69 0 2 g g ds to 2 25 0 1 g g ds and from 36 1 1 mv to 12 3 1 mv respectively there are two main reasons for negative zeta potential s decline and bound water s reduction diminution of ph during the fenton method fig 1b and creating fe oh n after adding lime wang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 the zeta potential did not change considerably via electrochemical 36 1 1 mv to 33 7 1 mv but the bound water significantly decreased from 4 69 0 2 g g ds to 2 59 0 1 g g ds because the electric field in the electrochemical method leads to bound water migration from the surface of sludge flocs and convert to free water navab daneshmand et al 2015 xiao et al 2017a reducing zeta potential negative is an effective way to acidify the environment wang et al 2017 hydrogen ions h were formed near the anode and zeta potential negative was reduced as ph reached to 2 but in total reactor volume under optimum conditions retention time 20 min ph 6 7 0 05 the amount of hydrogen ion produced during this time was inadequate for significant impact on zeta potential also in the in electrochemical there is no other cation such as fe al for reducing zeta potential negative destruction of tb eps cause zeta potential to reduce gholikandi et al 2018 but in section 4 3 electrochemical under optimal conditions of table 4 didn t have a significant impact on tb eps so there are no significant changes in zeta potential maximum reduction of bound water 65 8 2 and negative zeta potential 84 5 0 5 happened in electrochemical fenton process so that the negative zeta potential and bound water decrease was due to a simultaneous effect of fenton s reaction and electrochemical on sludge dai et al 2017 li et al 2016 fenton s reaction decreased negative zeta potential through the destruction of tb eps and electrochemical reduces bound water via the electric field 4 3 the impact of processes on eps of sludge the key role of eps in sludge dewatering is mentioned in previous studies and is divided into three kinds including lb eps tb eps and soluble eps the reduction of eps especially lb eps and tb eps improves dewaterability sheng et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 gholikandi et al 2018 doc pn and ps were measured for three kinds of eps that their results have been shown in fig 6 the contents of eps are important as the influence of pn is more than ps on dewatering yu et al 2008 liming et al 2009 fig 6a illustrates the variation of eps according to doc soluble eps was increased by fenton and electrochemical fenton method because of destroying the cell wall of microorganisms was by hydroxyl radical reaction 1 and releasing the intra cellular content of it into the supernatant kim et al 2016 the increasing soluble eps in the fenton process is more than the electrochemical fenton method in electrochemical method changes of soluble eps were not remarkable because electrolysis voltage and retention time main factors were selected in a range section 3 2 that has a small effect on disruption of the cell wall lb eps and tb eps were reduced 18 3 and 58 9 respectively by the fenton method fig 6a it was found that effect of fenton on the removal of tb eps was more significant than lb eps the tb eps layer is the closest layer to the microorganism and on the other hand the surface of the bacteria has the negative charges liao et al 2001 when fe2 ions added to the sludge they were absorbed by the negative surface of the microorganisms and fenton s reaction happened near the microorganism where tb eps were located as a result tb eps was reduced more than lb eps to prove this statement variations of tb eps and lb eps which were related to the time are presented in fig 6b the rate of reducing tb eps 30 4 in the retention time of 10 min is 5 times more than the rate of decreasing lb eps 6 1 in the electrochemical method lb eps and tb eps decreased 38 1 and 3 respectively fig 6a previous studies showed that electrochemical has the main effect on lb eps yuan et al 2011 li et al 2016 electrochemical fenton method has the best efficiency because it can decrease lb eps and tb eps significantly and simultaneously the decline of 40 and 61 6 were achieved to lb eps and tb eps respectively by electrochemical fenton fig 6a fig 6c and d shows the variation of pn and ps in the kinds of eps that pn and ps insignificantly grew in soluble eps in all methods in the lb eps and tb eps pn and ps amounts were reduced by electrochemical fenton and fenton methods but electrochemical method decreased pn and ps just in the lb eps 4 4 the effect of procedures on dewatering dewaterability of conditioned sludges was evaluated by a filter press in this section fig 7 a liter of the sample was added to the chamber of filter press and then it was pressed by air compressor at a pressure of 1 10 bars for 30 min dry solid of anaerobically digested sludge without conditioning grew from 2 3 0 5 to 6 0 3 dry solid of conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton and electrochemical fenton increased from 2 3 to 8 5 0 9 29 3 5 and 41 5 respectively cake of conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton method was more voluminous than other cakes economically decreasing volume of sludge leads to reducing costs of sludge transportation molinos senante et al 2013 wei et al 2018 5 overall discussion in this section a comparison between electrochemical fenton and fenton method is presented electrochemical fenton affects srf and ttf more than fenton the retention time of electrochemical fenton process 20 min was half of the fenton method 40 min chemicals consumption in electrochemical fenton was significantly less than fenton the amount of iron remains in conditioned sludge by fenton 25 5 mg g ds is significantly more than the one by electrochemical fenton 5 2 mg g ds these advantages are due to synergistic effect of two methods fenton and electrochemical the rate of fe2 oxidation in reaction 4 in the fenton process is 5000 times faster than the rate of fe3 reduction in reaction 5 also to reduce the fe3 to fe2 hydrogen peroxide is required which leads to increase in the use of this material in fenton method however by the synergistic effect of electrochemical fenton reduction of fe3 to fe2 will happen by reaction 6 the reaction 6 leads to reduce chemicals consumption in the fenton and increases its rate which causes retention time reduction the reaction 7 resulting in deposition of iron ions at the electrode surface and reduces the iron remains in conditioned sludge too reactions gholikandi et al 2015 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 53 76 m 1s 1 4 5 h2o2 fe3 fe2 o2h h 0 01 0 02 m 1s 1 6 fe3 e fe2 7 fe3 aq 3e fe s electrochemical fenton is capable of reducing the lb eps and tb eps simultaneously but fenton is more effective in degradation of tb eps the dry solids of conditioned sludge via electrochemical fenton ds 41 were more than the dry solids of conditioned sludge via fenton ds 29 estimating operation costs for procedures is indicated in table 5 the unit price of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and lime was determined based on obtained data from the local market local prices were more than world prices electricity price was specified according to the average price of the european union eu in non household section european statistics 2017 the cost of conditioning by electrochemical fenton was usd 41 82 per ton ds of sludge while it was usd 77 15 per ton ds of sludge in fenton costs estimation of electrochemical fenton method was compared to the previous study and was found that it is an inexpensive process rather than other presented methods in table 6 6 conclusion in recent years many studies have been conducted by researchers to develop conditioning and dewatering of sludge so that enhancing dewaterability for achieving effective reduction of sludge volume and reducing costs of it are the main goals present investigations evaluated electrochemical fenton method to achieve these aims the results showed that electrochemical fenton is an effective and inexpensive method for sludge handling also as the consumed dosage of iron in electrochemical fenton is lower reuse of conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton has fewer limitations than other methods fenton fenton lime and fecl3 lime this article indicated that electrochemical fenton method can be considered as a new alternative to wastewater

liu et al 2012 lime liang et al 2015 surfactant hong et al 2017 ultrasonic jiang et al 2014 and red mud zhang et al 2014 to improve conditioning and dewatering was investigated these studies reported the reduction of specific resistance to filtration srf in sludge more than 90 and their efficiencies were better than fenton process on the other hand enhancement of sludge conditioning and dewatering processes with electrochemical methods electrolysis has been proved by yuan et al 2010 and gharibi et al 2013 so that more than 15 decrease in capillary suction time cst was achieved yuan et al 2010 gharibi et al 2013 due to the results of current studies electrochemical and fenton methods are individually able to improve sludge conditioning and dewatering by destroying the structure of extracellular polymeric substances eps zhang et al 2015 yuan et al 2011 in recent years the performance of combining electrochemical and fenton processes to remove organic load gholikandi et al 2014a reduce heavy metals gholikandi et al 2017a and stabilize gholikandi et al 2017b of waste activated sludge has been conducted and evaluated the advantages of electrochemical fenton method rather than fenton are increasing the reaction rate of fenton reducing the consumption of chemicals iron and hydrogen peroxide and decreasing retention time gholikandi and masihi 2015 based on these studies electrochemical fenton method is considered as a suitable solution for conditioning and dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge in order to reliability accessibility and high efficiency of the process in this study the influence of electrochemical fenton process on conditioning and dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge was evaluated also a comparison between electrochemical fenton electrochemical and fenton was made experiments were carried out in neutral ph no acidification and the influences of the fundamental parameters h2o2 and fe2 dosage the voltage of electrochemical cell and retention time on srf and ttf time to filter of sludge were investigated the functional mechanism of the fenton electrochemical method on sludge conditioning and dewatering was determined by analysis of eps particle size distribution zeta potential and bound water tests and operating costs were estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 anaerobically digested sludge the sample

lime was injected if neutralization needed all tests were carried out at room temperature and in natural ph all experiments were repeated three times the step by step approach was used to determine the optimal conditions for reducing srf in this method one of the parameters is variable and other factors are constant this method is used when the parameters are independent of each other in the fenton method retention time and concentration of iron and peroxide hydrogen were considered as main factors at first a concentration of iron and peroxide hydrogen were determined at a fixed retention time and then optimum retention time was determined in constant amounts of iron and peroxide hydrogen in the electrochemical retention time and voltage were the main parameters at the constant voltages the impact of retention time was investigated for electrochemical fenton method voltage retention time and dosage of iron and peroxide hydrogen were the main factors which were determined by the step by step approach table 2 presents the range of main parameters in processes 2 2 2 eps extraction and analysis the sludge sample in a 50 ml tube was centrifuged centrifuge model biofuge primo r at 6000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was separated as soluble eps the remaining sludge at the bottom of the tube was re suspended in 50 ml sodium chloride 0 05 w v that was heated at 70 c this suspension was mixed by a vortex mixer for 10 min and then was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was collected as loosely bound eps lb eps the residual sludge at the end of the tube was re suspended again in 50 ml sodium chloride 0 05 w v and was heated at 80 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was collected as tightly bound eps tb eps dai et al 2017 the extracted soluble eps lb eps and tb eps were analyzed for doc dissolved organic carbon protein pn and polysaccharide ps before pn ps and doc analyses the samples were filtered by a 0 45 μm ptfe filter the doc was measured by a toc analyzer shimadzu tocv cph the pn was specified by the lowry method using bovine serum albumin as the standard bollag et al 1996 and ps was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 2 2 3 bound water bound water was measured according to a centrifugation method explained by jin et al 2004 thirty five milliliters of the sludge sample was centrifuged at 1057 g for 10 min and the supernatant was separated water amount of remaining sludge at the end of the tube was measured by desiccating sludge sample in an oven at 105 c overnight and was considered as bound water content xiao et al 2017b 2 2 4 other methods in order to measure fe cod total coliform ds and ttf 3500 fe 2520d 9221 2540 and 2710h of standard methods were used respectively apha 1999 srf was measured by using a buchner funnel with a whatman no 1 filter paper and exerting vacuum suction to et al 2016 ph meter hanna ph meter 211 mastersizer and zetasizer nano malvern instruments ltd uk were used to measure the ph size of particles and zeta potential respectively also a filter press eriez laboratory equipment l02 001 u s a was used for sludge dewatering near the electrodes ph was measured by using ph paper ph universal paper merck germany 3 results 3 1 fenton process at first the effect of fe2 and h2o2 concentrations on srf was investigated fig 1 a constant conditions time 20 min initial ph 6 87 0 1 shows when fe2 or h2o2 dosage is zero changes in srf is inconsiderable less than 4 because radical hydroxyl oh is not produced according to reaction 1 where h2o2 50 mg g ds fe2 increase from 0 to 100 mg g ds which lead to srf reduction 37 by increasing h2o2 and fe2 concentration to over 100 mg g ds reaction 2 and 3 brillas et al 2009 gholikandi and masihi 2015 happened that had a negative influence on srf reduction the maximum reduction of srf 62 3 was observed at concentration of h2o2 75 mg g ds and fe2 50 mg g ds fe2 h2o2 0 66 previous studies reported that the optimum ratio of fe2 h2o2 was in the range of 0 6 0 8 yu et al 2016 he et al 2015 fig 1b constant conditions initial ph 6 87 0 1 fe2 50 mg g ds h2o2 75 mg g ds demonstrates the effect of time on ph srf and ttf the maximum decrease of srf 85 3 3 and ttf 54 6 3 happened in the retention time of 40 min but during the time of 40 60 min srf and ttf didn t vary significantly fig 1b shows the ph changes before neutralization too sludge ph decreased from 6 87 0 2 to 3 1 0 1 by fenton process which is in agreement with previous studies bishop et al 1968 walling 1975 in all experiments the dosage of lime for neutralization was 30 5 mg g ds which improved the conditioning of sludge so that 5 7 of srf reduction was related to lime neutralization 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 2 fe2 oh fe3 oh 3 h2o2 oh oh2 h2o 3 2 electrochemical electrolysis process fig 2 a shows the influence of electrolysis voltage and retention time on srf increasing voltage and retention time resulting in srf reduction and we observed that maximum reduction of srf was between 5 and 15 v and the retention time of 15 25 min fig 2a which were similar to the results of yuan et al 2011 in order to accurate voltage determination in the range of 5 15 v the supplementary experiments were carried out fig 2b fig 2b shows that the maximum reduction of srf 14 5 0 5 occurred at the voltage 11 v and retention time 20 min the final ph was 6 7 0 05 after the electrochemical conditioning efficiency of electrochemical on srf is reduced because of cell disruption occurrence of floc structures and formation of smaller particles of sludge fig 2c at the electrolysis voltage 25 v and retention time 30 min emir and erdincler 2006 feng et al 2009 yuan et al 2011 reducing the sludge particle size has a negative effect on conditioning particles which are lower than 10 μm have a severe impact on the sludge dewatering liming et al 2009 fig 2c shows that increasing electrolysis voltage and retention time lead to the formation of fine sludge particles between 0 4 μm and 2 μm new peak to approve the bacterial cell destruction soluble cod and total coliforms were performed table 3 destructing cell wall of the microorganisms leads to live bacteria reduction the penetration of the intracellular material into the supernatant of sludge and increase of soluble organic matter table 3 illustrates that in the electrolysis voltage 25 v and retention time 30 min the soluble cod increased and total coliform decreased so it can be concluded that the cell wall has been destroyed and in the optimum condition voltage 11 v and retention time 20 min a variation of soluble cod total coliform and particles size are not considerable 3 3 electrochemical fenton process effective parameters h2o2 fe2 retention time and electrolysis voltage of electrochemical fenton method on the srf of sludge presented in this section according to the optimum range 5 v voltage 15 v and 15 min retention time 25 min of the electrochemical method voltage and retention time investigated due to a negative effect on the conditioning out of this range fig 3 a indicates the effect of fe2 and h2o2 dosage on srf constant conditions initial ph 6 95 0 1 retention time 15 min electrolysis voltage 5 v in fe2 0 and h2o2 0 srf reduction was 11 8 3 which is related to the electrochemical effect and by increasing fe2 and h2o2 dosage from 0 to 15 mg g ds and 0 25 mg g ds respectively the srf declined 67 4 3 the ratio of fe2 h2o2 0 6 is similar to previous studies gholikandi et al 2014b 2015 and the additional concentration of fe2 and h2o2 had no remarkable effects on srf fig 3b constant conditions initial ph 6 95 0 1 fe2 15 mg g ds h2o2 25 mg g ds shows the impact of electrolysis voltage and retention time on srf in the optimal ranges were obtained from fig 2a on the other hand to optimize energy consumption exact determination of the voltage and time by fig 3b is required maximum reduction of srf 93 8 3 reached in the electrolysis voltage 11 v and retention time 20 min that the contribution of the electrochemical method in srf reduction was 14 5 the energy consumed for per kilogram ds of sludge is 143 5 w for 11 5 0 5 g ds in 0 5 l sludge voltage 11 v i current density 450 30 ma time 20 min the ph and ttf variations with time are shown in fig 3c constant conditions initial ph 6 95 0 1 fe2 15 mg g ds h2o2 25 mg g ds retention time 20min electrolysis voltage 11 v ttf and ph decreased from 270 13 to 65 3 s and 6 95 0 15 to 6 63 0 15 respectively changing in ph was less than 5 therefore electrochemical fenton method didn t require neutralization table 4 illustrates optimal conditions in the fenton electrochemical and electrochemical fenton methods 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of methods on particles size distribution of sludge fig 4 presents the influence of fenton electrochemical and electrochemical fenton processes on particles size distribution of sludge which is obtained under optimal conditions of table 4 in the fenton method d10 a diameter that 10 of sludge particles cross from it d50 a diameter that 50 of sludge particles cross from it and d90 a diameter that 90 of sludge particles cross from it decreased from 8 2 to 4 6 μm reducing 43 9 39 8 to 27 2 μm reducing 31 6 and 81 1 to 68 8 reducing 15 1 μm respectively the hydroxyl radical produced based on reaction 1 destroys the cell wall of organisms and floc that leads to fine particles production in sludge conditioned by fenton process neyens et al 2004 tony et al 2008 he et al 2015 also ph reduction during the fenton process fig 1b leads to decrease floc size wang et al 2017 as the conditioned sludge particles with fenton are smaller than anaerobically digested sludge conditioning to centrifuge and belt filter press might be inappropriate by this method yu et al 2016 but it is suitable for filter press liu et al 2013 the electrochemical procedure decreased d10 d50 and d90 insignificantly less than 10 the electrochemical fenton process reduced d10 7 3 d50 6 5 and d90 6 2 conditioning of sludge with electrochemical fenton method does not have a significant impact on the size of sludge particles which is an advantage of that versus fenton method there are two reasons that why particle size in fenton decreases more than one in electrochemical fenton first in the fenton procedure ph decreased considerably fig 1b which causes desorption of flocs but in the electrochemical fenton method ph decreased inconsiderably fig 3c second chemicals consumption iron and peroxide hydrogen in fenton is more than the electrochemical fenton 3 times therefore radical hydroxyl production in the fenton is more than the electrochemical fenton described in supplementary file radical hydroxyl is the main factor in the production of the sludge fine particles conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton method is suitable for the filter press due to the lacking formation of large sludge particles rather than anaerobically digested sludge 4 2 the influence of procedures on bound water and zeta potential of sludge fig 5 displays the impact of conditioning on bound water and zeta potential under optimal conditions of table 4 elimination of bound water is the principal step to demote sludge water content xiao et al 2017a on the other hand zeta potential negative reduction massive sludge flocs are formed and dewatering enhances gholikandi et al 2018 the bound water and zeta potential negative by the fenton process were reduced from 4 69 0 2 g g ds to 2 25 0 1 g g ds and from 36 1 1 mv to 12 3 1 mv respectively there are two main reasons for negative zeta potential s decline and bound water s reduction diminution of ph during the fenton method fig 1b and creating fe oh n after adding lime wang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 the zeta potential did not change considerably via electrochemical 36 1 1 mv to 33 7 1 mv but the bound water significantly decreased from 4 69 0 2 g g ds to 2 59 0 1 g g ds because the electric field in the electrochemical method leads to bound water migration from the surface of sludge flocs and convert to free water navab daneshmand et al 2015 xiao et al 2017a reducing zeta potential negative is an effective way to acidify the environment wang et al 2017 hydrogen ions h were formed near the anode and zeta potential negative was reduced as ph reached to 2 but in total reactor volume under optimum conditions retention time 20 min ph 6 7 0 05 the amount of hydrogen ion produced during this time was inadequate for significant impact on zeta potential also in the in electrochemical there is no other cation such as fe al for reducing zeta potential negative destruction of tb eps cause zeta potential to reduce gholikandi et al 2018 but in section 4 3 electrochemical under optimal conditions of table 4 didn t have a significant impact on tb eps so there are no significant changes in zeta potential maximum reduction of bound water 65 8 2 and negative zeta potential 84 5 0 5 happened in electrochemical fenton process so that the negative zeta potential and bound water decrease was due to a simultaneous effect of fenton s reaction and electrochemical on sludge dai et al 2017 li et al 2016 fenton s reaction decreased negative zeta potential through the destruction of tb eps and electrochemical reduces bound water via the electric field 4 3 the impact of processes on eps of sludge the key role of eps in sludge dewatering is mentioned in previous studies and is divided into three kinds including lb eps tb eps and soluble eps the reduction of eps especially lb eps and tb eps improves dewaterability sheng et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 gholikandi et al 2018 doc pn and ps were measured for three kinds of eps that their results have been shown in fig 6 the contents of eps are important as the influence of pn is more than ps on dewatering yu et al 2008 liming et al 2009 fig 6a illustrates the variation of eps according to doc soluble eps was increased by fenton and electrochemical fenton method because of destroying the cell wall of microorganisms was by hydroxyl radical reaction 1 and releasing the intra cellular content of it into the supernatant kim et al 2016 the increasing soluble eps in the fenton process is more than the electrochemical fenton method in electrochemical method changes of soluble eps were not remarkable because electrolysis voltage and retention time main factors were selected in a range section 3 2 that has a small effect on disruption of the cell wall lb eps and tb eps were reduced 18 3 and 58 9 respectively by the fenton method fig 6a it was found that effect of fenton on the removal of tb eps was more significant than lb eps the tb eps layer is the closest layer to the microorganism and on the other hand the surface of the bacteria has the negative charges liao et al 2001 when fe2 ions added to the sludge they were absorbed by the negative surface of the microorganisms and fenton s reaction happened near the microorganism where tb eps were located as a result tb eps was reduced more than lb eps to prove this statement variations of tb eps and lb eps which were related to the time are presented in fig 6b the rate of reducing tb eps 30 4 in the retention time of 10 min is 5 times more than the rate of decreasing lb eps 6 1 in the electrochemical method lb eps and tb eps decreased 38 1 and 3 respectively fig 6a previous studies showed that electrochemical has the main effect on lb eps yuan et al 2011 li et al 2016 electrochemical fenton method has the best efficiency because it can decrease lb eps and tb eps significantly and simultaneously the decline of 40 and 61 6 were achieved to lb eps and tb eps respectively by electrochemical fenton fig 6a fig 6c and d shows the variation of pn and ps in the kinds of eps that pn and ps insignificantly grew in soluble eps in all methods in the lb eps and tb eps pn and ps amounts were reduced by electrochemical fenton and fenton methods but electrochemical method decreased pn and ps just in the lb eps 4 4 the effect of procedures on dewatering dewaterability of conditioned sludges was evaluated by a filter press in this section fig 7 a liter of the sample was added to the chamber of filter press and then it was pressed by air compressor at a pressure of 1 10 bars for 30 min dry solid of anaerobically digested sludge without conditioning grew from 2 3 0 5 to 6 0 3 dry solid of conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton and electrochemical fenton increased from 2 3 to 8 5 0 9 29 3 5 and 41 5 respectively cake of conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton method was more voluminous than other cakes economically decreasing volume of sludge leads to reducing costs of sludge transportation molinos senante et al 2013 wei et al 2018 5 overall discussion in this section a comparison between electrochemical fenton and fenton method is presented electrochemical fenton affects srf and ttf more than fenton the retention time of electrochemical fenton process 20 min was half of the fenton method 40 min chemicals consumption in electrochemical fenton was significantly less than fenton the amount of iron remains in conditioned sludge by fenton 25 5 mg g ds is significantly more than the one by electrochemical fenton 5 2 mg g ds these advantages are due to synergistic effect of two methods fenton and electrochemical the rate of fe2 oxidation in reaction 4 in the fenton process is 5000 times faster than the rate of fe3 reduction in reaction 5 also to reduce the fe3 to fe2 hydrogen peroxide is required which leads to increase in the use of this material in fenton method however by the synergistic effect of electrochemical fenton reduction of fe3 to fe2 will happen by reaction 6 the reaction 6 leads to reduce chemicals consumption in the fenton and increases its rate which causes retention time reduction the reaction 7 resulting in deposition of iron ions at the electrode surface and reduces the iron remains in conditioned sludge too reactions gholikandi et al 2015 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 53 76 m 1s 1 4 5 h2o2 fe3 fe2 o2h h 0 01 0 02 m 1s 1 6 fe3 e fe2 7 fe3 aq 3e fe s electrochemical fenton is capable of reducing the lb eps and tb eps simultaneously but fenton is more effective in degradation of tb eps the dry solids of conditioned sludge via electrochemical fenton ds 41 were more than the dry solids of conditioned sludge via fenton ds 29 estimating operation costs for procedures is indicated in table 5 the unit price of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and lime was determined based on obtained data from the local market local prices were more than world prices electricity price was specified according to the average price of the european union eu in non household section european statistics 2017 the cost of conditioning by electrochemical fenton was usd 41 82 per ton ds of sludge while it was usd 77 15 per ton ds of sludge in fenton costs estimation of electrochemical fenton method was compared to the previous study and was found that it is an inexpensive process rather than other presented methods in table 6 6 conclusion in recent years many studies have been conducted by researchers to develop conditioning and dewatering of sludge so that enhancing dewaterability for achieving effective reduction of sludge volume and reducing costs of it are the main goals present investigations evaluated electrochemical fenton method to achieve these aims the results showed that electrochemical fenton is an effective and inexpensive method for sludge handling also as the consumed dosage of iron in electrochemical fenton is lower reuse of conditioned sludge by electrochemical fenton has fewer limitations than other methods fenton fenton lime and fecl3 lime this article indicated that electrochemical fenton method can be considered as a new alternative to wastewater

19374,among available technologies to ensure drinking water security reverse osmosis ro has become the gold standard for purification due to its maturity and reliability however high energy consumption and low water recovery are the major impediments for extensive adoption of ro multi stage ro process is an innovative system design that can offer a more effective way to improve energy efficiency and water recovery but it is rarely employed for disinfection by product dbp treatment in drinking water thus this study applied multi stage ro to treat water containing haloacetic acids haas a prevalent class of dbps with widespread occurrence and high toxicity under a variety of environmental and operational conditions overall we found that 75 haas were rejected and 87 of water was recovered with a five stage ro process for compounds with identical number of halogen substitutions iodinated brominated and chlorinated haas were almost equally removed however highly halogenated species were easier to be rejected than lowly halogenated haas by developing quantitative structure activity relationship models the importance of size exclusion charge repulsion and hydrophobic interaction effects on multi stage ro removal was revealed environmental and operational variables like ph operating pressure water matrix and membrane age also played important roles in this process increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 5 and membrane age apparently enhanced haa rejections in contrast haa rejection increased only slightly from an operating pressure of 4 6 bars but decreased markedly from 6 to 8 bars compared to ultrapure water equal or higher removal efficiency was observed for haas spiked to tap water considering the need to balance water quality and quantity a four stage ro was preferred under this study s condition graphical abstract image 1 keywords multi stage reverses osmosis haloacetic acids qsar purification 1 introduction in drinking water disinfection by products dbps are substances formed in the reactions between disinfectants and organic matter li and mitch 2018 haloacetic acids haas are a prevalent class of dbps widely reported with considerable concentrations and potent toxicity for instance the concentrations of nine chlorinated cl and brominated br haas including chloroacetic acid caa bromoacetic acid baa dichloroacetic acid dcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa dibromochloroacetic acid dbcaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa ranged from 1 0 to 170 0 μg l 1 with a median of 23 μg l 1 across the united states mcguire et al 2003 in finished drinking water haa concentrations reached as high as 94 5 87 0 224 0 and 118 0 μg l 1 in canada king et al 2004 spain villanueva et al 2003 england malliarou et al 2005 and china chang et al 2010 respectively in terms of toxicity many haas have chronic cytotoxicity and acute genotoxicity plewa et al 2010 and an epidemiological study has proven that co exposure to br trihalomethanes and tcaa was associated with decreased semen quality zeng et al 2016 therefore many governments and organizations including the united states china and the world health organization have regulated the concentrations of certain haas in drinking water to comply with these regulations and to mitigate haa risks stakeholders have embraced a series of management strategies including water resource protection xie 2003 treatment technology optimization lifongo et al 2004 hua and reckhow 2013 pipe network rehabilitation bond et al 2011 and household treatment lifongo et al 2010 shi et al 2017 in recent decades membrane process has emerged as an attractive technology for advanced water reclamation han et al 2015 purification baek et al 2014 and treatment yin and deng 2015 as one of the widely used membrane technologies reverse osmosis ro is robust for desalination and rejection of numerous organic pollutants including dbps kimura et al 2003 fujioka et al 2013a pesticides pei et al 2005 plakas and karabelas 2012 pharmaceuticals yi et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 endocrine disrupters coday et al 2014 and personal care products yi et al 2017 for haas 90 cl haa rejections have been reported with the use of low pressure ro cartridges kimura et al 2003 in another study excellent removals of br haas were also observed yang et al 2017 the ro membrane made with polyamide showed better performance than the one made with cellulose acetate in terms of haa removal and acid resistance kimura et al 2003 agus and sedlak 2010 however earlier studies often focused on one or two haas but did not compare multiple haa species meanwhile some operating and environmental conditions such as input pressure ph feeding concentration water matrix components and membrane age may play important roles in the ro process kimura et al 2003 agus and sedlak 2010 yang et al 2017 that are currently unknown therefore a comprehensive evaluation of ro on the treatment of a variety of haas appears necessary conventionally a ro system applies only one membrane module to treat water although simple and convenient a single stage ro is neither energy efficient nor water saving usually 50 water is wasted as brine thereby inhibiting its wide acceptance elimelech and phillip 2011 lin and elimelech 2017 one solution to this obstacle is to develop a new process using multiple ro membrane modules sequentially zhu et al 2009 2010 or to optimize the process vince et al 2008 karuppiah et al 2012 this solution is especially important since the costs associated with water pretreatment and retentate management would decrease if water recovery increased elimelech and phillip 2011 using theoretical calculations lin and elimelech 2015 indicated that a four stage ro could save 60 more energy than a single stage ro which translates into a savings of 0 67 kwh m 3 in desalinating brackish water with a salinity of 5000 mg l 1 when water recovery is maintained at 90 however despite the benefits of saving energy and water in wastewater treatment lin and elimelech 2015 2017 a multi stage ro is rarely employed to control dbps in drinking water to our knowledge only one study has been conducted on the multi stage ro system to remove n nitrosamines nas fujioka et al 2013b in which three full scale water recycling plants in austria showed that na rejections varied considerably among ro stages and na species the reason for na rejections was mainly ascribed to the effect of size exclusion however the rejection of deprotonated compounds like haa may involve not only size exclusion but also electrostatic interaction yang et al 2017 which remains quantitatively unclear the purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms and affecting factors during haa removal using the multi stage ro process which is designed to balance the needs of water quality and quantity the mechanisms evaluated include size exclusion electrostatic interaction namely charge repulsion and hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between a membrane and haas the influencing factors examined include environmental conditions like ph and haa feeding concentration as well as operating factors like operation pressure and membrane age in addition a comparison was made of haa removals dosed to ultrapure water and real tap water hopefully the information may aid in a better understanding of multi stage ro for haa rejection 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and membranes seven haas haa7 were tested including

structure of the ro membrane is illustrated in fig s1 this membrane s water permeability was determined to be 1 36 10 6 m3 m 2 s 1 bar 1 using a method described in the earlier literature zhao et al 2017 which was higher than the membrane reported in that literature the average nacl rejection of this membrane was 97 5 for removing 250 mg l 1 nacl under 4 bar and 25 c which was slightly lower than the membrane 99 reported in the literature zhao et al 2017 2 2 multi stage ro system and operations the flow diagram of the multi stage ro system is shown in fig 1 in general samples went through several sequential ro stages for example after the first stage of ro treatment the feed water was divided into permeate namely filtrate and retentate namely concentrate or brine solutions subsequently the second stage of the ro process was fed by the retentate obtained from the first stage the process was repeated several times until the retentate water volume became 1 10 of the initial water volume that is 90 of water recovery during the process backpressure relief valves needle valves swagelok sunnyvale ca usa and pumps typ 2500 deng yuan industrial co ltd china were placed in line to maintain the desired pressure the feeding water was prepared by dissolving a mixture of haa7 each 50 μg l 1 into 3l ultrapure water plus 10 mg cl l 1 nacl which served as an indicator of desalination efficiency for the system the experiments were conducted in an air conditioned room at 25 1 c the operating pressures varied from 4 to the 6 to the 8 bars by adjusting the valve the impact of the initial ph was tested at phs of 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 by dosing different amounts of naoh although this process may create a small salinity difference among samples the difference level was μg l 1 which is negligible after each round of operation the ro system was immediately cleansed with 2 l milli q water to minimize the potential impact on the next operation round 2 3 analytical methods the haas were determined using a modified usepa 552 3 method as described previously wang et al 2017 using liquid liquid extraction the methylated haas were measured using a gas chromatograph gc with an electron capture detector gc9720 zhejiang fuli analytical instrument co ltd china and a db 5 gc column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent the method detection limits for haa7 were less than 1 μg l 1 for each compound the ph value and chloride concentration were determined using a ph meter thermo fisher model 8103bn and an ion chromatograph ic 2010 tosoh japan respectively 2 4 mathematical calculations 2 4 1 haa rejection and water recovery based on the concentration differences between the feed and permeate water total haa rejections after multi stage ro r total and each ro stage r i were calculated using equations 1 and 2 as shown below fujioka et al 2013a similarly the total recoveries of water in multi stage ro r total and each stage of ro r i were determined with equations 3 and 4 1 r total 1

p i is the solute concentration in the permeate of stage i ro μg l 1 v p i is the permeate volume of stage i ro l and v f i is the feed volume of stage i ro l 2 4 2 molecular stokes radius as a function of haa types to understand the size effect on haa rejection the stokes radii r s of haa7 were calculated using the stokes einstein equation as follows assuming solutes are spherical objects einstein 1956 6 r s nm kt 6 π η b d bw where ĸ is the boltzmann constant j k 1 t is the absolute temperature in k η b is the solution s dynamic viscosity pa s and d bw m2 s 1 is the diffusion

estimated via the tyn calus method equation 8 using the critical volume of solute v c cm3 2 4 3 debye radius as a function of ionic strength for electrolytes the debye radius λ d nm is a measure of the charge carrier s net electrostatic effect and it was computed with equation 9 provided in the literature russel et al 1989 9 λ d nm ε r ε 0 kt 2 n a e 2 i m 10 λ b nm e 2 4 π ε 0 ε r kt 11 λ d nm 1 8 π λ b n a i m 12 λ d nm 0 3082 i m where ε r is the relative dielectric constant of the medium ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity n a is the avogadro number e is the elementary charge and i m is the ionic strength in molar basis mol l 1 bjerrum length λ b nm is an indicator of the electrostatic interaction between two elementary charges which is generally used in discussions of electrostatic electrodynamic and electrokinetic phenomena in electrolytes λ b is calculated with equation 10 which can be converted to equation 11 under standard units at room temperature t 300 k ε r is roughly equal to 80 accordingly λ b is 0 7 nm subsequently λ d can be determined with equation 12 heimburg 2008 2 4 4 quantitative structure activity relationship qsar modeling qsar analyses are often used to identify the relationships among compounds with similar structures by assuming that the activity differences of compounds are mainly ascribed to the type number steric and electronic features of their functional groups chen et al 2015 to our knowledge only one qsar model has been developed previously for single stage ro and the target dbps were neutral noncharged species instead of charged dbps doederer et al 2014 therefore we developed qsar models to correlate haa structures with their rejection behaviors the qsar model was built up according to an empirical equation as below 13 p i 1 n 1 i n j n a ij d ij b where p is the overall rejection of contaminants with a multi stage ro system a ij and b are the constants obtained from single and multiple linear regressions respectively and d ij is a molecular descriptor used to characterize the compound structure 3 results and discussion 3 1 haa rejection efficiency 3 1 1 overall performance and qsar modeling fig 2 shows the rejections of haa7 each haa at 50 μg l 1 with the five stage ro treatment in general the ultimate rejection efficiency ranged from 74 6 to 98 0 for all haas confirming that ro is a robust tool for removing haas the smallest haa caa was rejected by 74 6 1 4 a little lower than the results reported in an earlier study using a membrane made of polyamide 86 0 agus and sedlak 2010 but higher than in another study that applied a ro membrane made of cellulose acetate 50 yang et al 2017 the relative haa rejections were ranked as tri di mono haas for the compounds with identical halogen types while iodinated i brominated br and chlorinated cl haas behaved similarly if these compounds had equal halogenation degrees for example although the mw of iaa 185 9 g mol 1 was greater than bcaa 173 3 g mol 1 and tcaa 163 3 g mol 1 iaa rejection using the multi stage ro process was 17 7 and 23 1 lower than bcaa and tcaa respectively this phenomenon indicated that ro filterability for haas increased with an increasing halogenation degree but was somehow irrelevant to halogen molecular weights mws which matches well with an earlier study kimura et al 2003 agus and sedlak 2010 because iaa was not previously investigated the results of this study appear to be the first reporting the rejection of iodinated haa by ro to identify the rejection mechanism s we made some qsar analyses to evaluate the influences of structural factors on haa performance initially we selected six commonly used molecular descriptors for evaluation including mw r s steric effect constants of halogens es electronic effect constants of halogens σ acid dissociation constants pka and the logarithmic octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow next these descriptors were correlated separately with the haa rejection efficiencies to quantify their individual contributions then multiple descriptors were grouped together to improve the modeling performance however to avoid inter correlations among descriptors i e r2 0 95 σ and es were excluded based on the criteria provided in the literature wang et al 2017 ultimately only four descriptors i e mw r s pka and the log kow were selected to establish qsar models and their values are presented in table s1 table 1 lists the qsar modeling results for a variety of models haa rejections by ro roughly increased as mws increased as shown in the first model perhaps due to the size exclusion effect doederer et al 2014 however mw alone was poorly correlated with the haa rejection behaviors r2 0 18 table 1 suggesting that mw may not be a proper size exclusion descriptor in the literature the molecular stokes radius r s was once used to indicate the molecular sieving effect of membranes dražević et al 2017 yang et al 2017 therefore we correlated haa r s with the haa rejections fig 2 of all models using only one molecular descriptor r s was the best descriptor with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 84 table 1 thus the results somehow supported that the size exclusion of organic solutes was the major mechanism responsible for haa rejections by ro when the log kow was also included the r2 between rtotal and paired descriptors improved significantly to 0 97 suggesting that the hydrophobic interaction between solute and membrane was the second important mechanism beyond that the best correlation was achieved using three descriptors together i e r s pka and the log kow resulting in an r2 of 0 98 model 8 in table 1 although the improvement of r2 was not significant relative to the paired model the result implies that pka is also a non negligible factor in removing haas with the multi stage ro process 3 1 2 prediction of haa overall rejections and benefit analysis although the multi stage ro process is advantageous in reducing energy consumption and improving water recovery the number of ro stages must be minimized to save the capital investment to identify the optimal ro stage we investigated the rejections of target haas under varying multi stage ro processes fig s2 and table s2 then we developed qsar models for each multi stage ro r2 0 90 table s3 and fig s3 according to the method provided in section 3 1 1 subsequently the rejections of 19 cl br and i haas under varying multi stage ro processes were predicted with the constructed models fig 3 a and table s4 then an integral parameter named the efficiency index η r total r total was defined to balance the contrasting effects on decreasing haa rejection and increasing water recovery along the ro process fig 3b presents the η curves as a function of ro stage numbers for all nineteen haas classified in three subgroups for all haas selected η reached the maximum at the optimal stage then it remained flat or slightly decreased when the stage number increased meaning no further benefit would be obtained using more than the optimal stage ro however the optimal stage varied among haas for example the removal of mono haas only required three stage ro to achieve an optimal η whereas tri haas required five stage ro to achieve the peak fig 3b inset thus to select a proper ro stage haa speciations in the water should also be considered 3 1 3 ro performance in each stage previously although some studies have employed two or three ro modules to treat contaminants magara et al 1998 fujioka et al 2012a no study has provided the rejection details of each ro stage thus this study investigated the rejection efficiencies of haas in each of the five ro stages fig 4 during the process haa rejections decreased progressively from the first 95 2 2 4 to the fifth stage 76 9 22 7 especially for those haas with small r s mono haas fig 4a the worsening performance along stages may be attributed to either membrane deterioration or solute changes to explain it we checked chloride rejections along ro stages and found that the rejection efficiencies of chloride were constantly high 95 in each stage fig 4b indicating that ro membranes were working properly and not deteriorated therefore we hypothesized that the escalated ionic strengthen may have led to the performance difference since the concentrations of haas and chloride in retentate increased progressively fig s4a we hereafter calculated the effective molecular sizes r eff of haas to reflect the impact of ionic strength according to an equation proposed in the literature heimburg 2008 yang et al 2017 14 r eff r s k λ d where k is a dimensionless fitting coefficient r s is the stokes einstein radius nm that can be used to reflect the size exclusion effect in the membrane filtration process and λ d is the debye radius nm for estimating the effect of electrostatic interaction which is mainly controlled by ion strength as seen when the ionic strength of the retentate kept increasing along the ro stages fig s4 λ d was reduced sequentially from 18 nm at the 1st stage to 10 nm at the 5th stage which subsequently decreased the electrostatic repulsion and haa rejections heimburg 2008 fig s5 plots the haa rejections at each stage as a function of changing r eff with a fitting r2 as 0 83 hence the results supported our hypothesis that the ionic strength increases caused the decreased ro rejection moreover the results indicated that haas with effective radii larger than tcaa such as dcbaa dbcaa and tbaa yang et al 2017 may be completely removed regardless of ro stage which could be supported by another ro study fujioka et al 2013b in addition to haas and salt concentrations the water volumes in each stage were also recorded during the multi stage ro process fig 4b and fig s4 although the volumes of feed permeate and retentate kept decreasing fig 4b the fractional water recovery in each stage i e permeate volume divided by feed water volume remained almost unchanged 40 during the first four stages not until the fifth stage did the water recovery decrease by 27 fig 4b which suggested that a salt content threshold controls the membrane permeability in water recovery in light of this finding highly saline water is probably more difficult to treat with the multi stage ro process 3 2 factors affecting haa rejections 3 2 1 effect of operating pressure in this part the operating pressure varied from 4 to 6 8 bars which was near the limit allowed by ro guidance 8 5 bar fig 5 shows the overall haa rejections as a function of operating pressure for the multi stage ro system in general haa rejections at the 4 and the 6 bars were approximately identical or only slightly increased with increasing pressure fig 5 indicating that increasing the operating pressure could only lead to enhanced water flux but would change haa rejections little to achieve the targeted water recovery 90 nine and five ro stages were needed for the operation pressure of the 4 and the 6 bars respectively but only one stage was needed for the 8 bar fig s6 however when the operating pressure was too high the 8 bar ro rejected much lower haas than at the 4 and the 6 bars fig 5 so perhaps an optimal operating pressure could achieve high water quality with as few ro modules as possible the reason for the worsened rejection at the 8 bar was likely related to the membrane reformation as a result of the imposed pressure which may have led to an enlarged membrane surface area and pore size reduced membrane thickness and collapse of the membrane structure kahdim et al 2003 kim et al 2018 in addition strong evidence also existed from the dramatic decline of chloride rejection at the 8 bar fig 5 3 2 2 effect of ph solution ph is perhaps an important factor for the ro process because it may influence not only haa speciation but also the charge and zeta potential of the membrane yang et al 2017 fig 6 presents the effect of initial ph on overall haa rejections with a multi stage ro haa rejections were significantly higher in neutral i e ph 7 5 and weak basic i e ph 8 5 solutions than in weak acidic water i e ph 6 5 the reason is likely due to the influence of ph on the membrane material i e polyamide which has an isoelectric point of ph 3 4 yang et al 2017 because the zeta potential of negatively charged membrane increased with increasing ph the force of repulsion to negatively charged haas became stronger as well thereby leading to higher haa rejections speciation is perhaps another non negligible reason in this process for the selected haas which have pka values ranging from 0 09 to 3 12 when the solutions had an initial ph 7 oh concentration in water was higher than h concentration and further concentrated along ro stages consequently the retentate became more basic with most haas existing in deprotonated forms however if the initial ph was 6 5 h was higher than oh in water and concentrated along ro consequently the retentate solution became more acidic ph 5 12 at final resulting in a portion of the haas up to 12 for iaa existing in neutral forms that may have permeated through ro membrane more readily than charged forms an example of this condition is presented in fig 6b by employing minteq software to mimic the iaa speciation which ranged from 10 to 500 μg l 1 at varying ph conditions when the feeding ph continued to decrease while the solute concentration continued to increase the fractions of non charged haas increased fig 6b hence ro rejections became more difficult 3 2 3 effect of membrane age to check the performance consistency of the ro membrane fig 7 shows the haa rejection differences by virgin and used ro membranes where the box plot indicates the range of haa rejections in each stage surprisingly the fresh membranes exhibited on average lower performances 88 5 than the aged membranes 94 1 suggesting that the haa rejections did not deteriorate along with ro uses to support this hypothesis the sem images of fresh and used membranes are shown in fig 7c f from the cross sectional view a typical reticular structure with finger like pores was observed in the fresh membrane fig 7c which was vulnerable to pressure freger 2004 in contrast the aged membrane presented a fractal and compacted cavernous structure fig 7d in addition based on the surface images the aged membrane was rougher than the fresh membrane fig 7e and f which may have resulted in poorer solute permeability kwak et al 2001 freger 2004 the phenomena thus imply that the efficiency of pollutant removal by ro would not deteriorate with use instead the key concern to aged ro is perhaps its water recovery 3 2 4 effect of water matrix to know whether gaps exist between laboratory and practical applications fig 8 shows a comparison of ro performance between haas dosed to tap water and haas spiked to ultrapure water overall the real tap water showed higher haa rejections than haas dosed to ultrapure water at a ph of 6 5 but at a ph of 7 5 the results were similar using mono haas as examples their rejections in real tap water reached 97 but fell to 84 at a ph of 6 5 and remained above 98 at phs of 7 5 and 8 5 in synthetic waters the elevated haa rejections in real tap water were likely attributed to the competing ions or dissolved organic matter fujioka et al 2012b kim et al 2018 however since the synthetic water with a ph of 7 5 achieved similar haa rejections as the real tap water it is hard to quantify the specific contributions of coexisting ions dissolved organic matter and ph in this study despite of so the results may have revealed that the experimental results obtained in laboratory studies with ultrapure water would not underestimate the performance of ro rejection on haas in real tap water 4 conclusions in terms of efficiency haa rejections were ranked cl br i haas for the compounds with the same number of halogens and tri di mono haas for the compounds with identical halogen types mechanistically the haa rejections by multi stage ro were mainly attributed to the combined effects of three factors ranked as size exclusion molecular hydrophobic charge repulsion the best qsar model achieved a r2 of 0 98 by employing three relevant descriptors along ro stages increased ionic strength was accompanied with decreased ro performance indicating an impact from operation environmental and operating factors also played important roles on the haa rejections during multi stage ro increasing the ph from 6 5 to 8 5 or the membrane age from virgin to used led to improved haa rejections however increasing the operating pressure from 4 to 6 bars remained constant while increasing the operating pressure from the 6 to the 8 bars dramatically worsened ro performance in contrast to ultrapure water haa treatments dosed to real tap water showed even higher efficiency recovery of water increased steadily as the number of ro stages increased applying a five stage ro in this study achieved 74 6 of haa rejections and 87 0 recovery of water to balance the needs of water quality water quantity energy and investment cost a

19374,among available technologies to ensure drinking water security reverse osmosis ro has become the gold standard for purification due to its maturity and reliability however high energy consumption and low water recovery are the major impediments for extensive adoption of ro multi stage ro process is an innovative system design that can offer a more effective way to improve energy efficiency and water recovery but it is rarely employed for disinfection by product dbp treatment in drinking water thus this study applied multi stage ro to treat water containing haloacetic acids haas a prevalent class of dbps with widespread occurrence and high toxicity under a variety of environmental and operational conditions overall we found that 75 haas were rejected and 87 of water was recovered with a five stage ro process for compounds with identical number of halogen substitutions iodinated brominated and chlorinated haas were almost equally removed however highly halogenated species were easier to be rejected than lowly halogenated haas by developing quantitative structure activity relationship models the importance of size exclusion charge repulsion and hydrophobic interaction effects on multi stage ro removal was revealed environmental and operational variables like ph operating pressure water matrix and membrane age also played important roles in this process increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 5 and membrane age apparently enhanced haa rejections in contrast haa rejection increased only slightly from an operating pressure of 4 6 bars but decreased markedly from 6 to 8 bars compared to ultrapure water equal or higher removal efficiency was observed for haas spiked to tap water considering the need to balance water quality and quantity a four stage ro was preferred under this study s condition graphical abstract image 1 keywords multi stage reverses osmosis haloacetic acids qsar purification 1 introduction in drinking water disinfection by products dbps are substances formed in the reactions between disinfectants and organic matter li and mitch 2018 haloacetic acids haas are a prevalent class of dbps widely reported with considerable concentrations and potent toxicity for instance the concentrations of nine chlorinated cl and brominated br haas including chloroacetic acid caa bromoacetic acid baa dichloroacetic acid dcaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa dibromochloroacetic acid dbcaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa ranged from 1 0 to 170 0 μg l 1 with a median of 23 μg l 1 across the united states mcguire et al 2003 in finished drinking water haa concentrations reached as high as 94 5 87 0 224 0 and 118 0 μg l 1 in canada king et al 2004 spain villanueva et al 2003 england malliarou et al 2005 and china chang et al 2010 respectively in terms of toxicity many haas have chronic cytotoxicity and acute genotoxicity plewa et al 2010 and an epidemiological study has proven that co exposure to br trihalomethanes and tcaa was associated with decreased semen quality zeng et al 2016 therefore many governments and organizations including the united states china and the world health organization have regulated the concentrations of certain haas in drinking water to comply with these regulations and to mitigate haa risks stakeholders have embraced a series of management strategies including water resource protection xie 2003 treatment technology optimization lifongo et al 2004 hua and reckhow 2013 pipe network rehabilitation bond et al 2011 and household treatment lifongo et al 2010 shi et al 2017 in recent decades membrane process has emerged as an attractive technology for advanced water reclamation han et al 2015 purification baek et al 2014 and treatment yin and deng 2015 as one of the widely used membrane technologies reverse osmosis ro is robust for desalination and rejection of numerous organic pollutants including dbps kimura et al 2003 fujioka et al 2013a pesticides pei et al 2005 plakas and karabelas 2012 pharmaceuticals yi et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 endocrine disrupters coday et al 2014 and personal care products yi et al 2017 for haas 90 cl haa rejections have been reported with the use of low pressure ro cartridges kimura et al 2003 in another study excellent removals of br haas were also observed yang et al 2017 the ro membrane made with polyamide showed better performance than the one made with cellulose acetate in terms of haa removal and acid resistance kimura et al 2003 agus and sedlak 2010 however earlier studies often focused on one or two haas but did not compare multiple haa species meanwhile some operating and environmental conditions such as input pressure ph feeding concentration water matrix components and membrane age may play important roles in the ro process kimura et al 2003 agus and sedlak 2010 yang et al 2017 that are currently unknown therefore a comprehensive evaluation of ro on the treatment of a variety of haas appears necessary conventionally a ro system applies only one membrane module to treat water although simple and convenient a single stage ro is neither energy efficient nor water saving usually 50 water is wasted as brine thereby inhibiting its wide acceptance elimelech and phillip 2011 lin and elimelech 2017 one solution to this obstacle is to develop a new process using multiple ro membrane modules sequentially zhu et al 2009 2010 or to optimize the process vince et al 2008 karuppiah et al 2012 this solution is especially important since the costs associated with water pretreatment and retentate management would decrease if water recovery increased elimelech and phillip 2011 using theoretical calculations lin and elimelech 2015 indicated that a four stage ro could save 60 more energy than a single stage ro which translates into a savings of 0 67 kwh m 3 in desalinating brackish water with a salinity of 5000 mg l 1 when water recovery is maintained at 90 however despite the benefits of saving energy and water in wastewater treatment lin and elimelech 2015 2017 a multi stage ro is rarely employed to control dbps in drinking water to our knowledge only one study has been conducted on the multi stage ro system to remove n nitrosamines nas fujioka et al 2013b in which three full scale water recycling plants in austria showed that na rejections varied considerably among ro stages and na species the reason for na rejections was mainly ascribed to the effect of size exclusion however the rejection of deprotonated compounds like haa may involve not only size exclusion but also electrostatic interaction yang et al 2017 which remains quantitatively unclear the purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms and affecting factors during haa removal using the multi stage ro process which is designed to balance the needs of water quality and quantity the mechanisms evaluated include size exclusion electrostatic interaction namely charge repulsion and hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between a membrane and haas the influencing factors examined include environmental conditions like ph and haa feeding concentration as well as operating factors like operation pressure and membrane age in addition a comparison was made of haa removals dosed to ultrapure water and real tap water hopefully the information may aid in a better understanding of multi stage ro for haa rejection 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and membranes seven haas haa7 were tested including caa baa iodoacetic acid iaa dcaa dbaa bcaa and tcaa except for dcaa which was obtained in liquid form all reagents were purchased in powder form from aladdin or sigma aldrich co ltd at analytical

inc at analytic grade the ro membrane category no ulp1812 50 used herein is one of the commercial low pressure ro products used in china and it was produced in spiral form by votron tec corp china per the manufacturer the membrane consists of a barrier layer made with cross linked polyamide and a supporting layer made of micro porous polysulfone in the tests both virgin and used membranes were characterized with scanning electron microscopy sem and their permeabilities and salt rejection efficiencies were monitored prior to sem imaging samples were sputter coated with a uniform layer of platinum approximately 10 nm thick to avoid the charge effect then micrographs were obtained with a sem instrument s 4700 hitachi japan at an accelerating voltage of 5 15 kev the typical porous structure of the ro membrane is illustrated in fig s1 this membrane s water permeability was determined to be 1 36 10 6 m3 m 2 s 1 bar 1 using a method described in the earlier literature zhao et al 2017 which was higher than the membrane reported in that literature the average nacl rejection of this membrane was 97 5 for removing 250 mg l 1 nacl under 4 bar and 25 c which was slightly lower than the membrane 99 reported in the literature zhao et al 2017 2 2 multi stage ro system and operations the flow diagram of the multi stage ro system is shown in fig 1 in general samples went through several sequential ro stages for example after the first stage of ro treatment the feed water was divided into permeate namely filtrate and retentate namely concentrate or brine solutions subsequently the second stage of the ro process was fed by the retentate obtained from the first stage the process was repeated several times until the retentate water volume became 1 10 of the initial water volume that is 90 of water recovery during the process backpressure relief valves needle valves swagelok sunnyvale ca usa and pumps typ 2500 deng yuan industrial co ltd china were placed in line to maintain the desired pressure the feeding water was prepared by dissolving a mixture of haa7 each 50 μg l 1 into 3l ultrapure water plus 10 mg cl l 1 nacl which served as an indicator of desalination efficiency for the system the experiments were conducted in an air conditioned room at 25 1 c the operating pressures varied from 4 to the 6 to the 8 bars by adjusting the valve the impact of the initial ph was tested at phs of 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 by dosing different amounts of naoh although this process may create a small salinity difference among samples the difference level was μg l 1 which is negligible after each round of operation the ro system was immediately cleansed with 2 l milli q water to minimize the potential impact on the next operation round 2 3 analytical methods the haas were determined using a modified usepa 552 3 method as described previously wang et al 2017 using liquid liquid extraction the methylated haas were measured using a gas chromatograph gc with an electron capture detector gc9720 zhejiang fuli analytical instrument co ltd china and a db 5 gc column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent the method detection limits for haa7 were less than 1 μg l 1 for each compound the ph value and chloride concentration were determined using a ph meter thermo fisher model 8103bn and an ion chromatograph ic 2010 tosoh japan respectively 2 4 mathematical calculations 2 4

function of haa types to understand the size effect on haa rejection the stokes radii r s of haa7 were calculated using the stokes einstein equation as follows assuming solutes are spherical objects einstein 1956 6 r s nm kt 6 π η b d bw where ĸ is the boltzmann constant j k 1 t is the absolute temperature in k η b is the solution s dynamic viscosity pa s and d bw m2 s 1 is the diffusion

estimated via the tyn calus method equation 8 using the critical volume of solute v c cm3 2 4 3 debye radius as a function of ionic strength for electrolytes the debye radius λ d nm is a measure of the charge carrier s net electrostatic effect and it was computed with equation 9 provided in the literature russel et al 1989 9 λ d nm ε r ε 0 kt 2 n a e 2 i m 10 λ b nm e 2 4 π ε 0 ε r kt 11 λ d nm

ionic strength in molar basis mol l 1 bjerrum length λ b nm is an indicator of the electrostatic interaction between two elementary charges which is generally used in discussions of electrostatic electrodynamic and electrokinetic phenomena in electrolytes λ b is calculated with equation 10 which can be converted to equation 11 under standard units at room temperature t 300 k ε r is roughly equal to 80 accordingly λ b is 0 7 nm subsequently λ d can be determined with equation 12 heimburg 2008 2 4 4 quantitative structure activity relationship qsar modeling qsar analyses are often used to identify the relationships among compounds with similar structures by assuming that the activity differences of compounds are mainly ascribed to the type number steric and electronic features of their functional groups chen et al 2015 to our knowledge only one qsar model has been developed previously for single stage ro and the target dbps were neutral noncharged species instead of charged dbps doederer et al 2014 therefore we developed qsar models to correlate haa structures with their rejection behaviors the qsar model was built up according to an empirical equation as below 13 p i 1 n 1 i n j n a ij d ij b where p is the overall rejection of contaminants with a multi stage ro system a ij and b are the constants obtained from single and multiple linear regressions respectively and d ij is a molecular descriptor used to characterize the compound structure 3 results and discussion 3 1 haa rejection efficiency 3 1 1 overall performance and qsar modeling fig 2 shows the rejections of haa7 each haa at 50 μg l 1 with the five stage ro treatment in general the ultimate rejection efficiency ranged from 74 6 to 98 0 for all haas confirming that ro is a robust tool for removing haas the smallest haa caa was rejected by 74 6 1 4 a little lower than the results reported in an earlier study using a membrane made of polyamide 86 0 agus and sedlak 2010 but higher than in another study that applied a ro membrane made of cellulose acetate 50 yang et al 2017 the relative haa rejections were ranked as tri di mono haas for the compounds with identical halogen types while iodinated i brominated br and chlorinated cl haas behaved similarly if these compounds had equal halogenation degrees for example although the mw of iaa 185 9 g mol 1 was greater than bcaa 173 3 g mol 1 and tcaa 163 3 g mol 1 iaa rejection using the multi stage ro process was 17 7 and 23 1 lower than bcaa and tcaa respectively this phenomenon indicated that ro filterability for haas increased with an increasing halogenation degree but was somehow irrelevant to halogen molecular weights mws which matches well with an earlier study kimura et al 2003 agus and sedlak 2010 because iaa was not previously investigated the results of this study appear to be the first reporting the rejection of iodinated haa by ro to identify the rejection mechanism s we made some qsar analyses to evaluate the influences of structural factors on haa performance initially we selected six commonly used molecular descriptors for evaluation including mw r s steric effect constants of halogens es electronic effect constants of halogens σ acid dissociation constants pka and the logarithmic octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow next these descriptors were correlated separately with the haa rejection efficiencies to quantify their individual contributions then multiple descriptors were grouped together to improve the modeling performance however to avoid inter correlations among descriptors i e r2 0 95 σ and es were excluded based on the criteria provided in the literature wang et al 2017 ultimately only four descriptors i e mw r s pka and the log kow were selected to establish qsar models and their values are presented in table s1 table 1 lists the qsar modeling results for a variety of models haa rejections by ro roughly increased as mws increased as shown in the first model perhaps due to the size exclusion effect doederer et al 2014 however mw alone was poorly correlated with the haa rejection behaviors r2 0 18 table 1 suggesting that mw may not be a proper size exclusion descriptor in the literature the molecular stokes radius r s was once used to indicate the molecular sieving effect of membranes dražević et al 2017 yang et al 2017 therefore we correlated haa r s with the haa rejections fig 2 of all models using only one molecular descriptor r s was the best descriptor with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 84 table 1 thus the results somehow supported that the size exclusion of organic solutes was the major mechanism responsible for haa rejections by ro when the log kow was also included the r2 between rtotal and paired descriptors improved significantly to 0 97 suggesting that the hydrophobic interaction between solute and membrane was the second important mechanism beyond that the best correlation was achieved using three descriptors together i e r s pka and the log kow resulting in an r2 of 0 98 model 8 in table 1 although the improvement of r2 was not significant relative to the paired model the result implies that pka is also a non negligible factor in removing haas with the multi stage ro process 3 1 2 prediction of haa overall rejections and benefit analysis although the multi stage ro process is advantageous in reducing energy consumption and improving water recovery the number of ro stages must be minimized to save the capital investment to identify the optimal ro stage we investigated the rejections of target haas under varying multi stage ro processes fig s2 and table s2 then we developed qsar models for each multi stage ro r2 0 90 table s3 and fig s3 according to the method provided in section 3 1 1 subsequently the rejections of 19 cl br and i haas under varying multi stage ro processes were predicted with the constructed models fig 3 a and table s4 then an integral parameter named the efficiency index η r total r total was defined to balance the contrasting effects on decreasing haa rejection and increasing water recovery along the ro process fig 3b presents the η curves as a function of ro stage numbers for all nineteen haas classified in three subgroups for all haas selected η reached the maximum at the optimal stage then it remained flat or slightly decreased when the stage number increased meaning no further benefit would be obtained using more than the optimal stage ro however the optimal stage varied among haas for example the removal of mono haas only required three stage ro to achieve an optimal η whereas tri haas required five stage ro to achieve the peak fig 3b inset thus to select a proper ro stage haa speciations in the water should also be considered 3 1 3 ro performance in each stage previously although some studies have employed two or three ro modules to treat contaminants magara et al 1998 fujioka et al 2012a no study has provided the rejection details of each ro stage thus this study investigated the rejection efficiencies of haas in each of the five ro stages fig 4 during the process haa rejections decreased progressively from the first 95 2 2 4 to the fifth stage 76 9 22 7 especially for those haas with small r s mono haas fig 4a the worsening performance along stages may be attributed to either membrane deterioration or solute changes to explain it we checked chloride rejections along ro stages and found that the rejection efficiencies of chloride were constantly high 95 in each stage fig 4b indicating that ro membranes were working properly and not deteriorated therefore we hypothesized that the escalated ionic strengthen may have led to the performance difference since the concentrations of haas and chloride in retentate increased progressively fig s4a we hereafter calculated the effective molecular sizes r eff of haas to reflect the impact of ionic strength according to an equation proposed in the literature heimburg 2008 yang et al 2017 14 r eff r s k λ d where k is a dimensionless fitting coefficient r s is the stokes einstein radius nm that can be used to reflect the size exclusion effect in the membrane filtration process and λ d is the debye radius nm for estimating the effect of electrostatic interaction which is mainly controlled by ion strength as seen when the ionic strength of the retentate kept increasing along the ro stages fig s4 λ d was reduced sequentially from 18 nm at the 1st stage to 10 nm at the 5th stage which subsequently decreased the electrostatic repulsion and haa rejections heimburg 2008 fig s5 plots the haa rejections at each stage as a function of changing r eff with a fitting r2 as 0 83 hence the results supported our hypothesis that the ionic strength increases caused the decreased ro rejection moreover the results indicated that haas with effective radii larger than tcaa such as dcbaa dbcaa and tbaa yang et al 2017 may be completely removed regardless of ro stage which could be supported by another ro study fujioka et al 2013b in addition to haas and salt concentrations the water volumes in each stage were also recorded during the multi stage ro process fig 4b and fig s4 although the volumes of feed permeate and retentate kept decreasing fig 4b the fractional water recovery in each stage i e permeate volume divided by feed water volume remained almost unchanged 40 during the first four stages not until the fifth stage did the water recovery decrease by 27 fig 4b which suggested that a salt content threshold controls the membrane permeability in water recovery in light of this finding highly saline water is probably more difficult to treat with the multi stage ro process 3 2 factors affecting haa rejections 3 2 1 effect of operating pressure in this part the operating pressure varied from 4 to 6 8 bars which was near the limit allowed by ro guidance 8 5 bar fig 5 shows the overall haa rejections as a function of operating pressure for the multi stage ro system in general haa rejections at the 4 and the 6 bars were approximately identical or only slightly increased with increasing pressure fig 5 indicating that increasing the operating pressure could only lead to enhanced water flux but would change haa rejections little to achieve the targeted water recovery 90 nine and five ro stages were needed for the operation pressure of the 4 and the 6 bars respectively but only one stage was needed for the 8 bar fig s6 however when the operating pressure was too high the 8 bar ro rejected much lower haas than at the 4 and the 6 bars fig 5 so perhaps an optimal operating pressure could achieve high water quality with as few ro modules as possible the reason for the worsened rejection at the 8 bar was likely related to the membrane reformation as a result of the imposed pressure which may have led to an enlarged membrane surface area and pore size reduced membrane thickness and collapse of the membrane structure kahdim et al 2003 kim et al 2018 in addition strong evidence also existed from the dramatic decline of chloride rejection at the 8 bar fig 5 3 2 2 effect of ph solution ph is perhaps an important factor for the ro process because it may influence not only haa speciation but also the charge and zeta potential of the membrane yang et al 2017 fig 6 presents the effect of initial ph on overall haa rejections with a multi stage ro haa rejections were significantly higher in neutral i e ph 7 5 and weak basic i e ph 8 5 solutions than in weak acidic water i e ph 6 5 the reason is likely due to the influence of ph on the membrane material i e polyamide which has an isoelectric point of ph 3 4 yang et al 2017 because the zeta potential of negatively charged membrane increased with increasing ph the force of repulsion to negatively charged haas became stronger as well thereby leading to higher haa rejections speciation is perhaps another non negligible reason in this process for the selected haas which have pka values ranging from 0 09 to 3 12 when the solutions had an initial ph 7 oh concentration in water was higher than h concentration and further concentrated along ro stages consequently the retentate became more basic with most haas existing in deprotonated forms however if the initial ph was 6 5 h was higher than oh in water and concentrated along ro consequently the retentate solution became more acidic ph 5 12 at final resulting in a portion of the haas up to 12 for iaa existing in neutral forms that may have permeated through ro membrane more readily than charged forms an example of this condition is presented in fig 6b by employing minteq software to mimic the iaa speciation which ranged from 10 to 500 μg l 1 at varying ph conditions when the feeding ph continued to decrease while the solute concentration continued to increase the fractions of non charged haas increased fig 6b hence ro rejections became more difficult 3 2 3 effect of membrane age to check the performance consistency of the ro membrane fig 7 shows the haa rejection differences by virgin and used ro membranes where the box plot indicates the range of haa rejections in each stage surprisingly the fresh membranes exhibited on average lower performances 88 5 than the aged membranes 94 1 suggesting that the haa rejections did not deteriorate along with ro uses to support this hypothesis the sem images of fresh and used membranes are shown in fig 7c f from the cross sectional view a typical reticular structure with finger like pores was observed in the fresh membrane fig 7c which was vulnerable to pressure freger 2004 in contrast the aged membrane presented a fractal and compacted cavernous structure fig 7d in addition based on the surface images the aged membrane was rougher than the fresh membrane fig 7e and f which may have resulted in poorer solute permeability kwak et al 2001 freger 2004 the phenomena thus imply that the efficiency of pollutant removal by ro would not deteriorate with use instead the key concern to aged ro is perhaps its water recovery 3 2 4 effect of water matrix to know whether gaps exist between laboratory and practical applications fig 8 shows a comparison of ro performance between haas dosed to tap water and haas spiked to ultrapure water overall the real tap water showed higher haa rejections than haas dosed to ultrapure water at a ph of 6 5 but at a ph of 7 5 the results were similar using mono haas as examples their rejections in real tap water reached 97 but fell to 84 at a ph of 6 5 and remained above 98 at phs of 7 5 and 8 5 in synthetic waters the elevated haa rejections in real tap water were likely attributed to the competing ions or dissolved organic matter fujioka et al 2012b kim et al 2018 however since the synthetic water with a ph of 7 5 achieved similar haa rejections as the real tap water it is hard to quantify the specific contributions of coexisting ions dissolved organic matter and ph in this study despite of so the results may have revealed that the experimental results obtained in laboratory studies with ultrapure water would not underestimate the performance of ro rejection on haas in real tap water 4 conclusions in terms of efficiency haa rejections were ranked cl br i haas for the compounds with the same number of halogens and tri di mono haas for the compounds with identical halogen types mechanistically the haa rejections by multi stage ro were mainly attributed to the combined effects of three factors ranked as size exclusion molecular hydrophobic charge repulsion the best qsar model achieved a r2 of 0 98 by employing three relevant descriptors along ro stages increased ionic strength was accompanied with decreased ro performance indicating an impact from operation environmental and operating factors also played important roles on the haa rejections during multi stage ro increasing the ph from 6 5 to 8 5 or the membrane age from virgin to used led to improved haa rejections however increasing the operating pressure from 4 to 6 bars remained constant while increasing the operating pressure from the 6 to the 8 bars dramatically worsened ro performance in contrast to ultrapure water haa treatments dosed to real tap water showed even higher efficiency recovery of water increased steadily as the number of ro stages increased applying a five stage ro in this study achieved 74 6 of haa rejections and 87 0 recovery of water to balance the needs of water quality water quantity energy and investment cost a
