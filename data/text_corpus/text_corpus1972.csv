9860,grapevine growing in areas with low rainfall as the brazilian semi arid requires irrigation to full fill plant water demand the objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological and yield responses of grapevine to irrigation strategies in the lower middle são francisco valley in petrolina state of pernambuco brazil the experiment was carried out over three consecutive growing seasons of drip irrigated syrah grapevine grafted on 1103 paulsen and planted in an ultisol soil taxonomy usa full irrigation fi regulated deficit irrigation rdi and deficit irrigation di treatments were designed in a randomized block with four replications mostly soil moisture depletion was observed until 0 6 m soil depth while higher moisture values and their small variation over the time were observed below 0 6 m and until 1 20 m depth as consequence of dense soil layers rdi and di promoted moderate water stress in plants pre dawn water potential from 0 2 to 0 4 mpa reducing water consumption and gas exchange intrinsic water use efficiency was higher in rdi and di 121 and 115 µmol co2 mol h20 1 respectively tritratable acidity reduced to 5 81 and 6 28 g l 1 tartaric acid as water deficit increased except in the third season soluble solids were influenced by treatments only in the second season when it decreased in fi plants 22 6 brix weight of 100 berries was influenced by treatments in all seasons with lower values for di and rdi grapevines less than 155 g number 15 and weight 2 2 kg of cluster per grapevine and yield 7284 kg were significantly higher in fi only in the third growing season while average cluster weight was greater in fi in the first and third seasons 84 and 149 g respectively irrigation water productivity did not differ among irrigation strategies deficit irrigation strategies allowed water saving keywords vitis vinífera l soil water content hardsetting soil layer leaf water potential water stress 1 introduction the cultivation of grapevine has extended worldwide and in brazil it achieved 74 826 ha with a total grape production of 1 416 398 ton in 2020 in its semi arid region in northeastern brazil significant area has been cultivated with grapes being 8 299 ha in the state of pernambuco and 1 969 ha in the state of bahia in 2020 ibge 2021 around 48 of this total grape production has been destined to grape processing wine juice and other derived products mello and machado 2020 in 2019 brazil stands at 81 000 ha of surface area vineyard oiv 2020b and has an estimated wine production volume of 2 2 million of hectoliters in 2019 oiv 2020a over the last few decades the lower middle são francisco valley along the border of states of pernambuco and bahia has appeared as one of the main tropical wine production areas in that country typically growing under irrigation conditions and trained mainly in vertical shoot positioning systems with proper irrigation and crop management practices the farmers can produce grapes and carry out winemaking at any time of the year allowing a potential average of between two and three vineyard growing cycles per year in accordance with and depending on each variety teixeira et al 2017 since then there is an increasing demand for high quality wine by winemakers in that region as grapevine water demand is full filled by irrigation due to low rainfall pattern one of the challenges facing winemakers is to improve grape quality in irrigated vineyards throughout an appropriate balance between vegetative and reproductive development souza et al 2009 in irrigated grapevines for wine production it is important to know the effects of water supply on yield grape composition and wine quality to achieve an adequate irrigation scheduling commonly reduced soil water availability and or plant water stress is performed for desirable outcomes as controlling plant vigor dry and loveys 1998 chaves et al 2007 chacón vozmediano et al 2020 romić et al 2020 enhancing berry quality for winemaking chaves et al 2007 acevedo opazo et al 2010 bucchetti et al 2011 zarrouk et al 2012 romero et al 2015 uriarte et al 2016 ramos et al 2020 reducing water consumption by plants bassoi et al 2007 chaves et al 2007 acevedo opazo et al 2010 silva et al 2018 and increasing intrinsic water use efficiency chaves et al 2007 silva et al 2018 romić et al 2020 limited water availability and climate changes trigo córdoba et al 2015 intrigliolo et al 2016 franck et al 2020 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2020 jordan and speelman 2020 also become a concern regarding the water addressed for irrigation in grapevines deficit irrigation has emerged as a potential strategy to allow crops to withstand mild water stress with little or no decreases of yield and potentially a positive impact on fruit quality for this the understanding of the physiological and molecular bases of grapevine responses to this water deficit is fundamental to optimize deficit irrigation management chaves et al 2010 one of the most promising management irrigation techniques utilized in vineyards in semi arid areas is regulated deficit irrigation rdi as it offers greater potential to reduce vine vigor stabilize yield improve berry quality and increase water use efficiency in different varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions romero et al 2013 rdi strategy in wine vineyards implies dynamic irrigation according to the phenological stage rather than simple implication of constant deficit irrigation high water availability during early berry development enhanced vegetative growth and increased berry size and yield of merlot grapevines reducing water supply in order to create a certain level of drought stress during late berry development did not damage yield or berry maturation rdi combining higher irrigation from flowering to bunch closure and lower irrigation from bunch closure to harvest has the potential to generate the best balance between vegetative growth high yield and wine with enhanced color and aroma compounds munitz et al 2017 however there are apparent contradictory results about the success of applying regulated deficit irrigation to achieve higher quality grapes which may be related to the accuracy of plant water status monitoring to regulate and to manage the physiological changes imposed to the grapevines by deficit irrigation acevedo opazo et al 2010 romero et al 2013 in southern portugal irrigation did not significantly affect castelão and moscatel berry sugar accumulation and ph and those results were in contrast with other authors who observed either an increase or a decrease in berry sugars induced by high soil water availability chaves et al 2007 in northwestern spain the differences on plant water status rainfed and irrigated godello and treixadura grapevines did not alter stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence and irrigation increased yield only for treixadura in only one season of three evaluated must quality was slightly affected by irrigation but differences were not observed in wines water productivity was greater in rain fed vines in the case of godello whereas in treixadura no significant differences between treatments were detected gross incomes were not increased by the irrigation practice except for treixadura in the last year trigo córdoba et al 2015 reducing irrigation water supply from 100 to 70 of crop evapotranspiration etc between fruit set to harvest slightly decreased mid day leaf water potential and no impact on leaf gas exchange canopy development yield and intrinsic water use efficiency of cabernet sauvignon vines in southeastern washington usa keller et al 2016 meanwhile the effects of post veraison deficit irrigation 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 etc on cabernet sauvignon water use efficiency decreased with increasing water application and this effect was statistically significant in the more irrigated treatment intrioglio et al 2016 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 reported that despite the huge amount of work aiming at assessing the effects of water status on vine yield and grape composition no clear relationships could be established between stem water potential and berry size and composition this is due to the large number of factors involved in grape composition development indicating that water status might not be its main driver cultivar timing of exposure to water restrictions and rootstock have a great influence on must and wine composition nevertheless other factors such as climate leaf surface yield ratio training systems amongst others might interact with water stress and salinity syrah is the most cultivated wine grapevine in the lower middle são francisco valley high solar radiation availability and irrigation feasibility throughout the year make the grapevine cultivation possible any time therefore deficit irrigation practices in syrah grapevines in that region have been previously studied on physiological and yield bases in the first three growing seasons yield difference appeared only in the third one with higher cluster weight for full irrigated fi grapevines followed by regulated deficit irrigated rdi and deficit irrigated di plants while average cluster weight was lower in di in the first and third seasons differences on soluble content were found only in the third season lower for fi while titratable acidity was always lower for di grapevines bassoi et al 2011 2015 the authors found at maximum moderate plant water stress in di grapevines by measuring pre dawn leaf water potential still in relation to that region wines originated from grapes from rdi and di vines showed higher values of alcohol content malic and lactic acids flavonols stilbenes anthocyanins epicatechin epicatechin gallate and procyanidin a2 tpi and color intensity and can be classified as aged wine while wine originated from full irrigation vines showed the highest values of ascorbic and tartaric acids lowest alcohol content and phenolic compounds in general and can be classified as young wines this enabled the production of wines with specific characteristics that should please many consumers with different tastes nascimento et al 2016 oliveira et al 2018 thus the major goal of this study was to investigate the yield and ecophysiological mechanisms in syrah grapevines cultivated under deficit irrigation practices in lower middle são francisco valley 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out at in vineyard located at experimental field of bebedouro embrapa

close cluster baggiolini 1952 when maturation has already started and then irrigation was performed according to the soil water monitoring in the effective root depth 0 60 m bassoi et al 2002 2003 when soil water storage at this layer reached around 50 60 of its capacity in 1gs irrigation occurred until 43 days after pruning dap and thereafter 64 65 83 84 85 103 104 and 105 dap 13 and 14 june 2 3 4 22 23 and 24 july 2013 in 2gs water was applied until 45 dap and then at 62 99 100 and 101 dap 9 dec 2013 15 16 and 17 jan 2014 in 3gs irrigation was performed up to 51 dap and later at 82 83 97 98 and 99 dap 28 and 29 july 12 13 and 14 aug 2013 in the irrigation deficit id water was applied until 43 45 and 51 dap phenological stage of close cluster in 1gs 2gs and 3gs respectively and then irrigation was cut off until harvesting the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three irrigation treatments fi rdi and di with four replications each plot consisted of 48 grapevines in two rows with 24 plants each and 12 of them middle portion of plot were used for measurements 2 4 fertigation the replacement of soil nutrients was carried out by means of fertigation in each season applying 20 kg ha 1 of n and 40 kg ha 1 k2o in all growing seasons the fertilizers used were urea and potassium sulfate and they were weekly applied in all irrigation strategies until flowering and before irrigation interruption in rdi and di treatments 2 5 plant and soil water relations the pre dawn ψpd and the mid day ψmd leaf water potentials were measured on two expanded leaves using the scholander pressure chamber model 1000 pms instrument co corvallis or usa in each treatment at two different times from 03h00 to 04h00 and from 12h00 to 13h00 respectively leaves were collected from the median portion of branches in different plants and in each of four replicates per treatment the ψpd and ψmd measurements were performed at 57 68 85 and 111 dap 6 and 17 june and 4 and 10 july 2013 in 1gs at 63 and 99 dap 10 dec 2013 and 15 jan 15 2014 in 2gs and at 78 and 107 dap 24 july and 22 aug 2014 in 3gs between phenological stages of close cluster and mature cluster soil water content θ was determined by neutron moderation technique 503 hydroprobe cpn concord ca usa in 12 aluminum tubes installed inside the plant rows and between two emitters four by strategy

gas exchange was assessed only in third growing season using a portable infrared gas analyzer irga model li 6400xt li cor lincoln ne usa described in a r m chaves et al 2016 measurements of net photosynthesis a transpiration e and stomatal conductance g s were initiated before the interruption of irrigation in rdi and di treatments and were ended close to harvesting evaluations were carried out after 51 79 and 107 dap measurements were performed at four different times throughout the day 07h00 10h00 13h00 and 15h00 always the same adult and healthy leaves which showed good and uniform characteristics as color age and size 2 7 yield in harvesting of all growing seasons the number and weight of cluster per plant were assessed for subsequent estimation of average cluster weight g and yield kg ha 1 2 8 irrigation water productivity and water use efficiency the irrigation water productivity iwp for each treatment and in all growing seasons was obtained by the ratio between yield kg ha 1 and applied irrigation water m3 ha 1 as described by fernández et al 2020 the instantaneous water use efficiency and intrinsic water use efficiency wue were estimated respectively by a e and a g s ratios as described by during 1994 and flexas et al 1998 2 9 berry analysis in each harvesting and in each repetition per treatment 200 berries were collected on opposite sides of the cluster in the upper middle and basal regions packed in plastic bags and transported inside styrofoam boxes with ice to the laboratory of enology at embrapa semi arid the mass of 100 berries was determined by a digital scale afterwards berries were macerated and their must was used for analyses of soluble solid content ss brix using portable refractometer atago brand pocket pal 1 model of titratable acidity ta expressed in g l 1 of tartaric acid according to ial 2005 and of ph using digital gauge 2 10 carbon isotopic composition δ13c in the harvesting of 1gs berries were collected from opposite sides of the cluster and at its upper median and basal portions the berries were packed frozen and transported to the centre for stable isotopes institute of biosciences sao paulo state university botucatu brazil 13c 12c isotopic ratios of the must samples were obtained according to dutra et al 2011 2 11 statistical methods anova f test at 5 probability and tukey test at 5 probability were performed using sisvar version 4 0 dex ufla lavras mg brazil 3 results and discussion 3 1 growing season weather and irrigation data higher eto and etc values were observed in 2gs than the others because it occurred in the period of year with the highest et demand in petrolina however in that season there was a high magnitude rainfall specifically between 66 and 75 dap during which there was no irrigation hence gross irrigation depth gid in fi treatment was slightly lower than in other two seasons 1gs and 3gs there were no high magnitude rainfalls in 1gs and 3gs seasons table 1 in the experimental site the lower rainfall pattern observed in 1gs april to august and 3gs may to september is usually observed in that period of the year autunn and winter seasons while 2gs october to january was carried out within the spring and summer seasons in which rainfall pattern is higher 3 2 soil water content as gid applied was the same for all treatments until the beginning of irrigation interruption at 43 45 and 51 dap respectively for 1gs 2gs and 3gs which means that there were no major differences in θ values among all treatments until these dates but subsequently θ up to 0 60 m depth in rdi and di has become smaller than fi treatment figs 1 2 and 3 it is noteworthy that for the edaphic conditions in lower middle são francisco valley the effective depth of the root system of irrigated grapevine was 0 60 m bassoi et al 2002 2003 however in 2gs fig 2 it happened a lower influence of irrigation on θ behavior after the interruption of water application than in 1gs fig 1 and 3gs fig 3 due to higher rainfalls from 70 to 76 dap 146 mm in rdi when irrigation was performed based on θ monitoring an increase of θ was observed up to 0 45 m depth in 1gs fig 1 because of water application at 64 65 83 84 85 103 104 and 105 dap and in 3gs fig 3 because of irrigations at 82 83 97 98 and 99 dap in 2 gs fig 2 this increase of θ in rdi occurred up to 0 60 m depth because of water application at 62 99 100 and 101 dap but in that season it happened a lower influence of irrigation on θ behavior after the interruption of water application due to higher rainfalls from 70 to 76 dap 146 mm in the deeper soil depths 0 75 0 90 1 05 and 1 20 m θ increased over the time until the irrigation interruption and after that decreased slightly in 1gs and 3gs fig 1 and 3 respectively except in 2gs fig 2 as consequence of the high magnitude rainfalls the increase in the density of an ultisol in depth in areas of the semi arid region of northeastern brazil under natural vegetation caatinga biome and under irrigation in petrolina was evaluated from the soil surface down to a depth of 1 m in 10 cm layers using computed tomography and results suggest a density increase at depths below 0 4 m fante junior et al 2002 the presence of these hardsetting soil layers are common in that region in consequence of changes in the arrangement of soil particles structure decreasing pore volume and increasing soil density and mechanical resistance to penetration of roots water and nutrients a simple texture gradient and a double layer of clay accumulation are presented between the surface and subsurface soil horizons soils silva et al 2004 this subsurface hardsetting is due to pedogenetic processes like eluviation and iluviation of clay which acts as pore sealing as well as plinthitization processes and clay dispersion influenced by alternate cycles of wetting and drying silva et al 2008 then this soil condition which occurs in an ultisol is crucial for the presence of higher values of θ in deeper soil depths of that area which has been irrigated throughout the year and for several years since grape production is an intensive agricultural exploitation under irrigation in that region it is important to highlight that shallow soils probably do not provide water storage to plants below effective rooting zone which makes relevant the importance of soil survey for deficit irrigation purposes 3 3 leaf water potential the measurements of leaf water potential in 1gs are shown in fig 4 left at 57 dap there were differences regarding ψpd and ψmd among fi treatment and others rdi and di which did not differ from the second reading 68 dap ψpd and ψmd only differentiated between fi and di treatments the fi treatment plants showed ψpd values close to or below 0 20 mpa indicating that in this treatment grapevines showed good water conditions ojeda 2007 the ψpd values of rdi and di treatments characterized a level of water restriction as light to medium 0 2 to 0 4 mpa except at 111 dap in di treatment which showed water restriction level of between medium to strong 0 4 to 0 6 mpa as pointed out by ojeda 2007 the ψpd values found in this study are slightly below those found 0 6 mpa and 0 4 mpa for the grapevine subjected to water deficit during two growing seasons in valencia spain intrigliolo and castel 2009 souza et al 2009 and chaves et al 2010 found ψpd values close to 0 2 mpa in grapevine syrah submitted to water deficit in 2gs there were only two ψ measurements due to rainfall which occurred after the irrigation interruption in the rdi and di treatments fig 4 middle the ψpd values of fi treatment were also close to 0 20 mpa indicating good plant water status while rdi and di treatments were lower between 0 20 and 0 40 mpa with a light to moderate water restriction level at 63 dap ψpd and ψmd values of rdi and di treatments did not differ between them but were different from the fi treatment however at 99 dap ψpd values of di treatment did not differ statistically from the other treatments regarding ψmd their values did not differ among treatments this was possibly due to rainfall occurred during the second growing season in 3gs fig 4 right ψpd values of fi treatment at 78 dap were higher than the rdi and di treatments however at 107 dap fi and rdi treatments differed between them but di didn t differ from both the fi treatment showed values above 0 20 mpa indicating good plant hydration while rdi plants were 0 54 mpa and 0 70 mpa presenting medium to strong water restriction levels di treatment presented readings near 0 4 mpa indicating light to medium water restriction level the ψmd was higher in the fi treatment the ψmd values were lower than those of ψpd due to higher deficit of vapor pressure which occurs during the day causing increased transpiration and consequently lower hydration plant pinheiro et al 2004 3 4 carbon isotopic concentration the main factor that affects the 13c 12c ratio is water stress farquhar et al 1989 yu et al 2021 and higher values of δ13c indicate less discrimination due to lower values of intercellular co2 and more efficient water use farquhar et al 1982 buchmann and kaplan 2001 in 1gs the fi treatment had lower values than rdi and di treatments confirming the presence of greater water stress in the grapevines this result is due to stomatal closure in plants under water stress confirmed by the results of g s having greater values of δ13c a similar behavior was observed in grapevines with and without water deficiency souza et al 2005 gaudillere et al 2002 studied the variation of the water status in different varieties of grapevines and obtained δ13c values for the syrah grapevine of 23 7 higher compared to the present study a comparison of the effect water deficiency with δ13c can be used with good precision on grapevines subjected to water stress δ13c is related to the ratio ci ca and iwp moreover most of the δ13c change in yield grapevines was related to water stress and demonstrated a significant correlation between δ13c measured in sugar of ripe berries and plant water status measured as the minimum predawn leaf water gaudillère et al 2002 3 5 gas exchange and water use efficiency the gas exchange measurements in 3gs were performed at 51 79 and 107 dap fig 5 and no differences were observed at 51 dap because the water depth applied up to this data had been the same for all treatments in the results of net photosynthesis a transpiration e and stomatal conductance g s at 79 and 107 dap large reductions occurred in rdi and di in comparison with fi treatment plants due to water restriction imposed by the irrigation interruption and higher soil water availability in fi strategy stomata closed when plants are under water stress in order to avoid complete leaf dehydration then co2 diffusion is limited to the leaf mesophyll which causes photosynthesis decrease chaves et al 2009 in the field plant stomatal closure controls water loss and midday leaf water potential and as grapevine is an isohydric species tardieu and simonneau 1998 it promotes high iwp related net photosynthetic activity and describe tolerant genotypes to water deficit jones 1983 higher a rates were found by santos et al 2013 in an experiment conducted in the same field and with the same grapevine cultivar without water restriction with measurements between 08h00 and 10h00 which is comparable to fi treatment chaves et al 2010 reported higher a values in syrah grapevines under drought in southern portugal which is comparable to di and rdi irrigation strategies romero et al 2013 found minimum a values in grapevines under water restriction in semi arid region of spain the g s response of plants under different irrigation strategies was similar to a values indicating stomatal closure in plants subjected to water stress and decrease in co2 assimilation these values were also found by chaves et al 2010 in syrah grapevines under drought stomatal conductance of vittis vinifera with water availability were higher in teszlák et al 2013 which are higher when compared to the fi treatment of this study this result may have been caused by climatic factors as the high vapor pressure deficit recorded during the measurements in this study fig 6 with maximum values near to 4 kpa besides being distinct mechanisms a and e are associated by leaf stomata aperture and closure that connect the plant to the atmospheric air and by which plants perform their gas exchange at 79 dap e decreased in rdi and di plants due to stomatal closure caused by water deficit and consequently lower a the fi treatment showed the highest average a values since there was a water replacement according to plant needs thus indicating the influence of the treatments on grapevine physiological behavior this is also presented in the ψpd and ψmd also indicating medium level of water stress this study showed variation of e values of rdi and di treatments and below from those obtained by souza et al 2009 in syrah grapevine under di irrigation strategy the complex mechanism of plant gas exchange is an important factor in semi arid conditions which decreases e and consequently the a growth and production thus there is a connection between a and e and to better evaluate this duality it is necessary the analysis of the water use efficiency by the instantaneous efficiency of water use a e or intrinsic efficiency of water use a g s ratios during 1994 flexas et al 1998 at 79 and 107 dap rdi and di plants showed higher values of the a g s and fi treatment had lower one fig 6 in semi arid conditions the plants with good soil water availability have higher a and g s intrigliolo and castel 2009 as in the present work on fi treatment with lower values of a g s grapevines under moderate water deficit usually present e rates decline with pre dawn leaf water potential lower than stomatal conductance as a result the a g s is generally higher in grapevine under deficit irrigation light to moderate water stress than under well watered conditions this is reflected in lower water use and higher a g s by crops which is the objective of deficit irrigation strategies applied in vineyards especially in semi arid region gaudillère et al 2002 chaves and oliveira 2004 souza et al 2005 the results of a e in fi treatment presented lower values in the measurements taken at 07h00 and 10h00 fig 6 due to lower vpd in the first hours of the day higher stomata aperture in rdi and di grapevines as well as higher a and lower e values fig 5 and consequent increase of the a e measurements taken at 13h00 and 15h00 presented most vpd decreasing a due to decreased g s in both deficit irrigation strategies and no difference related to a e occurred in these times among all treatments measurements of the c i c a at 79 dap and at all times fig 6 were higher in the fi treatment this result can be confirmed by higher average values of a g s and e in fi treatment fig 5 grapevines under water deficit rdi and di presented lower g s values partial stomatal closure and lower c i c a values in plants of the rdi and fi treatments which indicate stomatal limitation in order to reduce excessive water loss in proportion to an increase in vpd the plants promote the stomata closure but this limited the entry of co2 with consequent reduction in a m m chaves et al 2016 3 6 yield components total number and weight of cluster per grapevine and yield presented significant differences p 5 only in 3gs while average cluster weight differed among treatments in 1gs and 3gs decreasing as irrigation water restriction increased rdi and di table 2 specifically in 2gs high cv values for number of cluster per vine average cluster weight cluster weight per vine yield and iwp were found due to high rainfall 166 4 mm which occurred from 66 to 75 dap after irrigation interruption at close cluster 45 dap in chile acevedo opazo et al 2010 reported high cv values of cabernet sauvignon grapevine measurements under rdi i e cluster per plant 28 2 30 5 cluster weight 22 3 25 1 and yield 36 0 42 3 in southern italy sofo et al 2012 found cv values of 50 0 and 50 in yield 29 4 and 29 3 in number of cluster per plant 50 6 and 47 1 in cluster weight respectively for irrigated and non irrigated agilanico grapevines 3 7 iwp iwp did not differ among irrigation strategies in all seasons despite the marked effects on leaf gas exchange because lower water supply was associated with some lower yield components i e cluster per grapevine in 3gs average cluster in 1gs and 3gs and cluster weight per grapevine and yield in 3gs table 2 in southeastern spain rdi saved more water and was more efficient in water use from a productive point of view than 40 of the etc throughout the 3 year period of monastrell romero et al 2013 over 4 year period romero et al 2015 did not find differences related to iwp in monastrel irrigated by partial rootzone drying and rdi intrigliolo et al 2016 in valencia spain and keller et al 2016 in washington state usa did not find differences on iwp in three growing seasons of cabernet sauvignon grapevines under water replacement based on total or partial values of etc the highly linear relationship between biomass produced and water consumed by a given species has been demonstrated steduto et al 2007 3 8 berry characteristics no differences occurred in berry ph among treatments in all seasons soluble solids were influenced by treatments only in 2gs when it decreased in well watered plants fi finally weight of 100 berries was influenced by treatments in all seasons with lower values for di 1gs and 2gs and rdi 3gs grapevines table 3 tritratable acidity differed between fi higher value and di lower value in 1gs and 2gs as reported by bassoi et al 2011 2015 uriarte et al 2016 observed the quality berry parameters in tenpranillo in four seasons and among irrigated 25 50 and 100 of etc and rainfed grapevines no differences were observed in ph and tss but ta increased with irrigation in three seasons similar results were reported herein 3 9 differences among growing seasons the efficiency of deficit irrigation practices in modulating water use efficiency growth and grape berry composition is dependent on the variety characteristics vigor and drought avoiding traits the type of soil and the prevailing weather rainfall and temperature as commented by chaves et al 2010 ramos et al 2020 also observed that due to different climatic conditions recorded during 10 years differences in the grape composition during maturation were observed both in timing and in the final characteristics weather conditions mainly rainfall and et varied among all seasons evaluated since they occurred in different periods of the year and consequently the volume of water applied through drip irrigation system differed too therefore plant responses have changed from one growing season to another 4 conclusion we evaluated the regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation strategies applied from the close cluster stage to harvesting in comparison with full irrigation over three consecutive growing seasons of drip irrigated syrah grapevine in the semi arid region of northeastern brazil the soil investigated herein presents hardsetting layers at soil depths below effective rooting zone of grapevine 0 4 0 6 m this condition promotes a higher soil water availability at deeper soil profile between 0 6 and 1 0 m depth even when deficit irrigation strategy is applied consequently moderate plant water stress and decreased on plant water consumption were observed in all growing seasons irrigation water productivity did not differ among irrigation strategies in all seasons but intrinsic efficiency of water use was higher when deficit irrigation was applied a small reduction on average cluster weight was observed in two growing seasons due to water restriction soluble solid content differed just in 2gs while tritatable acidity was different among treatments in 1gs and 2gs hence deficit irrigation strategies can be applied for water saving purposes and monitoring soil water content at profile will be helpful for that future research should address alterations in canopy size and microclimate as weel as a long term observation as deficit irrigation should led to a decline in vine capacity and yield deeper analysis of berries and wines should be worthly too declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9860,grapevine growing in areas with low rainfall as the brazilian semi arid requires irrigation to full fill plant water demand the objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological and yield responses of grapevine to irrigation strategies in the lower middle são francisco valley in petrolina state of pernambuco brazil the experiment was carried out over three consecutive growing seasons of drip irrigated syrah grapevine grafted on 1103 paulsen and planted in an ultisol soil taxonomy usa full irrigation fi regulated deficit irrigation rdi and deficit irrigation di treatments were designed in a randomized block with four replications mostly soil moisture depletion was observed until 0 6 m soil depth while higher moisture values and their small variation over the time were observed below 0 6 m and until 1 20 m depth as consequence of dense soil layers rdi and di promoted moderate water stress in plants pre dawn water potential from 0 2 to 0 4 mpa reducing water consumption and gas exchange intrinsic water use efficiency was higher in rdi and di 121 and 115 µmol co2 mol h20 1 respectively tritratable acidity reduced to 5 81 and 6 28 g l 1 tartaric acid as water deficit increased except in the third season soluble solids were influenced by treatments only in the second season when it decreased in fi plants 22 6 brix weight of 100 berries was influenced by treatments in all seasons with lower values for di and rdi grapevines less than 155 g number 15 and weight 2 2 kg of cluster per grapevine and yield 7284 kg were significantly higher in fi only in the third growing season while average cluster weight was greater in fi in the first and third seasons 84 and 149 g respectively irrigation water productivity did not differ among irrigation

grapevine has extended worldwide and in brazil it achieved 74 826 ha with a total grape production of 1 416 398 ton in 2020 in its semi arid region in northeastern brazil significant area has been cultivated with grapes being 8 299 ha in the state of pernambuco and 1 969 ha in the state of bahia in 2020 ibge 2021 around 48 of this total grape production has been destined to grape processing wine juice and other derived products mello and machado 2020 in 2019 brazil stands at 81 000 ha of surface area vineyard oiv 2020b and has an estimated wine production volume of 2 2 million of hectoliters in 2019 oiv 2020a over the last few decades the lower middle são francisco valley along the border of states of pernambuco and bahia has appeared as one of the main tropical wine production areas in that country typically growing under irrigation conditions and trained mainly in vertical shoot positioning systems with proper irrigation and crop management practices the farmers can produce grapes and carry out winemaking at any time of the year allowing a potential average of between two and three vineyard growing cycles per year in accordance with and depending on each variety teixeira et al 2017 since then there is an increasing demand for high quality wine by winemakers in that region as grapevine water demand is full filled by irrigation due to low rainfall pattern one of the challenges facing winemakers is to improve grape quality in irrigated vineyards throughout an appropriate balance between vegetative and reproductive development souza et al 2009 in irrigated grapevines for wine production it is important to know the effects of water supply on yield grape composition and wine quality to achieve an adequate irrigation scheduling commonly reduced soil water availability and or plant water stress is performed for desirable outcomes as controlling plant vigor dry and loveys 1998 chaves et al 2007 chacón vozmediano et al 2020 romić et al 2020 enhancing berry quality for winemaking chaves et al 2007 acevedo opazo et al 2010 bucchetti et al 2011 zarrouk et al 2012 romero et al 2015 uriarte et al 2016 ramos et al 2020 reducing water consumption by plants bassoi et al 2007 chaves et al 2007 acevedo opazo et al 2010 silva et al 2018 and increasing intrinsic water use efficiency chaves et al 2007 silva et al 2018 romić et al 2020 limited water availability and climate changes trigo córdoba et al 2015 intrigliolo et al 2016 franck et al 2020 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2020 jordan and speelman 2020 also become a concern regarding the water addressed for irrigation in grapevines deficit irrigation has emerged as a potential strategy to allow crops to withstand mild water stress with little or no decreases of yield and potentially a positive impact on fruit quality for this the understanding of the physiological and molecular bases of grapevine responses to this water deficit is fundamental to optimize deficit irrigation management chaves et al 2010 one of the most promising management irrigation techniques utilized in vineyards in semi arid areas is regulated deficit irrigation rdi as it offers greater potential to reduce vine vigor stabilize yield improve berry quality and increase water use efficiency in different varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions romero et al 2013 rdi strategy in wine vineyards implies dynamic irrigation according to the phenological stage rather than simple implication of constant deficit irrigation high water availability during early berry development enhanced vegetative growth and increased berry size and yield of merlot grapevines reducing water supply in order to create a certain level of drought stress during late berry development did not damage yield or berry maturation rdi combining higher irrigation from flowering to bunch closure and lower irrigation from bunch closure to harvest has the potential to generate the best balance between vegetative growth high yield and wine with enhanced color and aroma compounds munitz et al 2017 however there are apparent contradictory results about the success of applying regulated deficit irrigation to achieve higher quality grapes which may be related to the accuracy of plant water status monitoring to regulate and to manage the physiological changes imposed to the grapevines by deficit irrigation acevedo opazo et al 2010 romero et al 2013 in southern portugal irrigation did not significantly affect castelão and moscatel berry sugar accumulation and ph and those results were in contrast with other authors who observed either an increase or a decrease in berry sugars induced by high soil water availability chaves et al 2007 in northwestern spain the differences on plant water status rainfed and irrigated godello and treixadura grapevines did not alter stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence and irrigation increased yield only for treixadura in only one season of three evaluated must quality was slightly affected by irrigation but differences were not observed in wines water productivity was greater in rain fed vines in the case of godello whereas in treixadura no significant differences between treatments were detected gross incomes were not increased by the irrigation practice except for treixadura in the last year trigo córdoba et al 2015 reducing irrigation water supply from 100 to 70 of crop evapotranspiration etc between fruit set to harvest slightly decreased mid day leaf water potential and no impact on leaf gas exchange canopy development yield and intrinsic water use efficiency of cabernet sauvignon vines in southeastern washington usa keller et al 2016 meanwhile the effects of post veraison deficit irrigation 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 etc on cabernet sauvignon water use efficiency decreased with increasing water application and this effect was statistically significant in the more irrigated treatment intrioglio et al 2016 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 reported that despite the huge amount of work aiming at assessing the effects of water status on vine yield and grape composition no clear relationships could be established between stem water potential and berry size and composition this is due to the large number of factors involved in grape composition development indicating that water status might not be its main driver cultivar timing of exposure to water restrictions and rootstock have a great influence on must and wine composition nevertheless other factors such as climate leaf surface yield ratio training systems amongst others might interact with water stress and salinity syrah is the most cultivated wine grapevine in the lower middle são francisco valley high solar radiation availability and irrigation feasibility throughout the year make the grapevine cultivation possible any time therefore deficit irrigation practices in syrah grapevines in that region have been previously studied on physiological and yield bases in the first three growing seasons yield difference appeared only in the third one with higher cluster weight for full irrigated fi grapevines followed by regulated deficit irrigated rdi and deficit irrigated di plants while average cluster weight was lower in di in the first and third seasons differences on soluble content were found only in the third season lower for fi while titratable acidity was always lower for di grapevines bassoi et al 2011 2015 the authors found at maximum moderate plant water stress in di grapevines by measuring pre dawn leaf water potential still in relation to that region wines originated from grapes from rdi and di vines showed higher values of alcohol content malic and lactic acids flavonols stilbenes anthocyanins epicatechin epicatechin gallate and procyanidin a2 tpi and color intensity and can be classified as aged wine while wine originated from full irrigation vines showed the highest values of ascorbic and tartaric acids lowest alcohol content and phenolic compounds in general and can be classified as young wines this enabled the production of wines with specific characteristics that should please many consumers with different tastes nascimento et al 2016 oliveira et al 2018 thus the major goal of this study was to investigate the yield and ecophysiological mechanisms in syrah grapevines cultivated under deficit irrigation practices in lower middle são francisco valley 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out at in vineyard located at experimental field of bebedouro embrapa

irrigation was cut off until harvesting the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three irrigation treatments fi rdi and di with four replications each plot consisted of 48 grapevines in two rows with 24 plants each and 12 of them middle portion of plot were used for measurements 2 4 fertigation the replacement of soil nutrients was carried out by means of fertigation in each season applying 20 kg ha 1 of n and 40 kg ha 1 k2o in all growing seasons the fertilizers used were urea and potassium sulfate and they were weekly applied in all irrigation strategies until flowering and before irrigation interruption in rdi and di treatments 2 5 plant and soil water relations the pre dawn ψpd and the mid day ψmd leaf water potentials were measured on two expanded leaves using the scholander pressure chamber model 1000 pms instrument co corvallis or usa in each treatment at two different times from 03h00 to 04h00 and from 12h00 to 13h00 respectively leaves were collected from the median portion of branches in different plants and in each of four replicates per treatment the ψpd and ψmd measurements were performed at 57 68 85 and 111 dap 6 and 17 june and 4

s ratios as described by during 1994 and flexas et al 1998 2 9 berry analysis in each harvesting and in each repetition per treatment 200 berries were collected on opposite sides of the cluster in the upper middle and basal regions packed in plastic bags and transported inside styrofoam boxes with ice to the laboratory of enology at embrapa semi arid the mass of 100 berries was determined by a digital scale afterwards berries were macerated and their must was used for analyses of soluble solid content ss brix using portable refractometer atago brand pocket pal 1 model of titratable acidity ta expressed in g l 1 of tartaric acid according to ial 2005 and of ph using digital gauge 2 10 carbon isotopic composition δ13c in the harvesting of 1gs berries were collected from opposite sides of the cluster and at its upper median and basal portions the berries were packed frozen and transported to the centre for stable isotopes institute of biosciences sao paulo state university botucatu brazil 13c 12c isotopic ratios of the must samples were obtained according to dutra et al 2011 2 11 statistical methods anova f test at 5 probability and tukey test at 5 probability were performed using sisvar version 4 0 dex ufla lavras mg brazil 3 results and discussion 3 1 growing season weather and irrigation data higher eto and etc values were observed in 2gs than the others because it occurred in the period of year with the highest et demand in petrolina however in that season there was a high magnitude rainfall specifically between 66 and 75 dap during which there was no irrigation hence gross irrigation depth gid in fi treatment was slightly lower than in other two seasons 1gs and 3gs there were no high magnitude rainfalls in 1gs and 3gs seasons table 1 in the experimental site the lower rainfall pattern observed in 1gs april to august and 3gs may to september is usually observed in that period of the year autunn and winter seasons while 2gs october to january was carried out within the spring and summer seasons in which rainfall pattern is higher 3 2 soil water content as gid applied was the same for all treatments until the beginning of irrigation interruption at 43 45 and 51 dap respectively for 1gs 2gs and 3gs which means that there were no major differences in θ values among all treatments until these dates but subsequently θ up to 0 60 m depth in rdi and di has become smaller than fi treatment figs 1 2 and 3 it is noteworthy that for the edaphic conditions in lower middle são francisco valley the effective depth of the root system of irrigated grapevine was 0 60 m bassoi et al 2002 2003 however in 2gs fig 2 it happened a lower influence of irrigation on θ behavior after the interruption of water application than in 1gs fig 1 and 3gs fig 3 due to higher rainfalls from 70 to 76 dap 146 mm in rdi when irrigation was performed based on θ monitoring an increase of θ was observed up to 0 45 m depth in 1gs fig 1 because of water application at 64 65 83 84 85 103 104 and 105 dap and in 3gs fig 3 because of irrigations at 82 83 97 98 and 99 dap in 2 gs fig 2 this increase of θ in rdi occurred up to 0 60 m depth because of water application at 62 99 100 and 101 dap but in that season it happened a lower influence of irrigation on θ behavior after the interruption of water application due to higher rainfalls from 70 to 76 dap 146 mm in the deeper soil depths 0 75 0 90 1 05 and 1 20 m θ increased over the time until the irrigation interruption and after that decreased slightly in 1gs and 3gs fig 1 and 3 respectively except in 2gs fig 2 as consequence of the high magnitude rainfalls the increase in the density of an ultisol in depth in areas of the semi arid region of northeastern brazil under natural vegetation caatinga biome and under irrigation in petrolina was evaluated from the soil surface down to a depth of 1 m in 10 cm layers using computed tomography and results suggest a density increase at depths below 0 4 m fante junior et al 2002 the presence of these hardsetting soil layers are common in that region in consequence of changes in the arrangement of soil particles structure decreasing pore volume and increasing soil density and mechanical resistance to penetration of roots water and nutrients a simple texture gradient and a double layer of clay accumulation are presented between the surface and subsurface soil horizons soils silva et al 2004 this subsurface hardsetting is due to pedogenetic processes like eluviation and iluviation of clay which acts as pore sealing as well as plinthitization processes and clay dispersion influenced by alternate cycles of wetting and drying silva et al 2008 then this soil condition which occurs in an ultisol is crucial for the presence of higher values of θ in deeper soil depths of that area which has been irrigated throughout the year and for several years since grape production is an intensive agricultural exploitation under irrigation in that region it is important to highlight that shallow soils probably do not provide water storage to plants below effective rooting zone which makes relevant the importance of soil survey for deficit irrigation purposes 3 3 leaf water potential the measurements of leaf water potential in 1gs are shown in fig 4 left at 57 dap there were differences regarding ψpd and ψmd among fi treatment and others rdi and di which did not differ from the second reading 68 dap ψpd and ψmd only differentiated between fi and di treatments the fi treatment plants showed ψpd values close to or below 0 20 mpa indicating that in this treatment grapevines showed good water conditions ojeda 2007 the ψpd values of rdi and di treatments characterized a level of water restriction as light to medium 0 2 to 0 4 mpa except at 111 dap in di treatment which showed water restriction level of between medium to strong 0 4 to 0 6 mpa as pointed out by ojeda 2007 the ψpd values found in this study are slightly below those found 0 6 mpa and 0 4 mpa for the grapevine subjected to water deficit during two growing seasons in valencia spain intrigliolo and castel 2009 souza et al 2009 and chaves et al 2010 found ψpd values close to 0 2 mpa in grapevine syrah submitted to water deficit in 2gs there were only two ψ measurements due to rainfall which occurred after the irrigation interruption in the rdi and di treatments fig 4 middle the ψpd values of fi treatment were also close to 0 20 mpa indicating good plant water status while rdi and di treatments were lower between 0 20 and 0 40 mpa with a light to moderate water restriction level at 63 dap ψpd and ψmd values of rdi and di treatments did not differ between them but were different from the fi treatment however at 99 dap ψpd values of di treatment did not differ statistically from the other treatments regarding ψmd their values did not differ among treatments this was possibly due to rainfall occurred during the second growing season in 3gs fig 4 right ψpd values of fi treatment at 78 dap were higher than the rdi and di treatments however at 107 dap fi and rdi treatments differed between them but di didn t differ from both the fi treatment showed values above 0 20 mpa indicating good plant hydration while rdi plants were 0 54 mpa and 0 70 mpa presenting medium to strong water restriction levels di treatment presented readings near 0 4 mpa indicating light to medium water restriction level the ψmd was higher in the fi treatment the ψmd values were lower than those of ψpd due to higher deficit of vapor pressure which occurs during the day causing increased transpiration and consequently lower hydration plant pinheiro et al 2004 3 4 carbon isotopic concentration the main factor that affects the 13c 12c ratio is water stress farquhar et al 1989 yu et al 2021 and higher values of δ13c indicate less discrimination due to lower values of intercellular co2 and more efficient water use farquhar et al 1982 buchmann and kaplan 2001 in 1gs the fi treatment had lower values than rdi and di treatments confirming the presence of greater water stress in the grapevines this result is due to stomatal closure in plants under water stress confirmed by the results of g s having greater values of δ13c a similar behavior was observed in grapevines with and without water deficiency souza et al 2005 gaudillere et al 2002 studied the variation of the water status in different varieties of grapevines and obtained δ13c values for the syrah grapevine of 23 7 higher compared to the present study a comparison of the effect water deficiency with δ13c can be used with good precision on grapevines subjected to water stress δ13c is related to the ratio ci ca and iwp moreover most of the δ13c change in yield grapevines was related to water stress and demonstrated a significant correlation between δ13c measured in sugar of ripe berries and plant water status measured as the minimum predawn leaf water gaudillère et al 2002 3 5 gas exchange and water use efficiency the gas exchange measurements in 3gs were performed at 51 79 and 107 dap fig 5 and no differences were observed at 51 dap because the water depth applied up to this data had been the same for all treatments in the results of net photosynthesis a transpiration e and stomatal conductance g s at 79 and 107 dap large reductions occurred in rdi and di in comparison with fi treatment plants due to water restriction imposed by the irrigation interruption and higher soil water availability in fi strategy stomata closed when plants are under water stress in order to avoid complete leaf dehydration then co2 diffusion is limited to the leaf mesophyll which causes photosynthesis decrease chaves et al 2009 in the field plant stomatal closure controls water loss and midday leaf water potential and as grapevine is an isohydric species tardieu and simonneau 1998 it promotes high iwp related net photosynthetic activity and describe tolerant genotypes to water deficit jones 1983 higher a rates were found by santos et al 2013 in an experiment conducted in the same field and with the same grapevine cultivar without water restriction with measurements between 08h00 and 10h00 which is comparable to fi treatment chaves et al 2010 reported higher a values in syrah grapevines under drought in southern portugal which is comparable to di and rdi irrigation strategies romero et al 2013 found minimum a values in grapevines under water restriction in semi arid region of spain the g s response of plants under different irrigation strategies was similar to a values indicating stomatal closure in plants subjected to water stress and decrease in co2 assimilation these values were also found by chaves et al 2010 in syrah grapevines under drought stomatal conductance of vittis vinifera with water availability were higher in teszlák et al 2013 which are higher when compared to the fi treatment of this study this result may have been caused by climatic factors as the high vapor pressure deficit recorded during the measurements in this study fig 6 with maximum values near to 4 kpa besides being distinct mechanisms a and e are associated by leaf stomata aperture and closure that connect the plant to the atmospheric air and by which plants perform their gas exchange at 79 dap e decreased in rdi and di plants due to stomatal closure caused by water deficit and consequently lower a the fi treatment showed the highest average a values since there was a water replacement according to plant needs thus indicating the influence of the treatments on grapevine physiological behavior this is also presented in the ψpd and ψmd also indicating medium level of water stress this study showed variation of e values of rdi and di treatments and below from those obtained by souza et al 2009 in syrah grapevine under di irrigation strategy the complex mechanism of plant gas exchange is an important factor in semi arid conditions which decreases e and consequently the a growth and production thus there is a connection between a and e and to better evaluate this duality it is necessary the analysis of the water use efficiency by the instantaneous efficiency of water use a e or intrinsic efficiency of water use a g s ratios during 1994 flexas et al 1998 at 79 and 107 dap rdi and di plants showed higher values of the a g s and fi treatment had lower one fig 6 in semi arid conditions the plants with good soil water availability have higher a and g s intrigliolo and castel 2009 as in the present work on fi treatment with lower values of a g s grapevines under moderate water deficit usually present e rates decline with pre dawn leaf water potential lower than stomatal conductance as a result the a g s is generally higher in grapevine under deficit irrigation light to moderate water stress than under well watered conditions this is reflected in lower water use and higher a g s by crops which is the objective of deficit irrigation strategies applied in vineyards especially in semi arid region gaudillère et al 2002 chaves and oliveira 2004 souza et al 2005 the results of a e in fi treatment presented lower values in the measurements taken at 07h00 and 10h00 fig 6 due to lower vpd in the first hours of the day higher stomata aperture in rdi and di grapevines as well as higher a and lower e values fig 5 and consequent increase of the a e measurements taken at 13h00 and 15h00 presented most vpd decreasing a due to decreased g s in both deficit irrigation strategies and no difference related to a e occurred in these times among all treatments measurements of the c i c a at 79 dap and at all times fig 6 were higher in the fi treatment this result can be confirmed by higher average values of a g s and e in fi treatment fig 5 grapevines under water deficit rdi and di presented lower g s values partial stomatal closure and lower c i c a values in plants of the rdi and fi treatments which indicate stomatal limitation in order to reduce excessive water loss in proportion to an increase in vpd the plants promote the stomata closure but this limited the entry of co2 with consequent reduction in a m m

deficit irrigation practices in modulating water use efficiency growth and grape berry composition is dependent on the variety characteristics vigor and drought avoiding traits the type of soil and the prevailing weather rainfall and temperature as commented by chaves et al 2010 ramos et al 2020 also observed that due to different climatic conditions recorded during 10 years differences in the grape composition during maturation were observed both in timing and in the final characteristics weather conditions mainly rainfall and et varied among all seasons evaluated since they occurred in different periods of the year and consequently the volume of water applied through drip irrigation system differed too therefore plant responses have changed from one growing season to another 4 conclusion we evaluated the regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation strategies applied from the close cluster stage to harvesting in comparison with full irrigation over three consecutive growing seasons of drip irrigated syrah grapevine in the semi arid region of northeastern brazil the soil investigated herein presents hardsetting layers at soil depths below effective rooting zone of grapevine 0 4 0 6 m this condition promotes a higher soil water availability at deeper soil profile between 0 6 and 1 0 m depth even when deficit irrigation strategy is applied consequently moderate plant water stress and decreased on plant water consumption were observed in all growing seasons irrigation water productivity did not differ among irrigation strategies in all seasons but intrinsic efficiency of water use was higher when deficit irrigation was applied a small reduction on average cluster weight was observed in two growing seasons due to water restriction soluble solid content differed just in 2gs while tritatable acidity was different among treatments in 1gs and 2gs hence deficit irrigation strategies can be applied for water saving purposes and monitoring soil water content at profile will be helpful for that future research should address alterations in canopy size and microclimate as weel as a long term observation as deficit irrigation should led to a decline in vine capacity and yield deeper analysis of berries and wines should be worthly too declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9861,a multilocation field experiment was conducted at students research farm department of agronomy punjab agricultural university pau ludhiana and pau regional research station rrs bathinda during summer 2019 the experiment was conducted in rcbd with 15 treatment combinations with 3 replications the treatments comprised of 3 mulch levels i e m0 m6 and m12 i e no mulch 6 and 12 t ha 1 respectively and 5 irrigation schedules i e i10 i20 i30 and i40 with 10 20 30 and 40 depletion of available soil water asw respectively and ir pau recommendation as 4 irrigations the growth parameters plant height dry matter accumulation and leaf area index yield attributing characters namely pods per plant number of seeds per pod and thousand grain weight seed and straw yield were significantly higher in m12 than m6 and no mulch m0 the growth parameters yield attributes seed and straw yield were significantly higher for i10 due to increased irrigation frequency 5 6 irrigations both m0i10 seven irrigations without mulch and m6i30 3 irrigations with straw mulch 6 t ha 1 treatments observed comparable seed yield 1 06 t ha 1 therefore the substantial increase in seed yield with lower crop water use with the usage of straw mulch saves a considerable amount of water subsequently the use of 6 t ha 1 of straw mulch with 3 irrigations 30 depletion from available soil water facilitated a higher seed yield the crop water use cwu was highest for m0 as due to bare soil resulted in more evapotranspiration the bio physical productivity bpwp and water use efficiency was found to be maximum for mulch treatments the i10 reported maximum cwu whereas bio physical water productivity bpwp were higher for i40 treatment where only one irrigation was given in this treatment the wue was maximum in i30 treatment at ludhiana and in i20 at bathinda location keywords green gram mulch levels irrigation regimes yield water productivity 1 introduction in the indian northern plains it is commonly observed that the field remains vacant till the onset of the monsoon so short duration crop which can fit in the crop sequence of rice wheat has immense importance thus the green gram bean vigna radiata l can be considered as the best candidate for the short window period after the harvest of the wheat the green gram being the short duration crop 60 days have a higher yield and attracts the farmers of punjab as well as of the whole indo gangetic plains the seeds of the green gram are highly nutritious containing 2 5 3 0 times higher protein content than cereals kumar et al 2016 green gram is resistant to drought and shade conditions as well as to low fertility the green gram crop can restore soil fertility by biological nitrogen fixation ram et al 2016 and so adds value in the rice wheat rotation usually there are two seasons for the sowing of green gram i e the summer season and the kharif season for which the yield of green gram bean is higher as compared to the kharif season crop the reason behind the lower yield of kharif season green gram is the concurrence with the monsoon and so higher infestation of diseases and insect pest attack whereas the short duration varieties of summer green gram bean are available yadav and singh 2014 the crop of green gram bean is sown in the summer season which is characterized by harsh temperature conditions and low relative humidity so the frequent application of irrigation is very essential for the growth and development of the crop singh 2005 irrigation is termed as a key driving facet that affects water and nutrient dynamics in the plant s root zone li et al 2020 so the major concern is the restoration of the fertile conditions of the soil with the rationalized use of water kaur 2014 if the irrigation is limited at critical stages of the crop it may drastically lower yields so excess or inadequate water may unswervingly affect crop growth so increasing water productivity is an imperative practice lesser amount of water perceptively for obtaining higher yields henceforth innovative irrigation practices help in enhancing water use efficiency thereby enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of the irrigation system levidow et al 2014 consequently agronomic intervention like mulching proves to be a practical solution for maintaining the optimum soil thermal and moisture regimes ranjan 1982 and ultimately higher crop yields sekhon et al 2020 after the harvest of the paddy straw farmers have paddy straw in abundance and usually being burnt in the field which pollutes the environment thus using paddy straw for mulch in various field crops as well as vegetables can unravel the menace further it is best organic mulch which in addition to the paddy straw mulch adds organic matter to the soil after its decomposition the mulch application helps in the blockage of the transportation of the vapors from the soil surface by acting as a barrier to the soil and altering the net radiation arriving at the soil surface it also helps in the suppression of the growth of the weeds moderating the soil surface temperature modifying the microclimatic conditions and helps in prevention of soil erosion kaur and bons 2017 bunna et al 2011 reported that paddy straw mulching helps in the tying up of soil nitrogen and the promotion of nitrogen in leguminous crops like green gram hence it is hypothesized that with the application of mulch a lesser number of irrigations are required by the crop keeping this in the view the present study was undertaken with the objective to investigate the effect of paddy straw mulching and irrigation regimes on the growth and productivity of green gram secondly to compute the water use and water productivity of green gram under various paddy straw mulch levels and irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out at students research farm department of agronomy punjab agricultural university pau ludhiana and pau regional research station rrs bathinda during summer 2019 these two stations were observed due to the varied weather conditions for studying irrigation and mulching effects the experimental site of ludhiana is situated at an altitude of 247 m above mean sea level with a latitudinal extent of 30 56 15 n and a longitudinal extent of 75 52 45 e the bathinda experimental station is situated at latitude 30 36 10 n and longitude 74 28 53 e with an altitude 211 m above mean sea level 2 2 weather and climate the subtropical semi arid type of climate is the key character of the ludhiana and bathinda region the four main climatological seasons of this region are winters december to february summers or pre monsoon lasting from march to may monsoon or rainy season lasting from june to september and post monsoon or autumn season october to november the sub tropical climate is responsible for the wide variation in the mean maximum temperature and it reaches a peak of 47 c in june month whereas the freezing temperatures associated with frosty spells are quite common during december and january the average annual rainfall of 500 750 mm is received in the ludhiana region and 440 mm for the bathinda region from which the maximum rainfall is contributed by the monsoon period the meteorological data recorded at the meteorological observatory of pau ludhiana and pau rrs bathinda during the crop growing season are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively the total rainfall received during the growing season of the crop for ludhiana and bathinda was 96 6 mm and 122 2 mm respectively and the total evaporation recorded was 553 4 mm and 940 mm for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the mean weekly maximum air temperature fluctuated between 31 3 and 39 3 c and the mean weekly minimum temperature varied between 18 1 and 22 3 c for ludhiana for the bathinda station the mean weekly maximum air temperature ranged between 34 9 and 44 8 c and the mean weekly minimum temperature ranged between 17 6 and 26 9 c the mean weekly relative humidity ranged between 30 2 and 57 1 and 34 9 71 9 for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the weekly sunshine hours ranged from 8 9 to 11 6 h and 6 0 10 5 h for ludhiana and bathinda respectively 2 3 soil of the experimental field the textural class of the soils of ludhiana and bathinda experimental station was loamy sand and sandy loam respectively the water content at field capacity 30 kpa and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa of 0 100 cm rhizosphere was 255 mm and 103 mm respectively for ludhiana the water content at field capacity 30 kpa and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa of 0 100 cm rhizosphere was 265 mm and 122 mm respectively for bathinda hence the available water in the 0 100 cm soil profile was 152 mm and 143 mm for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the average bulk density of the soil was 1 57 g cm 3 and 1 59 g cm 3 respectively for ludhiana and bathinda the physical properties of the experimental field are shown layer wise in table 1 for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the top 0 15 cm layer of the soil profile was neutral in ph 7 7 and 8 3 1 2 soil water ratio with 0 16 and 0

respectively 2 4 experimental treatments and methodology the experiment comprised fifteen combinations of treatments of mulch levels and irrigation schedules table 3 the three mulch levels were m0 no mulch application m6 6 t ha 1 and m12 12 t ha 1 whereas five irrigation schedules were i10 10 depletion from available soil water i20 20 depletion from available soil water i30 30 depletion from available soil water i40 40 depletion from available soil water and ir four irrigations of 75 mm depth the gross plot size of the experiment was 12 15 m2 and the net plot size was 7 88 m2 the paddy straw used in the experiment was taken from the farmer s field after the harvest of the crop it was not artificially treated and no alterations were made to the original length of the straw the breeders and research workers of pau ludhiana had worked vastly and been successful in releasing the high yielding and disease resistant green gram variety sml 832 suitable for irrigated conditions the pre sowing irrigation 75 mm was provided to the field just one day before the sowing of the crop the post sowing irrigations to the crop were provided as per the irrigation treatments at the experiment trial of ludhiana the depletion was noted from the 100 cm soil profile with the fdr frequency domain reflectometry tubes installed in the treatment plots on the day of sowing of the crop at the bathinda station the depletion level of the soil profile was calculated by the gravimetric method the details of the irrigation schedule during crop season at ludhiana and bathinda are given in table 4 the paddy straw was applied to the plots as per the mulch level treatments the samples of soil water were taken up to 100 cm soil profile at the sowing time of the crop as well as at the crop harvest to determine the contribution of the soil profile water at the initial days of the crop the soil water was measured up to 40 cm according to root depth but in the latter days soil water data from the 0 100 cm soil profile was recorded the summer green gram crop variety sml 832 was sown on 20 april 2019 at both locations the harvesting of crop at ludhiana was done on 1 july 2019 whereas on 2 july 2019 at the bathinda the sowing was done by the pora method making a total of nine lines in each plot and the space between the two lines was 22 5 cm with the plants being 7 cm apart the seed was treated with captan 30 g kg 1 of seed to prevent fungal infestation and diseases the nitrogen application was made at the recommended dose of 12 5 kg ha 1 by basal application of urea fertilizer at the time of sowing the phosphorus was applied by single super phosphate ssp application 40 kg ha 1 as a basal dose to control the pre emergence weeds the immediate application of pendimethalin stomp 30 ec 2 5 litres ha 1 anonymous 2020 the crop was damaged by the tobacco caterpillar and the spray of chlorpyriphos 20 ec 4 5 litres ha 1 anonymous 2020 was done with manual operated knapsack sprayer the crop was protected from the attack of sucking pests by the spray of triazophos 40 ec 1 5 litres ha 1 anonymous 2020 the height of the plant was recorded from the level of the ground and up to the junction of the petiole of leaf and stem of the last leaf which was fully opened the dry matter accumulation was recorded by removing five randomly selected plants then dried under the sun followed by an oven drying at a temperature range of 60 c until a constant weight of the plant sample is reached the three yield attributing characters i e number of pods per plant number of seeds per pod and thousand seed weight were recorded influencing the yield of green gram for the pod count per plant five random plants were selected and the total number of pods were counted on the five selected plants then the total pods on the five plants were counted and the average value was calculated for the number of pods per plant for the data on the number of seeds per pod five pods were randomly selected and the seeds were counted in total and then the average value was calculated and observed the number of seeds per pod for 1000 seed weight one thousand healthy seeds were counted weighed and the data was represented as 1000 seed weight the seed yield of every individual plot was recorded from a net plot area size of 7 88 m2 7 lines of 5 m length then the process of threshing and finally cleaning was carried out and values were expressed as t ha 1 2 5 soil water studies 2 5 1 crop water use soil water content was measured with time domain refractometry calibrated with the gravimetric method from 0 to 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 100 cm profile to compute soil water storage at pau ludhiana while at bathinda same was determined gravimetrically from 0 to 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 100 cm profile to compute soil water storage the crop season water use or consumptive use of water under the different treatments was worked out by the formula actual crop

drainage was considered zero when soil profile water storage was less than field capacity and when soil water storage exceeded the field capacity storage after irrigation or rainfall then deep drainage was calculated as the difference between the field capacity storage and soil water storage plus irrigation rainfall 2 5 2 the bio physical water productivity bpwp and water use efficiency wue

regimes on the various parameters of summer green gram and their interaction effects table 5 the data which was collected on the various investigation aspects were statistically analyzed as described by cochran and cox 1967 the analysis of variation was done by factorial rcbd randomized complete block design with sas software statistical package sas version 9 4 sas 2017 institute inc cary nc usa and the means were compared with fischer s least significant difference test at a 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 growth parameters the growth parameters such as the plant height dry matter and leaf area index lai significantly varied with the mulch levels and irrigation regimes table 6 the plant height was 6 96 and 4 92 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively for ludhiana however the increase was 21 75 and 0 78 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively for bathinda the dry matter accumulation was significantly higher for m6 and it was 18 56 and 8 19 higher than m0 and m12 respectively for ludhiana for bathinda the dry matter accumulation was 34 07 and 4 72 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively the lai was found to be 26 67 and 18 75 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively for ludhiana however a similar trend was observed for bathinda nevertheless there was no difference in leaf area between 6 and 12 t ha 1 straw mulch levels among the irrigation schedules the i10 treatment recorded significantly higher plant height dry matter accumulation and lai at harvest for both locations the lowest plant height was observed under the i40 schedule the combination of paddy straw mulch and lesser irrigation intervals produced more plant height than the no mulch treatment with higher irrigation frequency table 7 the treatment m6i20 performed preeminent at the ludhiana location and m12i10 treatment at bathinda the lowest plant height was recorded in m0i40 40 depletion from available soil water and without mulch at both locations the treatments with more number irrigations 5 7 recorded the highest dry matter the addition of mulch along with frequent irrigations helped in the higher accumulation of dry matter in green gram the treatment m6i10 at ludhiana and m6i20 at the bathinda site viewed maximum values when compared nearly 25 and 28 higher dry matter accumulation was found in mulched plots in respect to i10 treatment in respect to lai maximum values were observed in i 10 and lowest in i40 level the positive interaction showed higher values under treatment m6i10 than the same depletion level i e 10 depletion from available soil water but without mulch m0i10 at both the locations the i40 treatment showed the lowest lai in all mulch treatments as only one irrigation was given in the whole crop period in m0 m6 and m12 treatments 3 2 yield attributes the various yield attributes like pods per plant seeds per pod and 1000 seed weight varied significantly with the mulch levels and irrigation regimes except the seeds per pod which did not differ statistically table 8 at the ludhiana a per cent decrease of m0 8 7 and m6 2 9 as compared to the m12 mulch level was found the m12 treatment reported a significantly higher pod number than m0 but there were no statistically significant differences in m12 and m6 treatments at both the locations the positive interactions between mulch levels and irrigation regimes table 9 imply that higher pods per plant can be obtained with the inclusion of mulch 6 t ha 1 therefore the maximum number of pods were found in the treatment m6i20 as under i20 the numbers of irrigations were four for both the locations but for i30 three irrigations at both ludhiana and bathinda were given to the crop thus statistically the equivalent number of pods per plant was obtained by saving one irrigation in treatment m6i10 seven irrigations both locations sans mulch provided a statistically similar pod count per plot than m12i30 treatment as a consequence the water was conserved by the mulch application and with a combination of irrigation resulting in a higher pod set per plant significantly higher 1000 seed weight was recorded in mulch treatments m6 and m12 than without mulch the per cent reduction was found to be 6 5 5 and 2 1 3 for m0 and m6 compared to m12 for ludhiana and bathinda respectively for ludhiana among the irrigation schedules no statistically significant differences between i10 and i20 treatment were present however i10 was significantly better than i30 i40 and ir treatments in terms of seeds per pod for both the locations no statistically significant differences between the irrigation regimes viz i10 i20 i30were observed as the number of seeds per pod plays a pivotal role in deciding the seed yield if these irrigation treatments do not differ significantly in respect to seed number per plot then the seed yield might be comparable in these treatments 3 3 seed yield the seed yield is the ultimate product of the yield attributing characters the data on the seed yield of green gram under the effect of various mulch levels and irrigation schedules are presented in table 10 for both ludhiana and bathinda the highest seed yield was observed in m12 mulch at 12 t ha 1 and significantly higher than m0 where no mulch was applied at both locations though statistically no significant difference was observed between m6 and m12 treatments the per cent increase in the seed yield of m12 was 15 7 and 16 1 than m0 2 8 and 3 6 than m6 treatment at both ludhiana and bathinda respectively the i10 treatment observing frequent irrigations 6 and 5 irrigations under all the mulch levels showed maximum seed yield at both the experimental sites while no statistically significant differences were found with i20 5 irrigations treatment the results indicate that the frequently irrigated treatments of i10 and i20 reported a higher seed yield as compared to treatments with wide intervals within the two irrigations however the irrigation treatment i30 did not differ statistically from i20 treatment the lowest seed yield under i40 was owing to very little irrigation during the whole crop growth period at ludhiana the m6i10 m6i20 and m6i30 reported 1 14 1 10 and 1 06 t ha 1 respectively and the treatments of m12i10 m12i20 and m12i30 reported 1 15 1 11 and 1 09 t ha 1 respectively a similar seed yield 1 06 t ha 1 was observed under m0i10 and m6i30 treatments under m0i10 seven irrigations were given without mulch and in m6i30 at both the locations only 3 irrigations were given in combination with straw mulch 6 t ha 1 3 4 soil water studies 3 4 1 crop water use the mulch level of m0 recorded maximum crop water use than the m6 and m12 for both the locations the crop water use was 7 70 and 3 61 more for m0 and m6 as compared to m12 mulch level table 11 for ludhiana and the corresponding values for bathinda were 7 07 and 4 24 for the irrigation levels the frequently irrigated i10 treatment has a maximum crop water use of 471 1 mm followed by i20 ir i30 and the least for the i40 with the lowest irrigation count for ludhiana and a similar trend was followed for bathinda the crop water use was 63 02 60 19 40 40 and 50 99 more for i10 i20 i30 and ir as compared to i40 and the corresponding values for bathinda are 59 25 56 39 39 08 and 46 74 the crop water productivity was found to be maximum for m12 than m0 and m6 for both ludhiana and bathinda table 11 the higher seed yield at m12 and m6 resulted in higher cwp than the m0 mulch level among the irrigation levels the maximum value of cwp was for i40 the highest value of cwp under i40 was as a result of giving only one irrigation 3 4 2 bio physical water productivity and water use efficiency the bio physical productivity bpwp was found to be maximum for m12 than m0 and m6 for locations table 11 but water use efficiency wue was highest in m6 at ludhiana and at bathinda location equivalent values were noticed under both mulch levels m6 and m12 the higher seed yield in m12 and m6 treatments resulted in higher awp than the m0 mulch level among the irrigation the maximum value of bpwp was for i40 treatment for ludhiana and bathinda both whereas wue was maximum in i30 treatment at ludhiana and in i20 at bathinda location 4 discussion the dwindling irrigation resources and underground saline water in india particularly in the southwest region of punjab enforce to ponder about water conservation and management the farmers are buoyant to amplify cropping intensity for higher returns so it is our accountability to take care of our natural resources the burning of paddy straw mulch after the harvest of the crop is widespread throughout rice growing states so the use of paddy straw mulch for water conservation is of ample significance moreover it is free of charge the use of paddy straw influenced growth parameters such as the plant height dry matter and leaf area index lai an adequate supply of water unswervingly augments the growth and dry matter production of crops in addition to obliquely increasing the availability and utilization of nutrients kaur and singh 2006 during the summer months the temperatures reach as high as 48 0 c in punjab as mulches create congenial environment the higher increase in plant height dry matter accumulation lai under mulch than no mulch was due to more water conservation and lesser evaporation from the soil surface further significantly the better height under frequent irrigations yadav and singh 2014 with the use of straw mulch may have resulted due to enhanced water economy mulching also improved dry matter accumulation and lai compared to unmulched plots irrespective of the amount level of mulch akhtar et al 2019 also reported higher biomass accumulation of soybean crops with the application of wheat straw mulch ram et al 2013 also reported higher lai in wheat with the application of straw mulch compared to no mulch treatment kar and kumar 2007 also revealed that maximum lai was 21 35 greater in the mulched plots than in the non mulched plots under different irrigation levels in potato crop and hence straw mulch had an impact on lai depending on the irrigation treatments the frequent levels of irrigation enhanced the photosynthetic activity of the crop and so more was the accumulation of dry matter under i10 than i20 i30 treatments but when the irrigation treatments which have a wider interval between the two irrigations or the irrigations were applied less frequently the crop suffered from the water stress at some period of the growth for this reason the lowest height biomass accumulation and 1000 grain weight was found in 40 depletion of available soil water i40 as merely one irrigation was given to the crop throughout the crop duration thus affecting the photosynthesis process of the crop and ultimately affecting the dry matter accumulation the possible reason for higher lai at i10 is that the frequency of irrigation was more 7 irrigations consequently to a great extent higher vegetative growth under this treatment to maintain the turgidity of the tissue of the leaf the elongation of tissues was observed at a higher amount of irrigation level similar results were reported by vasimalai and subramanian 1980 that the increased frequency of the irrigation resulted in increased lai of the crop ram et al 2013 also reported that increased absorption of water and nutrients from the soil due to increased water availability resulted in better growth of wheat leaves under well irrigated conditions further the application of 6 t ha 1 mulch m6 showed an enhanced effect in respect to dry matter accumulation and lai than a high amount of straw mulch 12 tonne ha 1 the decline was nearly 47 6 and 33 1 in respect to m12i10 and m12i20 than m6i10 and m6i20 treatments for the dry matter at ludhiana this might be for the reason that high quantity 12 t ha 1 of straw mulch particularly with high frequency irrigations and rainfall at the latter stage of the crop 84 mm developed an enormously sodden environment for plant maturity at ludhiana consequently lai was also as low as 73 7 and 75 7 in m12i10 and m12i20 than m6i10 and m6i20 treatments at ludhiana the various yield attributes like pods per plant seeds per pod and 1000 seed weight play an imperative role in deciding crop yields the use of mulch impinges their number akhtar et al 2019 also reported that soybean crop plants produced a significantly higher number of pods with bold seeds with use of wheat straw mulch 6 t ha 1 than the plants without mulch similarly an increase in irrigation levels from 10 to 30 depletion increased these attributes arya and sharma 1994 and tank et al 1992 also reported an increase in the number of pods per plant and 1000 seed weight with increased frequency of irrigations the possible reason might be that increased frequency of irrigation delayed the crop maturity and therefore more time was taken for the partitioning of the photosynthates and assimilates to the seeds vasimalai and subramanian 1980 further the equivalent number of pods per plant was obtained under a lesser amount of irrigation water in treatment m0i10 seven irrigations both locations without mulch provided a statistically similar pod count per plot than m6i30 treatment as a consequence the water was conserved by the mulch application and with a combination of irrigation resulting in a higher pod set per plant the combination of mulch and proper irrigation helps in maintaining soil water thus improving crop yields and water use efficiency zheng et al 2021 in our study mulched plots 6 t ha 1 resulted in a 12 5 and 14 yield increase respectively at ludhiana and bathinda than non mulched conditions irrespective of irrigation regimes the equivalent seed yield 1 06 t ha 1 was observed under m0i10 and m6i30 treatments at the ludhiana location while at bathinda the values were 1 09 t ha 1 m0i10 and 1 10 m6i30 under m0i10 seven irrigations were given without mulch and in m6i30 only 3 irrigations in combination with straw mulch 6 t ha 1 were given at both the locations furthermore recommended schedule m0ir using four irrigations gave a comparatively 2 05 lower yield than the m2i30 treatment therefore a trivial increase in yield with lesser water use was observed in green gram with the use of straw mulch thereby saving nearly 750 cubic meters of irrigation water in one hectare the use of 6 t rice straw mulch per hectare is recommended than 12 t ha 1 as if the purpose is met with a lesser quantity then there is no question in wastage moreover more quantities of mulch impede the growth of the crop the combination of mulch and proper irrigation helps in maintaining soil water thus improving crop yields and water use efficiency zheng et al 2021 consequently the use of straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 with 3 irrigations 30 depletion from available soil water helped in obtaining a higher seed yield there was a marginal enhancement in grain yield at bathinda though the total rainfall at ludhiana was 122 2 mm during crop season while at bathinda was 96 6 mm but the distribution of rainfall was uniform at bathinda having eleven rainfall events in standard meteorological weeks 16 27 also at the early and mid crop growth stage whereas ludhiana experienced a total of 8 rainfall events and that also mostly in the latter stage of the crop crop maturation the better soil water availability at bathinda would have aid in the nutrient retention ultimately resulting in increased yield the climatic variations at both locations resulted in varied physiological growth and yield parameters for that reason enhanced higher grain yield at the bathinda location the mulch application helps in soil water conservation and it might be the reason for higher crop water use by the no mulch treatment this showed that water contents were more with the addition of more straw input kar and kumar 2007 also reported higher crop water use by potato crop under the absence of mulch than straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 ram et al 2013 found that straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 decreased the water use from 2 1 to 2 9 cm compared with the no mulch treatment the crop water use was higher with increased frequency of irrigation water to the crop the number of irrigations in i10 and i20 treatments varied from 5 to 7 consequently the high frequency of irrigation in i10 and i20 increased the evapotranspiration losses and so the crop water use was maximum li et al 2020 also concluded in their study on maize crops that crop water productivity in terms of volume of supplied irrigation water decreased with the increased amount of water hence mulched plots resulted in higher water use efficiency than no mulched plots kar and kumar 2007 yan et al 2017 ram et al 2013 also reported 14 7 34 2 higher water use efficiency in straw mulch treatments 2 4 and 6 t ha 1 than no mulch treatment across different irrigation levels ram et al 2013 also informed decreased water use efficiency with the increasing irrigation level 5 conclusion application of rice straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 conserved water and resulted in a higher pod set per plant and higher seed yield the equivalent seed yield was observed under no mulch and 7 irrigations 10 depletion from available soil water and straw mulch along with only 3 irrigations 30 depletion from available soil water also recommended schedule four irrigations gave a comparatively lower yield than 30 depletion from available soil water irrigations in conjunction with straw mulch therefore marginal yield increase with lesser water use was observed in green gram with use of straw mulch thereby saving one irrigation the bio physical water productivity and water use efficiency was also high under this treatment it is thus concluded to use straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 with 3 irrigations to attain a higher yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9861,a multilocation field experiment was conducted at students research farm department of agronomy punjab agricultural university pau ludhiana and pau regional research station rrs bathinda during summer 2019 the experiment was conducted in rcbd with 15 treatment combinations with 3 replications the treatments comprised of 3 mulch levels i e m0 m6 and m12 i e no mulch 6 and 12 t ha 1 respectively and 5 irrigation schedules i e i10 i20 i30 and i40 with 10 20 30 and 40 depletion of available soil water asw respectively and ir pau recommendation as 4 irrigations the growth parameters plant height dry matter accumulation and leaf area index yield attributing characters namely pods per plant number of seeds per pod and thousand grain weight seed and straw yield were significantly higher in m12 than m6 and no mulch m0 the growth parameters yield attributes seed and straw yield were significantly higher for i10 due to increased irrigation frequency 5 6 irrigations both m0i10 seven irrigations without mulch and m6i30 3 irrigations with straw mulch 6 t ha 1 treatments observed comparable seed yield 1 06 t ha 1 therefore the substantial increase in seed yield with lower crop water use with the usage of straw mulch saves a considerable amount of water subsequently the use of 6 t ha 1 of straw mulch with 3 irrigations 30 depletion from available soil water facilitated a higher seed yield the crop water use cwu was highest for m0 as due to bare soil resulted in more evapotranspiration the bio physical productivity bpwp and water use efficiency was found to be maximum

in i30 treatment at ludhiana and in i20 at bathinda location keywords green gram mulch levels irrigation regimes yield water productivity 1 introduction in the indian northern plains it is commonly observed that the field remains vacant till the onset of the monsoon so short duration crop which can fit in the crop sequence of rice wheat has immense importance thus the green gram bean vigna radiata l can be considered as the best candidate for the short window period after the harvest of the wheat the green gram being the short duration crop 60 days have a higher yield and attracts the farmers of punjab as well as of the whole indo gangetic plains the seeds of the green gram are highly nutritious containing 2 5 3 0 times higher protein content than cereals kumar et al 2016 green gram is resistant to drought and shade conditions as well as to low fertility the green gram crop can restore soil fertility by biological nitrogen fixation ram et al 2016 and so adds value in the rice wheat rotation usually there are two seasons for the sowing of green gram i e the summer season and the kharif season for which the yield of green gram bean is higher as compared to the kharif season crop the reason behind the lower yield of kharif season green gram is the concurrence with the monsoon and so higher infestation of diseases and insect pest attack whereas the short duration varieties of summer green gram bean are available yadav and singh 2014 the crop of green gram bean is sown in the summer season which is characterized by harsh temperature conditions and low relative humidity so the frequent application of irrigation is very essential for the growth and development of the crop singh 2005 irrigation is termed as a key driving facet that affects water and nutrient dynamics in the plant s root zone li et al 2020 so the major concern is the restoration of the fertile conditions of the soil with the rationalized use of water kaur 2014 if the irrigation is limited at critical stages of the crop it may drastically lower yields so excess or inadequate water may unswervingly affect crop growth so increasing water productivity is an imperative practice lesser amount of water perceptively for obtaining higher yields henceforth innovative irrigation practices help in enhancing water use efficiency thereby enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of the irrigation system levidow et al 2014 consequently agronomic intervention like mulching proves to be a practical solution for maintaining the optimum soil thermal and moisture regimes ranjan 1982 and ultimately higher crop yields sekhon et al 2020 after the harvest of the paddy straw farmers have paddy straw in abundance and usually being burnt in the field which pollutes the environment thus using paddy straw for mulch in various field crops as well as vegetables can unravel the menace further it is best organic mulch which in addition to the paddy straw mulch adds organic matter to the soil after its decomposition the mulch application helps in the blockage of the transportation of the vapors from the soil surface by acting as a barrier to the soil and altering the net radiation arriving at the soil surface it also helps in the suppression of the growth of the weeds moderating the soil surface temperature modifying the microclimatic conditions and helps in prevention of soil erosion kaur and bons 2017 bunna et al 2011 reported that paddy straw mulching helps in the tying up of soil nitrogen and the promotion of nitrogen in leguminous crops like green gram hence it is hypothesized that with the application of mulch a lesser number of irrigations are required by the crop keeping this in the view the present study was undertaken with the objective to investigate the effect of paddy straw mulching and irrigation regimes on the growth and productivity of green gram secondly to compute the water use and water productivity of green gram under various paddy straw mulch levels and irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out at students research farm department of agronomy punjab agricultural university pau ludhiana and pau regional research station rrs bathinda during summer 2019 these two stations were observed due to the varied weather conditions for studying irrigation and mulching effects the experimental site of ludhiana is situated at an altitude of 247 m above mean sea level with a latitudinal extent of 30 56 15 n and a longitudinal extent of 75 52 45 e the bathinda experimental station is situated at latitude 30 36 10 n and longitude 74 28 53 e with an altitude 211 m above mean sea level 2 2 weather and climate the subtropical semi arid type of climate is the key character of the ludhiana and bathinda region the four main climatological seasons of this region are winters december to february summers or pre monsoon lasting from march to may monsoon or rainy season lasting from june to september and post monsoon or autumn season october to november the sub tropical climate is responsible for the wide variation in the mean maximum temperature and it reaches a peak of 47 c in june month whereas the freezing temperatures associated with frosty spells are quite common during december and january the average annual rainfall of 500 750 mm is received in the ludhiana region and 440 mm for the bathinda region from which the maximum rainfall is contributed by the monsoon period the meteorological data recorded at the meteorological observatory of pau ludhiana and pau rrs bathinda during the crop growing season are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively the total rainfall received during the growing season of the crop for ludhiana and bathinda was 96 6 mm and 122 2 mm respectively and the total evaporation recorded was 553 4 mm and 940 mm for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the mean weekly maximum air temperature fluctuated between 31 3 and 39 3 c and the mean weekly minimum temperature varied between 18 1 and 22 3 c for ludhiana for the bathinda station the mean weekly maximum air temperature ranged between 34 9 and 44 8 c and the mean weekly minimum temperature ranged between 17 6 and 26 9 c the mean weekly relative humidity ranged between 30 2 and 57 1 and 34 9 71 9 for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the weekly sunshine hours ranged from 8 9 to 11 6 h and 6 0 10 5 h for ludhiana and bathinda respectively 2 3 soil of the experimental field the textural class of the soils of ludhiana and bathinda experimental station was loamy sand and sandy loam respectively the water content at field capacity 30 kpa and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa of 0 100 cm rhizosphere was 255 mm and 103 mm respectively for ludhiana the water content at field capacity 30 kpa and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa of 0 100 cm rhizosphere was 265 mm and 122 mm respectively for bathinda hence the available water in the 0 100 cm soil profile was 152 mm and 143 mm for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the average bulk density of the soil was 1 57 g cm 3 and 1 59 g cm 3 respectively for ludhiana and bathinda the physical properties of the experimental field are shown layer wise in table 1 for ludhiana and bathinda respectively the top 0 15 cm layer of the soil profile was neutral in ph 7 7 and 8 3 1 2 soil water ratio with 0 16 and 0

respectively 2 4 experimental treatments and methodology the experiment comprised fifteen combinations of treatments of mulch levels and irrigation schedules table 3 the three mulch levels were m0 no mulch application m6 6 t ha 1 and m12 12 t ha 1 whereas five irrigation schedules were i10 10 depletion from available soil water i20 20 depletion from available soil water i30 30 depletion from available soil water i40 40 depletion from available soil water and ir four irrigations of 75 mm depth the gross plot size of the experiment was 12 15 m2 and the net plot size was 7 88 m2 the paddy straw used in the experiment was taken from the farmer s field after the harvest of the crop it was not artificially treated and no alterations were made to the original length of the straw the breeders and research workers of pau ludhiana had worked vastly and been successful in releasing the high yielding and disease resistant green gram variety sml 832 suitable for irrigated conditions the pre sowing irrigation 75 mm was provided to the field just one day before the sowing of the crop the post sowing irrigations to the crop were provided as per the irrigation treatments at the experiment trial of ludhiana the depletion was noted from the 100 cm soil profile with the fdr frequency domain reflectometry tubes installed in the treatment plots on the day of sowing of the crop at the bathinda station the depletion level of the soil profile was calculated by the gravimetric method the details of the irrigation schedule during crop season at ludhiana and bathinda are given in table 4 the paddy straw was applied to the plots as per the mulch level treatments the samples of soil water were taken up to 100 cm soil profile at the sowing time of the crop as well as at the crop harvest to determine the contribution of the soil profile water at the initial days of the crop the soil water was measured up to 40 cm according to root depth but in the latter days soil water data from the 0 100 cm soil profile was recorded the summer green gram crop variety sml 832 was sown on 20 april 2019 at both locations the harvesting of crop at ludhiana was done on 1 july 2019 whereas on 2 july 2019 at the bathinda the sowing was done by the pora method making a total of nine lines in each plot and the space between the two lines was 22 5 cm with the plants being 7 cm apart the seed was treated with captan 30 g kg 1 of seed to prevent fungal infestation and diseases the nitrogen application was made at the recommended dose of 12 5 kg ha 1 by basal application of urea fertilizer at the time of sowing the phosphorus was applied by single super phosphate ssp application 40 kg ha 1 as a basal dose to control the pre emergence weeds the immediate application of pendimethalin stomp 30 ec 2 5 litres ha 1 anonymous 2020 the crop was damaged by the tobacco caterpillar and the spray of chlorpyriphos 20 ec 4 5 litres ha 1 anonymous 2020 was done with manual operated knapsack sprayer the crop was protected from the attack of sucking pests by the spray of triazophos 40 ec 1 5 litres ha 1 anonymous 2020 the height of the plant was recorded from the level of the ground and up to the junction of the petiole of leaf and stem of the last leaf which was fully opened the dry matter accumulation was recorded by removing five randomly selected plants then dried under the sun followed by an oven drying at a temperature range of 60 c until a constant weight of the plant sample is reached the three yield attributing characters i e number of pods per plant number of seeds per pod and thousand seed weight were recorded influencing the yield of green gram for the pod count per plant five random plants were selected and the total number of pods were counted on the five selected plants then the total pods on the five plants were counted and the average value was calculated for the number of pods per plant for the data on the number of seeds per pod five pods were randomly selected and the seeds were counted in total and then the average value was calculated and observed the number of seeds per pod for 1000 seed weight one thousand healthy seeds were counted weighed and the data was represented as 1000 seed weight the seed yield of every individual plot was recorded from a net plot area size of 7 88 m2 7 lines of 5 m length then the process of threshing and finally cleaning was carried out and values were expressed as t ha 1 2 5 soil water studies 2 5 1 crop water use soil water content was measured with time domain refractometry calibrated with the gravimetric method from 0 to 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 100 cm profile to compute soil water storage at pau ludhiana while at bathinda same was determined gravimetrically from 0 to 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 100 cm profile to compute soil water storage the crop season water use or consumptive use of water under the different treatments was worked out by the formula actual crop

change in soil profile water storage mm which is a difference between soil water content at planting and at harvesting dar et al 2017 runoff was absent as sufficient dikes were maintained deep drainage was considered zero when soil profile water storage was less than field capacity and when soil water storage exceeded the field capacity storage after irrigation or rainfall then deep drainage was calculated as the difference between the field capacity storage and soil water storage plus irrigation rainfall 2 5 2 the bio physical water productivity bpwp and water use efficiency wue

regimes on the various parameters of summer green gram and their interaction effects table 5 the data which was collected on the various investigation aspects were statistically analyzed as described by cochran and cox 1967 the analysis of variation was done by factorial rcbd randomized complete block design with sas software statistical package sas version 9 4 sas 2017 institute inc cary nc usa and the means were compared with fischer s least significant difference test at a 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 growth parameters the growth parameters such as the plant height dry matter and leaf area index lai significantly varied with the mulch levels and irrigation regimes table 6 the plant height was 6 96 and 4 92 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively for ludhiana however the increase was 21 75 and 0 78 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively for bathinda the dry matter accumulation was significantly higher for m6 and it was 18 56 and 8 19 higher than m0 and m12 respectively for ludhiana for bathinda the dry matter accumulation was 34 07 and 4 72 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively the lai was found to be 26 67 and 18 75 higher for m6 than m0 and m12 respectively for ludhiana however a similar trend was observed for bathinda nevertheless there was no difference in leaf area between 6 and 12 t ha 1 straw mulch levels among the irrigation schedules the i10 treatment recorded significantly higher plant height dry matter accumulation and lai at harvest for both locations the lowest plant height was observed under the i40 schedule the combination of paddy straw mulch and lesser irrigation intervals produced more plant height than the no mulch treatment with higher irrigation frequency table 7 the treatment m6i20 performed preeminent at the ludhiana location and m12i10 treatment at bathinda the lowest plant height was recorded in m0i40 40 depletion from available soil water and without mulch at both locations the treatments with more number irrigations 5 7 recorded the highest dry matter the addition of mulch along with frequent irrigations helped in the higher accumulation of dry matter in green gram the treatment m6i10 at ludhiana and m6i20 at the bathinda site viewed maximum values when compared nearly 25 and 28 higher dry matter accumulation was found in mulched plots in respect to i10 treatment in respect to lai maximum values were observed in i 10 and lowest in i40 level the positive interaction showed higher values under treatment m6i10 than the same depletion level i e 10 depletion from available soil water but without mulch m0i10 at both the locations the i40 treatment showed the lowest lai in all mulch treatments as only one irrigation was given in the whole crop period in m0 m6 and m12 treatments 3 2 yield attributes the various yield attributes like pods per plant seeds per pod and 1000 seed weight varied significantly with the mulch levels and irrigation regimes except the seeds per pod which did not differ statistically table 8 at the ludhiana a per cent decrease of m0 8 7 and m6 2 9 as compared to the m12 mulch level was found the m12 treatment reported a significantly higher pod number than m0 but there were no statistically significant differences in m12 and m6 treatments at both the locations the positive interactions between mulch levels and irrigation regimes table 9 imply that higher pods per plant can be obtained with the inclusion of mulch 6 t ha 1 therefore the maximum number of pods were found in the treatment m6i20 as under i20 the numbers of irrigations were four for both the locations but for i30 three irrigations at both ludhiana and bathinda were given to the crop thus statistically the equivalent number of pods per plant was obtained by saving one irrigation in treatment m6i10 seven irrigations both locations sans mulch provided a statistically similar pod count per plot than m12i30 treatment as a consequence the water was conserved by the mulch application and with a combination of irrigation resulting in a higher pod set per plant significantly higher 1000 seed weight was recorded in mulch treatments m6 and m12 than without mulch the per cent reduction was found to be 6 5 5 and 2 1 3 for m0 and m6 compared to m12 for ludhiana and bathinda respectively for ludhiana among the irrigation schedules no statistically significant differences between i10 and i20 treatment were present however i10 was significantly better than i30 i40 and ir treatments in terms of seeds per pod for both the locations no statistically significant differences between the irrigation regimes viz i10 i20 i30were observed as the number of seeds per pod plays a pivotal role in deciding the seed yield if these irrigation treatments do not differ significantly in respect to seed number per plot then the seed yield might be comparable in these treatments 3 3 seed yield the seed yield is the ultimate product of the yield attributing characters the data on the seed yield of green gram under the effect of various mulch levels and irrigation schedules are presented in table 10 for both ludhiana and bathinda the highest seed yield was observed in m12 mulch at 12 t ha 1 and significantly higher than m0 where no mulch was applied at both locations though statistically no significant difference was observed between m6 and m12 treatments the per cent increase in the seed yield of m12 was 15 7 and 16 1 than m0 2 8 and 3 6 than m6 treatment at both ludhiana and bathinda respectively the i10 treatment observing frequent irrigations 6 and 5 irrigations under all the mulch levels showed maximum seed yield at both the experimental sites while no statistically significant differences were found with i20 5 irrigations treatment the results indicate that the frequently irrigated treatments of i10 and i20 reported a higher seed yield as compared to treatments with wide intervals within the two irrigations however the irrigation treatment i30 did not differ statistically from i20 treatment the lowest seed yield under i40 was owing to very little irrigation during the whole crop growth period at ludhiana the m6i10 m6i20 and m6i30 reported 1 14 1 10 and 1 06 t ha 1 respectively and the treatments of m12i10 m12i20 and m12i30 reported 1 15 1 11 and 1 09 t ha 1 respectively a similar seed yield 1 06 t ha 1 was observed under m0i10 and m6i30 treatments under m0i10 seven irrigations were given without mulch and in m6i30 at both the locations only 3 irrigations were given in combination with straw mulch 6 t ha 1 3 4 soil water studies 3 4 1 crop water use the mulch level of m0 recorded maximum crop water use than the m6 and m12 for both the locations the crop water use was 7 70 and 3 61 more for m0 and m6 as compared to m12 mulch level table 11 for ludhiana and the corresponding values for bathinda were 7 07 and 4 24 for the irrigation levels the frequently irrigated i10 treatment has a maximum crop water use of 471 1 mm followed by i20 ir i30 and the least for the i40 with the lowest irrigation count for ludhiana and a similar trend was followed for bathinda the crop water use was 63 02 60 19 40 40 and 50 99 more for i10 i20 i30 and ir as compared to i40 and the corresponding values for bathinda are 59 25 56 39 39 08 and 46 74 the crop water productivity was found to be maximum for m12 than m0 and m6 for both ludhiana and bathinda table 11 the higher seed yield at m12 and m6 resulted in higher cwp than the m0 mulch level among the irrigation levels the maximum value of cwp was for i40 the highest value of cwp under i40 was as a result of giving only one irrigation 3 4 2 bio physical water productivity and water use efficiency the bio physical productivity bpwp was found to be maximum for m12 than m0 and m6 for locations table 11 but water use efficiency wue was highest in m6 at ludhiana and at bathinda location equivalent values were noticed under both mulch levels m6 and m12 the higher seed yield in m12 and m6 treatments resulted in higher awp than the m0 mulch level among the irrigation the maximum value of bpwp was for i40 treatment for ludhiana and bathinda both whereas wue was maximum in i30 treatment at ludhiana and in i20 at bathinda location 4 discussion the dwindling irrigation resources and underground saline water in india particularly in the southwest region of punjab enforce to ponder about water conservation and management the farmers are buoyant to amplify cropping intensity for higher returns so it is our accountability to take care of our natural resources the burning of paddy straw mulch after the harvest of the crop is widespread throughout rice growing states so the use of paddy straw mulch for water conservation is of ample significance moreover it is free of charge the use of paddy straw influenced growth parameters such as the plant height dry matter and leaf area index lai an adequate supply of water unswervingly augments the growth and dry matter production of crops in addition to obliquely increasing the availability and utilization of nutrients kaur and singh 2006 during the summer months the temperatures reach as high as 48 0 c in punjab as mulches create congenial environment the higher increase in plant height dry matter accumulation lai under mulch than no mulch was due to more water conservation and lesser evaporation from the soil surface further significantly the better height under frequent irrigations yadav and singh 2014 with the use of straw mulch may have resulted due to enhanced water economy mulching also improved dry matter accumulation and lai compared to unmulched plots irrespective of the amount level of mulch akhtar et al 2019 also reported higher biomass accumulation of soybean crops with the application of wheat straw mulch ram et al 2013 also reported higher lai in wheat with the application of straw mulch compared to no mulch treatment kar and kumar 2007 also revealed that maximum lai was 21 35 greater in the mulched plots than in the non mulched plots under different irrigation levels in potato crop and hence straw mulch had an impact on lai depending on the irrigation treatments the frequent levels of irrigation enhanced the photosynthetic activity of the crop and so more was the accumulation of dry matter under i10 than i20 i30 treatments but when the irrigation treatments which have a wider interval between the two irrigations or the irrigations were applied less frequently the crop suffered from the water stress at some period of the growth for this reason the lowest height biomass accumulation and 1000 grain weight was found in 40 depletion of available soil water i40 as merely one irrigation was given to the crop throughout the crop duration thus affecting the photosynthesis process of the crop and ultimately affecting the dry matter accumulation the possible reason for higher lai at i10 is that the frequency of irrigation was more 7 irrigations consequently to a great extent higher vegetative growth under this treatment to maintain the turgidity of the tissue of the leaf the elongation of tissues was observed at a higher amount of irrigation level similar results were reported by vasimalai and subramanian 1980 that the increased frequency of the irrigation resulted in increased lai of the crop ram et al 2013 also reported that increased absorption of water and nutrients from the soil due to increased water availability resulted in better growth of wheat leaves under well irrigated conditions further the application of 6 t ha 1 mulch m6 showed an enhanced effect in respect to dry matter accumulation and lai than a high amount of straw mulch 12 tonne ha 1 the decline was nearly 47 6 and 33 1 in respect to m12i10 and m12i20 than m6i10 and m6i20 treatments for the dry matter at ludhiana this might be for the reason that high quantity 12 t ha 1 of straw mulch particularly with high frequency irrigations and rainfall at the latter stage of the crop 84 mm developed an enormously sodden environment for plant maturity at ludhiana consequently lai was also as low as 73 7 and 75 7 in m12i10 and m12i20 than m6i10 and m6i20 treatments at ludhiana the various yield attributes like pods per plant seeds per pod and 1000 seed weight play an imperative role in deciding crop yields the use of mulch impinges their number akhtar et al 2019 also reported that soybean crop plants produced a significantly higher number of pods with bold seeds with use of wheat straw mulch 6 t ha 1 than the plants without mulch similarly an increase in irrigation levels from 10 to 30 depletion increased these attributes arya and sharma 1994 and tank et al 1992 also reported an increase in the number of pods per plant and 1000 seed weight with increased frequency of irrigations the possible reason might be that increased frequency of irrigation delayed the crop maturity and therefore more time was taken for the partitioning of the photosynthates and assimilates to the seeds vasimalai and subramanian 1980 further the equivalent number of pods per plant was obtained under a lesser amount of irrigation water in treatment m0i10 seven irrigations both locations without mulch provided a statistically similar pod count per plot than m6i30 treatment as a consequence the water was conserved by the mulch application and with a combination of irrigation resulting in a higher pod set per plant the combination of mulch and proper irrigation helps in maintaining soil water thus improving crop yields and water use efficiency zheng et al 2021 in our study mulched plots 6 t ha 1 resulted in a 12 5 and 14 yield increase respectively at ludhiana and bathinda than non mulched conditions irrespective of irrigation regimes the equivalent seed yield 1 06 t ha 1 was observed under m0i10 and m6i30 treatments at the ludhiana location while at bathinda the values were 1 09 t ha 1 m0i10 and 1 10 m6i30 under m0i10 seven irrigations were given without mulch and in m6i30 only 3 irrigations in combination with straw mulch 6 t ha 1 were given at both the locations furthermore recommended schedule m0ir using four irrigations gave a comparatively 2 05 lower yield than the m2i30 treatment therefore a trivial increase in yield with lesser water use was observed in green gram with the use of straw mulch thereby saving nearly 750 cubic meters of irrigation water in one hectare the use of 6 t rice straw mulch per hectare is recommended than 12 t ha 1 as if the purpose is met with a lesser quantity then there is no question in wastage moreover more quantities of mulch impede the growth of the crop the combination of mulch and proper irrigation helps in maintaining soil water thus improving crop yields and water use efficiency zheng et al 2021 consequently the use of straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 with 3 irrigations 30 depletion from available soil water helped in obtaining a higher seed yield there was a marginal enhancement in grain yield at bathinda though the total rainfall at ludhiana was 122 2 mm during crop season while at bathinda was 96 6 mm but the distribution of rainfall was uniform at bathinda having eleven rainfall events in standard meteorological weeks 16 27 also at the early and mid crop growth stage whereas ludhiana experienced a total of 8 rainfall events and that also mostly in the latter stage of the crop crop maturation the better soil water availability at bathinda would have aid in the nutrient retention ultimately resulting in increased yield the climatic variations at both locations resulted in varied physiological growth and yield parameters for that reason enhanced higher grain yield at the bathinda location the mulch application helps in soil water conservation and it might be the reason for higher crop water use by the no mulch treatment this showed that water contents were more with the addition of more straw input kar and kumar 2007 also reported higher crop water use by potato crop under the absence of mulch than straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 ram et al 2013 found that straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 decreased the water use from 2 1 to 2 9 cm compared with the no mulch treatment the crop water use was higher with increased frequency of irrigation water to the crop the number of irrigations in i10 and i20 treatments varied from 5 to 7 consequently the high frequency of irrigation in i10 and i20 increased the evapotranspiration losses and so the crop water use was maximum li et al 2020 also concluded in their study on maize crops that crop water productivity in terms of volume of supplied irrigation water decreased with the increased amount of water hence mulched plots resulted in higher water use efficiency than no mulched plots kar and kumar 2007 yan et al 2017 ram et al 2013 also reported 14 7 34 2 higher water use efficiency in straw mulch treatments 2 4 and 6 t ha 1 than no mulch treatment across different irrigation levels ram et al 2013 also informed decreased water use efficiency with the increasing irrigation level 5 conclusion application of rice straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 conserved water and resulted in a higher pod set per plant and higher seed yield the equivalent seed yield was observed under no mulch and 7 irrigations 10 depletion from available soil water and straw mulch along with only 3 irrigations 30 depletion from available soil water also recommended schedule four irrigations gave a comparatively lower yield than 30 depletion from available soil water irrigations in conjunction with straw mulch therefore marginal yield increase with lesser water use was observed in green gram with use of straw mulch thereby saving one irrigation the bio physical water productivity and water use efficiency was also high under this treatment it is thus concluded to use straw mulch at 6 t ha 1 with 3 irrigations to attain a higher yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9862,limited availability of water and nutrients in soil affects the yield and longevity of citrus plantation conservation of rainfall runoff not only enhances water availability but improves the nutritional status in soil which might increase the orchard efficiency in citrus keeping this in view a long term 7 years experiment was imposed to study the response of nagpur mandarin citrus reticulate blanco orchard in relation to fruit yield water use water productivity sustainability of production and energy use efficiency to various conservation practices cps on 12 land slope in a vertisol of central part of india the cps tested against without conservation practice wcp were continuous trenching ct and staggered trenching st alone and with grass mulch gm all the treatments were imposed in randomized block design rbd with 4 replications the combined use of ct and gm conserved the highest rainfall runoff 48 soil 51 organic carbon oc 52 and nutrients 43 53 compared with wcp in mandarin orchard the gm enhanced the available nutrients n p k and cu and oc contents in soil the relationship between rainfall and runoff was linear r2 0 85 0 93 in the plots with cps whereas in wcp plot it was exponential r2 0 88 however the runoff was linearly related to soil loss under both cps r2 0 76 0 91 and wcp r2 0 79 the empirical models developed were found reasonably accurate in predicting the runoff and soil loss with r2 value of 0 81 0 93 and 0 87 0 96 respectively the soil water content was improved by 3 55 in different cps compared with wcp the ct with gm improved the fruit yield by 53 utilizing 31 less water which resulted in 53 higher physical water productivity pwp and 123 higher irrigation water productivity iwp than that in wcp the fruit quality juice content total soluble solids acidity and ascorbic acid content under ct with gm was better than that in wcp the sustainability yield index syi and energy use efficiency eue under ct with gm were increased by 25 4 and 39 4 respectively compared with wcp overall these results reveal that the ct with gm could be imposed to sustain and enhance yield and water productivity by conserving rainwater and soil in citrus orchards of water scarce regions keywords runoff soil erosion mandarin orchard water use efficiency central india 1 introduction limited water availability and lower soil fertility are the major factors affecting yield and longevity of citrus orchards ghosh 2007 citrus cultivation is mainly confined to tropical climate of the world where precipitation is stochastic and seasonal the substantial overland flow of rainwater during monsoon and sub optimum moisture availability in soil during post monsoon is a common trend in citrus orchards in tropics the loss of rainwater soil and nutrients in overland flow not only affects the productivity and longevity of citrus orchards but also contaminates the surface water in the citrus belts he et al 2004 in this juncture conserving rainfall runoff along with soil in situ is indispensable for sustainable citriculture soil and water conservation in situ through mechanical measures bund trench terrace etc is advisable for the lands with slope up to 30 schwab et al 1993 for the lands with slope 2 12 construction of bunds is preferable contour bunds are useful in low rainfall areas annual rainfall 500 mm with permeable soil whereas in medium and high rainfall areas graded bunds are used bunding is not preferable in black soil or high clay content soil due to development of cracks through which flow of water takes place causing breaches of bunds suresh 1997 instead of bunds trenches are recommended for black soils even though trenches have been used on all slopes these are recommended for the lands with slope up to 20 trenches have been profitably used in both high rainfall and low rainfall regions with varying soil types and depths for soil and water conservation murty 1998 trenches may be continuous or interrupted the interrupted trenches may be constructed in series in line or in a staggered manner continuous trenches are essentially used to harvest the rainwater in situ and recharge the soil profile in low and medium rainfall areas the intermittent trenches or staggered trenches are adopted in high rainfall areas with lower cost of excavation than continuous trenches moreover construction of trenches is easier and cheaper than other conservation measures like bench terraces broad base terraces etc on slopes singh et al 2011 mulching is another technique to cover the land surface using both organic grass straws leaves etc and inorganic synthetic material polyethylene to conserve the soil water in situ in fields with less than 2 slope however conjunctive use of mulch and mechanical measure is advisable for efficient soil and water conservation in sloppy lands suresh 1997 commonly organic mulches are used during both wet and dry seasons to conserve water in crop fields whereas inorganic mulches conserve soil moisture in situ by reducing evaporation during dry season therefore harvesting the rainwater in situ using bund or trench along with organic mulch may improve soil water content swc in citrus orchards in water scarce areas in recent past some studies were carried out to quantify the runoff soil loss and nutrients loss from citrus plantations the study conducted by nishimura et al 2002 on quantification of n and p concentrations in the rainfall runoff of citrus orchards revealed that the runoff characteristic which is governed by rainfall pattern is the major factor influencing the concentrations of the nutrients in runoff he et al 2004 reported that the quantities of dissolved micronutrients in runoff varied from year to year due to the changes in their availability in soils of citrus fields zhang et al 2004 analysed the micronutrients no3 nh4 and p in runoff water of citrus orchards in florida usa and concluded that their concentrations changed with season and fertilization practices cerdà et al 2009 studied the loss of water and soil in young citrus plantation in mediterranean region using rainfall simulators and indicated that the soil loss and sediment concentration were 2 4 mg ha h and 10 4 g l respectively with recurrence interval of five years of rainfall wang et al 2010 evaluated the effect of inter crops bahia grass citron daylily peanut on soil erosion runoff and nutrient losses within a young citrus plantation and concluded that bahia grass conserved the highest soil and nutrients the study taken on overland flow and soil erosion under straw mulch in citrus plantation on 15 slope with sandy loam soil concluded that straw mulch could trap the runoff sediment and nutrients without bringing any affect on yield and quality of fruits of citrus trees liu et al 2012 tu et al 2018 studied the effect of different conservation measures grass strips strip intercropping level terrace and clean tillage in a 2 year old citrus plantation on 12 slop in a red soil in southern china and concluded that grass strips was the best protective measure and found economically and ecologically sound evaluation of different soil and water conservation treatments 1 no vegetation bare land bl 2 citrus without grass cover ck 3 citrus with strip planting of bermuda grass sp 4 citrus with full cover of bermuda grass fc concluded that the annual runoff volumes were significantly reduced under sp 27 2 mm and fc 33 0 mm compared with ck 311 4 mm and bl 456 7 mm treatments the sp and fc treatments significantly reduced the annual average sediment yield by 99 38 99 67 respectively compared with ck treatment mo et al 2019 duan et al 2020 studied the effects of different ground cover managements control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with grass cover and orchard with cover crops on hydrological and erosive process under extreme rainfall condition in citrus orchard and concluded that grass cover was found most efficient in conserving runoff 46 9 and soil erosion 66 8 compared with bare soil another study conducted on different conservation measures bermuda grass strip intercropping bermuda grass full coverage radish soybean crop rotation strip intercropping and clear tillage demonstrated that bermuda grass with full coverage yielded a significantly higher increase in bacterial population and diversity of fungi in soils compared with clean tillage in a citrus orchard of a humid subtropical climate of china wu et al 2021 nagpur mandarin citrus reticulata blanco one of the world famous citrus cultivar is commercially cultivated in 0 2 million hectare of central india the crop is grown in rolling lands 10 15 slope with high clay content 40 60 soil vertisols in rain fed agro climate of the region the intense rainfall with longer duration causes abundant overland flow and soil loss from citrus groves in clayey soil during monsoon season july october on the other hand the sub optimum availability of soil water content swc in rhizosphere in post monsoon season results in reduced yield and drying of young and bearing mandarin plantations causing a huge financial loss to the growers in the region ghosh 2007 srivastava et al 2010 the lower soil fertility of the orchards is another constraint for higher productivity of citrus in the area srivastava and singh 2009 in spite of all the constraints the coverage under the crop has an exponential growth owing to the climate suitability and higher profit of the cultivar in the region gangwar et al 1997 panigrahi et al 2012 the advent of micro irrigation has helped in increasing the area under citrus plantation on sloppy and undulating topography which are very susceptible to soil loss resulting in land degradation adoption of appropriate rainwater harvesting techniques could enhance the nutritional status and productivity of citrus orchards in water limited regions the organic material like grass has been reported as effective mulch to conserve soil moisture in situ in citrus plantation mohanty et al 2002 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 the nut grass is abundantly available in uplands and near the drainage channels in central india during monsoon season the water conservation through inter row bunds was not found suitable in cracking clayey soil due to damage of citrus plants by phytopthora disease caused by standing water behind the bunds huchche et al 1999 the water conservation by constructing trenches between the tree rows may be an alternative option in citrus orchards however the studies on the effects of rainwater conservation through trenches and grass mulch gm in citrus orchards in high clay content soil vertisol are limited furthermore the information on overland flow and sediment loss along with the nutrients and organic carbon oc could bring a better planning for land and water management strategies in both micro and macro scales in citrus belts prediction of runoff and soil erosion is very useful for planning design and management of different conservation measures which helps in preventing land and water degradation and livelihood improvement in an area suresh 1997 in recent years a lot of mathematical simulation models have been developed to forecast runoff and soil loss however due to complexity and huge data requirement for simulation these models are rarely preferred by planners for their use in watersheds moreover under data scarce conditions which are a common scenario in most developing countries the use of physical based models is highly restricted therefore in such conditions regression or empirical models serve as an alternative to physics based models due to their easy use and less data requirement to forecast runoff and soil loss mohanty et al 2010 such empirical models have not been developed for citrus orchards in the study region moreover energy which plays a pivotal rule in modern agriculture is going to be a crucial input in near future the energy use analysis becomes a necessary to optimize energy consumption and energy use efficiency to make agriculture sustainable namdari et al 2011 as a perennial crop citrus require substantial energy in land preparation and input use fertilizer water pesticides etc for its production adoption of soil and water conservation measures trenching mulching etc also requires some additional energy in crop fields jat et al 2005 the input output energy analysis and quantification of energy use efficiency is indispensable for energy efficient citrus production under different conservation measures keeping these in view the investigation was carried out to study the effects of trenches continuous staggered and grass mulch on fruit yield water use water productivity sustainability of production and energy use in citrus orchards on vertisol of a tropical climate in central part of india forecasting of overland flow with sediment yield and input output analysis of energy in citrus orchard in different treatments has also been done 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at icar central citrus research institute nagpur latitude 21º 08 45 n longitude 79º 02 15 e and 340 m above mean sea level india during 2004 2010 7 years the 13 year old nagpur mandarin plants with canopy diameter of 5 6 m spaced at 6 m x 6 m was used for the study an orchard with 320 mandarin plants in 1 152 ha was selected for the study the experimental soil was clayey with 31 sand 24 5 silt and 44 5 clay the ph of soil was 8 5 with basic infiltration rate of 3 7 mm h the volumetric water content of soil at 33 0 kpa field capacity and 1500 0 kpa permanent wilting point were 29 7 and 19 3 respectively the top 0 15 m soil had 196 4 mg kg

region the physical parameters texture infiltration rate field capacity permanent wilting point and chemical parameters nutrients and oc of soil were measured following standard procedures singh et al 2005 whereas land slope was determined by dumpy level survey in the orchard the climate of the experimental site is sub humid tropical the weather data during last 30 years of the experiment 1980 2010 collected near to the study site indicated that the daily air temperature varied from 13 8 ºc in month of december to 36 2 ºc in may sometimes air temperature goes up to 45 ºc in peak summer months may june the mean value of evaporation varied from 2 4 mm day in december to 12 8 mm day in may the mean annual rainfall recorded from non recording type of rain gauge at the site is 860 mm out of which 84 722 mm takes place in monsoon season july october the rainfall during post monsoon november february and pre monsoon march june periods are 43 mm 5 of total rainfall and 95 mm 11 of total rainfall respectively the distribution and analysis of annual rainfall and evaporation in different months during last 30 years 1980 2010 and experimental period 2004 2010 indicates that the monthly rainfall did not vary significantly among the years fig 1 the groundwater level near to the experiment site was at 18 20 m from land surface 2 2 treatments and layout the soil water conservation measures tested against without conservation practice wcp were i staggered trench st ii continuous trench ct iii st grass mulch gm and iv ct gm the randomized block design rbd with 4 replications was used for layout of the treatments the experimental plot 240 m x 48 m with 320 mandarin plants was split into 20 runoff plots 48 m x 12 m each runoff plot had 16 plants in 2 rows the runoff flow within the plots was restricted using polythene sheet in their surroundings the ct and st were trapezoidal in shape and their top width depth and bottom width were 0 6 m 0 30 m and 0 15 m respectively the sts with 1 m length each were spaced at 1 m distance following ziz zag manner the vertical interval for both ct and st was 720 mm the soil excavated in trenching was used to construct the bunds trapezoidal shape in downstream side each plant basin area was covered with gm 11 kg plant once in a year after monsoon season mohanty et al 2002 the used gm consisted of 14 8 g kg 1 oc 5 8 g kg 1 n 0 6 g kg 1 p 4 1 g kg 1 k 29 8 mg kg fe 4 0 mg kg cu 3 9 mg kg zn and 19 9 mg kg mn water was supplied to the citrus plants using micro irrigation at 50 soil moisture depletion in top 0 6 m soil profile irrigation quantity was worked out based on the formula volume of water applied m3 0 5 volumetric field capacity in percentage volumetric permanent wilting point in percentage mean canopy area of plants in m2 100 the plants in all treatment plots were uniformly fertilized with 260 kg ha n 185 kg ha p and 72 kg ha k srivastava and singh 1997 all the field management practices for the treatments were performed uniformly 2 3 measurement of variables the rainfall taken for analysis was measured in the rain gauge installed at the automatic weather station of the research farm overland flow runoff was quantified using multi slot divisor in each treatment plot the runoff quantity from one slot middle one out of 5 slots was collected in a 2 m3 capacity plastic tank at tail end of the plots after each rainfall the runoff in the tanks was quantified and properly stirred two samples each 1 litre of the stirred runoff were collected from each replicated plot out of the two runoff samples one was dried at 110 ºc the dried sediment was collected and called as sample soil loss the soil loss after each erosive rainfall event was calculated by multiplying the sample soil loss with total runoff collected in the treatment in another runoff sample sediment was collected by filtering the runoff through whatman no 1 filter paper 1 2 µm pore size the air dried soil samples were analyzed for available macro nutrients n p and k available micro nutrients fe cu zn and mn and oc singh et al 2005 the loss of total nutrients and oc under different treatments was estimated by multiplying the concentration of respective nutrients and oc with the total eroded soil the soil samples collected from top 0 15 m soil in month of november were analyzed to determine the changes in oc and nutrients contents in it the swc in treatment plots was measured fortnightly by neutron probe troxler usa and mean monthly swc in top 1 0 m soil under different treatments was calculated the yield kg ha in different treatments was estimated by multiplying the total fruit weight kg per plant with number of plants per hectare 278 five mandarin fruits were sampled from each treatment for analysis of juice percentage total soluble solids tss titrable acidity ta and ascorbic acid aa content ranganna 2001 the physical water productivity pwp and irrigation water productivity iwp under different treatments were estimated as the ratios of yield to rainwater quantity and yield to irrigation water quantity respectively sustainable yield index syi is an indicator of sustaining the productivity of a crop over the years in field condition the value of syi of a crop varies from 0 to 1 bhindhu and gaikward 1998 the higher the value of syi better the chance of sustaining the productive life of the orchard the syi under different treatments was estimated based on the formula singh et al 1990 syi ymean sd ymax where ymean is the mean yield under a given treatment sd is the standard deviation of yield for that treatment across the years and ymax is the maximum yield under that treatment in any year energy input ei energy output eo net energy gain neg and energy use efficiency eue in various treatments in nagpur mandarin orchard were worked out following the procedure recommended by singh and mittal 1992 and namdari et al 2011 the ei was estimated as the summation of energy equivalent of different inputs used whereas eo was estimated as the energy equivalent from fruit yield in different treatments in mandarin orchard the neg and eue were calculated as the difference between eo and ei and ratio of eo to ei respectively the data collected were statically analyzed for dmrt duncan s multiple range test using separation of means dean and voss 1999 the relations of runoff with rainfall and soil erosion were determined using microsoft office 2010 the performance of the developed empirical models to predict runoff and soil erosion under different treatments was evaluated using different

the values of e 0 36 van liew et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall runoff and soil erosion the seasonal runoff and soil erosion under various treatments are given in table 1 among the treatments both staggered trench st and continuous trench ct with grass mulch gm did not result any runoff and soil erosion during winter reflecting 100 rainwater conserving efficiency under gm in citrus orchard in this season the higher infiltration rate of soil 4 9 mm h resulted in higher rainwater conservation efficiency under gm compared with other treatments in winter in pre monsoon period runoff was nil even in without conservation practice wcp treatment indicating the less utility of the conservation practices in mandarin orchard in this period the occurrence of rainfall with intensity less than the infiltration rate of soil was the reason for no runoff and nil soil erosion during pre monsoon during monsoon the highest runoff 58 68 and soil erosion 7 75 t ha were observed in wcp whereas the lowest runoff 31 26 and soil erosion 3 95 t ha were observed in ct gm the lowest runoff and soil erosion was due to maximum conservation of overland flow in ct gm in monsoon season moreover dissipation of kinetic energy of raindrops by mulch and decrease in flow velocity and quantity of surface runoff due to gm and ct reduced the detachment splash erosion and transport of soil particles sheet and rill erosion resulting in lower soil erosion in ct gm than wcp in post monsoon period the runoff and soil erosion were in similar trend of winter under conservation practices among different seasons the monsoon was found most vulnerable to runoff generation 96 92 97 69 of annual runoff and soil erosion 95 67 97 96 of annual soil erosion followed by post monsoon runoff 1 26 1 72 of annual runoff soil erosion 1 35 1 72 of annual soil loss in mandarin orchards of the region the higher amount of rainfall per day 5 8 156 6 mm and higher frequency less duration between two rainfall events 1 7 days produced the higher runoff and soil erosion during monsoon than other seasons rainfall per day 1 2 12 9 mm frequency of rainfall 22 93 days earlier study also reported that the runoff and soil erosion under extreme rainfall condition were 2 8 times and 11 1 times higher respectively than that under normal rainfall condition in citrus orchard under a humid subtropical climate of china duan et al 2020 the gm was found equally effective in conserving rainwater 100 in situ under both ct and st during each season except monsoon in high clay content soil in the citrus orchard overall the conservation practices could trap 20 42 100 overland flow and 25 54 100 sediment loss compared with wcp in the orchard during different seasons of a year the higher trapping efficiency 100 for runoff and soil erosion was observed in winter and post monsoon seasons in st gm and ct gm due to lower runoff and sediment yield caused by low rainfall amounts during these seasons compared with monsoon season these results indicate that grass mulch controlled both runoff and soil erosion in different seasons of the year in citrus orchard on a vertisol the annual mean runoff and soil erosion under wcp was 54 97 of annual rainfall and 8 10 t ha respectively table 1 in past study it was reported that the runoff was 23 of rainfall with soil erosion of 10 7 t ha in citrus plantation in sandy loam soil on 15 land slope liu et al 2012 the study conducted in 1 3 year old citrus grove with 15 32 land gradient concluded that runoff was 75 of total rainfall whereas soil erosion was 30 t ha year in the orchard wang et al 2010 in another study conducted in 1 3 year old citrus plantation on 8 14 land gradient indicated that rainfall runoff and soil erosion were 33 of rainfall and 2 4 mg ha h respectively cerdà et al 2009 tu et al 2018 observed 37 42 runoff and 259 29 t km2 soil erosion under clean tillage in a 2 year old citrus plantation on 12 slope in a red soil in southern china in another study it was reported that runoff and soil loss were 23 9 of rainfall and 28 2 t ha respectively in citrus orchard on 12 slope under a subtropical humid climate of china mo et al 2019 duan et al 2020 observed 12 runoff and 11 4 mg ha 1 soil loss annually in citrus orchard under subtropical climate the differences in magnitude of runoff and soil erosion occurred between various studies and this study was attributed to the changes in land factors soil slope and plot size metrological parameters rainfall quantity and pattern evaporation etc and crop factors age canopy pattern of citrus orchards taken under the experiments the ct reduced the annual runoff and soil erosion by 35 10 and 40 24 respectively compared with wcp the reduction in runoff quantity was attributed to conservation of rainwater in trenches whereas the reduction in soil erosion was due to decreases in runoff velocity caused by breaking of land slope into several short ones coupled with reduced quantity of runoff in ct compared with wcp the gm trapped the soil and runoff up to 20 higher than that in non mulched treatments earlier it was also reported that straw mulch could conserve the rainwater 26 and soil 20 compared with wcp in citrus liu et al 2012 higher infiltration rate 4 9 mm h and reduced surface sealing of soil caused by higher organic matter produced due to decomposition of grass mulch resulted in lower runoff and soil erosion under mulching compared with non mulched treatments infiltration rate 3 8 4 1 mm h moreover the higher time of concentration time of retention due to decrease in velocity of surface runoff under higher resistance of gm to flow probably allowed more runoff water to be absorbed in the soil profile and resulted in lower runoff and soil loss under mulched condition schwab et al 1993 adekalu et al 2007 lowering splash erosion due to de energizing the rain drops is another reason for reduced soil erosion under mulching singh et al 2011 overall ct with gm was observed to be the best rainwater 48 3 and soil conservation 51 2 measure followed by st with gm rainwater conservation 34 8 soil conservation 41 8 in citrus orchard the rainfall runoff relation under conservation practices was linear r2 0 85 0 93 whereas exponential relation r2 0 88 was observed under wcp during 2004 2008 fig 2 these relationships indicated that the higher amount of runoff was generated under wcp than conservation practices for any change in rainfall amount further the lower slopes 0 265 0 329 and intercepts 0 706 1 311 obtained from rainfall runoff relationships in mulched treatments compared to those slopes 0 382 0 488 intercepts 1 885 2 712 in non mulched treatments indicated the lower rate of change in runoff with respect to rainfall under mulch compared with non mulched condition in wcp plot the higher slope 1 076 of rainfall runoff relationship for the rainfall more than 50 mm day compared to slope 0 555 for the rainfall less than 50 mm day reflected the higher rate of change in runoff with respect to rainfall under higher rainfall amount than that under lower rainfall amount however the soil erosion made a linear relations with runoff amount under both wcp r2 0 79 and conservation practices r2 0 76 0 91 fig 3 earlier studies also indicated that rainfall made an exponential relation with runoff with r2 value of 0 84 0 88 liu et al 2012 and runoff made a linear relation with r2 value of 0 82 0 91 with soil erosion cerdà et al 2009 in citrus orchards the higher slopes 0 019 0 022 and intercepts 0 044 0 16 obtained from runoff soil loss relationships in mulched treatments than those in non mulched ones slopes 0 018 intercepts 0 018 0 076 indicated the higher rate of change in soil loss with respect to runoff in mulched plots than that in non mulched plots moreover the rainfall runoff and runoff soil erosion relationships predicted reasonably the runoff 0 82 0 93 nrmse 0 16 0 41 e 0 81 0 94 d 0 61 0 89 sc g e and soil erosion 0 87 0 96 nrmse 0 11 0 28 e 0 86 0 98 d 0 82 0 93 sc g e quantities in different treatments during 2009 and 2010 table 2 the higher r2 with lower nrmse higher e and higher d of the soil erosion models than runoff models indicate the higher efficacy of prediction of the former models than the latter ones these relationships may be useful to design and adopt various conservation strategies in citrus groves of the study areas or elsewhere with similar pedo hydrology of the study site the slope of the relationships between the observed runoff and predicted runoff in wcp treatment 1 01 1 03 was highest followed by non mulched treatments 0 90 1 02 and mulched treatments 0 77 0 89 indicating the higher rate of change in predicted values with respect to observed values of runoff in wcp followed by non mulched treatments and mulched treatments fig 4 the relationships between observed soil loss and predicted soil loss followed the similar trend of runoff in different treatments fig 5 3 2 nutrient loss the transport of organic carbon oc and nutrients n p k fe cu zn and mn from the treatment plots followed the same trend of eroded soil table 3 among the macronutrients n p and k the quantity of p lossed through eroded soil was lowest due to its lower availability 24 9 mg kg soil than other nutrients n 196 4 mg kg soil k 296 77 mg kg soil in top soil of the experimental plot moreover the higher fixation of p with clay minerals might be a reason for slow availability of p in eroded soil compared with other nutrients irrespective of the nutrients their concentrations in the sediment were 1 2 3 1 times higher than that in top 0 15 m soil the highest concentration was observed with n 3 1 and the lowest concentration was observed with micronutrients 1 3 1 7 the lower solubility and mobility along with higher fixation with soil resulted in lower concentration of micronutrients compared with other nutrients in the sediment bhanavase et al 2007 the eroded soil in mulched treatments had higher oc and nutrients than the treatments without mulch indicating higher soil fertility under mulching the higher oc and available nutrients in soil produced due to decomposition of grass mulch and optimum soil water regime might be a reason for higher oc and nutrient content in eroded soil in the mulched plots lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 the higher loss of nutrients and oc was also reported earlier under mulching dass et al 2006 3 3 soil organic carbon and available nutrients the change in oc and available nutrients n p k fe cu zn and mn in the soil varied significantly in the treatments table 4 the oc in soil in non mulched treatments was reduced by 12 19 whereas mulching enhanced the oc by 12 16 compared with initial oc under ct and st the enhancement of oc in soil was attributed to decomposition of mulch and decrease in oc loss in sediment from mulched plots the macronutrients n p and k contents in the soil increased due to fertilizer application to the plants in all treatments the maximum increase in macronutrients in soil was in ct gm nutrients released from the decomposed mulch in conjunction with reduced runoff probably caused higher nutrients in soil under ct gm than wcp moreover the optimum temperature regime and moisture content in soil profile probably encouraged higher population of microbes which transformed the nutrients to available forms resulting in higher availability of nutrients in soil under mulching lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 wang et al 2010 earlier higher soil available nutrient was also observed under organic mulch in citrus orchard mohanty et al 2002 the enhancement of nutrients in soil suggests for development of suitable fertilizer application schedule to save fertilizers under conservation practices in citrus all the micronutrients contents except cu decreased in soil the high ph 8 5 of the soil and loss of nutrients in runoff coupled with uptake of nutrients by plants probably reduced the availability of micronutrients in the mandarin orchard panigrahi and srivastava 2016 the reduction in available micronutrients was lowest in ct gm the conservation of runoff and soil along with the nutrients available from decomposed gm resulted in higher availability of micronutrients in soil under ct gm and st gm than other treatments the improvement of cu in soil in all the treatment plots might be due to the use of fungicide containing cu in controlling phytophthora disease in citrus however the application of micronutrients based fertilizers in appropriate quantity in soil is suggested for citrus cultivation in the region 3 4 soil water content and irrigation supply the average soil water content swc in study years in different treatments during january december indicated that conservation practices produced significantly higher soil water than that in wcp fig 6 during june september the highest increase in swc 12 55 was recorded due to higher rainfall 711 mm and higher conservation of rainwater in this period than other periods the highest available swc was observed under ct gm due to conservation of maximum runoff in this treatment the available swc in different treatments was reduced during october december due to insufficient rainfall to compensate the evapo transpiration et of mandarin plants in this period however the reduction in available swc during october december was progressively decreased reflecting the lower et of the mandarin plants during december compared with that during october in earlier studies panigrahi et al 2010 and reddy et al 2013 also reported the lowest et of nagpur mandarin plants in december the available swc during january may was marginally higher 3 15 under conservation practices than wcp the supplemental drip irrigation provided to citrus plants helped in maintaining the optimum soil water regime and lowering the gaps in it among different conservation treatments during january may the available swc under gm was around 20 higher than that in without mulching the higher available swc was resulted by higher infiltration of runoff water in conjunction with less evaporation from soil under mulching compared with without mulching adekalu et al 2007 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 earlier research indicated that the soil water content was increased by 12 20 in citrus orchards due to the fact that mulch prevents surface sealing by preventing the direct impact of rain drops on the soil surface and encourages biological activities which leads to the development of macropores in the soil the macropores help in trapping higher quantity of rainwater due to increased infiltration rate under mulch kumar et al 2015 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 the irrigation quantity progressively increased during january may owing to rising in water requirement of mandarin plants from january to may table 5 the highest water requirement of the plants in may was evident from the increased evaporation rate in this month at the study site fig 1 earlier studies also reported the highest and lowest water requirement of nagpur mandarin plants in december january 23 litres plant 1 day 1 and may 55 litres plant 1 day 1 respectively in central india panigrahi et al 2010 reddy et al 2013 the irrigation requirements under ct gm and st gm were reduced by 31 and 24 respectively compared with wcp the reduction in water application attributed to higher storage of rainwater and less evaporation under mulching in ct and st the water applied was marginally 7 lower under ct than st moreover mulching alone reduced the water use by 20 22 compared with without mulching in the plots previous studies also reported 12 15 water saving in eureka lemon kumar et al 2015 and 15 20 in acid lime lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 under grass mulch compared with non mulched treatment overall the results indicate that grass mulch was found very effective in reducing irrigation water use by conserving in situ soil water in citrus orchard 3 5 yield fruit quality and water productivity the yield parameters number and weight of fruit total yield water productivity and internal quality of fruits juice total soluble solid acidity and ascorbic acid in different conservation practices and without conservation practice wcp are given in table 6 the number of fruits per plant under conservation practices was increased up to 37 compared with that in wcp the lower number of fruits dropped 104 272 under conservation practices than wcp 305 resulted in higher number of fruits in the former treatments in earlier studies higher fruit drop 23 31 under sub optimum soil water regime was also observed in citrus orchard panigrahi and srivastava 2011 mohanty et al 2002 previous research stated that the fruit drop which generally occurs due to physiological disorder could be reduced by improving physiological metabolic activity of the citrus plants under optimum soil water content and available nutrients as observed in ct gm huchche et al 1999 ghosh 2007 the number of fruit harvested was highest in ct gm moreover the fruit drop was reduced by 26 55 under grass mulch gm indicating the positive effect of mulch on on tree storage of fruits in citrus the fruit weight was higher in conservation practices than wcp the fruits harvested in st gm were heavier than that in ct gm the higher fruit weight in st gm might be due to lower number of fruits in this treatment than ct gm moreover gm produced the fruits with higher weight than non mulched treatments earlier studies also recorded heavier fruits under mulching than non mulched treatments and stated that the higher photosynthesis rate under increased soil moisture and available nutrients probably resulted in higher fruit weight of mulched plants than non mulched one mohanty et al 2002 kumar et al 2015 the total fruit production of mandarin plants was highest in ct gm the highest yield was attributed to higher number of fruits probably caused by higher photosynthesis rate of leaves under optimum soil water content and available nutrients in ct gm than other treatments panigrahi et al 2010 kumar et al 2015 the enhancement of fruit yield was 3 17 in non mulched treatments compared with wcp the fruit yield under ct was 14 higher than that under st the higher fruit yield was attributed to higher soil water content which resulted in lower fruit drop and higher fruit weight in ct compared with st further mulching produced 26 36 higher fruit yield than without mulched treatments the higher fruit yield was attributed to higher metabolic activities and formation of higher quantity of photosynthates by citrus plants under optimum soil water regime caused by higher rainwater conservation higher infiltration lower runoff and lower evaporation in mulched plots increased available nutrients under higher microbe bacteria fungi population in soil probably another reason for higher yield in mulched treatments compared with non mulched treatments mohanty et al 2002 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 earlier lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 and lal et al 2003 also reported 15 25 higher yield under gm compared with without mulch in citrus however experiment conducted by liu et al 2012 indicated that mulching had no significant effect on fruit yield in citrus the differential effect of mulching was attributed to changes in status of soil water content and nutrients crop variety land type and environments prevailed in citrus orchards under the experiments rodríguez gamir et al 2010 the yield in ct gm was 53 higher than that in wcp the production of higher yield using less water 31 resulted in higher physical water productivity pwp 53 and irrigation water productivity iwp 123 in ct gm than wcp the ct gm produced the highest pwp and iwp which were 9 53 and 20 123 higher than that in other treatments respectively the higher increase in fruit yield with reduced water use attributed to higher water productivity in ct gm than other treatments the lowest water productivity was observed in wcp the increase in iwp was higher than pwp under mulching indicating the higher effectiveness of gm on irrigation water application than rainwater conserving in mandarin orchard previous research also reported that water productivity could be enhanced by 65 78 due to mulching in citrus mohanty et al 2002 kumar et al 2015 the fruit qualities juice total soluble solids ascorbic acid were better under conservation practices than wcp the percentage of juice was highest in ct gm the higher juice content might be due to higher uptake of water under increased soil water content in ct gm than other treatments however the total soluble solid tss of fruits was lower in ct gm than st gm the dilution of sugars due to higher juice content might result in lower tss in the fruits under ct gm the fruits harvested under conservation practices were having lower acidity than that in wcp the st gm produced the fruits with lowest acidity among the treatments the increased rate of transformation of acids to sugars which helps in producing optimum osmotic turgidity in fruits under medium plant water stress condition probably caused the higher tss and lower acidity in st gm than ct gm huang et al 2000 earlier pérez pérez et al 2008 and navarro et al 2010 also observed the higher tss and lower acidity of citrus fruits of the plants under mild water deficit the ascorbic acid content was higher in the fruits under conservation practices compared with wcp moreover the ascorbic acid was higher in the fruits under mulched treatments ct gm st gm than other treatments past study by liu et al 2012 also recoded higher ascorbic acid content in the citrus fruits under mulching however concentration of ascorbic acid in the juice under both ct and st was statically at par 3 6 sustainability of production and energy analysis the sustainable yield index syi was the highest in ct gm followed by st gm table 7 the lowest syi was observed in without conservation practice wcp moreover the syi under mulched treatments was higher than that under non mulched treatments indicating the higher efficacy of gm on maintaining the sustainability of citrus production in vertisol the higher availability of organic carbon nutrients and soil water content might caused higher sustainability of production in citrus under grass mulch earlier studies also reported the higher syi under organic mulch in different fruit crops guava mango papaya and stated that the increased organic matter higher soil porosity and optimum soil temperature resulted in higher loads of beneficial microbes and earthworms in soil which helped in improving soil health and sustainability in crop production patil et al 2013 the energy analysis in the citrus orchard indicates that the highest energy input ei was in ct gm followed by st gm table 7 the lowest ei was in wcp the higher ei was attributed to the additional energy use 2402 mj ha in making trenches and doing mulching in ct gm even st used less energy than that in ct under both mulched and non mulched condition due to higher energy use in making ct than st the energy output eo followed the similar trend of fruit yield under different treatments the net energy gain neg was highest in ct gm followed by st gm the neg was lowest in st due to comparatively lower gain in yield 0 34 t ha resulting in lower increase in energy output 666 mj ha with higher increase in energy input 704 mj ha due to additional energy requirement in construction of trenches in this treatment compared with wcp the energy use efficiency eue followed the same trend of neg under different treatments previous study reported the higher eue under in situ moisture conservation measures in maize jat et al 2005 however the eues in st and wcp were statistically at par 4 conclusions all the conservation practices were found effective in trapping runoff and sediment which resulted in significant enhancement in available water and soil fertility in nagpur mandarin orchards the higher soil water content and available nutrients helped in boosting the productivity of the citrus plants the improved yield with reduced irrigation water quantity resulted in higher water productivity under conservation practices compared with without conservation practice among the conservation practices continuous trenching coupled with grass mulch was found most suitable to conserve rainwater and soil resulting in higher sustainable yield and energy use efficiency compared with without conservation practice in the citrus orchard the rainfall runoff and runoff soil erosion relationships developed under the study may be useful in integrated watershed development program in citrus belts of central india or in the regions with similar pedo hydrological condition of the study site overall it can be concluded that continuous trenching with grass mulch is a potential conservation option for mandarin orchards of water scarce central india it s adoption will bring a sizable increase in crop productivity with substantial water saving in citrus cultivation the enhancement in macronutrients along with reduction in micronutrients in soil recommend for further studies on fertilizer management under conservation measures

reported in this paper 
9862,limited availability of water and nutrients in soil affects the yield and longevity of citrus plantation conservation of rainfall runoff not only enhances water availability but improves the nutritional status in soil which might increase the orchard efficiency in citrus keeping this in view a long term 7 years experiment was imposed to study the response of nagpur mandarin citrus reticulate blanco orchard in relation to fruit yield water use water productivity sustainability of production and energy use efficiency to various conservation practices cps on 12 land slope in a vertisol of central part of india the cps tested against without conservation practice wcp were continuous trenching ct and staggered trenching st alone and with grass mulch gm all the treatments were imposed in randomized block design rbd with 4 replications the combined use of ct and gm conserved the highest rainfall runoff 48 soil 51 organic carbon oc 52 and nutrients 43 53 compared with wcp in mandarin orchard the gm enhanced the available nutrients n p k and cu and oc contents in soil the relationship between rainfall and runoff was linear r2 0 85 0 93 in the plots with cps whereas in wcp plot it was exponential r2 0 88 however the runoff was linearly related to soil loss under both cps r2 0 76 0 91 and wcp r2 0 79 the empirical models developed were found reasonably accurate in predicting the runoff and soil loss with r2 value of 0 81 0 93 and 0 87 0 96 respectively the soil water content was improved by 3 55 in different cps compared with wcp the ct with gm improved the fruit yield by 53 utilizing 31 less water which resulted in 53 higher physical water productivity pwp and 123 higher irrigation water productivity iwp than that in wcp the fruit quality juice content total soluble solids acidity and ascorbic acid content under ct with gm was better than that in wcp the sustainability yield index syi and energy use efficiency eue under ct with gm were increased by 25 4 and 39 4 respectively compared with wcp overall these results reveal that the ct with gm could be imposed to sustain and enhance yield and water productivity by conserving rainwater and soil in citrus orchards of water scarce regions keywords runoff soil erosion mandarin orchard water use efficiency central india 1 introduction limited water availability and lower soil fertility are the major factors affecting yield and longevity of citrus orchards ghosh 2007 citrus cultivation is mainly confined to tropical climate of the world where precipitation is stochastic and seasonal the substantial overland flow of rainwater during monsoon and sub optimum moisture availability in soil during post monsoon is a common trend in citrus orchards in tropics the loss of rainwater soil and nutrients in overland flow not only affects the productivity and longevity of citrus orchards but also contaminates the surface water in the citrus belts he et al 2004 in this juncture conserving rainfall runoff along with soil in situ is indispensable for sustainable citriculture soil and water conservation in situ through mechanical measures bund trench terrace etc is advisable for the lands with slope up to 30 schwab et al 1993 for the lands with slope 2 12 construction of bunds is preferable contour bunds are useful in low rainfall areas annual rainfall 500 mm with permeable soil whereas in medium and high rainfall areas graded bunds are used bunding is not preferable in black soil or high clay content soil due to development of cracks through which flow of water takes place causing breaches of bunds suresh 1997 instead of bunds trenches are recommended for black soils even though trenches have been used on all slopes these are recommended for the lands with slope up to 20 trenches have been profitably used in both high rainfall and low rainfall regions with varying soil types and depths for soil and water conservation murty 1998 trenches may be continuous or interrupted the interrupted trenches may be constructed in series in line or in a staggered manner continuous trenches are essentially used to harvest the rainwater in situ and recharge the soil profile in low and medium rainfall areas the intermittent trenches or staggered trenches are adopted in high rainfall areas with lower cost of excavation than continuous trenches moreover construction of trenches is easier and cheaper than other conservation measures like bench terraces broad base terraces etc on slopes singh et al 2011 mulching is another technique to cover the land surface using both organic grass straws leaves etc and inorganic synthetic material polyethylene to conserve the soil water in situ in fields with less than 2 slope however conjunctive use of mulch and mechanical measure is advisable for efficient soil and water conservation in sloppy lands suresh 1997 commonly organic mulches are used during both wet and dry seasons to conserve water in crop fields whereas inorganic mulches conserve soil moisture in situ by reducing evaporation during dry season therefore harvesting the rainwater in situ using bund or trench along with organic mulch may improve soil water content swc in citrus orchards in water scarce areas in recent past some studies were carried out to quantify the runoff soil loss and nutrients loss from citrus plantations the study conducted by nishimura et al 2002 on quantification of n and p concentrations in the rainfall runoff of citrus orchards revealed that the runoff characteristic which is governed by rainfall pattern is the major factor influencing the concentrations of the nutrients in runoff he et al 2004 reported that the quantities of dissolved micronutrients in runoff varied from year to year due to the changes in their availability in soils of citrus fields zhang et al 2004 analysed the micronutrients no3 nh4 and p in runoff water of citrus orchards in florida usa and concluded that their concentrations changed with season and fertilization practices cerdà et al 2009 studied the loss of water and soil in young citrus plantation in mediterranean region using rainfall simulators and indicated that the soil loss and sediment concentration were 2 4 mg ha h and 10 4 g l respectively with recurrence interval of five years of rainfall wang et al 2010 evaluated the effect of inter crops bahia grass citron daylily peanut on soil erosion runoff and nutrient losses within a young citrus plantation and concluded that bahia grass conserved the highest soil and nutrients the study taken on overland flow and soil erosion under straw mulch in citrus plantation on 15 slope with sandy loam soil concluded that straw mulch could trap the runoff sediment and nutrients without bringing any affect on yield and quality of fruits of citrus trees liu et al 2012 tu et al 2018 studied the effect of different conservation measures grass strips strip intercropping level terrace and clean tillage in a 2 year old citrus plantation on 12 slop in a red soil in southern china and concluded that grass strips was the best protective measure and found economically and ecologically sound evaluation of different soil and water conservation treatments 1 no vegetation bare land bl 2 citrus without grass cover ck 3 citrus with strip planting of bermuda grass sp 4 citrus with full cover of bermuda grass fc concluded that the annual runoff volumes were significantly reduced under sp 27 2 mm and fc 33 0 mm compared with ck 311 4 mm and bl 456 7 mm treatments the sp and fc treatments significantly reduced the annual average sediment yield by 99 38 99 67 respectively compared with ck treatment mo et al 2019 duan et al 2020 studied the effects of different ground cover managements control bare land orchard with no cover orchard with grass cover and orchard with cover crops on hydrological and erosive process under extreme rainfall condition in citrus orchard and concluded that grass cover was found most efficient in conserving runoff 46 9 and soil erosion 66 8 compared with bare soil another study conducted on different conservation measures bermuda grass strip intercropping bermuda grass full coverage radish soybean crop rotation strip intercropping and clear tillage demonstrated that bermuda grass with full coverage yielded a significantly higher increase in bacterial population and diversity of fungi in soils compared with clean tillage in a citrus orchard of a humid subtropical climate of china wu et al 2021 nagpur mandarin citrus reticulata blanco one of the world famous citrus cultivar is commercially cultivated in 0 2 million hectare of central india the crop is grown in rolling lands 10 15 slope with high clay content 40 60 soil vertisols in rain fed agro climate of the region the intense rainfall with longer duration causes abundant overland flow and soil loss from citrus groves in clayey soil during monsoon season july october on the other hand the sub optimum availability of soil water content swc in rhizosphere in post monsoon season results in reduced yield and drying of young and bearing mandarin plantations causing a huge financial loss to the growers in the region ghosh 2007 srivastava et al 2010 the lower soil fertility of the orchards is another constraint for higher productivity of citrus in the area srivastava and singh 2009 in spite of all the constraints the coverage under the crop has an exponential growth owing to the climate suitability and higher profit of the cultivar in the region gangwar et al 1997 panigrahi et al 2012 the advent of micro irrigation has helped in increasing the area under citrus plantation on sloppy and undulating topography which are very susceptible to soil loss resulting in land degradation adoption of appropriate rainwater harvesting techniques could enhance the nutritional status and productivity of citrus orchards in water limited regions the organic material like grass has been reported as effective mulch to conserve soil moisture in situ in citrus plantation mohanty et al 2002 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 the nut grass is abundantly available in uplands and near the drainage channels in central india during monsoon season the water conservation through inter row bunds was not found suitable in cracking clayey soil due to damage of citrus plants by phytopthora disease caused by standing water behind the bunds huchche et al 1999 the water conservation by constructing trenches between the tree rows may be an alternative option in citrus orchards however the studies on the effects of rainwater conservation through trenches and grass mulch gm in citrus orchards in high clay content soil vertisol are limited furthermore the information on overland flow and sediment loss along with the nutrients and organic carbon oc could bring a better planning for land and water management strategies in both micro and macro scales in citrus belts prediction of runoff and soil erosion is very useful for planning design and management of different conservation measures which helps in preventing land and water degradation and livelihood improvement in an area suresh 1997 in recent years a lot of mathematical simulation models have been developed to forecast runoff and soil loss however due to complexity and huge data requirement for simulation these models are rarely preferred by planners for their use in watersheds moreover under data scarce conditions which are a common scenario in most developing countries the use of physical based models is highly restricted therefore in such conditions regression or empirical models serve as an alternative to physics based models due to their easy use and less data requirement to forecast runoff and soil loss mohanty et al 2010 such empirical models have not been developed for citrus orchards in the study region moreover energy which plays a pivotal rule in modern agriculture is going to be a crucial input in near future the energy use analysis becomes a necessary to optimize energy consumption and energy use efficiency to make agriculture sustainable namdari et al 2011 as a perennial crop citrus require substantial energy in land preparation and input use fertilizer water pesticides etc for its production adoption of soil and water conservation measures trenching mulching etc also requires some additional energy in crop fields jat et al 2005 the input output energy analysis and quantification of energy use efficiency is indispensable for energy efficient citrus production under different conservation measures keeping these in view the investigation was carried out to study the effects of trenches continuous staggered and grass mulch on fruit yield water use water productivity sustainability of production and energy use in citrus orchards on vertisol of a tropical climate in central part of india forecasting of overland flow with sediment yield and input output analysis of energy in citrus orchard in different treatments has also been done 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at icar central citrus research institute nagpur latitude 21º 08 45 n longitude 79º 02 15 e and 340 m above mean sea level india during 2004 2010 7 years the 13 year old nagpur mandarin plants with canopy diameter of 5 6 m spaced at 6 m x 6 m was used for the study an orchard with 320 mandarin plants in 1 152 ha was selected for the study the experimental soil was clayey with 31 sand 24 5 silt and 44 5 clay the ph of soil was 8 5 with basic infiltration rate of 3 7 mm h the volumetric water content of soil at 33 0 kpa field capacity and 1500 0 kpa permanent wilting point were 29 7 and 19 3 respectively the top 0 15 m soil had 196 4 mg kg

region the physical parameters texture infiltration rate field capacity permanent wilting point and chemical parameters nutrients and oc of soil were measured following standard procedures singh et al 2005 whereas land slope was determined by dumpy level survey in the orchard the climate of the experimental site is sub humid tropical the weather data during last 30 years of the experiment 1980 2010 collected near to the study site indicated that the daily air temperature varied from 13 8 ºc in month of december to 36 2 ºc in may sometimes air temperature goes up to 45 ºc in peak summer months may june the mean value of evaporation varied from 2 4 mm day in december to 12 8 mm day in may the mean annual rainfall recorded from non recording type of rain gauge at the site is 860 mm out of which 84 722 mm takes place in monsoon season july october the rainfall during post monsoon november february and pre monsoon march june periods are 43 mm 5 of total rainfall and 95 mm 11 of total rainfall respectively the distribution and analysis of annual rainfall and evaporation in different months during last 30 years 1980 2010 and experimental period 2004 2010 indicates that the monthly rainfall did not vary significantly among the years fig 1 the groundwater level near to the experiment site was at 18 20 m from land surface 2 2 treatments and layout the soil water conservation measures tested against without conservation practice wcp were i staggered trench st ii continuous trench ct iii st grass mulch gm and iv ct gm the randomized block design rbd with 4 replications was used for layout of the treatments the experimental plot 240 m x 48 m with 320 mandarin plants was split into 20 runoff plots 48 m x 12 m each runoff plot had 16 plants in 2 rows the runoff flow within the plots was restricted using polythene sheet in their surroundings the ct and st were trapezoidal in shape and their top width depth and bottom width were 0 6 m 0 30 m and 0 15 m respectively the sts with 1 m length each were spaced at 1 m distance following ziz zag manner the vertical interval for both ct and st was 720 mm the soil excavated in trenching was used to construct the bunds trapezoidal shape in downstream side each plant basin area was covered with gm 11 kg plant once in a year after monsoon season mohanty et al 2002 the used gm consisted of 14 8 g kg 1 oc 5 8 g kg 1 n 0

irrigation quantity was worked out based on the formula volume of water applied m3 0 5 volumetric field capacity in percentage volumetric permanent wilting point in percentage mean canopy area of plants in m2 100 the plants in all treatment plots were uniformly fertilized with 260 kg ha n 185 kg ha p and 72 kg ha k srivastava and singh 1997 all the field management practices for the treatments were performed uniformly 2 3 measurement of variables the rainfall taken for analysis was measured in the rain gauge installed at the automatic weather station of the research farm overland flow runoff was quantified using multi slot divisor in each treatment plot the runoff quantity from one slot middle one out of 5 slots was collected in a 2 m3 capacity plastic tank at tail end of the plots after each rainfall the runoff in the tanks was quantified and properly stirred two samples each 1 litre of the stirred runoff were collected from each replicated plot out of the two runoff samples one was dried at 110 ºc the dried sediment was collected and called as sample soil loss the soil loss after each erosive rainfall event was calculated by multiplying the sample soil loss with total runoff collected in the treatment in another runoff sample sediment was collected by filtering the runoff through whatman no 1 filter paper 1 2 µm pore size the air dried soil samples were analyzed for available macro nutrients n p and k available micro nutrients fe cu zn and mn and oc singh et al 2005 the loss of total nutrients and oc under different treatments was estimated by multiplying the concentration of respective nutrients and oc with the total eroded soil the soil samples collected from top 0 15 m soil in month of november were analyzed to determine the changes in oc and nutrients contents in it the swc in treatment plots was measured fortnightly by neutron probe troxler usa and mean monthly swc in top 1 0 m soil under different treatments was calculated the yield kg ha in different treatments was estimated by multiplying the total fruit weight kg per plant with number of plants per hectare 278 five mandarin fruits were sampled from each treatment for analysis of juice percentage total soluble solids tss titrable acidity ta and ascorbic acid aa content ranganna 2001 the physical water productivity pwp and irrigation water productivity iwp under different treatments were estimated as the ratios of yield to rainwater quantity and yield to irrigation water quantity respectively sustainable yield index syi is an indicator of sustaining the productivity of a crop over the years in field condition the value of syi of a crop varies from 0 to 1 bhindhu and gaikward 1998 the higher the value of syi better the chance of sustaining the productive life of the orchard the syi under different treatments was estimated based on the formula singh et al 1990 syi ymean sd ymax where ymean is the mean yield under a given treatment sd is the standard deviation of yield for that treatment across the years and ymax is the maximum yield under that treatment in any year energy input ei energy output eo net energy gain neg and energy use efficiency eue in various treatments in nagpur mandarin orchard were worked out following the procedure recommended by singh and mittal 1992 and namdari et al 2011 the ei was estimated as the summation of energy equivalent of different inputs used whereas eo was estimated as the energy equivalent from fruit yield in different treatments in mandarin orchard the neg and eue were calculated as the difference between eo and ei and ratio of eo to ei respectively the data collected were statically analyzed for dmrt duncan s multiple range test using separation of means dean and voss 1999 the relations of runoff with rainfall and soil erosion were determined using microsoft office 2010 the performance of the developed empirical models to predict runoff and soil erosion under different treatments was evaluated using different

the values of e 0 36 van liew et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall runoff and soil erosion the seasonal runoff and soil erosion under various treatments are given in table 1 among the treatments both staggered trench st and continuous trench ct with grass mulch gm did not result any runoff and soil erosion during winter reflecting 100 rainwater conserving efficiency under gm in citrus orchard in this season the higher infiltration rate of soil 4 9 mm h resulted in higher rainwater conservation efficiency under gm compared with other treatments in winter in pre monsoon period runoff was nil even in without conservation practice wcp treatment indicating the less utility of the conservation practices in mandarin orchard in this period the occurrence of rainfall with intensity less than the infiltration rate of soil was the reason for no runoff and nil soil erosion during pre monsoon during monsoon the highest runoff 58 68 and soil erosion 7 75 t ha were observed in wcp whereas the lowest runoff 31 26 and soil erosion 3 95 t ha were observed in ct gm the lowest runoff and soil erosion was due to maximum conservation of overland flow in ct gm in monsoon season moreover dissipation of kinetic energy of raindrops by mulch and decrease in flow velocity and quantity of surface runoff due to gm and ct reduced the detachment splash erosion and transport of soil particles sheet and rill erosion resulting in lower soil erosion in ct gm than wcp in post monsoon period the runoff and soil erosion were in similar trend of winter under conservation practices among different seasons the monsoon was found most vulnerable to runoff generation 96 92 97 69 of annual runoff and soil erosion 95 67 97 96 of annual soil erosion followed by post monsoon runoff 1 26 1 72 of annual runoff soil erosion 1 35 1 72 of annual soil loss in mandarin orchards of the region the higher amount of rainfall per day 5 8 156 6 mm and higher frequency less duration between two rainfall events 1 7 days produced the higher runoff and soil erosion during monsoon than other seasons rainfall per day 1 2 12 9 mm frequency of rainfall 22 93 days earlier study also reported that the runoff and soil erosion under extreme rainfall condition were 2 8 times and 11 1 times higher respectively than that under normal rainfall condition in citrus orchard under a humid subtropical climate of china duan et al 2020 the gm was found equally effective in conserving rainwater 100 in situ under both ct and st during each season except monsoon in high clay content soil in the citrus orchard overall the conservation practices could trap 20 42 100 overland flow and 25 54 100 sediment loss compared with wcp in the orchard during different seasons of a year the higher trapping efficiency 100 for runoff and soil erosion was observed in winter and post monsoon seasons in st gm and ct gm due to lower runoff and sediment yield caused by low rainfall amounts during these seasons compared with monsoon season these results indicate that grass mulch controlled both runoff and soil erosion in different seasons of the year in citrus orchard on a vertisol the annual mean runoff and soil erosion under wcp was 54 97 of annual rainfall and 8 10 t ha respectively table 1 in past study it was reported that the runoff was 23 of rainfall with soil erosion of 10 7 t ha in citrus plantation in sandy loam soil on 15 land slope liu et al 2012 the study conducted in 1 3 year old citrus grove with 15 32 land gradient concluded that runoff was 75 of total rainfall whereas soil erosion was 30 t ha year in the orchard wang et al 2010 in another study conducted in 1 3 year old citrus plantation on 8 14 land gradient indicated that rainfall runoff and soil erosion were 33 of rainfall and 2 4 mg ha h respectively cerdà et al 2009 tu et al 2018 observed 37 42 runoff and 259 29 t km2 soil erosion under clean tillage in a 2 year old citrus plantation on 12 slope in a red soil in southern china in another study it was reported that runoff and soil loss were 23 9 of rainfall and 28 2 t ha respectively in citrus orchard on 12 slope under a subtropical humid climate of china mo et al 2019 duan et al 2020 observed 12 runoff and 11 4 mg ha 1 soil loss annually in citrus orchard under subtropical climate the differences in magnitude of runoff and soil erosion occurred between various studies and this study was attributed to the changes in land factors soil slope and plot size metrological parameters rainfall quantity and pattern evaporation etc and crop factors age canopy pattern of citrus orchards taken under the experiments the ct reduced the annual runoff and soil erosion by 35 10 and 40 24 respectively compared with wcp the reduction in runoff quantity was attributed to conservation of rainwater in trenches whereas the reduction in soil erosion was due to decreases in runoff velocity caused by breaking of land slope into several short ones coupled with reduced quantity of runoff in ct compared with wcp the gm trapped the soil and runoff up to 20 higher than that in non mulched treatments earlier it was also reported that straw mulch could conserve the rainwater 26 and soil 20 compared with wcp in citrus liu et al 2012 higher infiltration rate 4 9 mm h and reduced surface sealing of soil caused by higher organic matter produced due to decomposition of grass mulch resulted in lower runoff and soil erosion under mulching compared with non mulched treatments infiltration rate 3 8 4 1 mm h moreover the higher time of concentration time of retention due to decrease in velocity of surface runoff under higher resistance of gm to flow probably allowed more runoff water to be absorbed in the soil profile and resulted in lower runoff and soil loss under mulched condition schwab et al 1993 adekalu et al 2007 lowering splash erosion due to de energizing the rain drops is another reason for reduced soil erosion under mulching singh et al 2011 overall ct with gm was observed to be the best rainwater 48 3 and soil conservation 51 2 measure followed by st with gm rainwater conservation 34 8 soil conservation 41 8 in citrus orchard the rainfall runoff relation under conservation practices was linear r2 0 85 0 93 whereas exponential relation r2 0 88 was observed under wcp during 2004 2008 fig 2 these relationships indicated that the higher amount of runoff was generated under wcp than conservation practices for any change in rainfall amount further the lower slopes 0 265 0 329 and intercepts 0 706 1 311 obtained from rainfall runoff relationships in mulched treatments compared to those slopes 0 382 0 488 intercepts 1 885 2 712 in non mulched treatments indicated the lower rate of change in runoff with respect to rainfall under mulch compared with non mulched condition in wcp plot the higher slope 1 076 of rainfall runoff relationship for the rainfall more than 50 mm day compared to slope 0 555 for the rainfall less than 50 mm day reflected the higher rate of change in runoff with respect to rainfall under higher rainfall amount than that under lower rainfall amount however the soil erosion made a linear relations with runoff amount under both wcp r2 0 79 and conservation practices r2 0 76 0 91 fig 3 earlier studies also indicated that rainfall made an exponential relation with runoff with r2 value of 0 84 0 88 liu et al 2012 and runoff made a linear relation with r2 value of 0 82 0 91 with soil erosion cerdà et al 2009 in citrus orchards the higher slopes 0 019 0 022 and intercepts 0 044 0 16 obtained from runoff soil loss relationships in mulched treatments than those in non mulched ones slopes 0 018 intercepts 0 018 0 076 indicated the higher rate of change in soil loss with respect to runoff in mulched plots than that in non mulched plots moreover the rainfall runoff and runoff soil erosion relationships predicted reasonably the runoff 0 82 0 93 nrmse 0 16 0 41 e 0 81 0 94 d 0 61 0 89 sc g e and soil erosion 0 87 0 96 nrmse 0 11 0 28 e 0 86 0 98 d 0 82 0 93 sc g e quantities in different treatments during 2009 and 2010 table 2 the higher r2 with lower nrmse higher e and higher d of the soil erosion models than runoff models indicate the higher efficacy of prediction of the former models than the latter ones these relationships may be useful to design and adopt various conservation strategies in citrus groves of the study areas or elsewhere with similar pedo hydrology of the study site the slope of the relationships between the observed runoff and predicted runoff in wcp treatment 1 01 1 03 was highest followed by non mulched treatments 0 90 1 02 and mulched treatments 0 77 0 89 indicating the higher rate of change in predicted values with respect to observed values of runoff in wcp followed by non mulched treatments and mulched treatments fig 4 the relationships between observed soil loss and predicted soil loss followed the similar trend of runoff in different treatments fig 5 3 2 nutrient loss the transport of organic carbon oc and nutrients n p k fe cu zn and mn from the treatment plots followed the same trend of eroded soil table 3 among the macronutrients n p and k the quantity of p lossed through eroded soil was lowest due to its lower availability 24 9 mg kg soil than other nutrients n 196 4 mg kg soil k 296 77 mg kg soil in top soil of the experimental plot moreover the higher fixation of p with clay minerals might be a reason for slow availability of p in eroded soil compared with other nutrients irrespective of the nutrients their concentrations in the sediment were 1 2 3 1 times higher than that in top 0 15 m soil the highest concentration was observed with n 3 1 and the lowest concentration was observed with micronutrients 1 3 1 7 the lower solubility and mobility along with higher fixation with soil resulted in lower concentration of micronutrients compared with other nutrients in the sediment bhanavase et al 2007 the eroded soil in mulched treatments had higher oc and nutrients than the treatments without mulch indicating higher soil fertility under mulching the higher oc and available nutrients in soil produced due to decomposition of grass mulch and optimum soil water regime might be a reason for higher oc and nutrient content in eroded soil in the mulched plots lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 the higher loss of nutrients and oc was also reported earlier under mulching dass et al 2006 3 3 soil organic carbon and available nutrients the change in oc and available nutrients n p k fe cu zn and mn in the soil varied significantly in the treatments table 4 the oc in soil in non mulched treatments was reduced by 12 19 whereas mulching enhanced the oc by 12 16 compared with initial oc under ct and st the enhancement of oc in soil was attributed to decomposition of mulch and decrease in oc loss in sediment from mulched plots the macronutrients n p and k contents in the soil increased due to fertilizer application to the plants in all treatments the maximum increase in macronutrients in soil was in ct gm nutrients released from the decomposed mulch in conjunction with reduced runoff probably caused higher nutrients in soil under ct gm than wcp moreover the optimum temperature regime and moisture content in soil profile probably encouraged higher population of microbes which transformed the nutrients to available forms resulting in higher availability of nutrients in soil under mulching lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 wang et al 2010 earlier higher soil available nutrient was also observed under organic mulch in citrus orchard mohanty et al 2002 the enhancement of nutrients in soil suggests for development of suitable fertilizer application schedule to save fertilizers under conservation practices in citrus all the micronutrients contents except cu decreased in soil the high ph 8 5 of the soil and loss of nutrients in runoff coupled with uptake of nutrients by plants probably reduced the availability of micronutrients in the mandarin orchard panigrahi and srivastava 2016 the reduction in available micronutrients was lowest in ct gm the conservation of runoff and soil along with the nutrients available from decomposed gm resulted in higher availability of micronutrients in soil under ct gm and st gm than other treatments the improvement of cu in soil in all the treatment plots might be due to the use of fungicide containing cu in controlling phytophthora disease in citrus however the application of micronutrients based fertilizers in appropriate quantity in soil is suggested for citrus cultivation in the region 3 4 soil water content and irrigation supply the average soil water content swc in study years in different treatments during january december indicated that conservation practices produced significantly higher soil water than that in wcp fig 6 during june september the highest increase in swc 12 55 was recorded due to higher rainfall 711 mm and higher conservation of rainwater in this period than other periods the highest available swc was observed under ct gm due to conservation of maximum runoff in this treatment the available swc in different treatments was reduced during october december due to insufficient rainfall to compensate the evapo transpiration et of mandarin plants in this period however the reduction in available swc during october december was progressively decreased reflecting the lower et of the mandarin plants during december compared with that during october in earlier studies panigrahi et al 2010 and reddy et al 2013 also reported the lowest et of nagpur mandarin plants in december the available swc during january may was marginally higher 3 15 under conservation practices than wcp the supplemental drip irrigation provided to citrus plants helped in maintaining the optimum soil water regime and lowering the gaps in it among different conservation treatments during january may the available swc under gm was around 20 higher than that in without mulching the higher available swc was resulted by higher infiltration of runoff water in conjunction with less evaporation from soil under mulching compared with without mulching adekalu et al 2007 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 earlier research indicated that the soil water content was increased by 12 20 in citrus orchards due to the fact that mulch prevents surface sealing by preventing the direct impact of rain drops on the soil surface and encourages biological activities which leads to the development of macropores in the soil the macropores help in trapping higher quantity of rainwater due to increased infiltration rate under mulch kumar et al 2015 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 the irrigation quantity progressively increased during january may owing to rising in water requirement of mandarin plants from january to may table 5 the highest water requirement of the plants in may was evident from the increased evaporation rate in this month at the study site fig 1 earlier studies also reported the highest and lowest water requirement of nagpur mandarin plants in december january 23 litres plant 1 day 1 and may 55 litres plant 1 day 1 respectively in central india panigrahi et al 2010 reddy et al 2013 the irrigation requirements under ct gm and st gm were reduced by 31 and 24 respectively compared with wcp the reduction in water application attributed to higher storage of rainwater and less evaporation under mulching in ct and st the water applied was marginally 7 lower under ct than st moreover mulching alone reduced the water use by 20 22 compared with without mulching in the plots previous studies also reported 12 15 water saving in eureka lemon kumar et al 2015 and 15 20 in acid lime lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 under grass mulch compared with non mulched treatment overall the results indicate that grass mulch was found very effective in reducing irrigation water use by conserving in situ soil water in citrus orchard 3 5 yield fruit quality and water productivity the yield parameters number and weight of fruit total yield water productivity and internal quality of fruits juice total soluble solid acidity and ascorbic acid in different conservation practices and without conservation practice wcp are given in table 6 the number of fruits per plant under conservation practices was increased up to 37 compared with that in wcp the lower number of fruits dropped 104 272 under conservation practices than wcp 305 resulted in higher number of fruits in the former treatments in earlier studies higher fruit drop 23 31 under sub optimum soil water regime was also observed in citrus orchard panigrahi and srivastava 2011 mohanty et al 2002 previous research stated that the fruit drop which generally occurs due to physiological disorder could be reduced by improving physiological metabolic activity of the citrus plants under optimum soil water content and available nutrients as observed in ct gm huchche et al 1999 ghosh 2007 the number of fruit harvested was highest in ct gm moreover the fruit drop was reduced by 26 55 under grass mulch gm indicating the positive effect of mulch on on tree storage of fruits in citrus the fruit weight was higher in conservation practices than wcp the fruits harvested in st gm were heavier than that in ct gm the higher fruit weight in st gm might be due to lower number of fruits in this treatment than ct gm moreover gm produced the fruits with higher weight than non mulched treatments earlier studies also recorded heavier fruits under mulching than non mulched treatments and stated that the higher photosynthesis rate under increased soil moisture and available nutrients probably resulted in higher fruit weight of mulched plants than non mulched one mohanty et al 2002 kumar et al 2015 the total fruit production of mandarin plants was highest in ct gm the highest yield was attributed to higher number of fruits probably caused by higher photosynthesis rate of leaves under optimum soil water content and available nutrients in ct gm than other treatments panigrahi et al 2010 kumar et al 2015 the enhancement of fruit yield was 3 17 in non mulched treatments compared with wcp the fruit yield under ct was 14 higher than that under st the higher fruit yield was attributed to higher soil water content which resulted in lower fruit drop and higher fruit weight in ct compared with st further mulching produced 26 36 higher fruit yield than without mulched treatments the higher fruit yield was attributed to higher metabolic activities and formation of higher quantity of photosynthates by citrus plants under optimum soil water regime caused by higher rainwater conservation higher infiltration lower runoff and lower evaporation in mulched plots increased available nutrients under higher microbe bacteria fungi population in soil probably another reason for higher yield in mulched treatments compared with non mulched treatments mohanty et al 2002 lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 earlier lalruatsangi and hazarika 2018 and lal et al 2003 also reported 15 25 higher yield under gm compared with without mulch in citrus however experiment conducted by liu et al 2012 indicated that mulching had no significant effect on fruit yield in citrus the differential effect of mulching was attributed to changes in status of soil water content and nutrients crop variety land type and environments prevailed in citrus orchards under the experiments rodríguez gamir et al 2010 the yield in ct gm was 53 higher than that in wcp the production of higher yield using less water 31 resulted in higher physical water productivity pwp 53 and irrigation water productivity iwp 123 in ct gm than wcp the ct gm produced the highest pwp and iwp which were 9 53 and 20 123 higher than that in other treatments respectively the higher increase in fruit yield with reduced water use attributed to higher water productivity in ct gm than other treatments the lowest water productivity was observed in wcp the increase in iwp was higher than pwp under mulching indicating the higher effectiveness of gm on irrigation water application than rainwater conserving in mandarin orchard previous research also reported that water productivity could be enhanced by 65 78 due to mulching in citrus mohanty et al 2002 kumar et al 2015 the fruit qualities juice total soluble solids ascorbic acid were better under conservation practices than wcp the percentage of juice was highest in ct gm the higher juice content might be due to higher uptake of water under increased soil water content in ct gm than other treatments however the total soluble solid tss of fruits was lower in ct gm than st gm the dilution of sugars due to higher juice content might result in lower tss in the fruits under ct gm the fruits harvested under conservation practices were having lower acidity than that in wcp the st gm produced the fruits with lowest acidity among the treatments the increased rate of transformation of acids to sugars which helps in producing optimum osmotic turgidity in fruits under medium plant water stress condition probably caused the higher tss and lower acidity in st gm than ct gm huang et al 2000 earlier pérez pérez et al 2008 and navarro et al 2010 also observed the higher tss and lower acidity of citrus fruits of the plants under mild water deficit the ascorbic acid content was higher in the fruits under conservation practices compared with wcp moreover the ascorbic acid was higher in the fruits under mulched treatments ct gm st gm than other treatments past study by liu et al 2012 also recoded higher ascorbic acid content in the citrus fruits under mulching however concentration of ascorbic acid in the juice under both ct and st was statically at par 3 6 sustainability of production and energy analysis the sustainable yield index syi was the highest in ct gm followed by st gm table 7 the lowest syi was observed in without conservation practice wcp moreover the syi under mulched treatments was higher than that under non mulched treatments indicating the higher efficacy of gm on maintaining the sustainability of citrus production in vertisol the higher availability of organic carbon nutrients and soil water content might caused higher sustainability of production in citrus under grass mulch earlier studies also reported the higher syi under organic mulch in different fruit crops guava mango papaya and stated that the increased organic matter higher soil porosity and optimum soil temperature resulted in higher loads of beneficial microbes and earthworms in soil which helped in improving soil health and sustainability in crop production patil et al 2013 the energy analysis in the citrus orchard indicates that the highest energy input ei was in ct gm followed by st gm table 7 the lowest ei was in wcp the higher ei was attributed to the additional energy use 2402 mj ha in making trenches and doing mulching in ct gm even st used less energy than that in ct under both mulched and non mulched condition due to higher energy use in making ct than st the energy output eo followed the similar trend of fruit yield under different treatments the net energy gain neg was highest in ct gm followed by st gm the neg was lowest in st due to comparatively lower gain in yield 0 34 t ha resulting in lower increase in energy output 666 mj ha with higher increase in energy input 704 mj ha due to additional energy requirement in construction of trenches in this treatment compared with wcp the energy use efficiency eue followed the same trend of neg under different treatments previous study reported the higher eue under in situ moisture conservation measures in maize jat et al 2005 however the eues in st and wcp were statistically at par 4 conclusions all the conservation practices were found effective in trapping runoff and sediment which resulted in significant enhancement in available water and soil fertility in nagpur mandarin orchards the higher soil water content and available nutrients helped in boosting the productivity of the citrus plants the improved yield with reduced irrigation water quantity resulted in higher water productivity under conservation practices compared with without conservation practice among the conservation practices continuous trenching coupled with grass mulch was found most suitable to conserve rainwater and soil resulting in higher sustainable yield and energy use efficiency compared with without conservation practice in the citrus orchard the rainfall runoff and runoff soil erosion relationships developed under the study may be useful in integrated watershed development program in citrus belts of central india or in the regions with similar pedo hydrological condition of the study site overall it can be concluded that continuous trenching with grass mulch is a potential conservation option for mandarin orchards of water scarce central india it s adoption will bring a sizable increase in crop productivity with substantial water saving in citrus cultivation the enhancement in macronutrients along with reduction in micronutrients in soil recommend for further studies on fertilizer management under conservation measures

9863,rice is one of the most important agricultural commodities throughout the mekong river basin including the tonle sap lake floodplains in cambodia recent increases in hydropower dams along the mekong river have likely altered the surface water hydrology impacting the arable areas and soil qualities for rice production in the tonle sap lowland along with the hydrological impacts the region s rice farming is facing a rapidly changing climate it is critical to understand how the hydrological changes associated with dam development impact the region s rice production in a changing climate the aims of this study were to assess the impacts of recent increases in hydropower dams on the timing and areas of rice cropping in the tonle sap floodplains and to evaluate the effects of changing hydrology rising temperature and adaptive farming practices on rice productivity using a process based rice crop model oryza v3 the effect of dams on arable areas for rice was identified by a remote sensing method based on the phenorice algorithm for the period of 2001 2019 in two rice growing provinces kampong thom and battambang the phenorice method identified an increase in rice growing areas as well as shifts in both timing and location of rice cropping towards the sources of irrigation during the dry season since 2010 the oryza model simulated a substantial yield reduction with an increase of 2 c in air temperature in the region the model predicted that the rice productivity in the region is sensitive to soil organic carbon content which is expected to change with surface water hydrology the model also predicted that region s rice yield can increase by optimizing the timing and amount of n fertilization the findings from this study highlight how hydrology climate and agronomic practices can interact to impact rice production in the lower mekong region and provide insights for effective water management and agronomic practices to attain food security in the region in a changing climate keywords rice production hydrology remote sensing crop modeling climate change cambodia hydropower dams mekong river 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is the staple food in cambodia and rice farming provides livelihood to the majority of the nation s poor population cramb et al 2020 fao 2015 about 85 of the country s croplands is cultivated for rice siek et al 2017 rice production has increased in recent years since the government implemented its policy on the promotion of paddy production and rice export in 2010 royal government of cambodia 2010 cultivated rice area climbed at a rate of 1 7 from 1990 to 2017 cramb 2020 the country s average yield also improved from 2 5 to 3 3 tons ha 1 from 2005 to 2017 maff 2018 the ministry of agriculture reported a total harvested area of 3 2 million ha in 2018 this boost can be attributed to farmers moving from subsistence to commercial farming adoption of modern varieties increased use of fertilizers mechanization and availability of credit cramb et al 2020 johnston et al 2013 world bank 2015a cambodian rice is also gaining recognition in the export market for its high eating quality sopheap et al 2018 despite these developments cambodia s yield and production still lags thailand and vietnam its top rice producing neighbors that also enjoy the irrigation benefits of the rich mekong river ecosystem smith and hornbuckle 2013 usda 2010 world bank 2015a large portions of rice in cambodia are cultivated around the tonle sap floodplains approximately 23 of the floodplains are used for agriculture for which 75 are used for rice production fao 2015 matsui et al 2006 the tonle sap lake is the largest and most important lake in the lower mekong region in south east asia it is often referred as the beating heart of cambodia with its cyclic swelling and shrinking during the annual transition from monsoon to dry season lamberts 2006 tonle sap lake connects to the mekong river through the 110 km tonle sap river eyler and weatherby 2019 as the mekong river brings intense monsoon floods from may to october it carries an abundant mix of organic matter nutrient rich sediments and diverse fish species that are deposited to the tonle sap floodplains eyler and weatherby 2019 at its peak the lake can increase six times larger than its dry season volume depth goes from 1 to 10 m or more of which 70 of the water comes from the mekong river matsui et al 2006 as the floods recede during the dry season the floodplains become a spawning ground for fishes and provide a fertile soil for crop production eyler and weatherby 2019 hortle et al 2004 lamberts 2006 hydrology in the tonle sap floodplains is changing because of the increasing number of dams in the mekong river and tributaries regulating the flood flow downstream pokhrel et al 2018a while dams and hydroelectric power plants are built to address the increasing energy demands the lower mekong they also alter the natural cycle of biota exchange between tonle sap and mekong river sabo et al 2017 stone 2016 currently the connectivity of the floodplains to the river already reduced by 31 eyler and weatherby 2019 previous studies already predicted that lake extent and depth during dry season could increase haddeland et al 2006 kummu and sarkkula 2008 mekong river commission 2010 pokhrel et al 2018b and consequently drive irrigation infrastructure development arias et al 2012 better access to irrigation could influence planting time and open more lands for rice farming however the impact of changing tonle sap hydrology to rice production in terms of area location and timing of cultivation has not yet been examined water availability is a major constraint in dry season rice production in cambodia paddy fields situated farther away from rivers and canals are likely to experience water stress according to a study conducted by veasna et al 2014 however with hydropower dams regulating the flow of stored flood water from the monsoon months water level is expected to rise and reside longer during the dry season arias et al 2012 kummu and sarkkula 2008 mekong river commission 2010 pokhrel et al 2018b several infrastructure projects are currently initiated to allow better access to dependable irrigation adb 2019 aciar 2015 although maff 2018 already reported the increasing dry season rice production area information on the location and timing of the expansion are scarce as climate is changing drought spells are occurring more frequently in cambodia specifically in 2002 2012 2015 and 2016 sithirith 2017 the country s mean temperature has increased at a rate of 0 02 c annually since 1950 thoeun 2015 by 2060 the mean annual temperature is predicted to increase by 2 7 c world bank 2018 dry season monthly average temperature of tonle sap lake is rising by 0 03 c each year from 1988 to 2018 daly et al 2020 comprehensive water management and forecasting in the lower mekong region is critical in making important decisions related to food security for instance with the presence of dams providing guidelines on the amount and timing of discharge will aid in ensuring irrigation demands are met in the rice cropping areas the soil organic matter of the agricultural zone of tonle sap s floodplains is replenished by the rich mix of sediments from the monsoon flood dry season rice benefits from this ecosystem service once the water subsides leaving behind fertile silt deposits eyler and weatherby 2019 in a comprehensive survey conducted by arias et al 2013 they determined positive correlation between organic matter content and duration of inundation as the dams continue to control the magnitude of water and sediment flow beveridge et al 2020 kondolf et al 2014 the nutrient quality carried by the flood pulse during the wet season could diminish this might result in less fertile deposits in the floodplains come dry season making it even more necessary for farmers to apply chemical fertilizers in the absence of long term yield and production data earth observation acquired from satellite images can provide information on how rice production patterns in tonle sap floodplains have changed over the years rice cropping areas can be identified by detecting agronomic flooding during the start of the season and subsequent ground cover changes corresponding to rice phenological stages displayed by the vegetation index such indicators are the basis of the phenorice algorithm boschetti et al 2017 which utilizes hypertemporal optical imagery from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to map rice areas nasa goddard space flight center ocean ecology laboratory 2014a 2014b the method identifies signals of crop establishment and key phases of development of the rice plant effects of climate and agronomic variables that contribute to rice yield and production can be explained using process based crop models boote et al 1996 rosenzweig et al 2014 the oryza v3 rice model bouman et al 2001 li et al 2017 was specifically designed to simulate rice growth and development the model can estimate the effect of climate soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics irrigation and farm management practices to harvest yield at varying rice production environments belder et al 2005 boling et al 2007 radanielson et al 2018 sudhir yadav et al 2011 when actual ground data are not available remote sensing and crop modeling can provide area based historical yield estimates and generate yield forecasts for future scenarios this study examined the changes in the dry season rice production in the tonle sap floodplains coinciding with the surge of hydropower dam developments in the mekong river using remote sensing we analyzed the relationship between cropping patterns and surface water availability through crop simulation modeling we investigated the effects of climate change farm management practices and field abiotic conditions to harvestable rice yield specifically this research sought to accomplish the following objectives 1 to detect the changes in timing and location of cropping before and after the surge of dam developments using the phenorice method and 2 to test and apply the oryza v3 rice model in simulating the effect of changes in hydrology agronomic practices and increasing temperature to rice production and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 spatio temporal changes in crop production based on the study by hecht et al 2019 dam constructions in the lower mekong river dramatically increased from 2010 and beyond fig 1 therefore we designated 2001 2010 as pre dam and 2011 2019 as post dam which in this paper referred to as dam periods there were 37 operational hydropower dams in the mekong river basin in 2010 and this number increased to 64 by 2017 hecht et al 2019 2 1 1 study sites this study focused on kampong thom and battambang two of the major rice producing provinces in cambodia fig 2 in 2017 maff reported that battambang contributed 1 15 million tons 11 0 and kampong thom shared 0 80 million tons 7 9 to the country s total rice production in the same year kampong thom and battambang accounted for 9 81 and 3 74 of the total dry season production area respectively the dry season rice production spans from october to march direct seeding by manual broadcasting is the common sowing practice nesbitt 1997 rice growers in these provinces rely on irrigation systems for water source during the dry season canals and reservoirs distribute the remaining monsoon water in the tonle sap lake to the rice growing areas cramb et al 2020 smith and hornbuckle 2013 kampong thom is in the central part of cambodia close to the confluence that connects the lake to the mekong river exposing it to early and prolonged inundation fig 2 much of its locality lies in the southeastern part of the tonle sap floodplain where 94 of agricultural lands are devoted for rice farming adb 2012 dry season rice is commonly planted in the latter part of the wet season to early dry season which is around september to november cramb et al 2020 ricepedia 2018 battambang is situated in the northwestern part of cambodia and by the northern end of the tonle sap lake fig 2 in the western side of the province is the kamping pouy reservoir providing good water management system for the rice growers within the area nguyen et al 2011 sithirith 2017 it has one of the largest irrigated paddy rice areas in the country siek et al 2017 and the top producer of wet season rice the locations of these two provinces provide perspective on the rice cropping pattern from the start of the monsoon until the flood recedes in the dry season kampong thom experiences early and longer flooding while battambang experiences late inundation and early flood recession 2 1 2 detecting the timing and location of cropping using phenorice the phenorice method identifies rice cropping areas on a per pixel basis by thresholding vegetation indices and derivative curve fitting boschetti et al 2017 this allows the recognition of key phenological stages such as sowing flowering and planting duration it also detects signals of agronomic flooding before and after crop establishment to confirm a rice area the algorithm has been tested over different genetic environmental management and climatic conditions

rule a pixel is classified as a rice area if a clear and unambiguous flood condition is detected based on the defined ndfi threshold the flood signals should be followed by evi profile consistent with the rice s development stages to discriminate from other flooded habitats boschetti et al 2017 busetto et al 2019 rapid growth during the vegetative stage of the plant is indicated by the increase in evi signal followed by a relatively stationary peak that signifies anthesis and finally the decrease in spectral curve slope that represents senescence and harvest savitzky golay smoothing chen et al 2004 was applied to reduce noise and substitute missing pixels of the evi and ndfi time series the highest minima of the evi spectral curve closest to the detected agronomic flooding is a proxy to crop establishment while the highest maxima correspond to crop heading the modis time series day of year doy product which gives the julian date when the image was acquired aids in identifying the dates when these important signals occur allowing us to estimate crop establishment or planting time usefulness index and pixel reliability indicators were used for quality control especially the inherent error expected for the monsoon season where cloud covers and rain are a common occurrence the complete description of this method is provided by boschetti et al 2017 and implemented as an interactive data language in envi exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado a software for geographical and remote sensing imagery analysis in this study the phenorice workflow see appendix a was coded and executed in the statistical software r r core team 2020 the required parameters were calibrated by applying phenorice to the 17 farms visited in kampong thom and battambang length of vegetative stage and planting durations were based on the commonly used rice varieties on these sites medium duration 100 110 days varieties were assumed for dry season planting flooded conditions which suggest land preparation and crop establishment have a minimum threshold ndvi value of 0 earth observation images from modis terra and aqua have 250 m spatial resolution and 8 day combined nominal temporal resolution these products have been widely used for modeling terrestrial ecosystems to detect long term land use and cover changes time series evi huete et al 1994 ndfi boschetti et al 2014 doy usefulness index and pixel reliability quality indicators were the specific products used as input for phenorice they were preprocessed and extracted using the modistsp package busetto and ranghetti 2016 in r annual land cover maps downloaded from servir mekong https rlcms servir adpc net en landcover were used to pre classify rice areas before implementing phenorice crop establishment dates estimated by phenorice from 2001 to 2019 were recorded with the corresponding pixel count and location the planting dates were used as input in oryza v3 to estimate the total rice production tons ha 1 the total area for a given crop establishment date were calculated for each dam period the time series moving average was obtained with 8 day rolling window accounting for the temporal resolution of the modis images we plotted the geo coordinates of the pixels and created a density map to spatially illustrate the locations and clustering of farm areas 2 1 3 estimating changes in flooding extent using ndfi the changes in dry season hydrology in the tonle sap lake were estimated through remote sensing where water areas were detected using ndfi signals a fixed area extent to delineate kampong thom and battambang was designated for each analyzed image from 2001 to 2019 an area is flooded if the pixel has a minimum value of 0 boschetti et al 2017 the percentage of flood pixels for a given extent and associated doy were obtained the moving average of percent flooding during pre dam and post dam were calculated with an 8 day rolling window based on the temporal resolution of ndfi and doy images the relationship between the extent of flooding with the timing and area of cropping were evaluated using pair wise comparison and pearson correlation respectively note that ndfi only detects surface water thus that depth of flooding was not considered in the analysis 2 2 oryza v3 model calibration and testing all the production and yield estimations in this study were executed using the oryza v3 rice model li et al 2017 formerly known as oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 developed at the international rice research institute irri this recently updated version has an expanded ability to model lowland upland and flooded rice ecosystems it mechanistically simulates growth and development of rice through its photosynthesis respiration and water nitrogen balance modules its capability to model weather agronomic management conditions and abiotic constraints has been calibrated and validated for 18 popular rice varieties in various locations throughout asia belder et al 2005 boling et al 2007 li et al 2015 radanielson et al 2018 sudhir yadav et al 2011 the model update features the soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics module that quantify the changes in the soil organic carbon and nitrogen content the soil temperature module was also added which accounts for the daily temperature from the soil surface to the lower layers the detailed formulations behind these modules can be found in li et al 2017 to test the ability of the crop model to simulate farm conditions within our specific study region we calibrated and tested oryza v3 using field measurements and information gathered from farmer s interviews during the dry season of 2018 and 2019 there were two rice varieties commonly planted in our sample farms one is sen kra ob with short to medium planting duration aromatic and commonly grown for the export market the other variety was ir 5154 which has a longer growth duration and cultivated in both dry and wet seasons these two varieties were calibrated using the measured total dry biomass and phenological information to determine their specific leaf area and partitioning factors appendix b the values were calculated using the auto calibration tool in the oryza v3 model package all the other crop parameters were taken from the default crop values of the model which are based on the robustly parameterized ir 72 rice variety model testing was conducted by comparing the measured total dry biomass stem and leaf measurements in the vegetative stage of the 2019 dry season to the simulated values associated r2 root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and model efficiency ef were duly noted to determine the predictive accuracy of the simulation outputs the following formula were used to calculate rmse rrmse and ef 1 rmse 1 n y i y i 2 n 2 rrmse rmse y 100 3 e f 1 1 n y i y i 2 1 n y i y 2 observed values are designated by y i and simulated values by y i the total number of samples is given by n and y is the mean of observed values 2 2 1 farm surveys and interview with growers we conducted interviews with local growers to collect baseline data for model calibration and testing sowing date irrigation depth amount and timing of fertilizer application and growth stage information of the planted variety were noted sizes of the farms included in the study ranged from 0 2 to 3 0 ha we visited 12 farms in krong stueng saen village in kampong thom near the stung sen river a tributary of tonle sap lake the sample farms were selected such that their spread represent the elevation gradient and distance from the lake during our interviews we gathered that irrigation is managed by a local farmers cooperative under the cambodia agricultural value chain cavac program although these farms are located no more than 10 kilometers apart their crop establishments varied according to their proximity to irrigation sources farms located farther away from the river tend to sow early to utilize the receding monsoon flood in battambang we collected data from five farms located in banan district their irrigation is controlled by the local government through the provincial department of water resources and meteorology as verified during our interviews thus their sowing times could vary from two weeks to one month it was an unusually dry year in cambodia in 2019 for instance kampong thom farmers had to plant early to take advantage of the subsiding lake water from the dry monsoon season most of the rice farmers in battambang suspended sowing because there was no available irrigation we were informed during the farm visit that the local government decided to reserve the water supply for the anticipated drought for the rest of the dry season in 2019 the farms we visited in kampong thom appeared to have greater flexibility and capacity to make decisions related to irrigation management compared to the battambang sites who are reliant on the local government for the release of water to the canals 2 2 2 plant biomass measurements weight of total biomass and planting density were taken at reproductive stage in ds 2018 january to february 2019 samples were taken from three replicates of 0 5 0 5 m quadrat spread out to represent each farmer s plot total number of tillers per quadrat were noted and 20 subsamples were oven dried at 75 c for at least 3 days fresh and dry weight of the 20 subsampled tillers were measured during the vegetative stage in ds 2019 december 2019 weight of partitioned biomass and planting density were measured weeds were observed to be a common problem in the paddies occupying up to 20 of the cropping area based on visual estimation in the farms visited 2 2 3 soil measurements soil measurements were taken by core boring at 0 15 cm depths soil texture was determined by hydrometer method adapted from huluka and miller 2014 total n was analyzed by kjeldahl digestion method greweling and peech 1960 jackson 1959 total soil organic carbon was measured following ghani et al 2003 bulk density was determined from soil sampled at 5 cm depth using a metal tube with 5 cm diameter costantini 1995 soil texture total n soil organic matter content and bulk density measurements were used as input data for crop model simulations all plant and soil samples were processed at the soil science laboratory of the royal university of agriculture in phnom penh cambodia other required parameters such as the different volumetric water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated following the derivation formulated by saxton and rawls 2006 to provide the 100 cm depth soil information required by the crop model soil texture soil organic carbon and bulk density from 15 to 100 cm depth were obtained from soilgridstm https soilgrids org this online resource is provided by the world soil information also known as the international soil reference and information centre generated from global compilation of soil profile data and environmental layers through machine learning methods at 250 m2 resolution other input data required by oryza v3 such as volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity were derived based on saxton and rawls 2006 from the soil texture information provided by soilgridstm 2 2 4 climate data climate data for model calibration and farm specific dry season simulations in 2018 and 2019 were provided by the weather stations from cambodia s center of excellence on sustainable agricultural intensification and nutrition cesain since historical weather data from 2001 to 2018 were unavailable for battambang and kampong thom we obtained the temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and wind speed data from the national centers for environmental prediction global forecast system ncep gfs rainfall data from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42v7 were resampled to 0 1 degree 10 km spatial resolution the estimated climate data from gfs and trmm were used for seasonal yield simulations performed from 2001 to 2018 2 3 scenario simulations oryza v3 simulates rice growth at daily time step requiring crop soil field management and weather input data crop data includes the genetic characteristics of the variety used such as phenology development rates assimilate partitioning behavior among others soil input information includes soil texture chemical composition and water content agronomic management inputs required are crop establishment method timing density of planting and timing amount of applied irrigation and nitrogen n daily weather data includes temperature solar radiation vapor pressure wind speed and rainfall we used the model to estimate the final yield based on the planting date we obtained from phenorice as well as to simulate yield responses due to changes in temperature n application and soil nutrient deposits in the form of organic carbon 2 3 1 estimating past production and yield we calculated the attainable yield for each sowing date from 2001 to 2018 to capture the changes and effects of climate conditions to the total in this context attainable yield is the highest possible yield that the model can predict from the given inputs and abiotic conditions sadras et al 2015 same management inputs were employed through all the simulations which were based on the agronomic practices of the visited farms in kampong thom with median harvest yield essentially the only varying factors were the historical daily weather information obtained from ncep gfs and trmm 3b42v7 using the total rice area per planting date from phenorice and yield from calibrated ir 5154 variety we estimated the mean daily total production for pre dam and post dam periods 2 3 2 predicting yield response to changes in temperature nitrogen applications and residual soil organic carbon upon determining the level of confidence of oryza v3 to simulate the actual field conditions in our farm samples we performed sensitivity analysis by designing a range of treatments to model yield response all simulations were executed using field conditions and farmer s practices gathered from the kampong thom farms during the 2019 dry season appendix c 2 3 2 1 temperature effects in 2015 cambodia recorded a maximum annual temperature of 38 c thoeun 2015 furthermore the world health organization who predicted that cambodia s yearly average could increase from 1 6 to 2 0 c by 2100 who 2016 given these conditions we estimated the effect of supra optimal temperatures on the harvest yield of the sample farms in kampong thom farms we simulated changes of 5 to 5 c from the daily temperatures recorded by cesain weather station in addition a long term simulation experiment was performed to explore the rice yield sensitivity to temperature increases and whether this increase would affect the ideal planting times in the future climate this simulation experiment was done by adding 3 c to the base air temperatures in the weather data for the period of 2001 2018 the temperatures used in these simulations were meant to capture extreme temperature changes higher than the predicted by who 2 3 2 2 nitrogen application effects we performed n simulations with three application schedules based on our farm interviews appendix c with total n applied ranging from 30 to 200 kg ha 1 per season in the first simulation s 1 n was applied at two different developmental stages 1 during early tillering and 2 panicle initiation in the second simulation s 2 n was also applied twice 1 during late tillering and 2 booting and lastly s 3 simulated three n applications 1 during early tillering 2 late tillering and 3 panicle initiation 2 3 2 3 residual soil organic carbon in anticipation of the decline of sediment quality in the tonle sap floodplains we estimated the possible effects of the changing soil organic carbon soc content to the harvest yield referencing the onsite soc measured during the start of dry season in 2018 we estimated the final yield if soc is decreased by up to 50 or increased to up to 50 using the calibrated ir 5154 variety 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis the modis time series satellite data from 2001 to 2020 were extracted from the national aeronautics and space administration archive nasa goddard space flight center ocean ecology laboratory 2014b 2014a and pre processed in r language r core team 2020 using the modistsp package busetto and ranghetti 2016 the phenorice algorithm was written and implemented in r with the aid of gis and remote sensing packages such as rgdal bivand et al 2021 raster hijmans and van etten 2012 rgeos bivand et al 2021 and sf pebesma 2018 further data processing and statistical analyses such as student t test correlation anova and savitzky golay smoothing were undertaken using tidyverse wickham et al 2019 hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2020 prospectr stevens and ramirez lopez 2020 and base r core team 2020 packages in r table 1 3 results 3 1 lake water extent in relation to location and timing of rice production the almost two fold increase in hydropower dams in the lower mekong river since 2010 coincided with apparent shift in timing and location of rice cultivation to later in the year especially for kampong thom province to graphically illustrate the influence of the floodwater availability to the crop establishment distribution in the dry season production october to january we overlaid the rolling average of the surface water detected in the tonle sap lake with the average percent of rice area planted fig 3 area in blue we performed simple pair wise comparison on the seasonal and monthly flood extent between pre and post dam periods the percent water area detected in the designated map extent per province during the two dam periods were compared table 2 based on student t test there was no significant difference between the seasonal area of flooding of the two dam periods in both battambang and kampong thom table 2 however monthly flood variability showed statistical increase in surface water at post dam period specifically in the months of november and january for both in kampong thom and battambang floodplains table 2 examining the cultivated rice areas detected by phenorice there was an apparent shift in crop establishment schedule as shown by the difference in plot areas in fig 3 area in green and yellow pairwise comparison between pre dam and post dam periods showed significance difference on the estimated monthly total rice area table 3 increase in rice cultivation during post dam period was more evident in kampong thom specifically from november to december previously at pre dam sowing falls on early october the onset of the dry season in the case of battambang province the results of a two tailed student t test in table 3 did not show statistical significance in the seasonal rice areas between pre dam and post dam however extended crop establishment was observed in november to december during post dam period phenorice allowed us to examine the spatial distribution of rice farms in the tonle sap floodplains illustrated by the density maps of the different planting seasons in fig 4 the heat map of kampong thom showed that farms were more clustered during pre dam and became sparsely distributed during post dam and fig 4 a and b in battambang province the locations and area distribution were generally similar for both pre and post dam fig 3 c and d cropping was relatively denser during pre dam on the northwest side where kamping pouy reservoir is situated however an apparent decrease in hotspot density can be observed during the post dam period concentration near the reservoir declined while cultivations seemed to shift towards the direction of the lake to establish the relationship between the area of inundation and area of rice cultivation a simple correlation was performed between the seasonal flooding detected and total seasonal rice area table 4 the seasonal flooding was the mean of the surface water detected by ndfi each year for the entire dry season while the total seasonal rice area is the mean of the annual sum of dry season rice areas estimated by phenorice in kampong thom there was a strong correlation between the extent of flooding and rice area planted 0 81 at pre dam however this correlation decreased at post dam 0 49 as shown in table 4 as the correlation decreased significant increase in cultivation table 3 and fairly spread out distribution of planting locations along the floodplains fig 4 a and b were observed at post dam in kampong thom conversely in battambang the correlation between flooding extent and planting area remained high and increased slightly at post dam 0 71 0 74 as the extent of the lake increased in november and december at post dam table 2 so did the area of rice cultivation table 3 there was no considerable change in the location of planting in battambang but subtle movement of high density areas towards the location of the lake was evident in fig 4 c and d 3 2 results of crop model calibration and testing total dry biomass of ir 5154 and sen kra ob sampled in 2018 were used for model calibration total and partitioned biomass sampled in kampong thom in 2029 were used for model testing only ir 5154 variety was used for model testing because inadequate data for sen kra ob results are shown in the 1 1 plot in fig 5 to visually inspect the differences between the modeled and actual measurements the corresponding values of the goodness of fit parameters are listed in table 5 the calculated modeling efficiency ef for model calibration was 0 49 and 0 64 for ir 5154 and sen kra ob respectively a model is considered acceptable if threshold values are 0 5 ef moriasi et al 2007 other parameters such as rmse rrmse and r2 were used to verify the ability of the model to predict biomass and yield from actual farm conditions table 5 the total biomass during the more advanced stage of development were underestimated but overall model testing showed acceptable ef and r2 partitioned green leaves and stem gave ef values of 0 56 and 0 35 respectively 3 3 modeling production from historical climate conditions combining remote sensing and crop modeling we observed considerable increase in total rice production during the post dam period in kampong thom province this can be expected since rice areas noticeably increased based on the results of phenorice method fig 6 crop establishments at pre dam period were concentrated in october with relatively less production activities for the rest of the dry season noticeable shift in planting time is observed during post dam particularly in the months of november to december yields trends in pre and post dam periods follow the same pattern as represented by solid continuous line in fig 6 the dry season attainable yield of ir 5154 the variety used in the simulation fluctuated between 6 5 and 7 0 tons ha 1 the seasonal variability was primarily driven by the climatic conditions during the plant s growth and development note that for these simulations historical weather data were used and same farm management inputs were assumed regardless of the planting date the annual total production for the sample provinces were estimated and presented in the bar graph in fig 7 the only available official data gathered from maff for the two sample provinces was for 2016 and 2017 represented by the points in the graph this very low number of data points were inadequate to substantially validate the 17 year production data estimated by the model from these two production data points there was noticeable underestimation by the combined phenorice and oryza v3 which would also be true for the previous years where official data were not available fluctuations in the total dry season annual production was also evident in the modeled results instead of a slow steady increase that is displayed by the production growth from maff reports maff 2017 2018 potential reasons for this underestimation are addressed in the discussion 3 4 simulating potential future conditions 3 4 1 amount and timing of n application the model estimated that a total optimum n of 150 kg ha 1 was required for ir 5154 to reach its maximum attainable yield regardless of the treatment no apparent yield advantage was observed for any n applied greater than 150 kg ha 1 treatments s 1 and s 2 tend to score higher yield than s 3 in sub optimal n conditions for s 1 and s 2 n was applied two times during the growing period while n was applied three times for s 3 3 4 2 soil organic carbon during our soil sampling the measured soc in the farms varied from 0 3 to 0 8 g kg 1 at 0 15 cm depths which fall in the low fertility category three treatments based on the management practices observed in the sample farms were simulated the treatments were identified as follows low refers to the practices that produced the lowest reported yield medium for the median yield and high for the management that obtained the highest yield during the 2019 dry season survey ir 5154 was the variety used for all the simulations the rate of yield increase with increasing soc fig 8b were the same for all the treatments yield improvement by no more than 0 5 t ha 1 was observed if the current soc is increased by 50 the relatively flatter slope of the line shown by the best farm practice indicated that not much value was added to their yield with increased soc on the other hand decreasing the amount of soc by 50 caused greater impact on yield especially for medium 0 50 0 58 t ha 1 and low managed farms 0 46 0 50 t ha 1 yield could decline in best managed farms by 0 39 t ha 1 and increase of 0 20 t ha 1 with decrease and increase of soc by 50 respectively 3 4 3 temperature increase we simulated how change in temperature in kampong thom farms could affect the harvest yield with varying management practices employing the same treatments used in soc sensitivity analysis the recorded average minimum and maximum daily temperature for these simulations were 23 and 35 c respectively results in fig 8c showed that abrupt declines in harvest yield occurred when temperature increased by more than 2 c medium and low managed farms appeared to have less sensitivity to temperature decline of to up to 5 c yield penalty as temperature rises were more observable in farms under high agronomic management we then verified the possible yield response if the historical temperature was increased by 3 c in kampong thom and battambang fig 9 this hypothetical increase in temperature was based on the predicted in average temperature increase in cambodia by 2060 world bank 2018 it was apparent in fig 9 that yield could decline by up to 4 tons ha 1 especially in late december to january at post dam period in both provinces some dates that were no longer considered favorable for rice production particularly late december to the first quarter of the year same management conditions were applied for both average and increased temperature simulations 4 discussion 4 1 analysis on the changes in cropping patterns remote sensing complemented by crop model based yield estimation fills the critical information gap when area specific historical harvest and production and data are not available applying this method could also provide spatial and temporal perspective on the changes in cropping patterns that would aid land use planners and policymakers in decisions related to resource management and food security in the case of kampong thom expansion in cropping areas at post dam period appeared to have spread both towards and away from the permanent lake fig 4 a and b this implies access to stored irrigation which can be attributed to the gradual release of the flood waters accumulated during the monsoon season in more and newer hydropower dams recent findings by bonnema and hossain 2017 confirm that lower mekong basin tributaries which includes tonle sap have already experienced extended dry season flooding from 2002 through 2015 access to stored irrigation water allows rice farmers more flexibility to decide when to start their cropping this was exemplified by the changes in planting dates detected by phenorice shifting from october during pre dam period to november and december during post dam period fig 3 the decreased correlation between the cultivated rice area and availability of surface water in kampong thom table 4 could indicate that farmers were less pressured in seizing the available floodwater before it drains for the rest of the dry season in contrast if indeed the floodwater subsides sooner at the onset of dry season and the extent of the lake during the wet season has decreased during the post dam period the location of cultivation hotspots in battambang in fig 4 c and d illustrate the early flood recession in the northern part of the lake fig 4 c and d whereby rice growers taking advantage of the available irrigation before it subsides the geographic locations of kampong thom and battambang relative to the tonle sap lake fig 1 demonstrate how rice production in the floodplains are dependent on the accessibility to floodwater for instance kampong thom gets flooded ahead of battambang because of its proximity to the lake river confluence the latter drains water first and the former experiences longer inundation without irrigation planting needs to be done just before flood recedes our results found discernible associations with the availability of surface water table 4 the observed expansion in rice cultivation area table 3 and fig 3 and the spatio temporal movement of rice production fig 4 from a survey conducted by joffre and de silva 2015 from 2003 to 2013 they reported that dry season average irrigated area per household increased from 0 to 0 7 ha in tonle sap lake s agricultural zones joffre and de silva 2015 if water supply is available dry season rice production can be boosted further by reliable irrigation infrastructure de silva et al 2014 helmers 1997 veasna et al 2014 through the support of the australian centre for international agricultural research to cavac 20 new irrigation schemes were built in cambodia between 2010 and 2015 to divert water from rivers making water more available year round aciar 2015 gef 2019 growing export demand adoption of high yielding varieties agricultural mechanization increased use of chemical fertilizers and loan provisions for farmers also contribute to the improved productivity of dry season rice cramb 2020 cramb et al 2020 johnston et al 2013 liese et al 2014 world bank 2015b however these factors were not considered in our analysis nevertheless current efforts from donor bodies to support the development and rehabilitation of irrigation canals and reservoirs adb 2019 aciar 2015 gef 2019 would keep cambodia s momentum in increasing its dry season rice production we recognize that rice locations identified by phenorice were likely underestimated and may require thorough validation from high resolution satellite images and more in situ validation persistent cloud cover and precipitation were common sources of noise and pixel reliability indices were not sufficient to correct this error it was stressed by the proponents of the algorithm busetto et al 2019 that the main focus of phenorice was to estimate crop establishment based on phenological signals and has a known issue of underestimating rice areas a two year total production data 2016 and 2017 for battambang and kampong thom was available from maff and were included in fig 6 but was insufficient as validation data points the official maff reports fig 7 showed that our estimate of rice production areas from phenorice likely underestimated the total rice production in kampong thom despite this limitation the geographical and temporal planting patterns provide approximations of the difference between the rice production trends in the identified dam periods 4 2 analysis on yield and production simulations area estimation by phenorice and yield simulations by oryza v3 generated new information about the effects of various farm management practices soil fertility and increasing temperature to rice production and yield when historical provincial level data was lacking the capability of oryza v3 a process based crop model to describe rice production in kampong thom and battambang provinces was evaluated using actual farm measurements from 2018 and 2019 dry season cropping despite the limited sample points the above ground biomass data from ir 5154 and sen kra ob provided acceptable goodness of fit during the calibration fig 5 table 5 observed and simulated values were generally close to the 1 1 line therefore within allowable limits piñeiro et al 2008 model testing using the ir 5154 variety were generally satisfactory with improved ef and r2 especially for total biomass fig 5 and table 5 we put less priority in obtaining high model accuracy rather we aim to adequately provide yield trends through the crop model s ability to show responses from our variables of interest yield and production simulations were focused on dry season cropping as dams in the mekong river modulate water release downstream haddeland et al 2006 hecht et al 2019 kummu and sarkkula 2008 anticipating irrigation to be more available and opening up more farmlands for rice production historical production calculations were carried out only for kampong thom as our findings show that the effect of hydrology was more evident in this province succeeding yield response simulations were performed using ir 5154 since we were able to calibrate and test this variety in our crop model exploring the different farm management options in fig 8 assessed possible risks for farmers who tend to invest more time and inputs during the dry season cramb et al 2020 farmers can control more variables during the dry season compared to wet season such as the delivery of water and fertilizer application that could result in better yield returns limited nutrient availability is one of the major reasons for low productivity of rice in cambodia kong et al 2020 if reliable irrigation becomes more accessible for dry season cropping farmers have better opportunity to maximize productivity and profitability from investing on chemical fertilizers oryza v3 results illustrated that once the maximum n threshold was reached any additional n amount no longer contributed any considerable increase in yield fig 8a simulations also showed that two time application one during vegetative and one during reproductive stage was more efficient if the total applied n was less than 150 kg ha 1 during our site visits most farmers interviewed in kampong thom reported applying less than this amount of fertilizer appendix c the model illustrated that when soc was reduced by 50 the yield penalty was greater than the potential yield gained if soc was increased by 50 fig 7b thus highlighting the importance of the cyclic replenishment of soil nutrients in the tonle sap floodplains floodplain soil tend to be more fertile after monsoon flood recedes when nutrient rich sediments are brought ashore from the upstream arias et al 2013 natural soil enhancement provided by the flood pulse is not only sustainable but it also benefits the farmers who can t afford commercial fertilizers fertilizer accounts for 21 of wet season and 37 of dry season input cost vuthy 2014 in 2010 the world bank reported that cambodia is heavily reliant on importers for their fertilizer supply substandard and counterfeit products are also an issue because effective inspection procedures are not in place vuthy et al 2014 world bank 2015b this situation puts the farmers on the losing end having to use fertilizer less than the recommended level because of the high price and the risk of benefiting less than what they paid for the farmers we interviewed related about instances when cropping was halted because of unreliable irrigation drier rainy season means lower water reserves which was the case in our 2019 visit results of oryza v3 simulations predicted that increasing the current average temperature by least 2 c was critical and could cause significant yield decline fig 8 the planting window where farmers can obtain the highest attainable yield may also shorten in the future sowing in late december to the first quarter of the year could be prone to higher yield loss fig 9 some farmers we interviewed do two cropping during the dry season their first sowing is in early october followed by second planting in late january to february based on our simulation results warmer future scenario may not be favorable for late dry season production furthermore with 3 c temperature increase in fig 9 the drop in yield is most pronounced in december planting dates which coincided with the increased planting area in the post dam period this could potentially mean that the gains in total rice production through improved access to water may be negated by an increase in temperature during the same period 5 conclusions dry season rice production in the tonle sap floodplains has intensified in recent years following the phenorice method this study showed that most crop establishment activities shifted to november and december areas of rice cultivation increased and rice growing locations became more dispersed these changes coincided with the increase of dam developments in the mekong river as dams control the discharge of water downstream irrigation becomes more accessible this would give farmers more flexibility on the timing of crop establishment and could open more areas for rice cultivation although the ability of phenorice to detect rice areas needs further validation the results of this study provided important observations to streamline the focus of future research studies accuracy in detecting rice area can be improved by using satellite images with higher temporal and or spatial resolution thorough ground truthing is also recommended various simulation scenarios were explored using oryza v3 to predict yield responses to farm management practices soil fertility and increasing temperature testing different n management regimes we determined the optimum n required and the best timing of application to get the attainable yield of the sample rice variety the model also estimated the yield loss increase if the present soil organic carbon concentrations are reduced increased by 50 we identified that an increase by at least 2 c from the current average temperature could lead to drastic yield loss shorten the ideal planting window for sowing and prevent late or second cropping in future warmer dry seasons examining these changes in rice production and drivers of yield are critical in forecasting and decision making related to

9863,rice is one of the most important agricultural commodities throughout the mekong river basin including the tonle sap lake floodplains in cambodia recent increases in hydropower dams along the mekong river have likely altered the surface water hydrology impacting the arable areas and soil qualities for rice production in the tonle sap lowland along with the hydrological impacts the region s rice farming is facing a rapidly changing climate it is critical to understand how the hydrological changes associated with dam development impact the region s rice production in a changing climate the aims of this study were to assess the impacts of recent increases in hydropower dams on the timing and areas of rice cropping in the tonle sap floodplains and to evaluate the effects of changing hydrology rising temperature and adaptive farming practices on rice productivity using a process based rice crop model oryza v3 the effect of dams on arable areas for rice was identified by a remote sensing method based on the phenorice algorithm for the period of 2001 2019 in two rice growing provinces kampong thom and battambang the phenorice method identified an increase in rice growing areas as well as shifts in both timing and location of rice cropping towards the sources of irrigation during the dry season since 2010 the oryza model simulated a substantial yield reduction with an increase of 2 c in air temperature in the region the model predicted that the rice productivity in the region is sensitive to soil organic carbon content which is expected to change with surface water hydrology the model also predicted that region s rice yield can increase by optimizing the timing and amount of n fertilization the findings from this study highlight how hydrology climate and agronomic practices can interact to impact rice production in the lower mekong region and provide insights for effective water management and agronomic practices to attain food security in the region in a changing climate keywords rice production hydrology remote sensing crop modeling climate change cambodia hydropower dams mekong river 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is the staple food in cambodia and rice farming provides livelihood to the majority of the nation s poor population cramb et al 2020 fao 2015 about 85 of the country s croplands is cultivated for rice siek et al 2017 rice production has increased in recent years since the government implemented its policy on the promotion of paddy production and rice export in 2010 royal government of cambodia 2010 cultivated rice area climbed at a rate of 1 7 from 1990 to 2017 cramb 2020 the country s average yield also improved from 2 5 to 3 3 tons ha 1 from 2005 to 2017 maff 2018 the ministry of agriculture reported a total harvested area of 3 2 million ha in 2018 this boost can be attributed to farmers moving from subsistence to commercial farming adoption of modern varieties increased use of fertilizers mechanization and availability of credit cramb et al 2020 johnston et al 2013 world bank 2015a cambodian rice is also gaining recognition in the export market for its high eating quality sopheap et al 2018 despite these developments cambodia s yield and production still lags thailand and vietnam its top rice producing neighbors that also enjoy the irrigation benefits of the rich mekong river ecosystem smith and hornbuckle 2013 usda 2010 world bank 2015a large portions of rice in cambodia are cultivated around the tonle sap floodplains approximately 23 of the floodplains are used for agriculture for which 75 are used for rice production fao 2015 matsui et al 2006 the tonle sap lake is the largest and most important lake in the lower mekong region in south east asia it is often referred as the beating heart of cambodia with its cyclic swelling and shrinking during the annual transition from monsoon to dry season lamberts 2006 tonle sap lake connects to the mekong river through the 110 km tonle sap river eyler and weatherby 2019 as the mekong river brings intense monsoon floods from may to october it carries an abundant mix of organic matter nutrient rich sediments and diverse fish species that are deposited to the tonle sap floodplains eyler and weatherby 2019 at its peak the lake can increase six times larger than its dry season volume depth goes from 1 to 10 m or more of which 70 of the water comes from the mekong river matsui et al 2006 as the floods recede during the dry season the floodplains become a spawning ground for fishes and provide a fertile soil for crop production eyler and weatherby 2019 hortle et al 2004 lamberts 2006 hydrology in the tonle sap floodplains is changing because of the increasing number of dams in the mekong river and tributaries regulating the flood flow downstream pokhrel et al 2018a while dams and hydroelectric power plants are built to address the increasing energy demands the lower mekong they also alter the natural cycle of biota exchange between tonle sap and mekong river sabo et al 2017 stone 2016 currently the connectivity of the floodplains to the river already reduced by 31 eyler and weatherby 2019 previous studies already predicted that lake extent and depth during dry season could increase haddeland et al 2006 kummu and sarkkula 2008 mekong river commission 2010 pokhrel et al 2018b and consequently drive irrigation infrastructure development arias et al 2012 better access to irrigation could influence planting time and open more lands for rice farming however the impact of changing tonle sap hydrology to rice production in terms of area location and timing of cultivation has not yet been examined water availability is a major constraint in dry season rice production in cambodia paddy fields situated farther away from rivers and canals are likely to experience water stress according to a study conducted by veasna et al 2014 however with hydropower dams regulating the flow of stored flood water from the monsoon months water level is expected to rise and reside longer during the dry season arias et al 2012 kummu and sarkkula 2008 mekong river commission 2010 pokhrel et al 2018b several infrastructure projects are currently initiated to allow better access to dependable irrigation adb 2019 aciar 2015 although maff 2018 already reported the increasing dry season rice production area information on the location and timing of the expansion are scarce as climate is changing drought spells are occurring more frequently in cambodia specifically in 2002 2012 2015 and 2016 sithirith 2017 the country s mean temperature has increased at a rate of 0 02 c annually since 1950 thoeun 2015 by 2060 the mean annual temperature is predicted to increase by 2 7 c world bank 2018 dry season monthly average temperature of tonle sap lake is rising by 0 03 c each year from 1988 to 2018 daly et al 2020 comprehensive water management and forecasting in the lower mekong region is critical in making important decisions related to food security for instance with the presence of dams providing guidelines on the amount and timing of discharge will aid in ensuring irrigation demands are met in the rice cropping areas the soil organic matter of the agricultural zone of tonle sap s floodplains is replenished by the rich mix of sediments from the monsoon flood dry season rice benefits from this ecosystem service once the water subsides leaving behind fertile silt deposits eyler and weatherby 2019 in a comprehensive survey conducted by arias et al 2013 they determined positive correlation between organic matter content and duration of inundation as the dams continue to control the magnitude of water and sediment flow beveridge et al 2020 kondolf et al 2014 the nutrient quality carried by the flood pulse during the wet season could diminish this might result in less fertile deposits in the floodplains come dry season making it even more necessary for farmers to apply chemical fertilizers in the absence of long term yield and production data earth observation acquired from satellite images can provide information on how rice production patterns in tonle sap floodplains have changed over the years rice cropping areas can be identified by detecting agronomic flooding during the start of the season and subsequent ground cover changes corresponding to rice phenological stages displayed by the vegetation index such indicators are the basis of the phenorice algorithm boschetti et al 2017 which utilizes hypertemporal optical imagery from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to map rice areas nasa goddard space flight center ocean ecology laboratory 2014a 2014b the method identifies signals of crop establishment and key phases of development of the rice plant effects of climate and agronomic variables that contribute to rice yield and production can be explained using process based crop models boote et al 1996 rosenzweig et al 2014 the oryza v3 rice model bouman et al 2001 li et al 2017 was specifically designed to simulate rice growth and development the model can estimate the effect of climate soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics irrigation and farm management practices to harvest yield at varying rice production environments belder et al 2005 boling et al 2007 radanielson et al 2018 sudhir yadav et al 2011 when actual ground data are not available remote sensing and crop modeling can provide area based historical yield estimates and generate yield forecasts for future scenarios this study examined the changes in the dry season rice production in the tonle sap floodplains coinciding with the surge of hydropower dam developments in the mekong river using remote sensing we analyzed the relationship between cropping patterns and surface water availability through crop simulation modeling we investigated the effects of climate change farm management practices and field abiotic conditions to harvestable rice yield specifically this research sought to accomplish the following objectives 1 to detect the changes in timing and location of cropping before and after the surge of dam developments using the phenorice method and 2 to test and apply the oryza v3 rice model in simulating the effect of changes in hydrology agronomic practices and increasing temperature to rice production and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 spatio temporal changes in crop production based on the study by hecht et al 2019 dam constructions in the lower mekong river dramatically increased from 2010 and beyond fig 1 therefore we designated 2001 2010 as pre dam and 2011 2019 as post dam which in this paper referred to as dam periods there were 37 operational hydropower dams in the mekong river basin in 2010 and this number increased to 64 by 2017 hecht et al 2019 2 1 1 study sites this study focused on kampong thom and battambang two of the major rice producing provinces in cambodia fig 2 in 2017 maff reported that battambang contributed 1 15 million tons 11 0 and kampong thom shared 0 80 million tons 7 9 to the country s total rice production in the same year kampong thom and battambang accounted for 9 81 and 3 74 of the total dry season production area respectively the dry season rice production spans from october to march direct seeding by manual broadcasting is the common sowing practice nesbitt 1997 rice growers in these provinces rely on irrigation systems for water source during the dry season canals and reservoirs distribute the remaining monsoon water in the tonle sap lake to the rice growing areas cramb et al 2020 smith and hornbuckle 2013 kampong thom is in the central part of cambodia close to the confluence that connects the lake to the mekong river exposing it to early and prolonged inundation fig 2 much of its locality lies in the southeastern part of the tonle sap floodplain where 94 of agricultural lands are devoted for rice farming adb 2012 dry season rice is commonly planted in the latter part of the wet season to early dry season which is around september to november cramb et al 2020 ricepedia 2018 battambang is situated in the northwestern part of cambodia and by the northern end of the tonle sap lake fig 2 in the western side of the province is the kamping pouy reservoir providing good water management system for the rice growers within the area nguyen et al 2011 sithirith 2017 it has one of the largest irrigated paddy rice areas in the country siek et al 2017 and the top producer of wet season rice the locations of these two provinces provide perspective on the rice cropping pattern from the start of the monsoon until the flood recedes in the dry season kampong thom experiences early and longer flooding while battambang experiences late inundation and early flood recession 2 1 2 detecting the timing and location of cropping using phenorice the phenorice method identifies rice cropping areas on a per pixel basis by thresholding vegetation indices and derivative curve fitting boschetti et al 2017 this allows the recognition of key phenological stages such as sowing flowering and planting duration it also detects signals of agronomic flooding before and after crop establishment to confirm a rice area the algorithm has been tested over different genetic environmental management and climatic conditions with high detection of accuracy boschetti et al 2017 busetto et al 2019 setiyono et al 2018 phenological indicators are distinguished by using the enhanced vegetation index evi and normalized difference flood index ndfi from the modis terra and aqua mod13q1 and myd13 time series images busetto and ranghetti 2016 nasa goddard space flight center ocean ecology laboratory 2014b 2014a as a rule a pixel is classified as a rice area if a clear and unambiguous flood condition is detected based on the defined ndfi threshold the flood signals should be followed by evi profile consistent with the rice s development stages to discriminate from other flooded habitats boschetti et al 2017 busetto et al 2019 rapid growth during the vegetative stage of the plant is indicated by the increase in evi signal followed by a relatively stationary peak that signifies anthesis and finally the decrease in spectral curve slope that represents senescence and harvest savitzky golay smoothing chen et al 2004 was applied to reduce noise and substitute missing pixels of the evi and ndfi time series the highest minima of the evi spectral curve closest to the detected agronomic flooding is a proxy to crop establishment while the highest maxima correspond to crop heading the modis time series day of year doy product which gives the julian date when the image was acquired aids in identifying the dates when these important signals occur allowing us to estimate crop establishment or planting time usefulness index and pixel reliability indicators were used for quality control especially the inherent error expected for the monsoon season where cloud covers and rain are a common occurrence the complete description of this method is provided by boschetti et al 2017 and implemented as an interactive data language in envi exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado a software for geographical and remote sensing imagery analysis in this study the phenorice workflow see appendix a was coded and executed in the statistical software r r core team 2020 the required parameters were calibrated by applying phenorice to the 17 farms visited in kampong thom and battambang length of vegetative stage and planting durations were based on the commonly used rice varieties on these sites medium duration 100 110 days varieties were assumed for dry season planting flooded conditions which suggest land preparation and crop establishment have a minimum threshold ndvi value of 0 earth observation images from modis terra and aqua have 250 m spatial resolution and 8 day combined nominal temporal resolution these products have been widely used for modeling terrestrial ecosystems to detect long term land use and cover changes time series evi huete et al 1994 ndfi boschetti et al 2014 doy usefulness index and pixel reliability quality indicators were the specific products used as input for phenorice they were preprocessed and extracted using the modistsp package busetto and ranghetti 2016 in r annual land cover maps downloaded from servir mekong https rlcms servir adpc net en landcover were used to pre classify rice areas before implementing phenorice crop establishment dates estimated by phenorice from 2001 to 2019 were recorded with the corresponding pixel count and location the planting dates were used as input in oryza v3 to estimate the total rice production tons ha 1 the total area for a given crop establishment date were calculated for each dam period the time series moving average was obtained with 8 day rolling window accounting for the temporal resolution of the modis images we plotted the geo coordinates of the pixels and created a density map to spatially illustrate the locations and clustering of farm areas 2 1 3 estimating changes in flooding extent using ndfi the changes in dry season hydrology in the tonle sap lake were estimated through remote sensing where water areas were detected using ndfi signals a fixed area extent to delineate kampong thom and battambang was designated for each analyzed image from 2001 to 2019 an area is flooded if the pixel has a minimum value of 0 boschetti et al 2017 the percentage of flood pixels for a given extent and associated doy were obtained the moving average of percent flooding during pre dam and post dam were calculated with an 8 day rolling window based on the temporal resolution of ndfi and doy images the relationship between the extent of flooding with the timing and area of cropping were evaluated using pair wise comparison and pearson correlation respectively note that ndfi only detects surface water thus that depth of flooding was not considered in the analysis 2 2 oryza v3 model calibration and testing all the production and yield estimations in this study were executed using the oryza v3 rice model li et al 2017 formerly known as oryza2000 bouman et al 2001 developed at the international rice research institute irri this recently updated version has an expanded ability to model lowland upland and flooded rice ecosystems it mechanistically simulates growth and development of rice through its photosynthesis respiration and water nitrogen balance modules its capability to model weather agronomic management conditions and abiotic constraints has been calibrated and validated for 18 popular rice varieties in various locations throughout asia belder et al 2005 boling et al 2007 li et al 2015 radanielson et al 2018 sudhir yadav et al 2011 the model update features the soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics module that quantify the changes in the soil organic carbon and nitrogen content the soil temperature module was also added which accounts for the daily temperature from the soil surface to the lower layers the detailed formulations behind these modules can be found in li et al 2017 to test the ability of the crop model to simulate farm conditions within our specific study region we calibrated and tested oryza v3 using field measurements and information gathered from farmer s interviews during the dry season of 2018 and 2019 there were two rice varieties commonly planted in our sample farms one is sen kra ob with short to medium planting duration aromatic and commonly grown for the export market the other variety was ir 5154 which has a longer growth duration and cultivated in both dry and wet seasons these two varieties were calibrated using the measured total dry biomass and phenological information to determine their specific leaf area and partitioning factors appendix b the values were calculated using the auto calibration tool in the oryza v3 model package all the other crop parameters were taken from the default crop values of the model which are based on the robustly parameterized ir 72 rice variety model testing was conducted by comparing the measured total dry biomass stem and leaf measurements in the vegetative stage of the 2019 dry season to the simulated values associated r2 root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and model efficiency ef were duly noted to determine the predictive accuracy of the simulation outputs the following formula were used to calculate rmse rrmse and ef 1 rmse 1 n y i y i 2 n 2 rrmse rmse y 100 3 e f 1 1 n y i y i 2 1 n y i y 2 observed values are designated by y i and simulated values by y i the total number of samples is given by n and y is the mean of observed values 2 2 1 farm surveys and interview with growers we conducted interviews with local growers to collect baseline data for model calibration and testing sowing date irrigation depth amount and timing of fertilizer application and growth stage information of the planted variety were noted sizes of the farms included in the study ranged from 0 2 to 3 0 ha we visited 12 farms in krong stueng saen village in kampong thom near the stung sen river a tributary of tonle sap lake the sample farms were selected such that their spread represent the elevation gradient and distance from the lake during our interviews we gathered that irrigation is managed by a local farmers cooperative under the cambodia agricultural value chain cavac program although these farms are located no more than 10 kilometers apart their crop establishments varied according to their proximity to irrigation sources farms located farther away from the river tend to sow early to utilize the receding monsoon flood in battambang we collected data from five farms located in banan district their irrigation is controlled by the local government through the provincial department of water resources and meteorology as verified during our interviews thus their sowing times could vary from two weeks to one month it was an unusually dry year in cambodia in 2019 for instance kampong thom farmers had to plant early to take advantage of the subsiding lake water from the dry monsoon season most of the rice farmers in battambang suspended sowing because there was no available irrigation we were informed during the farm visit that the local government decided to reserve the water supply for the anticipated drought for the rest of the dry season in 2019 the farms we visited in kampong thom appeared to have greater flexibility and capacity to make decisions related to irrigation management compared to the battambang sites who are reliant on the local government for the release of water to the canals 2 2 2 plant biomass measurements weight of total biomass and planting density were taken at reproductive stage in ds 2018 january to february 2019 samples were taken from three replicates of 0 5 0 5 m quadrat spread out to represent each farmer s plot total number of tillers per quadrat were noted and 20 subsamples were oven dried at 75 c for at least 3 days fresh and dry weight of the 20 subsampled tillers were measured during the vegetative stage in ds 2019 december 2019 weight of partitioned biomass and planting density were measured weeds were observed to be a common problem in the paddies occupying up to 20 of the cropping area based on visual estimation in the farms visited 2 2 3 soil measurements soil measurements were taken by core boring at 0 15 cm depths soil texture was determined by hydrometer method adapted from huluka and miller 2014 total n was analyzed by kjeldahl digestion method greweling and peech 1960 jackson 1959 total soil organic carbon was measured following ghani et al 2003 bulk density was determined from soil sampled at 5 cm depth using a metal tube with 5 cm diameter costantini 1995 soil texture total n soil organic matter content and bulk density measurements were used as input data for crop model simulations all plant and soil samples were processed at the soil science laboratory of the royal university of agriculture in phnom penh cambodia other required parameters such as the different volumetric water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated following the derivation formulated by saxton and rawls 2006 to provide the 100 cm depth soil information required by the crop model soil texture soil organic carbon and bulk density from 15 to 100 cm depth were obtained from soilgridstm https soilgrids org this online resource is provided by the world soil information also known as the international soil reference and information centre generated from global compilation of soil profile data and environmental layers through machine learning methods at 250 m2 resolution other input data required by oryza v3 such as volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity were derived based on saxton and rawls 2006 from the soil texture information provided by soilgridstm 2 2 4 climate data climate data for model calibration and farm specific dry season simulations in 2018 and 2019 were provided by the weather stations from cambodia s center of excellence on sustainable agricultural intensification and nutrition cesain since historical weather data from 2001 to 2018 were unavailable for battambang and kampong thom we obtained the temperature solar radiation vapor pressure and wind speed data from the national centers for environmental prediction global forecast system ncep gfs rainfall data from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42v7 were resampled to 0 1 degree 10 km spatial resolution the estimated climate data from gfs and trmm were used for seasonal yield simulations performed from 2001 to 2018 2 3 scenario simulations oryza v3 simulates rice growth at daily time step requiring crop soil field management and weather input data crop data includes the genetic characteristics of the variety used such as phenology development rates assimilate partitioning behavior among others soil input information includes soil texture chemical composition and water content agronomic management inputs required are crop establishment method timing density of planting and timing amount of applied irrigation and nitrogen n daily weather data includes temperature solar radiation vapor pressure wind speed and rainfall we used the model to estimate the final yield based on the planting date we obtained from phenorice as well as to simulate yield responses due to changes in temperature n application and soil nutrient deposits in the form of organic carbon 2 3 1 estimating past production and yield we calculated the attainable yield for each sowing date from 2001 to 2018 to capture the changes and effects of climate conditions to the total in this context attainable yield is the highest possible yield that the model can predict from the given inputs and abiotic conditions sadras et al 2015 same management inputs were employed through all the simulations which were based on the agronomic practices of the visited farms in kampong thom with median harvest yield essentially the only varying factors were the historical daily weather information obtained from ncep gfs and trmm 3b42v7 using the total rice area per planting date from phenorice and yield from calibrated ir 5154 variety we estimated the mean daily total production for pre dam and post dam periods 2 3 2 predicting yield response to changes in temperature nitrogen applications and residual soil organic carbon upon determining the level of confidence of oryza v3 to simulate the actual field conditions in our farm samples we performed sensitivity analysis by designing a range of treatments to model yield response all simulations were executed using field conditions and farmer s practices gathered from the kampong thom farms during the 2019 dry season appendix c 2 3 2 1 temperature effects in 2015 cambodia recorded a maximum annual temperature of 38 c thoeun 2015 furthermore the world health organization who predicted that cambodia s yearly average could increase from 1 6 to 2 0 c by 2100 who 2016 given these conditions we estimated the effect of supra optimal temperatures on the harvest yield of the sample farms in kampong thom farms we simulated changes of 5 to 5 c from the daily temperatures recorded by cesain weather station in addition a long term simulation experiment was performed to explore the rice yield sensitivity to temperature increases and whether this increase would affect the ideal planting times in the future climate this simulation experiment was done by adding 3 c to the base air temperatures in the weather data for the period of 2001 2018 the temperatures used in these simulations were meant to capture extreme temperature changes higher than the predicted by who 2 3 2 2 nitrogen application effects we performed n simulations with three application schedules based on our farm interviews appendix c with total n applied ranging from 30 to 200 kg ha 1 per season in the first simulation s 1 n was applied at two different developmental stages 1 during early tillering and 2 panicle initiation in the second simulation s 2 n was also applied twice 1 during late tillering and 2 booting and lastly s 3 simulated three n applications 1 during early tillering 2 late tillering and 3 panicle initiation 2 3 2 3 residual soil organic carbon in anticipation of the decline of sediment quality in the tonle sap floodplains we estimated the possible effects of the changing soil organic carbon soc content to the harvest yield referencing the onsite soc measured during the start of dry season in 2018 we estimated the final yield if soc is decreased by up to 50 or increased to up to 50 using the calibrated ir 5154 variety 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis the modis time series satellite data from 2001 to 2020 were extracted from the national aeronautics and space administration archive nasa goddard space flight center ocean ecology laboratory 2014b 2014a and pre processed in r language r core team 2020 using the modistsp package busetto and ranghetti 2016 the phenorice algorithm was written and implemented in r with the aid of gis and remote sensing packages such as rgdal bivand et al 2021 raster hijmans and van etten 2012 rgeos bivand et al 2021 and sf pebesma 2018 further data processing and statistical analyses such as student t test correlation anova and savitzky golay smoothing were undertaken using tidyverse wickham et al 2019 hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2020 prospectr stevens and ramirez lopez 2020 and base r core team 2020 packages in r table 1 3 results 3 1 lake water extent in relation to location and timing of rice production the almost two fold increase in hydropower dams in the lower mekong river since 2010 coincided with apparent shift in timing and location of rice cultivation to later in the year especially for kampong thom province to graphically illustrate the influence of the floodwater availability to the crop establishment distribution in the dry season production october to january we overlaid the rolling average of the surface water detected in the tonle sap lake with the average percent of rice area planted fig 3 area in blue we performed simple pair wise comparison on the seasonal and monthly flood extent between pre and post dam periods the percent water area detected in the designated map extent per province during the two dam periods were compared table 2 based on student t test there was no significant difference between the seasonal area of flooding of the two dam periods in both battambang and kampong thom table 2 however monthly flood variability showed statistical increase in surface water at post dam period specifically in the months of november and january for both in kampong thom and battambang floodplains table 2 examining the cultivated rice areas detected by phenorice there was an apparent shift in crop establishment schedule as shown by the difference in plot areas in fig 3 area in green and yellow pairwise comparison between pre dam and post dam periods showed significance difference on the estimated monthly total rice area table 3 increase in rice cultivation during post dam period was more evident in kampong thom specifically from november to december previously at pre dam sowing falls on early october the onset of the dry season in the case of battambang province the results of a two tailed student t test in table 3 did not show statistical significance in the seasonal rice areas between pre dam and post dam however extended crop establishment was observed in november to december during post dam period phenorice allowed us to examine the spatial distribution of rice farms in the tonle sap floodplains illustrated by the density maps of the different planting seasons in fig 4 the heat map of kampong thom showed that farms were more clustered during pre dam and became sparsely distributed during post dam and fig 4 a and b in battambang province the locations and area distribution were generally similar for both pre and post dam fig 3 c and d cropping was relatively denser during pre dam on the northwest side where kamping pouy reservoir is situated however an apparent decrease in hotspot density can be observed during the post dam period concentration near the reservoir declined while cultivations seemed to shift towards the direction of the lake to establish the relationship between the area of inundation and area of rice cultivation a simple correlation was performed between the seasonal flooding detected and total seasonal rice area table 4 the seasonal flooding was the mean of the surface water detected by ndfi each year for the entire dry season while the total seasonal rice area is the mean of the annual sum of dry season rice areas estimated by phenorice in kampong thom there was a strong correlation between the extent of flooding and rice area planted 0 81 at pre dam however this correlation decreased at post dam 0 49 as shown in table 4 as the correlation decreased significant increase in cultivation table 3 and fairly spread out distribution of planting locations along the floodplains fig 4 a and b were observed at post dam in kampong thom conversely in battambang the correlation between flooding extent and planting area remained high and increased slightly at post dam 0 71 0 74 as the extent of the lake increased in november and december at post dam table 2 so did the area of rice cultivation table 3 there was no considerable change in the location of planting in battambang but subtle movement of high density areas towards the location of the lake was evident in fig 4 c and d 3 2 results of crop model calibration and testing total dry biomass of ir 5154 and sen kra ob sampled in 2018 were used for model calibration total and partitioned biomass sampled in kampong thom in 2029 were used for model testing only ir 5154 variety was used for model testing because inadequate data for sen kra ob results are shown in the 1 1 plot in fig 5 to visually inspect the differences between the modeled and actual measurements the corresponding values of the goodness of fit parameters are listed in table 5 the calculated modeling efficiency ef for model calibration was 0 49 and 0 64 for ir 5154 and sen kra ob respectively a model is considered acceptable if threshold values are 0 5 ef moriasi et al 2007 other parameters such as rmse rrmse and r2 were used to verify the ability of the model to predict biomass and yield from actual farm conditions table 5 the total biomass during the more advanced stage of development were underestimated but overall model testing showed acceptable ef and r2 partitioned green leaves and stem gave ef values of 0 56 and 0 35 respectively 3 3 modeling production from historical climate conditions combining remote sensing and crop modeling we observed considerable increase in total rice production during the post dam period in kampong thom province this can be expected since rice areas noticeably increased based on the results of phenorice method fig 6 crop establishments at pre dam period were concentrated in october with relatively less production activities for the rest of the dry season noticeable shift in planting time is observed during post dam particularly in the months of november to december yields trends in pre and post dam periods follow the same pattern as represented by solid continuous line in fig 6 the dry season attainable yield of ir 5154 the variety used in the simulation fluctuated between 6 5 and 7 0 tons ha 1 the seasonal variability was primarily driven by the climatic conditions during the plant s growth and development note that for these simulations historical weather data were used and same farm management inputs were assumed regardless of the planting date the annual total production for the sample provinces were estimated and presented in the bar graph in fig 7 the only available official data gathered from maff for the two sample provinces was for 2016 and 2017 represented by the points in the graph this very low number of data points were inadequate to substantially validate the 17 year production data estimated by the model from these two production data points there was noticeable underestimation by the combined phenorice and oryza v3 which would also be true for the previous years where official data were not available fluctuations in the total dry season annual production was also evident in the modeled results instead of a slow steady increase that is displayed by the production growth from maff reports maff 2017 2018 potential reasons for this underestimation are addressed in the discussion 3 4 simulating potential future conditions 3 4 1 amount and timing of n application the model estimated that a total optimum n of 150 kg ha 1 was required for ir 5154 to reach its maximum attainable yield regardless of the treatment no apparent yield advantage was observed for any n applied greater than 150 kg ha 1 treatments s 1 and s 2 tend to score higher yield than s 3 in sub optimal n conditions for s 1 and s 2 n was applied two times during the growing period while n was applied three times for s 3 3 4 2 soil organic carbon during our soil sampling the measured soc in the farms varied from 0 3 to 0 8 g kg 1 at 0 15 cm depths which fall in the low fertility category three treatments based on the management practices observed in the sample farms were simulated the treatments were identified as follows low refers to the practices that produced the lowest reported yield medium for the median yield and high for the management that obtained the highest yield during the 2019 dry season survey ir 5154 was the variety used for all the simulations the rate of yield increase with increasing soc fig 8b were the same for all the treatments yield improvement by no more than 0 5 t ha 1 was observed if the current soc is increased by 50 the relatively flatter slope of the line shown by the best farm practice indicated that not much value was added to their yield with increased soc on the other hand decreasing the amount of soc by 50 caused greater impact on yield especially for medium 0 50 0 58 t ha 1 and low managed farms 0 46 0 50 t ha 1 yield could decline in best managed farms by 0 39 t ha 1 and increase of 0 20 t ha 1 with decrease and increase of soc by 50 respectively 3 4 3 temperature increase we simulated how change in temperature in kampong thom farms could affect the harvest yield with varying management practices employing the same treatments used in soc sensitivity analysis the recorded average minimum and maximum daily temperature for these simulations were 23 and 35 c respectively results in fig 8c showed that abrupt declines in harvest yield occurred when temperature increased by more than 2 c medium and low managed farms appeared to have less sensitivity to temperature decline of to up to 5 c yield penalty as temperature rises were more observable in farms under high agronomic management we then verified the possible yield response if the historical temperature was increased by 3 c in kampong thom and battambang fig 9 this hypothetical increase in temperature was based on the predicted in average temperature increase in cambodia by 2060 world bank 2018 it was apparent in fig 9 that yield could decline by up to 4 tons ha 1 especially in late december to january at post dam period in both provinces some dates that were no longer considered favorable for rice production particularly late december to the first quarter of the year same management conditions were applied for both average and increased temperature simulations 4 discussion 4 1 analysis on the changes in cropping patterns remote sensing complemented by crop model based yield estimation fills the critical information gap when area specific historical harvest and production and data are not available applying this method could also provide spatial and temporal perspective on the changes in cropping patterns that would aid land use planners and policymakers in decisions related to resource management and food security in the case of kampong thom expansion in cropping areas at post dam period appeared to have spread both towards and away from the permanent lake fig 4 a and b this implies access to stored irrigation which can be attributed to the gradual release of the flood waters accumulated during the monsoon season in more and newer hydropower dams recent findings by bonnema and hossain 2017 confirm that lower mekong basin tributaries which includes tonle sap have already experienced extended dry season flooding from 2002 through 2015 access to stored irrigation water allows rice farmers more flexibility to decide when to start their cropping this was exemplified by the changes in planting dates detected by phenorice shifting from october during pre dam period to november and december during post dam period fig 3 the decreased correlation between the cultivated rice area and availability of surface water in kampong thom table 4 could indicate that farmers were less pressured in seizing the available floodwater before it drains for the rest of the dry season in contrast if indeed the floodwater subsides sooner at the onset of dry season and the extent of the lake during the wet season has decreased during the post dam period the location of cultivation hotspots in battambang in fig 4 c and d illustrate the early flood recession in the northern part of the lake fig 4 c and d whereby rice growers taking advantage of the available irrigation before it subsides the geographic locations of kampong thom and battambang relative to the tonle sap lake fig 1 demonstrate how rice production in the floodplains are dependent on the accessibility to floodwater for instance kampong thom gets flooded ahead of battambang because of its proximity to the lake river confluence the latter drains water first and the former experiences longer inundation without irrigation planting needs to be done just before flood recedes our results found discernible associations with the availability of surface water table 4 the observed expansion in rice cultivation area table 3 and fig 3 and the spatio temporal movement of rice production fig 4 from a survey conducted by joffre and de silva 2015 from 2003 to 2013 they reported that dry season average irrigated area per household increased from 0 to 0 7 ha in tonle sap lake s agricultural zones joffre and de silva 2015 if water supply is available dry season rice production can be boosted further by reliable irrigation infrastructure de silva et al 2014 helmers 1997 veasna et al 2014 through the support of the australian centre for international agricultural research to cavac 20 new irrigation schemes were built in cambodia between 2010 and 2015 to divert water from rivers making water more available year round aciar 2015 gef 2019 growing export demand adoption of high yielding varieties agricultural mechanization increased use of chemical fertilizers and loan provisions for farmers also contribute to the improved productivity of dry season rice cramb 2020 cramb et al 2020 johnston et al 2013 liese et al 2014 world bank 2015b however these factors were not considered in our analysis nevertheless current efforts from donor bodies to support the development and rehabilitation of irrigation canals and reservoirs adb 2019 aciar 2015 gef 2019 would keep cambodia s momentum in increasing its dry season rice production we recognize that rice locations identified by phenorice were likely underestimated and may require thorough validation from high resolution satellite images and more in situ validation persistent cloud cover and precipitation were common sources of noise and pixel reliability indices were not sufficient to correct this error it was stressed by the proponents of the algorithm busetto et al 2019 that the main focus of phenorice was to estimate crop establishment based on phenological signals and has a known issue of underestimating rice areas a two year total production data 2016 and 2017 for battambang and kampong thom was available from maff and were included in fig 6 but was insufficient as validation data points the official maff reports fig 7 showed that our estimate of rice production areas from phenorice likely underestimated the total rice production in kampong thom despite this limitation the geographical and temporal planting patterns provide approximations of the difference between the rice production trends in the identified dam periods 4 2 analysis on yield and production simulations area estimation by phenorice and yield simulations by oryza v3 generated new information about the effects of various farm management practices soil fertility and increasing temperature to rice production and yield when historical provincial level data was lacking the capability of oryza v3 a process based crop model to describe rice production in kampong thom and battambang provinces was evaluated using actual farm measurements from 2018 and 2019 dry season cropping despite the limited sample points the above ground biomass data from ir 5154 and sen kra ob provided acceptable goodness of fit during the calibration fig 5 table 5 observed and simulated values were generally close to the 1 1 line therefore within allowable limits piñeiro et al 2008 model testing using the ir 5154 variety were generally satisfactory with improved ef and r2 especially for total biomass fig 5 and table 5 we put less priority in obtaining high model accuracy rather we aim to adequately provide yield trends through the crop model s ability to show responses from our variables of interest yield and production simulations were focused on dry season cropping as dams in the mekong river modulate water release downstream haddeland et al 2006 hecht et al 2019 kummu and sarkkula 2008 anticipating irrigation to be more available and opening up more farmlands for rice production historical production calculations were carried out only for kampong thom as our findings show that the effect of hydrology was more evident in this province succeeding yield response simulations were performed using ir 5154 since we were able to calibrate and test this variety in our crop model exploring the different farm management options in fig 8 assessed possible risks for farmers who tend to invest more time and inputs during the dry season cramb et al 2020 farmers can control more variables during the dry season compared to wet season such as the delivery of water and fertilizer application that could result in better yield returns limited nutrient availability is one of the major reasons for low productivity of rice in cambodia kong et al 2020 if reliable irrigation becomes more accessible for dry season cropping farmers have better opportunity to maximize productivity and profitability from investing on chemical fertilizers oryza v3 results illustrated that once the maximum n threshold was reached any additional n amount no longer contributed any considerable increase in yield fig 8a simulations also showed that two time application one during vegetative and one during reproductive stage was more efficient if the total applied n was less than 150 kg ha 1 during our site visits most farmers interviewed in kampong thom reported applying less than this amount of fertilizer appendix c the model illustrated that when soc was reduced by 50 the yield penalty was greater than the potential yield gained if soc was increased by 50 fig 7b thus highlighting the importance of the cyclic replenishment of soil nutrients in the tonle sap floodplains floodplain soil tend to be more fertile after monsoon flood recedes when nutrient rich sediments are brought ashore from the upstream arias et al 2013 natural soil enhancement provided by the flood pulse is not only sustainable but it also benefits the farmers who can t afford commercial fertilizers fertilizer accounts for 21 of wet season and 37 of dry season input cost vuthy 2014 in 2010 the world bank reported that cambodia is heavily reliant on importers for their fertilizer supply substandard and counterfeit products are also an issue because effective inspection procedures are not in place vuthy et al 2014 world bank 2015b this situation puts the farmers on the losing end having to use fertilizer less than the recommended level because of the high price and the risk of benefiting less than what they paid for the farmers we interviewed related about instances when cropping was halted because of unreliable irrigation drier rainy season means lower water reserves which was the case in our 2019 visit results of oryza v3 simulations predicted that increasing the current average temperature by least 2 c was critical and could cause significant yield decline fig 8 the planting window where farmers can obtain the highest attainable yield may also shorten in the future sowing in late december to the first quarter of the year could be prone to higher yield loss fig 9 some farmers we interviewed do two cropping during the dry season their first sowing is in early october followed by second planting in late january to february based on our simulation results warmer future scenario may not be favorable for late dry season production furthermore with 3 c temperature increase in fig 9 the drop in yield is most pronounced in december planting dates which coincided with the increased planting area in the post dam period this could potentially mean that the gains in total rice production through improved access to water may be negated by an increase in temperature during the same period 5 conclusions dry season rice production in the tonle sap floodplains has intensified in recent years following the phenorice method this study showed that most crop establishment activities shifted to november and december areas of rice cultivation increased and rice growing locations became more dispersed these changes coincided with the increase of dam developments in the mekong river as dams control the discharge of water downstream irrigation becomes more accessible this would give farmers more flexibility on the timing of crop establishment and could open more areas for rice cultivation although the ability of phenorice to detect rice areas needs further validation the results of this study provided important observations to streamline the focus of future research studies accuracy in detecting rice area can be improved by using satellite images with higher temporal and or spatial resolution thorough ground truthing is also recommended various simulation scenarios were explored using oryza v3 to predict yield responses to farm management practices soil fertility and increasing temperature testing different n management regimes we determined the optimum n required and the best timing of application to get the attainable yield of the sample rice variety the model also estimated the yield loss increase if the present soil organic carbon concentrations are reduced increased by 50 we identified that an increase by at least 2 c from the current average temperature could lead to drastic yield loss shorten the ideal planting window for sowing and prevent late or second cropping in future warmer dry seasons examining these changes in rice production and drivers of yield are critical in forecasting and decision making related to food security and water resource management in the lower mekong region providing insights on when and where to cultivate rice would provide information to policymakers to set guidelines that will be

9864,the objective of this study was to quantify the losses of water sediments and phosphorus p fractions by surface runoff as a function of terrain slope and p rates applied in two soils with contrasting textures six field trials installed in 2015 were evaluated in 2018 and 2019 in a nitisol and in a cambisol with 642 and 225 g kg 1 of clay averages of 0 55 110 and 220 kg ha 1 year 1 of p were applied superficially corresponding to 0 32 5 65 130 m³ ha 1 year 1 of pig slurry pig slurry was applied under three terrain slopes at each site 10 20 and 30 in the nitisol and 15 25 and 35 in the cambisol after natural rainfall events the drained solution was collected and the flow volume amount of sediments and fractions of dissolved reactive p drp particulate p pp and total p tp lost by surface runoff were determined at the beginning of 2019 soil samples were collected in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers and the mehlich 1 extractable p was determined increase in terrain slope substantially increased the losses of water sediments and p considering the highest slope of each site the losses of water sediments and tp in the nitisol were 35 3 13 5 and 21 8 times higher than in the cambisol mehlich 1 extractable p in the nitisol was 1 7 times higher than that observed in the cambisol drp represented about 73 of the total p lost but the participation of pp increased with the increase in slope it was concluded that the nitisol undergoes higher losses of water sediments and p by surface runoff compared to the cambisol much due to the higher rainfall volume rate of transported material lower water infiltration in the soil profile and accumulation of p in the surface layer of the soil graphical abstract ga1 keywords pig manure clay soils phosphorus fraction eutrophication 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for plant development and is often applied as fertilizer in agriculture however its transfer from agricultural areas to aquatic environments has high pollutant potential sharpley 2016 zhang et al 2016 especial attention to the p management is given to places as the state of santa catarina in the southern region of brazil the largest pork producer in the country abpa 2019 this production is characterized by being in a confined system generating a large amount of waste mainly in the liquid slurry form in addition the pig production in santa catarina is concentrated in small farms in general smaller than 10 ha cepa 2018 with steep relief martini 2012 this practice culminates in successive applications of pig slurry to fields with high potential for p losses by surface runoff the continuous and excessive application of pig slurry can exceed the p requirement by plants and thus accumulate in several fractions especially those of greater lability gatiboni et al 2008 such accumulation occurs mainly on the top soil layer where the slurry is applied reducing the adsorption potential of p within soil particles in this layer due to p saturation barrow 2015 thus inadequate management of this nutrient for supply in nutrients to field crops disregarding technical criteria may exceed soil retention capacity and intensify environmental problems due to the transfer of p to aquatic environments sharpley 2016 soil characteristics influence the applied p dynamics loam soils that have lower p sorption capacity are prone to greater losses especially by leaching guardini et al 2012 lourenzi et al 2014 on the other hand clay soils have higher adsorption capacity and accumulation on surface layers which in association with lower infiltration rate increases the risk of losses due to surface runoff boitt et al 2018 gérard 2016 mazaheri and mahmoodabadi 2012 moreover soil slopes influence the transport of the p within the water and sediments amorim et al 2010 this factor implies in innumerous hydrologic process as superficial retention of water infiltration rate runoff velocity and energy morbidelli et al 2018 besides that the slope is also related to the thickness of soil that interacts within runoff sharpley 1985 thus terrain slope associated with the application of pig slurry or any other phosphate fertilizer applied to the soil surface can increases the losses of p by surface runoff fang et al 2015 intensify water and sediment losses wu et al 2018 and consequently greater amounts of p adhered to sediments are also lost liu et al 2015 therefore would be important to add the terrain slope as an aggravating factor of p losses to empirical models for predicting losses and risk of environmental contamination however there is little data available dall orsoletta et al 2021 the increase in p rates and land slopes can increase p losses from agricultural areas to contiguous environments although these effects are widely reported in the literature few studies have been dedicated to quantifying this increase under field conditions limiting the approaches applied to p management to qualitative measures thus the quantification of p losses in agricultural areas under field conditions that present textural and climatic contrast is necessary for precise measures adoption to mitigate these losses the main hypothesis of this study is that soils with high clay content have higher p losses than loam soils which are intensified in steeper terrain thus the objectives of the study were i to quantify and evaluate losses of water p fractions and sediments by surface runoff ii to quantify the effects of terrain slope and average annual phosphorus rate on losses by surface runoff in two soils with contrasting texture 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area description in 2015 six field trials were installed in the state of santa catarina southern brazil in two regions with high concentration of pigs and impacted by the application of pig slurry fig 1 trials were installed in campos novos 27 22 16 s and 51 12 32 w with a cfb climate and rio do sul 27 11 20 s and 49 39 25 w with a cfa climate peel et al 2007 in areas that were not being cultivated the soils in the two sites are classified as nitisol and cambisol respectively wrb fao 2015 prior to the installation soil was collected in the 0 20 cm layer in both sites the nitisol had the following characteristics sand 120 g kg 1 silt 346 g kg 1 clay 642 g kg 1 organic matter om 30 g kg 1 ph h2o 1 1 6 3 mehlich 1p 6 4 mg dm 3 the cambisol had the following characteristics sand 334 g kg 1 silt 441 g kg 1 clay 225 g kg 1 om 22 g kg 1 ph h2o 1 1 5 5 mehlich 1p 3 3 mg dm 3 additionally the theoretical maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity p max was estimated in both sites by the langmuir isotherms equation p max was equal to 2317 2 and 2275 3 mg kg 1 in the layers of 0 10 and 10 20 cm in the nitisol and to 969 4 and 985 3 mg kg 1 in the layers of 0 10 and 10 20 cm in the cambisol further details can be seen in dall orsoletta et al 2021 2 2 treatments and management history there were three trials in each region all with the same design varying only the slope of the terrain where they were installed in campos novos each trial was allocated in a strip of mechanically constructed slopes equal to 10 20 and 30 in rio do sul trials were allocated in a strip of slope existing in the terrain being 15 25 and 35 the experimental units with 4 25 m2 of total area were delimited with 20 cm high galvanized sheet metal buried 10 cm into the soil fig s1 the lower end of each plot has a funnel that directs runoff water to a bs3 sample collectors grando et al 2021 the experimental units were cultivated with the perennial grass tifton 85 cynodon dactylon and during the winter period annual ryegrass lolium multiflorum was sown the pasture was periodically mowed at intervals of approximately 30 days in the spring summer period and 60 days in the autumn winter period maintaining a residual of 10 cm for regrowth in each experiment three rates of pig slurry were evaluated in addition to a control treatment without fertilization the applications were carried out between 2016 and 2019 with average rates of 0 55 110 and 220 kg ha 1 year 1 of p table 1 which corresponded to the averages of 0 32 5 65 and 130 m³ ha 1 year 1 of pig slurry the pig slurry used came from an anaerobic biodigester and was applied to the soil surface after cutting the pasture with four annual applications the treatments were distributed within each slope strip in a randomized block design with three replicates which totaled 72 experimental units in both sites the samples were collected after rainfall events that caused surface runoff in january 2019 samples were collected in the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm layers from which p was extracted by mehlich 1 mehlich 1953 and determined according to murphy and riley 1962 thus during the period evaluated between 2018 and 2019 32 collections were performed in the nitisol and 30 collections in the cambisol as well as 11 pasture cuts 8 pig slurry applications and one soil collection both sites were subjected to the same pasture management fertilization and data collection aiming to standardize the effects and data generated during the evaluation period the average annual rainfall observed was 1616 mm in the nitisol and 1311 mm in the cambisol fig s2 2 3 methods of analysis the total runoff volume was quantified in the field by measuring the height of the water level in the collectors whose height volume ratio had been previously calibrated homogenized runoff samples were taken to the laboratory and kept under refrigeration until the determinations were performed concentrations of sediments dissolved reactive p drp and total p tp were determined runoff sediment concentration was determined by colorimetry based on turbidity measurements made in benchtop turbidimeter digimed tb 1000p with readings in ntu in 10 ml aliquots of homogenized samples minella et al 2008 calibration curves with sediments from each site were previously prepared for drp determination a 10 ml aliquot of the homogenized samples was filtered using a cellulose acetate filter with 0 45 µm pore diameter 4500 p apha 2005 for tp a homogenized 10 ml aliquot of the samples without filtration was digested in autoclave at 120 c for 60 min 4500 p apha 2005 p concentrations in drp and tp extracts were determined in a uv visible spectrophotometer at 882 nm uv 1800 shimadzu according to the method described by murphy and riley 1962 additionally the particulate p pp concentration was estimated by the difference between tp and drp values 2 4 statistical analysis the data of runoff sediments and p fractions were subjected to the shapiro wilk normality test and to bartlett s variance homogeneity test the data were transformed by box cox to meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity the data were then subjected to analysis of variance anova to compare the experiments with all treatments equal each slope being an experiment and the rates being the treatments when significant p 0 05 for rate the means were compared by regression and when significant for slope the means were subjected to the lsd test p 0 05 the data when transformed were converted to the original scale for graphical representation the statistical calculations and construction of graphs were performed in the r program version 4 0 0 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 surface runoff and sediment transport of all the precipitated volume 4 75 resulted in surface runoff in the nitisol against only 0 14 in the cambisol data not shown the highest annual rainfall was observed in the nitisol region 19 higher than that quantified in the cambisol region fig s2 in the nitisol there were increments in the runoff volume of 6 0 and 13 7 times for the 20 and 30 slopes when compared to the 10 slope fig 2 a the same behavior was observed for the cambisol with 62 and 227 times more for the 25 and 35 slopes when compared to the 15 slope fig 2 b in general considering the highest slopes surface runoff was about 35 times higher in the nitisol with clay texture than in the cambisol with loam texture the nitisol showed increases of 3 9 and 6 7 times in sediment transport as the 20 and 30 slopes compared to the lowest slope and these losses are highly correlated with surface runoff fig s3 in the cambisol sediment losses were 70 and 173 times higher for the slopes of 25 and 35 compared to the lowest slope in relation to p rates for each kilogram of p added to the nitisol there was an average reduction of about 0 2 kg ha 1 year 1 in the sediments lost this reduction was not observed in the cambisol 3 2 phosphorus in soil and lost fractions the soil p contents extracted by mehlich 1 increased with the increase in the p rate applied to the soil in 2018 with more significant accumulation in the nitisol than in the cambisol the nitisol showed increases of 0 64 and 0 10 mg dm 3 for each kilogram of p added to the soil for the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers respectively fig 4 a with accumulation 6 times higher in the surface layer the cambisol showed increases of 0 44 and 0 04 mg dm 3 for each kilogram of p added to the soil for the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers fig 4 b with accumulation 11 times higher in the surface layer terrain slope affected the p contents in both soils and the highest values were observed in intermediate slopes the 10 20 cm layer of the cambisol was not affected by slope figure f in the sediment the p concentration at the 10 slope was higher than those observed at the 20 and 30 slopes 1 2 and 1 3 times higher respectively in nitisol also in the nitisol each additional kilogram of p applied represented an increase of 0 01 mg dm 3 in the concentration of tp in the runoff water fig 5 a and c it is worth pointing out that regarding slope the mean concentration of p in the runoff water of the cambisol was 2 60 mg dm 3 that is 1 3 times higher than that observed at the 10 slope in the nitisol fig 5 b and d the average losses of tp at the slopes of 20 and 30 represented increments of 5 0 and 13 5 times compared to the lowest slope of the nitisol reaching at the highest slope the average of 1856 g ha 1 year 1 of tp lost fig 6 a and c in the cambisol there were increments of 58 and 161 times for the slopes of 25 and 35 in comparison to the lowest slope with the average of 85 2 g ha 1 year 1 of tp lost at the highest slope fig 6 b in the treatment where p is not applied the nitisol loses approximately 14 times more than the average losses in the cambisol considering the highest slope the nitisol lost 22 times more tp than the cambisol each kilogram of p applied annually in the nitisol represents increments of approximately 5 g ha 1 year 1 in the tp lost the highest p rate resulted in the transfer of 1806 g ha 1 year 1 in the nitisol a value very close to the losses observed at the highest slope in this same soil comparing the highest slopes of each site the nitisol lost about 21 times more drp than the cambisol the average drp losses in the nitisol increased 4 7 and 8 6 times when considering the slopes of 20 and 30 compared to the lowest slope reaching at the highest slope the average of 1159 g ha 1 year 1 of drp lost the drp showed linear losses with the increase in p rate in the nitisol in the control treatment the losses were approximately 11 times higher compared to the mean 30 g ha 1 year 1 of drp lost in the cambisol fig 7 for each 10 increase in slope in both soils there was an increase in pp losses fig 8 with no influence of the applied p rate however again the losses occurred in greater quantity in the soil with higher clay content it is the nitisol with increments in average losses of 5 3 and 13 5 times at the 20 and 30 slopes compared to the lowest slope reaching at the highest slope the average of 548 3 g ha 1 year 1 of pp lost in the cambisol there were increments of 98 and 307 times at the 25 and 35 slopes in comparison to the lowest slope with 27 6 g ha 1 year 1 of pp lost at the highest slope regardless of soil and slope the drp represented about 73 of the total p losses fig 9 a and b with the increase in slope however there was an increase in the participation of pp lost in the nitisol totaling 23 25 and 32 at the slopes of 10 20 and 30 respectively for the cambisol there was no association between slope and the pp partition with an average of 27 of p lost in this fraction with the increase in the p rate applied to the soil there was a reduction in the pp partition in the p losses in the nitisol fig 9 c totaling 59 28 22 and 17 for the p rates of 0 55 110 and 220 kg ha 1 year 1 the cambisol showed no association between p losses and p rate with 21 of losses in the form of pp 4 discussion 4 1 influence of slope and p rates on losses by surface runoff rainfall intensity duration frequency and volume impact the runoff volume sediment yield santos et al 2017 khan et al 2016 and p losses heathwaite al 2005 intensive rainfall easily surpasses soil infiltration capacity generating runoff khan et al 2016 the importance of the rainfall frequency is due to the hydraulic conductivity of a saturated soil be lower than from an unsaturated one sakaguchi et al 2005 therefore soil with high moisture due to previous rainfall will be prone to generate runoff even with low intensity and low volume rainfall than in a dry soil santos et al 2017 among the rainfall characteristics the volume is the most important once is the quantification of all the water entering the soil system that could produce runoff and thus sediment and p movement so higher rainfall volumes are often linked with higher sediment and p losses lourenzi et al 2014 another important factor to be considered is the lower infiltration rate normally observed in clayey soils mazaheri and mahmoodabadi 2012 increasing the runoff volume in these soils schick et al 2017 thus the higher volume and frequency of rainfall altogether with the texture characteristics of the nitisol explain to great extend its higher runoff volume sediment yield and p losses the greater slope increases the displacement speed of the flowing water reducing the stability of soil particles yang et al 2015 in addition greater slopes potentiate sediment losses due to the greater angle of impact of raindrops and consequently greater shear capacity of the soil liu et al 2015 additionally with the increase in slope there is an increase in the effective depth of soil that interacts with the flow yang et al 2015 nutrients adsorbed to soil particles are also lost more significantly in steeper areas berger et al 2010 fang et al 2015 greater terrain slopes potentiate losses of sediments and consequently of nutrients adhered to them despite representing only about 27 of the total p lost the participation of the fraction linked to sediments pp increased with the increase in soil slope this is directly related to an increase in the amount of sediment lost in the steeper terrains as observed in fig 3 this is caused by the greater detachment capacity of soil particles and higher velocity of the runoff berger et al 2010 liu et al 2015 as previously reported the reduction of sediment losses observed because of the increase in the fertilization rate may be related to the higher plant biomass productivity the presence of higher content of plant residues on the soil can reduce the disaggregation caused by raindrops and flow velocity reducing the amount of sediment lost schick et al 2017 vegetation cover can serve as a barrier and facilitate the deposition of eroded soil eshghizadeh et al 2016 addition of fertilizers in soil can increase biomass production both from shoots and roots increasing soil organic carbon content gross and glaser 2021 furthermore manure application results in increased soil aggregate stability with reduced runoff and erosion and therefore reduced p transport potential wortmann and shapiro 2008 the decrease in sediment losses by increasing the pig slurry rate was observed only in the coarser textured soil probably because this soil has less clay content and consequently lower aggregate stability than the finer textured soil on the other hand higher pig slurry rates despite favoring plant productivity increase losses of drp and tp for the cambisol the absence of significant effect as a function of p application rates can be attributed to high infiltration rate in this soil indicating a potential loss by leaching khan et al 2018 leached p correlates best with the amount of solution that infiltrates into the soil compared to the amount of nutrient applied lourenzi et al 2014 this hypothesis is consistent with the lower runoff volume in this soil compared with the nitisol the presence of vegetation cover on the soil as with the grass used in the present experiment can contribute to reducing the losses butler et al 2006 schick et al 2017 but does not eliminate the problem thus the combination of strategies to contain sediment and nutrient losses should be used in the pig farms to minimize the environmental impacts of this activity the construction of physical barriers such as terraces can contribute substantially to the reduction of losses fragmenting long slope lengths slope length of crops has an influence on hydrology and losses of sediments and p in surface runoff sharpley and kleinman 2003 another alternative is the adoption of vegetative barriers using species with high p extraction capacity and or capable of altering soil microrelief creating small obstacles to the transported material blanco canqui et al 2004 4 2 phosphorus availability in soil and fractions lost the p lost by runoff can be fractionated from readily available forms to recalcitrant forms the drp represents readily available forms depending on the p content in the topsoil and the amounts of drained water butler et al 2006 the p bound to sediment incorporates forms adsorbed to organic and inorganic particles varying according to the amount of soil that can be moved and its p concentration wang et al 2013 even though it s not a readily available fraction tp represents the entire compartment that may be released yang et al 2018 and is most used in studies that assess environmental risks dall orsoletta et al 2021 the history of fertilization with pig slurry increased the extractable p of the soil especially in the surface layer in the 0 10 cm layer the increase was more pronounced in the nitisol consequently p losses through surface runoff are intensified lourenzi et al 2014 p has reduced mobility in soil and surface application results in higher p concentration in the first centimeters of the soil fig 4 a and b this phenomenon is more significant in soils with higher p adsorption capacity gatiboni et al 2015 in the nitisol the amounts of p extracted by mehlich 1 in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers reached values close to 130 and 23 mg dm 3 respectively at the highest p rate values that were 1 7 and 2 6 times higher than those observed in the cambisol fig 4 a and b this amplitude is equivalent to the differences of p max between the soils the presence of a p rich layer in surface significantly increases the risk of losses by surface runoff bertol et al 2017 in experiment with simulated rain bertol et al 2007 observed that the losses of drp and p adhered to sediments by surface runoff under different soil management systems were directly related to the concentration of p in the soil surface layer from 0 to 2 5 cm in sandier soils such as the cambisol p tends to distribute more easily along the soil profile reducing losses by runoff but increasing the chance of contamination by leaching guardini et al 2012 in general the total losses of p by runoff obtained in the present study can be considered low when compared to the total amounts applied however the p contents present in the water were above 2 mg dm 3 fig 5 and may cause negative effects to the environment these values are 27 and 31 times higher than those considered critical for the eutrophication of streams 0 075 mg dm 3 dodds et al 1998 and reservoirs 0 064 mg dm 3 cunha et al 2013 respectively in this context it is hypothesized that part of this element may be lost by leaching khan et al 2018 a factor that also poses high risk of environmental contamination this may occur because the animal manure applied to the soil favors the migration of p along the profile as it influences the decrease of p adsorption capacity by the soil pizzeghello et al 2016 the greatest risks of losses by leaching exist in sandier soils due to the lower p adsorption capacity guardini et al 2012 thus it is necessary to conduct further studies taking into account the amount of p that may be migrating in subsurface in the profile of different soils the increase in p content in the soil is accompanied by the increase in more labile forms boitt et al 2018 as well as the drp gatiboni et al 2015 as observed in fig 9 the drp represented on average 73 of the tp lost a result also found by other studies conducted under similar conditions lourenzi et al 2014 2015 constant and excessive applications of pig slurry can exceed the amount of p extracted by plants and increase the content stored in the soil this accumulation of p in the soil leads to a reduction in the degree of affinity between the element and soil particles firstly due to the increases in the negative charge on the reacting surface and secondly due to the decrease of phosphorus penetration into the minerals barrow 2015 this reduction in the p affinity for the adsorption sites occurs in association with the supply of nutrients to the soil lourenzi et al 2014 thus when the second step of the adsorption process takes place p becomes available in the soil solution gatiboni et al 2015 however a low correlation was found between the p rate applied and the transfer of p by surface runoff fig s3 the results of the present study indicate that successive applications of pig slurry without considering technical criteria increase the p contents beyond the need of the plants the mehlich p values reached in the 0 10 cm layer exceeded by 15 and 5 times the values considered adequate for cultivation of perennial pastures in the study region cqfs rs sc 2016 in steeper terrains the risk of losses of p and other chemical elements present in the transported material is even more pronounced based on this the use of environmental models that predict the risk of p contamination in pig farms is indispensable dall orsoletta et al 2021 finally by knowing the absolute values of the losses of p in its fractions and its relationship with soil attributes clay content p content and slope as well as with fertilization management factors such as the pig slurry rate applied in experiments conducted for at least four years it is possible to build more robust models alternatively it is an option to improve existing ones increasing their accuracy in a greater range of conditions favoring the control of environmental pollution with p 5 conclusion increase in the terrain slope increases water losses consequently it increment sediments losses and p forms in the runoff the slope impacts on the losses are related to the evaluated environment where more clayey soils such as nitisol has higher losses of water sediments and p forms the intrinsic conditions of this type of soil such as slower drainage when compared to a loam texture such as cambisol add to the slope effect intensifying water losses sediments and p forms in areas with permanent soil cover with pasture the pp losses are low with most of the p being lost in soluble form as drp however with the slope increase there is an increase in the pp losses due to the greater runoff kinetic energy under these conditions and facilitated particles disaggregated carrying from the soil pig slurry application to the soil does not alter water losses but reduces sediment losses and linearly increases p losses in the nitisol p rate had no influence on losses in the cambisol the nitisol has higher accumulation of available p extracted by mehlich 1 in the surface layer and higher losses by surface runoff compared to the cambisol clay soils have greater p adsorption capacity with limited vertical displacement and concentration in the most superficial layer as observed in nitisol the most soil superficial layer is also the one that directly interacts with surface runoff which aggravates p losses in this soil type declaration of

9864,the objective of this study was to quantify the losses of water sediments and phosphorus p fractions by surface runoff as a function of terrain slope and p rates applied in two soils with contrasting textures six field trials installed in 2015 were evaluated in 2018 and 2019 in a nitisol and in a cambisol with 642 and 225 g kg 1 of clay averages of 0 55 110 and 220 kg ha 1 year 1 of p were applied superficially corresponding to 0 32 5 65 130 m³ ha 1 year 1 of pig slurry pig slurry was applied under three terrain slopes at each site 10 20 and 30 in the nitisol and 15 25 and 35 in the cambisol after natural rainfall events the drained solution was collected and the flow volume amount of sediments and fractions of dissolved reactive p drp particulate p pp and total p tp lost by surface runoff were determined at the beginning of 2019 soil samples were collected in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers and the mehlich 1 extractable p was determined increase in terrain slope substantially increased the losses of water sediments and p considering the highest slope of each site the losses of water sediments and tp in the nitisol were 35 3 13 5 and 21 8 times higher than in the cambisol mehlich 1 extractable p in the nitisol was 1 7 times higher than that observed in the cambisol drp represented about 73 of the total p lost but the participation of pp increased with the increase in slope it was concluded that the nitisol undergoes higher losses of water sediments and p by surface runoff compared to the cambisol much due to the higher rainfall volume rate of transported material lower water infiltration in the soil profile and accumulation of p in the surface layer of the soil graphical abstract ga1 keywords pig manure clay soils phosphorus fraction eutrophication 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for plant development and is often applied as fertilizer in agriculture however its transfer from agricultural areas to aquatic environments has high pollutant potential sharpley 2016 zhang et al 2016 especial attention to the p management is given to places as the state of santa catarina in the southern region of brazil the largest pork producer in the country abpa 2019 this production is characterized by being in a confined system generating a large amount of waste mainly in the liquid slurry form in addition the pig production in santa catarina is concentrated in small farms in general smaller than 10 ha cepa 2018 with steep relief martini 2012 this practice culminates in successive applications of pig slurry to fields with high potential for p losses by surface runoff the continuous and excessive application of pig slurry can exceed the p requirement by plants and thus accumulate in several fractions especially those of greater lability gatiboni et al 2008 such accumulation occurs mainly on the top soil layer where the slurry is applied reducing the adsorption potential of p within soil particles in this layer due to p saturation barrow 2015 thus inadequate management of this nutrient for supply in nutrients to field crops disregarding technical criteria may exceed soil retention capacity and intensify environmental problems due to the transfer of p to aquatic environments sharpley 2016 soil characteristics influence the applied p dynamics loam soils that have lower p sorption capacity are prone to greater losses especially by leaching guardini et al 2012 lourenzi et al 2014 on the other hand clay soils have higher adsorption capacity and accumulation on surface layers which in association with lower infiltration rate increases the risk of losses due to surface runoff boitt et al 2018 gérard 2016 mazaheri and mahmoodabadi 2012 moreover soil slopes influence the transport of the p within the water and sediments amorim et al 2010 this factor implies in innumerous hydrologic process as superficial retention of water infiltration rate runoff velocity and energy morbidelli et al 2018 besides that the slope is also related to the thickness of soil that interacts within runoff sharpley 1985 thus terrain slope associated with the application of pig slurry or any other phosphate fertilizer applied to the soil surface can increases the losses of p by surface runoff fang et al 2015 intensify water and sediment losses wu et al 2018 and consequently greater amounts of p adhered to sediments are also lost liu et al 2015 therefore would be important to add the terrain slope as an aggravating factor of p losses to empirical models for predicting losses and risk of environmental contamination however there is little data available dall orsoletta et al 2021 the increase in p rates and land slopes can increase p losses from agricultural areas to contiguous environments although these effects are widely reported in the literature few studies have been dedicated to quantifying this increase under field conditions limiting the approaches applied to p management to qualitative measures thus the quantification of p losses in agricultural areas under field conditions that present textural and climatic contrast is necessary for precise measures adoption to mitigate these losses the main hypothesis of this study is that soils with high clay content have higher p losses than loam soils which are intensified in steeper terrain thus the objectives of the study were i to quantify and evaluate losses of water p fractions and sediments by surface runoff ii to quantify the effects of terrain slope and average annual phosphorus rate on losses by surface runoff in two soils with contrasting texture 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area description in 2015 six field trials were installed in the state of santa catarina southern brazil in two regions with high concentration of pigs and impacted by the application of pig slurry fig 1 trials were installed in campos novos 27 22 16 s and 51 12 32 w with a cfb climate and rio do sul 27 11 20 s and 49 39 25 w with a cfa climate peel et al 2007 in areas that were not being cultivated the soils in the two sites are classified as nitisol and cambisol respectively wrb fao 2015 prior to the installation soil was collected in the 0 20 cm layer in both sites the nitisol had the following characteristics sand 120 g kg 1 silt 346 g kg 1 clay 642 g kg 1 organic matter om 30 g kg 1 ph h2o 1 1 6 3 mehlich 1p 6 4 mg dm 3 the cambisol had the following characteristics sand 334 g kg 1 silt 441 g kg 1 clay 225 g kg 1 om 22 g kg 1 ph h2o 1 1 5 5 mehlich 1p 3 3 mg dm 3 additionally the theoretical maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity p max was estimated in both sites by the langmuir isotherms equation p max was equal to 2317 2 and 2275 3 mg kg 1 in the layers of 0 10 and 10 20 cm in the nitisol and to 969 4 and 985 3 mg kg 1 in the layers of 0 10 and 10 20 cm in the cambisol further details can be seen in dall orsoletta et al 2021 2 2 treatments and management history there were three trials in each region all with the same design varying only the slope of the terrain where they were installed in campos novos each trial was allocated in a strip of mechanically constructed slopes equal to 10 20 and 30 in rio do sul trials were allocated in a strip of slope existing in the terrain being 15 25 and 35 the experimental units with 4 25 m2 of total area were delimited with 20 cm high galvanized sheet metal buried 10 cm into the soil fig s1 the lower end of each plot has a funnel that directs runoff water to a bs3 sample collectors grando et al 2021 the experimental units were cultivated with the perennial grass tifton 85 cynodon dactylon and during the winter period annual ryegrass lolium multiflorum was sown the pasture was periodically mowed at intervals of approximately 30 days in the spring summer period and 60 days in the autumn winter period maintaining a residual of 10 cm for regrowth in each experiment three rates of pig slurry were evaluated in addition to a control treatment without fertilization the applications were carried out between 2016 and 2019 with average rates of 0 55 110 and 220 kg ha 1 year 1 of p table 1 which corresponded to the averages of 0 32 5 65 and 130 m³ ha 1 year 1 of pig slurry the pig slurry used came from an anaerobic biodigester and was applied to the soil surface after cutting the pasture with four annual applications the treatments were distributed within each slope strip in a randomized block design with three replicates which totaled 72 experimental units in both sites the samples were collected after rainfall events that caused surface runoff in january 2019 samples were collected in the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm layers from which p was extracted by mehlich 1 mehlich 1953 and determined according to murphy and riley 1962 thus during the period evaluated between 2018 and 2019 32 collections were performed in the nitisol and 30 collections in the cambisol as well as 11 pasture cuts 8 pig slurry applications and one soil collection both sites were subjected to the same pasture management fertilization and data collection aiming to standardize the effects and data generated during the evaluation period the average annual rainfall observed was 1616 mm in the nitisol and 1311 mm in the cambisol fig s2 2 3 methods of analysis the total runoff volume was quantified in the field by measuring the height of the water level in the collectors whose height volume ratio had been previously calibrated homogenized runoff samples were taken to the laboratory and kept under refrigeration until the determinations were performed concentrations of sediments dissolved reactive p drp and total p tp were determined runoff sediment concentration was determined by colorimetry based on turbidity measurements made in benchtop turbidimeter digimed tb 1000p with readings in ntu in 10 ml aliquots of homogenized samples minella et al 2008 calibration curves with sediments from each site were previously prepared for drp determination a 10 ml aliquot of the homogenized samples was filtered using a cellulose acetate filter with 0 45 µm pore diameter 4500 p apha 2005 for tp a homogenized 10 ml aliquot of the samples without filtration was digested in autoclave at 120 c for 60 min 4500 p apha 2005 p concentrations in drp and tp extracts were determined in a uv visible spectrophotometer at 882 nm uv 1800 shimadzu according to the method described by murphy and riley 1962 additionally the particulate p pp concentration was estimated by the difference between tp and drp values 2 4 statistical analysis the data of runoff sediments and p fractions were subjected to the shapiro wilk normality test and to bartlett s variance homogeneity test the data were transformed by box cox to meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity the data were then subjected to analysis of variance anova to compare the experiments with all treatments equal each slope being an experiment and the rates being the treatments when significant p 0 05 for rate the means were compared by regression and when significant for slope the means were subjected to the lsd test p 0 05 the data when transformed were converted to the original scale for graphical representation the statistical calculations and construction of graphs were performed in the r program version 4 0 0 r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 surface runoff and sediment transport of all the precipitated volume 4 75 resulted in surface runoff in the nitisol against only 0 14 in the cambisol data not shown the highest annual rainfall was observed in the nitisol region 19 higher than that quantified in the cambisol region fig s2 in the nitisol there were increments in the runoff volume of 6 0 and 13 7 times for the 20 and 30 slopes when compared to the 10 slope fig 2 a the same behavior was observed for the cambisol with 62 and 227 times more for the 25 and 35 slopes when compared to the 15 slope fig 2 b in general considering the highest slopes surface runoff was about 35 times higher in the nitisol with clay texture than in the cambisol with loam texture the nitisol showed increases of 3 9 and 6 7 times in sediment transport as the 20 and 30 slopes compared to the lowest slope and these losses are highly correlated with surface runoff fig s3 in the cambisol sediment losses were 70 and 173 times higher for the slopes of 25 and 35 compared to the lowest slope in relation to p rates for each kilogram of p added to the nitisol there was an average reduction of about 0 2 kg ha 1 year 1 in the sediments lost this reduction was not observed in the cambisol 3 2 phosphorus in soil and lost fractions the soil p contents extracted by mehlich 1 increased with the increase in the p rate applied to the soil in 2018 with more significant accumulation in the nitisol than in the cambisol the nitisol showed increases of 0 64 and 0 10 mg dm 3 for each kilogram of p added to the soil for the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers respectively fig 4 a with accumulation 6 times higher in the surface layer the cambisol showed increases of 0 44 and 0 04 mg dm 3 for each kilogram of p added to the soil for the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers fig 4 b with accumulation 11 times higher in the surface layer terrain slope affected the p contents in both soils and the highest values were observed in intermediate slopes the 10 20 cm layer of the cambisol was not affected by slope figure f in the sediment the p concentration at the 10 slope was higher than those observed at the 20 and 30 slopes 1 2 and 1 3 times higher respectively in nitisol also in the nitisol each additional kilogram of p applied represented an increase of 0 01 mg dm 3 in the concentration of tp in the runoff water fig 5 a and c it is worth pointing out that regarding slope the mean concentration of p in the runoff water of the cambisol was 2 60 mg dm 3 that is 1 3 times higher than that observed at the 10 slope in the nitisol fig 5 b and d the average losses of tp at the slopes of 20 and 30 represented increments of 5 0 and 13 5 times compared to the lowest slope of the nitisol reaching at the highest slope the average of 1856 g ha 1 year 1 of tp lost fig 6 a and c in the cambisol there were increments of 58 and 161 times for the slopes of 25 and 35 in comparison to the lowest slope with the average of 85 2 g ha 1 year 1 of tp lost at the highest slope fig 6 b in the treatment where p is not applied the nitisol loses approximately 14 times more than the average losses in the cambisol considering the highest slope the nitisol lost 22 times more tp than the cambisol each kilogram of p applied annually in the nitisol represents increments of approximately 5 g ha 1 year 1 in the tp lost the highest p rate resulted in the transfer of 1806 g ha 1 year 1 in the nitisol a value very close to the losses observed at the highest slope in this same soil comparing the highest slopes of each site the nitisol lost about 21 times more drp than the cambisol the average drp losses in the nitisol increased 4 7 and 8 6 times when considering the slopes of 20 and 30 compared to the lowest slope reaching at the highest slope the average of 1159 g ha 1 year 1 of drp lost the drp showed linear losses with the increase in p rate in the nitisol in the control treatment the losses were approximately 11 times higher compared to the mean 30 g ha 1 year 1 of drp lost in the cambisol fig 7 for each 10 increase in slope in both soils there was an increase in pp losses fig 8 with no influence of the applied p rate however again the losses occurred in greater quantity in the soil with higher clay content it is the nitisol with increments in average losses of 5 3 and 13 5 times at the 20 and 30 slopes compared to the lowest slope reaching at the highest slope the average of 548 3 g ha 1 year 1 of pp lost in the cambisol there were increments of 98 and 307 times at the 25 and 35 slopes in comparison to the lowest slope with 27 6 g ha 1 year 1 of pp lost at the highest slope regardless of soil and slope the drp represented about 73 of the total p losses fig 9 a and b with the increase in slope however there was an increase in the participation of pp lost in the nitisol totaling 23 25 and 32 at the slopes of 10 20 and 30 respectively for the cambisol there was no association between slope and the pp partition with an average of 27 of p lost in this fraction with the increase in the p rate applied to the soil there was a reduction in the pp partition in the p losses in the nitisol fig 9 c totaling 59 28 22 and 17 for the p rates of 0 55 110 and 220 kg ha 1 year 1 the cambisol showed no association between p losses and p rate with 21 of losses in the form of pp 4 discussion 4 1 influence of slope and p rates on losses by surface runoff rainfall intensity duration frequency and volume impact the runoff volume sediment yield santos et al 2017 khan et al 2016 and p losses heathwaite al 2005 intensive rainfall easily surpasses soil infiltration capacity generating runoff khan et al 2016 the importance of the rainfall frequency is due to the hydraulic conductivity of a saturated soil be lower than from an unsaturated one sakaguchi et al 2005 therefore soil with high moisture due to previous rainfall will be prone to generate runoff even with low intensity and low volume rainfall than in a dry soil santos et al 2017 among the rainfall characteristics the volume is the most important once is the quantification of all the water entering the soil system that could produce runoff and thus sediment and p movement so higher rainfall volumes are often linked with higher sediment and p losses lourenzi et al 2014 another important factor to be considered is the lower infiltration rate normally observed in clayey soils mazaheri and mahmoodabadi 2012 increasing the runoff volume in these soils schick et al 2017 thus the higher volume and frequency of rainfall altogether with the texture characteristics of the nitisol explain to great extend its higher runoff volume sediment yield and p losses the greater slope increases the displacement speed of the flowing water reducing the stability of soil particles yang et al 2015 in addition greater slopes potentiate sediment losses due to the greater angle of impact of raindrops and consequently greater shear capacity of the soil liu et al 2015 additionally with the increase in slope there is an increase in the effective depth of soil that interacts with the flow yang et al 2015 nutrients adsorbed to soil particles are also lost more significantly in steeper areas berger et al 2010 fang et al 2015 greater terrain slopes potentiate losses of sediments and consequently of nutrients adhered to them despite representing only about 27 of the total p lost the participation of the fraction linked to sediments pp increased with the increase in soil slope this is directly related to an increase in the amount of sediment lost in the steeper terrains as observed in fig 3 this is caused by the greater detachment capacity of soil particles and higher velocity of the runoff berger et al 2010 liu et al 2015 as previously reported the reduction of sediment losses observed because of the increase in the fertilization rate may be related to the higher plant biomass productivity the presence of higher content of plant residues on the soil can reduce the disaggregation caused by raindrops and flow velocity reducing the amount of sediment lost schick et al 2017 vegetation cover can serve as a barrier and facilitate the deposition of eroded soil eshghizadeh et al 2016 addition of fertilizers in soil can increase biomass production both from shoots and roots increasing soil organic carbon content gross and glaser 2021 furthermore manure application results in increased soil aggregate stability with reduced runoff and erosion and therefore reduced p transport potential wortmann and shapiro 2008 the decrease in sediment losses by increasing the pig slurry rate was observed only in the coarser textured soil probably because this soil has less clay content and consequently lower aggregate stability than the finer textured soil on the other hand higher pig slurry rates despite favoring plant productivity increase losses of drp and tp for the cambisol the absence of significant effect as a function of p application rates can be attributed to high infiltration rate in this soil indicating a potential loss by leaching khan et al 2018 leached p correlates best with the amount of solution that infiltrates into the soil compared to the amount of nutrient applied lourenzi et al 2014 this hypothesis is consistent with the lower runoff volume in this soil compared with the nitisol the presence of vegetation cover on the soil as with the grass used in the present experiment can contribute to reducing the losses butler et al 2006 schick et al 2017 but does not eliminate the problem thus the combination of strategies to contain sediment and nutrient losses should be used in the pig farms to minimize the environmental impacts of this activity the construction of physical barriers such as terraces can contribute substantially to the reduction of losses fragmenting long slope lengths slope length of crops has an influence on hydrology and losses of sediments and p in surface runoff sharpley and kleinman 2003 another alternative is the adoption of vegetative barriers using species with high p extraction capacity and or capable of altering soil microrelief creating small obstacles to the transported material blanco canqui et al 2004 4 2 phosphorus availability in soil and fractions lost the p lost by runoff can be fractionated from readily available forms to recalcitrant forms the drp represents readily available forms depending on the p content in the topsoil and the amounts of drained water butler et al 2006 the p bound to sediment incorporates forms adsorbed to organic and inorganic particles varying according to the amount of soil that can be moved and its p concentration wang et al 2013 even though it s not a readily available fraction tp represents the entire compartment that may be released yang et al 2018 and is most used in studies that assess environmental risks dall orsoletta et al 2021 the history of fertilization with pig slurry increased the extractable p of the soil especially in the surface layer in the 0 10 cm layer the increase was more pronounced in the nitisol consequently p losses through surface runoff are intensified lourenzi et al 2014 p has reduced mobility in soil and surface application results in higher p concentration in the first centimeters of the soil fig 4 a and b this phenomenon is more significant in soils with higher p adsorption capacity gatiboni et al 2015 in the nitisol the amounts of p extracted by mehlich 1 in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm layers reached values close to 130 and 23 mg dm 3 respectively at the highest p rate values that were 1 7 and 2 6 times higher than those observed in the cambisol fig 4 a and b this amplitude is equivalent to the differences of p max between the soils the presence of a p rich layer in surface significantly increases the risk of losses by surface runoff bertol et al 2017 in experiment with simulated rain bertol et al 2007 observed that the losses of drp and p adhered to sediments by surface runoff under different soil management systems were directly related to the concentration of p in the soil surface layer from 0 to 2 5 cm in sandier soils such as the cambisol p tends to distribute more easily along the soil profile reducing losses by runoff but increasing the chance of contamination by leaching guardini et al 2012 in general the total losses of p by runoff obtained in the present study can be considered low when compared to the total amounts applied however the p contents present in the water were above 2 mg dm 3 fig 5 and may cause negative effects to the environment these values are 27 and 31 times higher than those considered critical for the eutrophication of streams 0 075 mg dm 3 dodds et al 1998 and reservoirs 0 064 mg dm 3 cunha et al 2013 respectively in this context it is hypothesized that part of this element may be lost by leaching khan et al 2018 a factor that also poses high risk of environmental contamination this may occur because the animal manure applied to the soil favors the migration of p along the profile as it influences the decrease of p adsorption capacity by the soil pizzeghello et al 2016 the greatest risks of losses by leaching exist in sandier soils due to the lower p adsorption capacity guardini et al 2012 thus it is necessary to conduct further studies taking into account the amount of p that may be migrating in subsurface in the profile of different soils the increase in p content in the soil is accompanied by the increase in more labile forms boitt et al 2018 as well as the drp gatiboni et al 2015 as observed in fig 9 the drp represented on average 73 of the tp lost a result also found by other studies conducted under similar conditions lourenzi et al 2014 2015 constant and excessive applications of pig slurry can exceed the amount of p extracted by plants and increase the content stored in the soil this accumulation of p in the soil leads to a reduction in the degree of affinity between the element and soil particles firstly due to the increases in the negative charge on the reacting surface and secondly due to the decrease of phosphorus penetration into the minerals barrow 2015 this reduction in the p affinity for the adsorption sites occurs in association with the supply of nutrients to the soil lourenzi et al 2014 thus when the second step of the adsorption process takes place p becomes available in the soil solution gatiboni et al 2015 however a low correlation was found between the p rate applied and the transfer of p by surface runoff fig s3 the results of the present study indicate that successive applications of pig slurry without considering technical criteria increase the p contents beyond the need of the plants the mehlich p values reached in the 0 10 cm layer exceeded by 15 and 5 times the values considered adequate for cultivation of perennial pastures in the study region cqfs rs sc 2016 in steeper terrains the risk of losses of p and other chemical elements present in the transported material is even more pronounced based on this the use of environmental models that predict the risk of p contamination in pig farms is indispensable dall orsoletta et al 2021 finally by knowing the absolute values of the losses of p in its fractions and its relationship with soil attributes clay content p content and slope as well as with fertilization management factors such as the pig slurry rate applied in experiments conducted for at least four years it is possible to build more robust models alternatively it is an option to improve existing ones increasing their accuracy in a greater range of conditions favoring the control of environmental pollution with p 5 conclusion increase in the terrain slope increases water losses consequently it increment sediments losses and p forms in the runoff the slope impacts on the losses are related to the evaluated environment where more clayey soils such as nitisol has higher losses of water sediments and p forms the intrinsic conditions of this type of soil such as slower drainage when compared to a loam texture such as cambisol add to the slope effect intensifying water losses sediments and p forms in areas with permanent soil cover with pasture the pp losses are low with most of the p being lost in soluble form as drp however with the slope increase there is an increase in the pp losses due to the greater runoff kinetic energy under these conditions and facilitated particles disaggregated carrying from the soil pig slurry application to the soil does not alter water losses but reduces sediment losses and linearly increases p losses in the nitisol p rate had no influence on losses in the cambisol the nitisol has higher accumulation of available p extracted by mehlich 1 in the surface layer and higher losses by surface runoff compared to the cambisol clay soils have greater p adsorption capacity with limited vertical displacement and concentration in the most superficial layer as observed in nitisol the most soil superficial layer is also the one that directly interacts with surface runoff which aggravates p losses in this soil type declaration of
