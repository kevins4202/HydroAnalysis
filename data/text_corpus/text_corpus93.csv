465,an accurate estimation of terrestrial water storage tws is crucial for water resource management and drought monitoring however the uncertainties in model physics surface parameters and meteorological data often limit the accuracy of land surface hydrological models in estimating tws in this study a multi model based framework was developed to predict tws in china by 2050 using a bayesian model averaging bma method and grace satellite observations compared to grace observations our bma based tws anomaly twsa estimations reduce root mean square errors by 10 16 and increase correlation coefficients by 26 46 over semi humid and semi arid basins than simple arithmetical averaging for the validation period 2008 2016 at the same time bma shows decreasing root mean square differences 10 12 over humid basins the calibrated bma weights were then applied to future projections of twsa under two representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 the overall rate of twsa for the future period 2021 2050 was detected with the same direction as that from past decades 2003 2016 but with larger decreasing values especially for the haihe basin in north china bma based twsa would decrease faster by about 19 for rcp 2 6 and 26 for rcp 6 0 these results suggest a decreasing trend in future tws over most of the basins in china due to combined effects of global warming and human activities which suggests likely aggravated risk of water shortage and a growing need for adaptive water resources management keywords terrestrial water storage future projections bayesian model averaging ensemble simulations representative concentration pathway 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws represents the sum of water stored above and underneath the surface of the earth syed et al 2008b zeng et al 2008 including groundwater soil moisture snow surface water ice and biomass tws is an important component of global hydrological cycles and plays a key role in earth s climate system famiglietti 2004 zeng et al 2008 furthermore as an integrated measure of surface and groundwater availability tws has significant implications for drought monitoring and water resources management long et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 yang et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 especially for china china has several large rivers and vast amounts of lakes and wetlands however water shortage is persistent problem in some arid and semi arid areas of china due to certain climatic condition and the uneven distribution of water resources chen et al 2017 moreover several extreme droughts and water deficit problems affected many parts of china during the past decades affecting many people and resulting in serious losses fu et al 2013 chen et al 2017 therefore accurate estimations of tws have been important for the hydrological process studies and water resource management in china chen et al 2017 since its launch in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 has provided a new approach to monitor tws variations around the world grace derived tws changes have been widely used to infer groundwater rodell et al 2009 long et al 2016 frappart et al 2019 terrestrial freshwater discharge syed et al 2008a evapotranspiration pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 sheffield et al 2009 snow niu et al 2007a the mass balance of ice sheets chen et al 2009 and glaciers luthcke et al 2008 and the water balance of lakes swenson and wahr 2009 however due to coarse temporal monthly and spatial resolutions 150 000 km2 the utility of grace observations have been limited for many applications that require tws estimates with higher resolution houborg et al 2012 rowlands et al 2005 scanlon et al 2016 2018 swenson et al 2006 as an effective tool to produce accurate tws estimates at regional and global scales progress based land surface modeling lsm and hydrological modeling hm have been used to examine the spatial temporal variation grippa et al 2011 syed et al 2008b and long term trend of tws seyoum and milewski 2016 zhang et al 2018 another advantage of model simulations is their ability to predict individual components of tws such as soil moisture and groundwater ahmed et al 2016 seyoum and milewski 2016 thus it is possible to use lsm or hm simulations to fill the current need for historical tws construction zhang et al 2018 and future projections however model based tws estimates are limited by the accuracy of the atmospheric forcing data sets liu et al 2018 and the physical parameterizations and model parameters niu et al 2007b grippa et al 2011 scanlon et al 2018 a single climate model has weaknesses in simulating the climate system and may underestimate the uncertainty of climate change liu et al 2016 2018 raftery et al 2005 using an ensemble based multiple model simulations is a promising method to reduce the uncertainties derived from lsms and hms fang and li 2016 miao et al 2013 the simplest multi model ensemble is simple arithmetical averaging saa which can be generated by combining the individual model output with equal weights duan and phillips 2010 however saa does not produce a superior result to the best individual ensemble member in most cases liu and xie 2013 several sophisticated techniques have been developed to reduce the uncertainties derived from ensemble mean by employing weighted schemes to each input model e g machine learning algorithm zaherpour et al 2019 and bayesian model averaging bma method raftery et al 2005 bma is a statistical post processing approach that uses ensemble based simulations to yield probabilistic predictions it can provide both deterministic estimates and probability density functions for any quantity of interest based on training data sets raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 bma has been used in various fields of studies including surface air temperature duan and phillips 2010 miao et al 2013 fang and li 2016 evapotranspiration zhu et al 2016 runoff prediction duan et al 2007 and soil moisture liu and xie 2013 long et al 2017 used the bma method to merge three grace products and several model outputs and examined the spatiotemporal variations in tws over 60 basins globally liu et al 2018 investigated how to improve tws anomaly twsa estimates by combining simulations of multiple lsms forced by different meteorological data sets using the bma approach these studies suggest that bma is an effective method to incorporate both the advantages of grace satellite observations and model simulations this study is to use a bma ensemble approach and grace observations to reduce the uncertainties derived from model based simulations and improve the prediction of twsa in particular given that few studies have assessed the potential future changes of tws we apply the approach to future projections of tws and investigate the potential changes in tws over china under different future climate projections the contributions of each key component on the interannual variations of twsa would be examined for major river basins of china the results from this study will provide policy makers with valuable information about future water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 model simulations the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project phase 2b isimip2b offers a framework to compare climate impact projections in different sectors and at different scales frieler et al 2017 warszawski et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 in this study we chose an ensemble of 12 model combinations two hms and one lsm forced by climate input data hempel et al 2013 from four global circulation models gcms for historical 1901 2005 and future 2006 2050 conditions the two hms include h08 hanasaki et al 2008a hanasaki et al 2008b and watergap2 müller schmied et al 2014 müller schmied et al 2016 and the lsm is lpjml sitch et al 2003 rost et al 2008 von bloh et al 2010 four gcms including gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc esm chem were forced by two emission scenarios i e the representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 moss et al 2010 prior to use in the hm and lsm simulations the climate model output was bias corrected to an observation based meteorological forcing data set the watch forcing data era 40 weedon et al 2011 using the trend preserving bias correction method hempel et al 2013 lange 2018 the hms and lsm used in this study were then run within the same framework of the isimip2b all the simulations were conducted at 0 5 0 5 horizontal resolution with varying land use and land cover changes h08 uses constant co2 concentration while varied values for lpjml watergap2 does not consider the effect of co2 the isimip2b also provide the projections of industrial manufacturing and domestic water use data which were generated under shared socio economic pathway 2 ssp2 from the water futures and solutions project wada et al 2016 it is noteworthy that the water abstraction data provided for rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 are identical and are taken from simulations based on rcp 6 0 because rcp 2 6 is not considered by the water futures and solutions project h08 and lpjml use varied land use data sets varying from year to year while only varied irrigation area for watergap2 static land use map the land use data for historical simulations are taken from hyde 3 2 klein goldewijk et al 2017 while those for future scenarios were generated by the lsm model of agricultural production and its impacts on the environment lotze campen et al 2008 popp et al 2014 as shown in table 1 only watergap2 model was calibrated against observed long term annual river discharge from global runoff data centre for the period of observations with a maximum of 30 years 1979 2008 müller schmied et al 2016 monthly average output data covering the time period 2003 2050 are used in this study because the projected water use data are only available until 2050 after which the values are assumed to remain constant the simulations between 2003 and 2005 are historical runs and are the same for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 table 1 lists the main model characteristics for the two hms and one lsm a detailed description of the driving data set and the bias correction method is given in hempel et al 2013 andlange 2018 in this study the vertically integrated twsa is expressed as 1 twsa s n w a s m a g w a where snwa sma and gwa denote the anomalies in snow water soil water and groundwater storages respectively these datasets are from model simulations and will be compared with grace based twsa products 2 2 grace we used the center for space research csr grace rl06 mascon product http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html save et al 2016 save 2019 to calibrate and evaluate the model simulations the csr rl06 mascon data were generated using the same standards as the csr rl06 spherical harmonics solutions using grace level 1 observations the c20 coefficients were replaced with the c20 solutions from satellite laser ranging analysis cheng and tapley 2004 and the contributions of the geo center were corrected according to the estimates from swenson et al 2008 to ensure consistency in the results obtained from different grace studies save et al 2016 and save 2019 provides more details about the processing the spatial resolution of the csr grace rl06 solutions is 1 4 degree save 2019 to be consistent with the model based twsa estimates these csr grace rl06 data have been resampled to the same spatial resolution 0 5 0 5 it is noted that although the csr grace rl06 mascon data are represented on a 0 25 longitude latitude grid they represent the equal area geodesic grid of size 1 0 1 0 at the equator which is the current native resolution of csr rl06 mascon solutions save et al 2016 save 2019 the monthly twsa data from the csr grace rl06 mascon product for the period january 2003 december 2016 were used in this study which are relative to a 2004 2009

use during calibration and evaluation 2 3 bma bma raftery et al 2005 duan and phillips 2010 is a post processing algorithm that produces probabilistic forecasts from ensemble members expressed as 2 p

they are calculated using the following equations 4 μ k a k b k b 0 k b 1 k f k 5 σ k 2 a k b k 2 c 0 k c 1 k f k where μ k and σ k 2 are the mean and variance of the gamma distribution and b 0k b 1k c 0k c 1k are the parameters that need to be estimated the bma weight wk and b 0k b 1k c 0k c 1k of the individual model were estimated from a calibration data set i e grace observations in this study using the linear regression method and the maximum likelihood technique vrugt et al 2008 for which the values were obtained iteratively using the markov chain monte carlo algorithm in bma the posterior distribution is the weighted average of the individual models where the weights are bayesian posterior probabilities that the given model is the true model conditional on the data that are grace observations the period 2003 2012 was used to derive weight wk training period while 2013 2016 was taken as the validation period after that the bma weights were then applied to model simulations between 2021 and 2050 for generating bma based twsa projections 2 4 analysis methods similar to that from the grace product twsa estimates from the model based simulations were generated as the departure of the mean between 2004 and 2009 after that the nonparameteric mann kendall method was used to test the statistical significance of trends where the sen median slope sen 1968 was considered as the temporal trend value of twsa for the regional twsa area weighted please see the supplement for more information to evaluate the performance of the bma based estimates and compare them with the model based twsa simulations and twsa from the grace product several metrics were computed for the evaluation period 2013 2016 these metrics include the root mean square deviation rmsd and pearson s correlation r 6 rmsd 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 7 r 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o σ s σ o where oi is the observed value grace si is the simulated value o and s are their average values for the target period σ s and σ o are the corresponding standard deviations and n is the number of measurements the kling gupta efficiency kge statistic also is used to measure the agreement between model simulations and the grace product kge varies from to 1 with perfect forecast at kge 1 kge is calculated using the following equation gupta et al 2009 8 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 9 α s o 10 β σ s σ o where r is the correlation coefficient eq 7 α is an indicator of bias β is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values to investigate the role of different components of twsa i e snow soil water and groundwater on the interannual variations of total twsa we used the component contribution ratio ccr kim et al 2009 in this study to determine their contributions ccr is expressed as 11 ccr mad tv 12 mad 1 n i 1 n s i s 13 tv i 1 c o m p o n e n t s ma d i where mad is the mean absolute deviation of a twsa component si is the indices of snow soil water and groundwater and tv is the total variability ccr ranges from 0 to 1 where a ccr of 1 indicates that the contribution is 100 2 5 major river basins in china six major river basins in china representing a broad range of climate land cover and human water use were examined fig 1 table 2 we used the mean annual aridity index ai which is defined as the ratio between mean annual precipitation and annual potential evapotranspiration trabucco and zomer 2018 to describe the climatic characteristics of the six basins the ai is classified to five categories humid ai 0 65 semi humid 0 5 ai 0 65 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 arid 0 05 ai 0 2 and hyper arid ai 0 05 the ai data were downloaded from the figshare open data repository https figshare com articles global aridity index and potential evapotranspiration et0 climate database v2 7504448 3 based on these criteria two basins yangtze river and zhujiang were categorized as humid two songhuajiang and huaihe as semi humid and two yellow river and haihe as semiarid some of the basins have been subjected to large scale groundwater withdrawal for irrigation including the haihe basin and the middle reach of the yellow river basin no arid or hyper arid river basins were included in this study because long et al 2015 suggested that grace derived twsa data may be more accurate in humid regions than in arid areas 3 results 3 1 evaluation of spatial patterns in twsa we first evaluated the spatial variability of annual twsa from 12 model simulations and two ensemble means saa and bma using grace observations for the evaluation period 2008 2016 fig 2 the twsa estimates of model simulations between 2006 and 2016 are from the rcp 2 6 scenario the hot spots of significantly negative twsa values such as north india and the north china plain which are known to be dominated by groundwater overexploitation rodell et al 2009 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 sinha et al 2017 are detected in both the grace observations fig 2a and model simulations forced by miroc5 fig 2m n and o both grace and model simulations forced by ipsl fig 2j k and l show positive twsa values in the inner and northern tibetan plateau which may be related to the expansions of lake area and increases in the lake mass wang et al 2016 meng et al 2019 however negative twsa values over northwest and southwest china detected in grace are not obvious in the single model simulation or saa the spatial correlation coefficients of single model simulations and saa with grace data are very low less than 0 1 the poor correlation suggests that none of the single model simulations or saa captures the spatial variation of annual twsa well in contrast the bma based estimates show the highest spatial correlation of 0 87 fig 2c and detect the obviously negative values over north india the north china plain and northwest and southwest china moreover the bma based estimates show the same positive value centers detected by the grace product over the northwest area of the tibetan plateau and south china fig 3 depicts the temporal correlation coefficients between model simulations and grace data most of model simulations show high positive correlation coefficients with grace observations over southwest china parts of south china and india saa captures the temporal variations of twsa derived from grace better than most estimates by a single model fig 3a however it could be found from fig 3a that parts of northwest china the north china plain and northeast china show non significant correlations bma shows the highest correlations with grace observations fig 3b these results suggest that bma based twsa estimations could capture the temporal variations of grace observations well and could be used to investigate the temporal variations in twsa the kge coefficients between model simulations and grace estimates are presented in fig 4 red regions show high kge values high correspondence between grace and model simulations whereas blue regions show large differences single model simulation and saa have negative kge values over most of the study areas in contrast bma significantly improves the twsa estimates especially over southwest china south china and india fig 4b 3 2 evaluation in major river basins of china to provide a comprehensive and thorough understanding of how bma works to merge climate modeling and grace data we compared temporal variations in twsa from multi model ensemble simulations and their mean values saa and bma with grace observations for six major river basins in china for the period of 2003 2016 fig 5 model based simulations after 2005 are from rcp 2 6 the basin averaged bma weights of 12 ensemble simulations can be found in fig s1 overall the model based twsa estimates agree well with those from the grace product in humid basins e g the yangtze fig 5e and zhujiang basins fig 5f but the performance is not as good in semi arid basins fig 5b and c this may be explained in part by the differences of signal to noise ratio stnr i e seasonality of twsa fitted using sine and cosine functions over the standard deviation of twsa long et al 2015 long et al 2015 pointed out that humid regions have higher strn values relative to semi arid regions which suggests that model simulations may capture the temporal variations of grace twsa better in relatively humid regions the correlation coefficients and rmsds between 2008 and 2016 are presented in fig 6 neither single model simulation shows the best statistical metrics over all basins for example watergap2 shows the best performance in the haihe basin fig 6b and yellow river basin fig 6c while lpjml forced by miroc5 agrees best with grace in the songhuajiang basin fig 6a compared to single model simulation saa improves the twsa estimates for most cases but still shows large rmsds or low correlation coefficients in some river basins e g fig 6a c and d in contrast bma shows the best performance in most river basins except the haihe fig 6b in which four model simulations from watergap2 produce slightly lower rmsds over semi humid and semi arid basins bma decreases the rmsd by 10 16 and increases the correlations 26 46 compared to saa notably the correlation increases from a value of 0 10 for saa to 0 26 for bma over the songhuajiang basin bma shows similar correlation coefficients with saa over the humid basins e g the yangtze river basin fig 6e and zhujiang basin fig 6f but exhibits reduced rmsd 5 26 in addition the bma based twsa is more highly correlated with grace data in the yangtze river basin r 0 76 and zhujiang basin r 0 69 than in other basins r 0 39 except for the haihe basin r 0 92 the analysis using single model simulations and saa yields similar results overall these results indicate that model based or bma based twsa estimates agree better with grace derived values in humid river basins than in semi humid or semiarid basins which is consistent with findings by long et al 2015 3 3 interannual variations and trends of twsa under two scenarios we compared the interannual variations of twsa from saa and bma under two scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 between 2003 and 2016 fig 7 the basin averaged bma weights of 12 ensemble simulations for rcp 6 0 can be found in fig s2 it should be noted that an 11 month running average of the monthly anomaly time series was calculated to remove the seasonal cycle and intra annual variation saa and bma show similar interannual variability in most river basins except for differences in magnitude compared to saa bma increases twsa in songhuajiang yangtze river and zhujiang because model based twsa estimates are lower than those from the grace product in the other three basins saa overestimates twsa compared to the grace product fig 7 and the bma based estimates induce an increase in twsa as mentioned in section 3 2 bma based twsa estimates outperform both the original single model simulations and ensemble mean saa in terms of rmsd and correlations for the whole of china and in the six river basins thus the results give confidence that the bma scheme can be used to predict potential changes of twsa fig 8 shows the interannual variations of twsa between 2021 and 2050 predicted twsa over these three decades shows larger interannual variability than that of the past decades fig 7 in most basins although differences in the magnitudes are apparent all model based twsa estimates saa and bma for the haihe basin continually decrease in 2003 2016 mainly because of groundwater depletion induced by human activities feng et al 2013 moiwo et al 2013 pan et al 2017 tang et al 2013 the trends of twsa in the haihe basin are statistically significant during the historical period under rcp 2 6 and have the values of 3 7 mm yr 1 and 6 0 mm yr 1 for saa and bma respectively fig 9 b rcp 6 0 produces similar trends as rcp 2 6 for the historical period but larger differences for future projections compared to that of past years the overall rate for the future period 2021 2050 is projected to have the same direction in the haihe basin but with larger decreasing values saa identifies an increase of the trend of about 21 0 88 mm yr 1 for rcp 2 6 and 49 1 3 mm yr 1 for rcp 6 0 the corresponding projections by the bma procedure are 19 1 4 mm yr 1 and 26 2 5 mm yr 1 respectively fig 9b in contrast increasing trends are detected during the past decade in the songhuajiang basin fig 9a however for the future period rcp 6 0 identifies a clearly lower increasing rate and rcp 2 6 even produces a significantly decreasing trend fig 9a moreover predicted twsa shows a significantly decreasing trend for the other basins except zhujiang under rcp 6 0 fig 9f these results illustrate that future projections of tws under both scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 show decreasing trends over most river basins in china due to the combined effect of global warming and human activities 4 discussion 4 1 relative contribution of different components we investigated the relative role of the individual storage components in the interannual variability of model based twsa for the six basins in china using the multi model ensemble mean saa however only snow water soil moisture and groundwater are discussed in this paper because other surface water components e g glacier river water are not explicitly considered in this study fig 10 shows the ccr values calculated based on eq 8 using anomalies of each month over 14 years 2003 2016 because most of the river basins are located at the mid latitudes and subtropical areas the sub surface water storage component soil moisture and groundwater dominates the interannual variation of twsa zhujiang is located in a wet region with little snow where the simulation indicates the dominant role of soil moisture 56 moving to the humid and semi humid basins over the sub tropical areas groundwater dominates the tws changes in the yangtze 57 and huaihe basins 55 in the songhuajiang basin located in the semi humid region with higher latitude snow water storage 31 is found to make a larger contribution than soil moisture 26 in contrast for the semi arid regions with strong human influence soil moisture shows the highest contribution to the interannual variation of twsa such as the yellow river 60 and haihe 54 basins in addition the relative contributions of water storage components to the interannual variability of model based twsa estimations for historical and future periods not shown are similar these results indicate that soil moisture explains the major part of tws variation in the dry basins where groundwater also contributes high due to excessive pumping for irrigation surface water storage is a major part of tws and an important contributor to twsa variation in wet regions kim et al 2009 however the role of surface water storage is not investigated in this study because these datasets are not available it should be noted that compared to the observations of individual components groundwater soil water etc grace data have a better spatial coverage and information content lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 which can produce more accurate tws predictions the bma based tws predictions can be used as reference data sets to evaluate earth system model simulations moreover tws predictions can be disaggregated to estimate the individual components through some better known model simulations long et al 2016 frappart et al 2019 or data assimilation girotto et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 4 2 comparisons of two scenarios due to the anticipated future changes in climate both precipitation and temperature patterns are expected to induce pose changes to tws grillakis 2019 to analyze what might occur two future emission scenarios were examined rcp 2 6 which assumes that an aggressive mitigation strategy will be pursued and that co2 emissions will peak in the middle of the century and then decrease and rcp 6 0 which assumes that a less ambitious mitigation scenario will be followed in which co2 emissions continue to increase until the end of the century the two scenarios show similar tws changes in the historical period 2003 2016 but slight differences for the near future 2021 2050 with the less aggressive rcp 2 6 scenario resulting in a slightly faster decreasing trend this is probably due to that rcp 2 6 leads to a higher near term emissions than rcp 6 0 between 2005 and 2025 which then induces more significant changes during the first two decades of the near future period walsh et al 2017 grillakis 2019 in addition exceptionally frequent human activities e g groundwater overexploitation for irrigation water abstraction for domestic and industrial uses etc that are expected to result in the decline of tws are projected to become substantially more frequent in the future than in the recent past due to the population increase and economic development in china thus a faster decreasing trend is projected for future twsa under both scenarios especially in the haihe basin it should be noted that the water abstraction for domestic and industrial uses in rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 are identical while the irrigation was computed internally and induced different water uses for crop growth under the two scenarios these results illustrate that the combined effects of global warming and human activities would induce significantly decreasing trends in future tws over most river basins in china under both scenarios it then increases a possibly aggravated risk of water shortage and a growing need for adaptive water resources management in addition the effects of other key factors precipitation temperature evapotranspiration etc on the interannual variation and trends of tws were not discussed in this study which could be investigated in our future work 4 3 uncertainties in twsa from model simulations and grace one of the novelties of this study is that the bma based framework through combining multi model ensemble simulations and the grace satellite product can provide tws estimates with higher accuracy compared to single model simulations and saa the bma weights could be applied to future projections in tws changes under different scenarios for the analysis on the interannual variation and trend of twsa in fact an optimal solution by a combination of available data sources is thought to have great potential for overcoming the limitation of relying on a single data source for improved accuracy spatial and temporal coverage of the dataset as well as addressing the consistency of long term large scale tws information chen et al 2019 another strength of this study is the quantitative analysis about the contribution of individual hydrologic components to the interannual variation in twsa lsm and hm simulations can account for the impacts of different possible future co2 concentrations on the change in tws including plant transpiration ground evaporation soil moisture depletion groundwater decline and also water demand for agriculture industry and domesticity as a limitation the bma framework for future tws estimates that was developed in this research relies on grace information during the historical period the uncertainty embodied in the grace satellite product can affect the future projections of tws changes currently various twsa series are available from different processing centers the comparison of six different grace products is presented in figs s3 and s4 it can be found that different grace products show some discrepancies however as far as we know no studies have shown that one series has the best quality nevertheless the discrepancies among different grace satellite products are much smaller when compared to model simulations fig s4 moreover the uncertainty from the grace product is less than that of either lsm or hm simulations forced by gcm output for these reasons we chose the csr grace rl06 mascon product as satellite observations to calibrate and evaluate model simulations another issue is that the differences of spatial resolution between grace data and model simulations may affect the bma based tws predictions although the csr grace rl06 mascon product has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 their intrinsic resolution is about 200 300km the sparse resolution of grace data may induce some effects on bma based tws predictions which needs to be investigated in our future study for example spectral or spatial filters can be applied to model simulations to remove spectral information that is not detected by grace or empirical orthogonal function or related decompositions are also some potential choices the third is that the length of the training period may affect the bma based tws predictions as shown in fig s5 among the four sensitivity experiments with different training periods the period of 2003 2012 has a better performance over most of the six river basins in china however this experiment with the training period of 2003 2012 still shows lower correlations than other experiments with shorter lengths for songhuajiang and huaihe basins this indicates that the choice of training period is still a challenge for the bma based framework the fourth is that current lsms and hms essentially simulate the natural hydrologic cycling without fully considering anthropogenic impacts large uncertainties derived from human interferences such as groundwater pumping for irrigation and water withdrawal form surface water could lead to systematic change of tws zeng and cai 2018 for example the water abstraction data used in this study are identical for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 which does not fully consider the water demands under different climate projections as human activities play an increasing role in transforming hydrologic processes wang and cai 2009 lsms and hms should be developed or improved to better capture the anthropogenic components at multiple temporal and spatial scales vogel et al 2015 zeng and cai 2018 5 conclusions a bma based framework was developed in this study to integrate tws changes from multi model simulations calibrated by grace satellite observations by applying the bma approach to the whole china mainland this study reconstructs twsa historical data sets 2003 2016 our results show that spatial temporal variabilities of twsa estimates derived from the bma based framework are better than those from lsm and hm simulations with lower rmsds and higher correlation coefficients compared to saa bma decreases the rmsd by 10 16 and increases the correlation 26 46 for semi humid and semi arid basins at the same time the bma approach decreases rmsd 5 26 for humid basins this study also projects future twsa during 2021 2050 it is found the future twsa will continue the decreasing trend derived from bma based estimates but with larger decreasing values especially for the haihe basin in north china the decreasing trend of bma based twsa will be faster by 19 1 4 mm yr 1 for rcp 2 6 and 26 2 5 mm yr 1 for rcp 6 0 than the historical trend these results illustrate that the combined effects of global warming and human activities would induce significantly decreasing trends in future tws over most river basins in china under both scenarios which implies a possibly aggravated risk of water shortage and a growing need for adaptive water resources management the bma framework developed in this research for determining future potential tws change has clear strengths over other approaches however its implementation is limited somewhat by uncertainties inherent in model simulations and grace satellite products for future work new parameterizations incorporated into the lsm or hm such as a lateral groundwater flow component zeng et al 2018 might further help to improve the groundwater and tws simulations more satellite derived tws data products e g grace follow on mission kornfeld et al 2019 can be merged together to enhance the accuracy of bma based twsa estimates moreover recent developments in the bma method such as copula integrated bma madadgar and moradkhani 2014 are likely to improve deterministic skill in the bma based tws predictions credit

465,an accurate estimation of terrestrial water storage tws is crucial for water resource management and drought monitoring however the uncertainties in model physics surface parameters and meteorological data often limit the accuracy of land surface hydrological models in estimating tws in this study a multi model based framework was developed to predict tws in china by 2050 using a bayesian model averaging bma method and grace satellite observations compared to grace observations our bma based tws anomaly twsa estimations reduce root mean square errors by 10 16 and increase correlation coefficients by 26 46 over semi humid and semi arid basins than simple arithmetical averaging for the validation period 2008 2016 at the same time bma shows decreasing root mean square differences 10 12 over humid basins the calibrated bma weights were then applied to future projections of twsa under two representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 the overall rate of twsa for the future period 2021 2050 was detected with the same direction as that from past decades 2003 2016 but with larger decreasing values especially for the haihe basin in north china bma based twsa would decrease faster by about 19 for rcp 2 6 and 26 for rcp 6 0 these results suggest a decreasing trend in future tws over most of the basins in china due to combined effects of global warming and human activities which suggests likely aggravated risk of water shortage and a growing need for adaptive water resources management keywords terrestrial water storage future projections bayesian model averaging ensemble simulations representative concentration pathway 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws represents the sum of water stored above and underneath the surface of the earth syed et al 2008b zeng et al 2008 including groundwater soil moisture snow surface water ice and biomass tws is an important component of global hydrological cycles and plays a key role in earth s climate system famiglietti 2004 zeng et al 2008 furthermore as an integrated measure of surface and groundwater availability tws has significant implications for drought monitoring and water resources management long et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 yang et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 especially for china china has several large rivers and vast amounts of lakes and wetlands however water shortage is persistent problem in some arid and semi arid areas of china due to certain climatic condition and the uneven distribution of water resources chen et al 2017 moreover several extreme droughts and water deficit problems affected many parts of china during the past decades affecting many people and resulting in serious losses fu et al 2013 chen et al 2017 therefore accurate estimations of tws have been important for the hydrological process studies and water resource management in china chen et al 2017 since its launch in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 has provided a new approach to monitor tws variations around the world grace derived tws changes have been widely used to infer groundwater rodell et al 2009 long et al 2016 frappart et al 2019 terrestrial freshwater discharge syed et al 2008a evapotranspiration pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 sheffield et al 2009 snow niu et al 2007a the mass balance of ice sheets chen et al 2009 and glaciers luthcke et al 2008 and the water balance of lakes swenson and wahr 2009 however due to coarse temporal monthly and spatial resolutions 150 000 km2 the utility of grace observations have been limited for many applications that require tws estimates with higher resolution houborg et al 2012 rowlands et al 2005 scanlon et al 2016 2018 swenson et al 2006 as an effective tool to produce accurate tws estimates at regional and global scales progress based land surface modeling lsm and hydrological modeling hm have been used to examine the spatial temporal variation grippa et al 2011 syed et al 2008b and long term trend of tws seyoum and milewski 2016 zhang et al 2018 another advantage of model simulations is their ability to predict individual components of tws such as soil moisture and groundwater ahmed et al 2016 seyoum and milewski 2016 thus it is possible to use lsm or hm simulations to fill the current need for historical tws construction zhang et al 2018 and future projections however model based tws estimates are limited by the accuracy of the atmospheric forcing data sets liu et al 2018 and the physical parameterizations and model parameters niu et al 2007b grippa et al 2011 scanlon et al 2018 a single climate model has weaknesses in simulating the climate system and may underestimate the uncertainty of climate change liu et al 2016 2018 raftery et al 2005 using an ensemble based multiple model simulations is a promising method to reduce the uncertainties derived from lsms and hms fang and li 2016 miao et al 2013 the simplest multi model ensemble is simple arithmetical averaging saa which can be generated by combining the individual model output with equal weights duan and phillips 2010 however saa does not produce a superior result to the best individual ensemble member in most cases liu and xie 2013 several sophisticated techniques have been developed to reduce the uncertainties derived from ensemble mean by employing weighted schemes to each input model e g machine learning algorithm zaherpour et al 2019 and bayesian model averaging bma method raftery et al 2005 bma is a statistical post processing approach that uses ensemble based simulations to yield probabilistic predictions it can provide both deterministic estimates and probability density functions for any quantity of interest based on training data sets raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 bma has been used in various fields of studies including surface air temperature duan and phillips 2010 miao et al 2013 fang and li 2016 evapotranspiration zhu et al 2016 runoff prediction duan et al 2007 and soil moisture liu and xie 2013 long et al 2017 used the bma method to merge three grace products and several model outputs and examined the spatiotemporal variations in tws over 60 basins globally liu et al 2018 investigated how to improve tws anomaly twsa estimates by combining simulations of multiple lsms forced by different meteorological data sets using the bma approach these studies suggest that bma is an effective method to incorporate both the advantages of grace satellite observations and model simulations this study is to use a bma ensemble approach and grace observations to reduce the uncertainties derived from model based simulations and improve the prediction of twsa in particular given that few studies have assessed the potential future changes of tws we apply the approach to future projections of tws and investigate the potential changes in tws over china under different future climate projections the contributions of each key component on the interannual variations of twsa would be examined for major river basins of china the results from this study will provide policy makers with valuable information about future water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 model simulations the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project phase 2b isimip2b offers a framework to compare climate impact projections in different sectors and at different scales frieler et al 2017 warszawski et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 in this study we chose an ensemble of 12 model combinations two hms and one lsm forced by climate input data hempel et al 2013 from four global circulation models gcms for historical 1901 2005 and future 2006 2050 conditions the two hms include h08 hanasaki et al 2008a hanasaki et al 2008b and watergap2 müller schmied et al 2014 müller schmied et al 2016 and the lsm is lpjml sitch et al 2003 rost et al 2008 von bloh et al 2010 four gcms including gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc esm chem were forced by two emission scenarios i e the representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 moss et al 2010 prior to use in the hm and lsm simulations the climate model output was bias corrected to an observation based meteorological forcing data set the watch forcing data era 40 weedon et al 2011 using the trend preserving bias correction method hempel et al 2013 lange 2018 the hms and lsm used in this study were then run within the same framework of the isimip2b all the simulations were conducted at 0 5 0 5 horizontal resolution with varying land use and land cover changes h08 uses constant co2 concentration while varied values for lpjml watergap2 does not consider the effect of co2 the isimip2b also provide the projections of industrial manufacturing and domestic water use data which were generated under shared socio economic pathway 2 ssp2 from the water futures and solutions project wada et al 2016 it is noteworthy that the water abstraction data provided for rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 are identical and are taken from simulations based on rcp 6 0 because rcp 2 6 is not considered by the water futures and solutions project h08 and lpjml use varied land use data sets varying from year to year while only varied irrigation area for watergap2 static land use map the land use data for historical simulations are taken from hyde 3 2 klein goldewijk et al 2017 while those for future scenarios were generated by the lsm model of agricultural production and its impacts on the environment lotze campen et al 2008 popp et al 2014 as shown in table 1 only watergap2 model was calibrated against observed long term annual river discharge from global runoff data centre for the period of observations with a maximum of 30 years 1979 2008 müller schmied et al 2016 monthly average output data covering the time period 2003 2050 are used in this study because the projected water use data are only available until 2050 after which the values are assumed to remain constant the simulations between 2003 and 2005 are historical runs and are the same for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 table 1 lists the main model characteristics for the two hms and one lsm a detailed description of the driving data set and the bias correction method is given in hempel et al 2013 andlange 2018 in this study the vertically integrated twsa is expressed as 1 twsa s n w a s m a g w a where snwa sma and gwa denote the anomalies in snow water soil water and groundwater storages respectively these datasets are from model simulations and will be compared with grace based twsa products 2 2 grace we used the center for space research csr grace rl06 mascon product http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html save et al 2016 save 2019 to calibrate and evaluate the model simulations the csr rl06 mascon data were generated using the same standards as the csr rl06 spherical harmonics solutions using grace level 1 observations the c20 coefficients were replaced with the c20 solutions from satellite laser ranging analysis cheng and tapley 2004 and the contributions of the geo center were corrected according to the estimates from swenson et al 2008 to ensure consistency in the results obtained from different grace studies save et al 2016 and save 2019 provides more details about the processing the spatial resolution of the csr grace rl06 solutions is 1 4 degree save 2019 to be consistent with the model based twsa estimates these csr grace rl06 data have been resampled to the same spatial resolution 0 5 0 5 it is noted that although the csr grace rl06 mascon data are represented on a 0 25 longitude latitude grid they represent the equal area geodesic grid of size 1 0 1 0 at the equator which is the current native resolution of csr rl06 mascon solutions save et al 2016 save 2019 the monthly twsa data from the csr grace rl06 mascon product for the period january 2003 december 2016 were used in this study which are relative to a 2004 2009

use during calibration and evaluation 2 3 bma bma raftery et al 2005 duan and phillips 2010 is a post processing algorithm that produces probabilistic forecasts from ensemble members expressed as 2 p

they are calculated using the following equations 4 μ k a k b k b 0 k b 1 k f k 5 σ k 2 a k b k 2 c 0 k c 1 k f k where μ k and σ k 2 are the mean and variance of the gamma distribution and b 0k b 1k c 0k c 1k are the parameters that need to be estimated the bma weight wk and b 0k b 1k c 0k c 1k of the individual model were estimated from a calibration data set i e grace observations in this study using the linear regression method and the maximum likelihood technique vrugt et al 2008 for which the values were obtained iteratively using the markov chain monte carlo algorithm in bma the posterior distribution is the weighted average of the individual models where the weights are bayesian posterior probabilities that the given model is the true model conditional on the data that are grace observations the period 2003 2012 was used to derive weight wk training period while 2013 2016 was taken as the validation period after that the bma weights were then applied to model simulations between 2021 and 2050 for generating bma based twsa projections 2 4 analysis methods similar to that from the grace product twsa estimates from the model based simulations were generated as the departure of the mean between 2004 and 2009 after that the nonparameteric mann kendall method was used to test the statistical significance of trends where the sen median slope sen 1968 was considered as the temporal trend value of twsa for the regional twsa area weighted please see the supplement for more information to evaluate the performance of the bma based estimates and compare them with the model based twsa simulations and twsa from the grace product several metrics were computed for the evaluation period 2013 2016 these metrics include the root mean square deviation rmsd and pearson s correlation r 6 rmsd 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 7 r 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o σ s σ o where oi is the observed value grace si is the simulated value o and s are their average values for the target period σ s and σ o are the corresponding standard deviations and n is the number of measurements the kling gupta efficiency kge statistic also is used to measure the agreement between model simulations and the grace product kge varies from to 1 with perfect forecast at kge 1 kge is calculated using the following equation gupta et al 2009 8 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 9 α s o 10 β σ s σ o where r is the correlation coefficient eq 7 α is an indicator of bias β is a measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values to investigate the role of different components of twsa i e snow soil water and groundwater on the interannual variations of total twsa we used the component contribution ratio ccr kim et al 2009 in this study to determine their contributions ccr is expressed as 11 ccr mad tv 12 mad 1 n i 1 n s i s 13 tv i 1 c o m p o n e n t s ma d i where mad is the mean absolute deviation of a twsa component si is the indices of snow soil water and groundwater and tv is the total variability ccr ranges from 0 to 1 where a ccr of 1 indicates that the contribution is 100 2 5 major river basins in china six major river basins in china representing a broad range of climate land cover and human water use were examined fig 1 table 2 we used the mean annual aridity index ai which is defined as the ratio between mean annual precipitation and annual potential evapotranspiration trabucco and zomer 2018 to describe the climatic characteristics of the six basins the ai is classified to five categories humid ai 0 65 semi humid 0 5 ai 0 65 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 arid 0 05 ai 0 2 and hyper arid ai 0 05 the ai data were downloaded from the figshare open data repository https figshare com articles global aridity index and potential evapotranspiration et0 climate database v2 7504448 3 based on these criteria two basins yangtze river and zhujiang were categorized as humid two songhuajiang and huaihe as semi humid and two yellow river and haihe as semiarid some of the basins have been subjected to large scale groundwater withdrawal for irrigation including the haihe basin and the middle reach of the yellow river basin no arid or hyper arid river basins were included in this study because long et al 2015 suggested that grace derived twsa data may be more accurate in humid regions than in arid areas 3 results 3 1 evaluation of spatial patterns in twsa we first evaluated the spatial variability of annual twsa from 12 model simulations and two ensemble means saa and bma using grace observations for the evaluation period 2008 2016 fig 2 the twsa estimates of model simulations between 2006 and 2016 are from the rcp 2 6 scenario the hot spots of significantly negative twsa values such as north india and the north china plain which are known to be dominated by groundwater overexploitation rodell et al 2009 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 sinha et al 2017 are detected in both the grace observations fig 2a and model simulations forced by miroc5 fig 2m n and o both grace and model simulations forced by ipsl fig 2j k and l show positive twsa values in the inner and northern tibetan plateau which may be related to the expansions of lake area and increases in the lake mass wang et al 2016 meng et al 2019 however negative twsa values over northwest and southwest china detected in grace are not obvious in the single model simulation or saa the spatial correlation coefficients of single model simulations and saa with grace data are very low less than 0 1 the poor correlation suggests that none of the single model simulations or saa captures the spatial variation of annual twsa well in contrast the bma based estimates show the highest spatial correlation of 0 87 fig 2c and detect the obviously negative values over north india the north china plain and northwest and southwest china moreover the bma based estimates show the same positive value centers detected by the grace product over the northwest area of the tibetan plateau and south china fig 3 depicts the temporal correlation coefficients between model simulations and grace data most of model simulations show high positive correlation coefficients with grace observations over southwest china parts of south china and india saa captures the temporal variations of twsa derived from grace better than most estimates by a single model fig 3a however it could be found from fig 3a that parts of northwest china the north china plain and northeast china show non significant correlations bma shows the highest correlations with grace observations fig 3b these results suggest that bma based twsa estimations could capture the temporal variations of grace observations well and could be used to investigate the temporal variations in twsa the kge coefficients between model simulations and grace estimates are presented in fig 4 red regions show high kge values high correspondence between grace and model simulations whereas blue regions show large differences single model simulation and saa have negative kge values over most of the study areas in contrast bma significantly improves the twsa estimates especially over southwest china south china and india fig 4b 3 2 evaluation in major river basins of china to provide a comprehensive and thorough understanding of how bma works to merge climate modeling and grace data we compared temporal variations in twsa from multi model ensemble simulations and their mean values saa and bma with grace observations for six major river basins in china for the period of 2003 2016 fig 5 model based simulations after 2005 are from rcp 2 6 the basin averaged bma weights of 12 ensemble simulations can be found in fig s1 overall the model based twsa estimates agree well with those from the grace product in humid basins e g the yangtze fig 5e and zhujiang basins fig 5f but the performance is not as good in semi arid basins fig 5b and c this may be explained in part by the differences of signal to noise ratio stnr i e seasonality of twsa fitted using sine and cosine functions over the standard deviation of twsa long et al 2015 long et al 2015 pointed out that humid regions have higher strn values relative to semi arid regions which suggests that model simulations may capture the temporal variations of grace twsa better in relatively humid regions the correlation coefficients and rmsds between 2008 and 2016 are presented in fig 6 neither single model simulation shows the best statistical metrics over all basins for example watergap2 shows the best performance in the haihe basin fig 6b and yellow river basin fig 6c while lpjml forced by miroc5 agrees best with grace in the songhuajiang basin fig 6a compared to single model simulation saa improves the twsa estimates for most cases but still shows large rmsds or low correlation coefficients in some river basins e g fig 6a c and d in contrast bma shows the best performance in most river basins except the haihe fig 6b in which four model simulations from watergap2 produce slightly lower rmsds over semi humid and semi arid basins bma decreases the rmsd by 10 16 and increases the correlations 26 46 compared to saa notably the correlation increases from a value of 0 10 for saa to 0 26 for bma over the songhuajiang basin bma shows similar correlation coefficients with saa over the humid basins e g the yangtze river basin fig 6e and zhujiang basin fig 6f but exhibits reduced rmsd 5 26 in addition the bma based twsa is more highly correlated with grace data in the yangtze river basin r 0 76 and zhujiang basin r 0 69 than in other basins r 0 39 except for the haihe basin r 0 92 the analysis using single model simulations and saa yields similar results overall these results indicate that model based or bma based twsa estimates agree better with grace derived values in humid river basins than in semi humid or semiarid basins which is consistent with findings by long et al 2015 3 3 interannual variations and trends of twsa under two scenarios we compared the interannual variations of twsa from saa and bma under two scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 between 2003 and 2016 fig 7 the basin averaged bma weights of 12 ensemble simulations for rcp 6 0 can be found in fig s2 it should be noted that an 11 month running average of the monthly anomaly time series was calculated to remove the seasonal cycle and intra annual variation saa and bma show similar interannual variability in most river basins except for differences in magnitude compared to saa bma increases twsa in songhuajiang yangtze river and zhujiang because model based twsa estimates are lower than those from the grace product in the other three basins saa overestimates twsa compared to the grace product fig 7 and the bma based estimates induce an increase in twsa as mentioned in section 3 2 bma based twsa estimates outperform both the original single model simulations and ensemble mean saa in terms of rmsd and correlations for the whole of china and in the six river basins thus the results give confidence that the bma scheme can be used to predict potential changes of twsa fig 8 shows the interannual variations of twsa between 2021 and 2050 predicted twsa over these three decades shows larger interannual variability than that of the past decades fig 7 in most basins although differences in the magnitudes are apparent all model based twsa estimates saa and bma for the haihe basin continually decrease in 2003 2016 mainly because of groundwater depletion induced by human activities feng et al 2013 moiwo et al 2013 pan et al 2017 tang et al 2013 the trends of twsa in the haihe basin are statistically significant during the historical period under rcp 2 6 and have the values of 3 7 mm yr 1 and 6 0 mm yr 1 for saa and bma respectively fig 9 b rcp 6 0 produces similar trends as rcp 2 6 for the historical period but larger differences for future projections compared to that of past years the overall rate for the future period 2021 2050 is projected to have the same direction in the haihe basin but with larger decreasing values saa identifies an increase of the trend of about 21 0 88 mm yr 1 for rcp 2 6 and 49 1 3 mm yr 1 for rcp 6 0 the corresponding projections by the bma procedure are 19 1 4 mm yr 1 and 26 2 5 mm yr 1 respectively fig 9b in contrast increasing trends are detected during the past decade in the songhuajiang basin fig 9a however for the future period rcp 6 0 identifies a clearly lower increasing rate and rcp 2 6 even produces a significantly decreasing trend fig 9a moreover predicted twsa shows a significantly decreasing trend for the other basins except zhujiang under rcp 6 0 fig 9f these results illustrate that future projections of tws under both scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 show decreasing trends over most river basins in china due to the combined effect of global warming and human activities 4 discussion 4 1 relative contribution of different components we investigated the relative role of the individual storage components in the interannual variability of model based twsa for the six basins in china using the multi model ensemble mean saa however only snow water soil moisture and groundwater are discussed in this paper because other surface water components e g glacier river water are not explicitly considered in this study fig 10 shows the ccr values calculated based on eq 8 using anomalies of each month over 14 years 2003 2016 because most of the river basins are located at the mid latitudes and subtropical areas the sub surface water storage component soil moisture and groundwater dominates the interannual variation of twsa zhujiang is located in a wet region with little snow where the simulation indicates the dominant role of soil moisture 56 moving to the humid and semi humid basins over the sub tropical areas groundwater dominates the tws changes in the yangtze 57 and huaihe basins 55 in the songhuajiang basin located in the semi humid region with higher latitude snow water storage 31 is found to make a larger contribution than soil moisture 26 in contrast for the semi arid regions with strong human influence soil moisture shows the highest contribution to the interannual variation of twsa such as the yellow river 60 and haihe 54 basins in addition the relative contributions of water storage components to the interannual variability of model based twsa estimations for historical and future periods not shown are similar these results indicate that soil moisture explains the major part of tws variation in the dry basins where groundwater also contributes high due to excessive pumping for irrigation surface water storage is a major part of tws and an important contributor to twsa variation in wet regions kim et al 2009 however the role of surface water storage is not investigated in this study because these datasets are not available it should be noted that compared to the observations of individual components groundwater soil water etc grace data have a better spatial coverage and information content lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 which can produce more accurate tws predictions the bma based tws predictions can be used as reference data sets to evaluate earth system model simulations moreover tws predictions can be disaggregated to estimate the individual components through some better known model simulations long et al 2016 frappart et al 2019 or data assimilation girotto et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 4 2 comparisons of two scenarios due to the anticipated future changes in climate both precipitation and temperature patterns are expected to induce pose changes to tws grillakis 2019 to analyze what might occur two future emission scenarios were examined rcp 2 6 which assumes that an aggressive mitigation strategy will be pursued and that co2 emissions will peak in the middle of the century and then decrease and rcp 6 0 which assumes that a less ambitious mitigation scenario will be followed in which co2 emissions continue to increase until the end of the century the two scenarios show similar tws changes in the historical period 2003 2016 but slight differences for the near future 2021 2050 with the less aggressive rcp 2 6 scenario resulting in a slightly faster decreasing trend this is probably due to that rcp 2 6 leads to a higher near term emissions than rcp 6 0 between 2005 and 2025 which then induces more significant changes during the first two decades of the near future period walsh et al 2017 grillakis 2019 in addition exceptionally frequent human activities e g groundwater overexploitation for irrigation water abstraction for domestic and industrial uses etc that are expected to result in the decline of tws are projected to become substantially more frequent in the future than in the recent past due to the population increase and economic development in china thus a faster decreasing trend is projected for future twsa under both scenarios especially in the haihe basin it should be noted that the water abstraction for domestic and industrial uses in rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 are identical while the irrigation was computed internally and induced different water uses for crop growth under the two scenarios these results illustrate that the combined effects of global warming and human activities would induce significantly decreasing trends in future tws over most river basins in china under both scenarios it then increases a possibly aggravated risk of water shortage and a growing need for adaptive water resources management in addition the effects of other key factors precipitation temperature evapotranspiration etc on the interannual variation and trends of tws were not discussed in this study which could be investigated in our future work 4 3 uncertainties in twsa from model simulations and grace one of the novelties of this study is that the bma based framework through combining multi model ensemble simulations and the grace satellite product can provide tws estimates with higher accuracy compared to single model simulations and saa the bma weights could be applied to future projections in tws changes under different scenarios for the analysis on the interannual variation and trend of twsa in fact an optimal solution by a combination of available data sources is thought to have great potential for overcoming the limitation of relying on a single data source for improved accuracy spatial and temporal coverage of the dataset as well as addressing the consistency of long term large scale tws information chen et al 2019 another strength of this study is the quantitative analysis about the contribution of individual hydrologic components to the interannual variation in twsa lsm and hm simulations can account for the impacts of different possible future co2 concentrations on the change in tws including plant transpiration ground evaporation soil moisture depletion groundwater decline and also water demand for agriculture industry and domesticity as a limitation the bma framework for future tws estimates that was developed in this research relies on grace information during the historical period the uncertainty embodied in the grace satellite product can affect the future projections of tws changes currently various twsa series are available from different processing centers the comparison of six different grace products is presented in figs s3 and s4 it can be found that different grace products show some discrepancies however as far as we know no studies have shown that one series has the best quality nevertheless the discrepancies among different grace satellite products are much smaller when compared to model simulations fig s4 moreover the uncertainty from the grace product is less than that of either lsm or hm simulations forced by gcm output for these reasons we chose the csr grace rl06 mascon product as satellite observations to calibrate and evaluate model simulations another issue is that the differences of spatial resolution between grace data and model simulations may affect the bma based tws predictions although the csr grace rl06 mascon product has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 their intrinsic resolution is about 200 300km the sparse resolution of grace data may induce some effects on bma based tws predictions which needs to be investigated in our future study for example spectral or spatial filters can be applied to model simulations to remove spectral information that is not detected by grace or empirical orthogonal function or related decompositions are also some potential choices the third is that the length of the training period may affect the bma based tws predictions as shown in fig s5 among the four sensitivity experiments with different training periods the period of 2003 2012 has a better performance over most of the six river basins in china however this experiment with the training period of 2003 2012 still shows lower correlations than other experiments with shorter lengths for songhuajiang and huaihe basins this indicates that the choice of training period is still a challenge for the bma based framework the fourth is that current lsms and hms essentially simulate the natural hydrologic cycling without fully considering anthropogenic impacts large uncertainties derived from human interferences such as groundwater pumping for irrigation and water withdrawal form surface water could lead to systematic change of tws zeng and cai 2018 for example the water abstraction data used in this study are identical for both rcp 2 6 and rcp 6 0 which does not fully consider the water demands under different climate projections as human activities play an increasing role in transforming hydrologic processes wang and cai 2009 lsms and hms should be developed or improved to better capture the anthropogenic components at multiple temporal and spatial scales vogel et al 2015 zeng and cai 2018 5 conclusions a bma based framework was developed in this study to integrate tws changes from multi model simulations calibrated by grace satellite observations by applying the bma approach to the whole china mainland this study reconstructs twsa historical data sets 2003 2016 our results show that spatial temporal variabilities of twsa estimates derived from the bma based framework are better than those from lsm and hm simulations with lower rmsds and higher correlation coefficients compared to saa bma decreases the rmsd by 10 16 and increases the correlation 26 46 for semi humid and semi arid basins at the same time the bma approach decreases rmsd 5 26 for humid basins this study also projects future twsa during 2021 2050 it is found the future twsa will continue the decreasing trend derived from bma based estimates but with larger decreasing values especially for the haihe basin in north china the decreasing trend of bma based twsa will be faster by 19 1 4 mm yr 1 for rcp 2 6 and 26 2 5 mm yr 1 for rcp 6 0 than the historical trend these results illustrate that the combined effects of global warming and human activities would induce significantly decreasing trends in future tws over most river basins in china under both scenarios which implies a possibly aggravated risk of water shortage and a growing need for adaptive water resources management the bma framework developed in this research for determining future potential tws change has clear strengths over other approaches however its implementation is limited somewhat by uncertainties inherent in model simulations and grace satellite products for future work new parameterizations incorporated into the lsm or hm such as a lateral groundwater flow component zeng et al 2018 might further help to improve the groundwater and tws simulations more satellite derived tws data products e g grace follow on mission kornfeld et al 2019 can be merged together to enhance the accuracy of bma based twsa estimates moreover recent developments in the bma method such as copula integrated bma madadgar and moradkhani 2014 are likely to improve deterministic skill in the bma based tws predictions credit

466,biochar is black carbon produced from pyrolysis of biomass and may be added to soil to sequester carbon and improve soil water retention to date models to predict changes in soil water retention with biochar amendment are still missing and therefore direct measurements are required for every biochar soil combination which can be time consuming here a predictive model for biochar s effect on soil water retention was developed and tested that includes water retained in biochar intrapores and biochar s impact on interpores between particles the independently measured parameters needed for the model are the particle size distributions psds and particle densities for biochar and soil water retention data for biochar free soil biochar intrapore volume distribution from mercury porosimetry amount of biochar added bulk density of the biochar soil mixture and dew point potentiometer measurements of biochar the model was tested using poultry litter and wood biochars amended to two soils sand and sandy loam at 2 and 7 mass fraction the model predicted changes in the soil water characteristic well for the biochar amendment with rmse decreasing by 50 when the full model was used model predictions of the change in available water capacity with biochar amendment for eight biochar soil combinations had an average absolute error of 0 017 0 006 and an average relative error of 1 0 0 40 the model correctly predicted the increase in available water content when sandy loam was amended with wood biochar and the decrease if amended with poultry litter biochar the model provides an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which biochar alters water retention and a means to estimate the initial change in available water capacity for a particular biochar soil combination if necessary biochar and soil properties are measured graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water retention biochar model available water capacity soil water characteristic 1 introduction biochar is a carbon rich solid produced by pyrolysis of organic materials that is added to soil to sequester carbon and to change chemical and physical properties of soils lehmann 2007 novak et al 2009 when amended to stormwater treatment media such as greenroofs or biofiltration media biochar may increase water retention beck et al 2011 tian et al 2019 and pollutant removal ashoori et al 2019 because of varying organic feedstock and pyrolysis conditions biochars are produced with a wide range of particle size distributions cetin et al 2004 liu et al 2016 internal pore volumes brewer et al 2014 and surface areas song and guo 2012 zabaniotou et al 2008 all of which affect water retention thus the influence of biochar on water retention will vary with each biochar media combination the soil water characteristic swc describes water retention in soil mualem 1976 tuller et al 1999 and tuller and or 2005 suggest that swc can be divided into the wet end where water retention is strongly influenced by capillary forces and pore structure and the dry end pf 5 0 pf log h and h matric potential expressed as cm h2o or matric potential 10 mpa where the adsorptive contribution generally dominates over the capillary contribution tuller et al 1999 tuller and or 2005 many studies have evaluated biochar s impact on water retention e g abel et al 2013 busscher et al 2010 kinney et al 2012 marsiello et al 2015 novak et al 2009 tryon 1948 with biochar sometimes increasing or decreasing water retention at specific matric potentials and for particular biochar soil combinations in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms by which biochar alters soil water retention laboratory experiments were conducted by amending mesquite biochar pyrolyzed at 400 c which was ground and separated into to fine 0 251 mm medium 0 251 0 853 mm and coarse 0 853 2 00 mm size fractions before amending to a uniform silica sand 0 251 0 853 mm at 2 w w liu et al 2017 by quantifying the total volume of biochar intrapores pores within the envelope of biochar particles and connected to external pores and the interpores of the biochar sand mixtures pores between the exterior particle surfaces the influence of biochar on intrapores and interpores was differentiated as matric potential increased from pf 6 100 mpa to pf 3 0 1 mpa mesquite biochar increased water retention by adding water in intrapores not present in 100 sand samples with further increases in matric potential the elongated shapes of biochar particles increased the interpore volume and thus water retention however because biochars were only amended to a coarse sand where interpores drained at high matric potential biochar effects on interpores did not alter the available water capacity the plant available water retained between field capacity and the permanent wilting point in addition liu et al 2017 did not measure the intrapore volume distribution of their biochars and were therefore unable to independently predict changes in available water capacity before biochar amendment the development and testing of a method to predict the magnitude and direction increase or decrease of changes to available water capacity with biochar amendment was an important objective of our work in a similar study a pinewood biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c was separated into unsieved fine 2 mm and coarse 2 mm size fractions and amended to a uniform sand d 50 0 90 mm at 0 5 and 10 v v trifunovic et al 2018 while measurements showed that biochar significantly affected water retention the most significant increases occurred for fine biochar which was attributed to the fine biochar filling large interpores between sand particles that created more intermediate sized pores that retained water via capillarity the effect of biochar amendment on available water capacity was not evaluated in their study since samples were not subjected to sufficiently small matric potentials while their experiments helped to elucidate the mechanisms by which biochar alters water retention trifunovic et al 2018 were also unable to independently predict changes in water retention due to biochar amendment many studies demonstrate the influence of biochar amendment on water retention and some have fitted the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 to describe these data abel et al 2013 liu et al 2017 however we are aware of no model that can predict the impact of biochar amendment on water retention as most studies have been observational abel et al 2013 arthur et al 2015 liu et al 2017 marsiello et al 2015 sun et al 2013 the recent efforts elucidating the mechanisms by which biochar amendment alters water retention liu et al 2017 trifunovic et al 2018 were unable to predict changes in water retention at specific capillary pressures with biochar addition since the intrapore volume distributions of biochar were not quantified we are aware of no model to predict the change in water retention including the change in field capacity wilting point or available water capacity if a particular biochar is amended to a given soil at a prescribed application rate development of such a model will result in an improved understanding of biochar s impact on water retention and guide the selection of biochar and the biochar application rates when increases in water retention are desired models to predict the swc for soil include mechanistic and empirical models brooks and corey 1964 campbell 1974 van genuchten 1980 fitted to a finite number of equilibrium matric potential water content measurements to describe the entire swc in a second approach measured soil properties are used in pedotransfer functions ptfs to predict swc for particular soil classes rawls and brakensiek 1982 schaap and leij 1998 to predict swc at particular matric potentials rajkai and varallyay 1992 rawls et al 1983 or to estimate the parameters in the swc models rawls and brakensiek 1982 a third approach was introduced by arya and paris 1981 who observed the similarity between particle size distributions psds and swc data here the mass fraction of particles associated with each soil size fraction usually at least 20 was used to estimate the pore volume associated with that soil size fraction assuming a cube shaped assemblage of particles with the bulk and particle densities of the assemblage identical to those measured for the natural sample the pore volume for each soil size fraction was represented with uniform size capillary tubes the pore radius of the capillary tubes was estimated assuming particles were spherical and the equivalent pore length was a function of the number of particles particle radius and a scaling parameter α the scaling parameter accounts for nonspherical soil particles with various shapes sizes and orientations the pore radius was then used to determine an equivalent soil water pressure for the pore volume formed from each soil size fraction using the young laplace equation jury et al 1991 in the original model the scaling parameter α was constant and determined empirically arya lalit m and paris 1981 more recently an alternative formulation for predicting the equivalent pore radius of each soil size fraction was developed that uses only information from the psd particle density and bulk density of the natural sample arya lalit m and heitman 2015 arya and heitman 2015 concluded that this new model without empirical parameters predicted swc with similar accuracy as the earlier approaches many other models for predicting swc using psds have been proposed chan and govindaraju 2004 haverkamp and parlange 1986 mishra et al 2003 mohammadi and vanclooster 2011 sakai 1994 the purpose of this work was to develop a model to predict changes in swc for a soil amended with biochar by accounting for biochar s separate influence on water retained in intrapores and interpores such a model would allow screening of biochars best suited for increasing water retention in a particular soil or stormwater treatment medium and provide a means to estimate the magnitude of the change in available water capacity if biochar was amended at a particular mass fraction experiments testing the model were conducted in both coarse and fine media and fill a gap in previous mechanistic studies liu et al 2017 trifunovic et al 2018 where biochar alterations of interpores did not affect the available water capacity or this effect was not measured for the model developed herein biochar s contributions to water stored in biochar intrapores in a biochar soil mixture were accounted for by measurement of water retained by pure biochar in the dry region of the swc defined operationally for this study as 3 8 pf 6 5 0 62 mpa matric potential 310 mpa these measurements account for water retained by adsorption onto surfaces absorption into organic matter and capillary retention in small intrapores mercury invasion porosimetry mip measurements were used to account for water retained in large intrapores by capillarity pf 3 8 to estimate biochar s impact on capillary water retained in the interpores of a biochar soil mixture the arya paris model first proposed by arya and paris arya lalit m and paris 1981 and later amended arya lalit m and heitman 2015 was selected and modified in this study this model was chosen over other models relating psd to swc because it uses information from the psd particle density and bulk density of the natural sample arya lalit m and heitman 2015 without relying on empirical parameters as earlier approaches arya lalit m and paris 1981 arya lm et al 1999 the arya paris model predicted swc with reasonable accuracy for 41 soils from the unsoda hydraulic properties database including 9 clay soils 12 loams 9 sandy loams and 11 sands arya lalit m and heitman 2015 the model developed herein excludes biochar s impact on air water interfacial tension and contact angle through dissolution of solutes e g yi et al 2015 clogging of biochar intrapores and changes in biochar particle size and porosity through weathering although these effects are discussed with this model the volumetric water content retained in a biochar soil mixture at each capillary pressure step is determined by summing the volumetric water content from 1 the natural soil without biochar addition cm3 cm 3 2 the change in intrapore water for 3 8 pf 6 5 due primarily to changes in sorbed water δθ intra sorb cm3 cm 3 3 the additional intrapore capillary water within biochar for pf 3 8 cm3 cm 3 and 4 the change in water stored in interpores cm3 cm 3 as shown below this model combined with appropriate laboratory data can be used to predict changes in water retention in biochar amended soil 2 theory 2 1 intrapore water for 3 8 pf 6 5 the intrapores of soil and biochar particles may retain both sorbed and capillary water for soil capillary water will be completely drained from pores formed by silt at pf 3 8 0 6 mpa and somewhere above pf 3 8 0 6 mpa for pores formed from clay and organic matter jensen et al 2015 at pf 5 9 8 mpa capillarity is negligible tuller and or 2005 thus water retained in intrapores over 3 8 pf 6 5 in our soil samples sand sandy loam is primarily retained by sorption including by organic matter and this water was measured using a dew point potentiometer described below the lower and upper pf limits specified here were selected based on instrument precision and accuracy decagon devices 2013 gubiani et al 2013 the water retained in a biochar soil mixture at 3 8 pf 6 5 can be estimated by using the water retained in the soil and biochar measured separately at each matric potential and the mass fraction of biochar and soil in the mixture 1 mc i m m s mc i s m bc mc i bc m s m bc where mc i m mc i s and mc i bc are moisture content g g 1 of the biochar soil mixture soil without biochar and biochar respectively at matric potential i and m bc and m s are dry mass of biochar and soil respectively in the biochar soil mixture a dew point potentiometer was used to measure the matric potential of soil and biochar samples prepared at different moisture contents which are used in eq 1 to estimate the moisture content of biochar soil mixtures to obtain the volumetric water content associated with water retention at each matric potential θ i intra sorb cm3 cm 3 eq 1 is divided by water density ρ w g cm 3 and multiplied by the dry bulk density ρ b m t m v t g cm 3 of the biochar soil mixture where m t m is the total dry mass g and v t is the total sample volume cm3 the change in water retention due to biochar amendment at 3 8 pf 6 5 is then the difference between this volumetric water content and that for the natural soil at step i 2 δ θ i intra sorb mc i m m t m mc i s m t s ρ w v t 2 2 intrapore water for pf 3 8 in addition to water sorbed or filling small cavities at pf 3 8 additional water may fill the cavities of large biochar intrapores the additional water retained in a biochar intrapores at pf 3 8 can be estimated by using the mip measurements of 100 biochar restricted to this pf range where care must be exercised to exclude interpore volume with these measurements described below and the known mass of biochar in a biochar soil mixture the additional intrapore water retained at matric potential i due to biochar amendment is determined from 3 δ θ i intra cap m bc v t j p f i v j intra where v j intra is the specific intrapore volume ml g 1 filled with water and determined by mip at the jth matric potential increment and pf 3 8 is the lower limit of detection of the dew point potentiometer in order to determine v j intra at a particular matric potential from mip data estimates of the contact angles of mercury and water in biochar intrapores are needed described below m bc and v t are based on biochar application rates 2 3 interpore water to predict the influence of biochar amendment on water retained in interpores δ θ i inter the arya paris model first proposed by arya and paris 1981 and later amended arya lalit m and heitman 2015 was adopted and modified for biochar soil mixtures particle density is an important parameter in the arya paris model and was assumed uniform for all soil particles in their model arya lalit m and paris 1981 however biochars are significantly less dense than soil particles envelope density which is the appropriate particle density to use in the arya paris model ranging from 0 25 0 6 g cm3 brewer et al 2014 for biochar and is 4 to 10 times smaller than soil particle density 2 65 g cm3 to account for the variability of particle densities a volume weighted particle density was determined because pore radii in the arya paris model are correlated to the number and size of spherical particles in a given size fraction arya lalit m and paris 1981 arya lalit m and heitman 2015 the volume weighted particle density is then defined as 4 ρ s i m v i bc ρ s bc v i s ρ s s v i bc v i s where ρ s i m is the volume weighted particle density g cm 3 of the mixture for size fraction i ρ s bc and ρ s s are envelope densities g cm 3 of biochar and soil particles respectively and v i bc and v i s are the volume ml of biochar and soil particles respectively in size fraction i these volumes are determined from 5 v i b c m i b c ρ s b c and v i s m i s ρ s s where m i bc and m i s are the mass g of biochar and soil respectively in each size fraction obtained from psd substituting eq 5 into 4 the particle density of the biochar soil mixture for size fraction i can also be expressed as 6 ρ s i m m i bc m i s m i bc ρ s bc m i s ρ s s the arya paris model also requires the sample void ratio ε cm3 cm 3 that is computed from 7 ε ρ s ρ b ρ b where ρ s is the average particle density g cm 3 of the entire sample 8 ρ s m bc m s m bc ρ s bc m s ρ s s and m bc and m s are the total dry mass g of biochar and soil respectively in the biochar soil mixture with these definitions the fraction of the total particle volume of the mixture v i m cm3 cm3 associated with size fraction i is 9 v i m m i bc ρ s bc m i s ρ s s ρ s m t m where m t m m s m bc is the total mixture mass g in the modified arya paris model the interpore volume created by each particle size class is assumed proportional to the volume of particles in that size class with this assumption the volumetric water content retained in pores associated with particle size fraction i of the mixture θ i m cm3 cm 3 is obtained from successive summations of water filled pore volumes for that particle class and smaller 10 θ i m ϕ m s w m j 1 i v j m where ϕ m is the total interparticle porosity cm3 cm 3 of the mixture not total porosity expressed as 11 ϕ m ε 1 ε and s w m is the ratio of the measured saturated water content to theoretical total porosity cm3 cm 3 and accounts for air entrapment arya lm et al 1999 subscript j is the index for particle size fraction and begins with the smallest particle class i eq 10 is applied to each particle size fraction i to determine the volumetric water content associated with water filled pores created by particles in that size class and smaller to obtain the matric potential associated with water retained in pores associated with particle size class i the number of particles in each size class i n i is determined for each size class 12 n i 3 m t i m 4 π ρ s i m r i 3 where m t i m m i bc m i s is the total mass g of particles in size class i and r i is the mean particle radius cm of size class i the pore radius for each size class i r i cm is then estimated using a relationship that combines the attributes of natural packed soil structure with those of a counterpart hypothetical structure consisting of spherical particles arya lalit m and heitman 2015 13 r i 0 0717 ϕ m m t i m ρ b n i 4 3 r i the matric potential associated with water retained for particle size class i θ i m is then determined from h i 2 γ cos θ ρ w g r i where γ is the air water interfacial tension dyne cm 1 θ is the contact angle ρ w is density of water g cm 3 and g is the gravitational constant this matric potential h i is then used with the volumetric water content θ i m from eq 10 to determine swc data in the application described below γ and θ are assumed the same for soil and biochar amended soil although any differences can be accounted for in the expression for h i this modified arya paris model is used to estimate the change in water retention due to change in interpores with biochar amendment the model is applied first to natural soil and then to the biochar soil mixture using the same particle size classes for each medium next the estimated change in interpore space associated with biochar amendment at each matric potential i is determined from 14 δ θ i inter θ i m θ i s where δ θ i inter is the change in water retention due to change in interpores from the biochar addition cm3 cm 3 and θ i m and θ i s are the modified arya paris model predicted volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 retained in the biochar soil mixture and natural soil respectively in applying these models to predict water retention for pf 3 8 the entire particle size distribution including data from sieve analysis and hydrometer measurements are used 2 4 models for water retention in biochar amended media to evaluate the different mechanisms that alter water retention with biochar addition four separate models were used in this study when examined in combination these models illustrate biochar s influence on water retention through alteration of a soil s

of biochar intrapores is accounted for in model 3 δ θ i intra cap while the contact angle of the outer particle surfaces is accounted for in model 4 δ θ i inter experiments described below were used to test the hypothesis that model 4 is sufficient to describe changes in water retention when biochar is amended to soils statistical measures to evaluate model fits are described in supplemental materials these models use several measured properties of biochar and soil but do not use any model fitted parameters 3 materials and methods 3 1 biochars two biochars were tested in this study poultry litter biochar plbc produced from poultry litter using a slow pyrolysis system at 300⁰c song and guo 2012 and soil reef biochar srbc produced by heating southern yellow pine in a continuous pyrolysis system at 550 c for 10 min the biochar company in berwyn pa usa additional information regarding the production and elemental composition of these biochars is found elsewhere song and guo 2012 teixido et al 2011 the biochars were rinsed in water to remove water soluble compounds and oven dried steps that in prior work were shown to remove hydrophobicity yi et al 2015 each biochar was separately rinsed in deionized di water three to four times at 1 50 ratio biochar to di water at 50 rpm until the electrical conductivity of the rinsate was 100 µs cm 1 the rinsed biochars were oven dried at 105 c for 12 to 15 h and cooled to room temperature both water drop penetration test 1 2 sec and the contact angle measurements 0 3 letey et al 2000 yi et al 2015 confirmed that biochars were water wetting and contact angles of 0 0 were assumed in all analyses the biochar samples were then separately sieved between 30 0 595 mm opening and 35 0 5 mm opening mesh resulting in particles with a geometric mean diameter of 0 545 mm the post treated biochars are referred to as plbc and srbc while samples that were sieved but not rinsed with water and oven dried are referred to as fresh plbc or fresh srbc uniform size biochar particles were used here to separately evaluate the effect of biochar intrapores on water retention which is discussed below following similar treatment procedures a well characterized sand 30 40 accusand unimin co le sueur mn usa was rinsed in di water until the water turned clear oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and then sieved to a geometric mean diameter of 0 545

crushed using a mortar and pestle to remove aggregates experiments in mixtures of biochar and sandy loam include biochar s effect on both intrapores and interpores the plbc and srbc were mixed separately with sand at 2 and 7 w w and designated as 2 plbc sand 7 plbc sand 2 srbc sand and 7 srbc sand because sand and biochar particles were sieved to the same size fraction the biochar sand mixtures were intended to have minimal change in interpores from biochar amendment thus the biochar sand mixtures primarily tested the effect of biochar on sorbed and capillary water in intrapores the sandy loam sl was also mixed with biochars at 2 and 7 w w and identified as 2 plbc sl 7 plbc sl 2 srbc sl and 7 srbc sl depending on the mass fraction of plbc or srbc these plbc and srbc samples mixed with sl represent samples where both intrapore and interpore spaces were modified with biochar amendment 3 2 biochar particle density surface area and intrapore volume duplicate samples of plbc and

particle size distribution particle size distributions were obtained for sl using standard methods astm standard c136 06 2003 astm standard d7928 17 2017 and plotted as both mass and volume distributions using the density of sand sl envelope density of biochar and mass based psds for these materials the volume based psds for each material were determined and these used to calculate the volume based psds for each biochar soil mixture while mass based psds are more traditionally reported volume based distributions illustrate particle volume changes due to biochar amendment and may be more appropriate for use in the modified arya paris model as discussed above 3 4 intrapore water for 3 8 pf 6 5 a wp4c dew point potentiometer decagon pullman wa usa was used to obtain data to estimate δ θ i i n t r a s o r b for 3 8 pf 6 5 here the matric potential h i must be determined for various sample moisture contents to determine δ θ i i n t r a s o r b experimental procedures from the instrument manufacturer were followed to obtain the sorption and desorption isotherms for 3 8 pf 6 5 for all samples and sample mixtures plbc srbc sand 2 plbc sand 7 plbc sand 2 srbc sand 7 srbc sand sl 2 plbc sl 7 plbc sl 2 srbc sl and 7 srbc sl the number of independent samples used for each medium was large and varied for example biochar sorption data were collected from 9 or 10 samples of plbc or srbc respectively while biochar soil sorption data were collected from 47 samples of 7 plbc sl the average sample volume was 10 0 ml 0 1 standard error and measurement temperatures ranged from 19 23 c wp4c measurements determine the total water potential associated with sample gravimetric moisture content mc i for plbc only data indicated that osmotic effects were important and the measured total potential was corrected for osmotic effects following a procedure consistent with the manufacturer s guidelines decagon devices 2013 and discussed in supplemental materials 3 5 interpore water pf 3 8 the sand and biochar sand mixtures were tightly packed dry by pouring dry sand or biochar sand mixtures into a two layer nest of screens and then into aluminum cores 7 7 cm inside diameter 3 6 cm height to pack sl and biochar sl mixtures 1 cm thick layers of sample mixtures were dry packed in aluminum cores 5 4 cm inside diameter 3 0 cm height all samples were prepared in duplicate the sample cores were placed in a plastic bin and then slowly saturated from below with degassed di water until the water level reached slightly below the height of sample cores the plastic bin was then covered overnight to saturate the samples swc for pf 3 8 were measured by draining the saturated sample cores the water saturated sand and biochar sand mixtures were placed on a tension table dane and topp 2002 topp and zebchuk 1979 and matric potentials of 3 7 17 22 27 37 and 57 cm h2o were applied until equilibrium was reached with each step defined as a mass change 1 over 8 12 h period following tension table measurements samples were transferred to a pressure plate extractor 15 bar ceramic plate extractor soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa and matric potentials of 129 256 383 510 764 1400 3500 and 6330 cm h2o were applied sequentially to the samples samples were weighed through time at each pressure step until equilibrium was reached which was defined as mass change 1 over 3 4 d equilibration time due to the different equilibration times of sand and sl swc for sl mixtures were measured separately saturated sl samples were placed on a tension table at 6 5 and at 21 5 cm h2o samples were weighed through time at each pressure step until equilibrium was reached which was defined as mass change 1 over 2 4 d the samples were then transferred to the pressure plate extractor and matric potentials of 70 3 246 492 1000 1500 2100 and 5200 cm h2o applied sequentially to the samples sample equilibration times ranged from 6 d h 70 3 cm h2o to 31 d h 5200 cm h2o and were determined by sample mass changes 1 between successive measurements all samples were measured at ambient temperature 19 23 c as described above sample volumes for swc data collected from the wp4c tension table and pressure plate extractor varied and ranged from 10 0 0 1 ml for wp4c measurements to 168 and 68 8 ml for sand and sl samples respectively in the tension table and pressure plate extractor as will be shown below the smaller sample size for the wp4c measurements resulted in a relatively large variation in data for biochar soil mixtures using this instrument in these mixed samples biochar content was small 2 or 7 by mass and resulted in significant variability in water retention data much less variability was observed for wp4c measurements in pure biochar or soil 4 results and discussion 4 1 particle densities and specific surface area biochar envelope densities determined from mip measurements were ρ s bc 1 25 0 03 g cm 3 and 0 65 0 01 g cm 3 for plbc and srbc respectively because the envelope density is 1 9 times larger for plbc than srbc amending a soil with the same biochar mass will result in 80 more srbc than plbc particles if a soil is amended with a fixed mass of biochar srbc amendment is likely to have a more significant effect than plbc on interpores between particles since a larger volume of biochar would be added the skeletal densities for plbc and srbc were ρ sk bc 1 72 0 04 g cm 3 and 1 39 0 03 g cm 3 for plbc and srbc respectively and reflect the higher mineral content in biochar produced from poultry litter plbc than wood srbc from pycnometer measurements for sand and sl the skeletal density assumed equal to envelope density was 2 66 0 01 g ml 1 and 2 42 0 02 g ml 1 for sand and sl respectively the rinsing of biochars with di water increased ssa from 0 8 0 2 m2 g 1 to 1 53 0 15 m2 g 1 and from 41 19 m2 g 1 to 350 30 m2 g 1 for plbc and srbc respectively because higher ssa indicates more sorption sites srbc was expected to sorb significantly more water than plbc and thus retain more water at the dry end of the swc typical sem images of plbc and srbc biochars are shown in figure s1 in supplemental materials from the analysis of these and other images the largest pores are 33 µm in diameter for both biochars while intrusion pressures were measured for mercury they were converted to pf for water entry into air filled biochar assuming a contact angle of 0o and 130o giesche 2006 for air water and air mercury systems respectively the young laplace equation was then used to estimate the pore diameter at each intrusion pressure step assuming cylindrical pores cumulative invaded volumes are plotted against pf air water system in fig 1 a and invaded pore volumes associated with equivalent pore diameters are plotted in fig 1b the plotted pore diameter range 33 μm 0 1 μm represents the pressure range 1 9 pf 4 4 most of the intrapore volume occurs between 1 9 pf 4 4 for plbc and 1 9 pf 3 5 for srbc which is the range of matric pressures over which most biochar intrapores are filled by capillary forces the intrapore filling was linear for plbc and sigmoidal for srbc indicating that srbc intrapore volume is not distributed uniformly across pore sizes fig 1a the total intrapore volume was 0 23 0 01 cm3 g 1 for plbc and 0 83 0 01 cm3 g 1 for srbc which is consistent with the higher ssa measured for srbc in addition to retaining almost 4 times as much water in intrapores than plbc most of the water retained within srbc intrapores accessed by mip is accessible at matric potentials above the wilting point pf 4 2 and thus plant available thus srbc amendment to soils is expected to be more beneficial for water retention than equal quantities of plbc while mip measurements determined intrapore volume up to pf 6 data were only used in the water retention model for pf 3 8 since dew point potentiometer measurements characterized water retention accurately for 3 8 pf 6 5 4 2 particle size distribution while the addition of plbc or srbc to sand was not expected to change the psd since sand and biochar particles were sieved to the same size biochar amendment to sl would alter particle and pore size distributions the psd was measured for sl and computed for biochar sl mixtures using measured psd for sl and biochar particles sizes and envelop densities the psds of sl and biochar amended sl were used in model 4 to calculate δ θ i inter and are plotted by volume in fig 2 a and b for plbc sl and srbc sl respectively and by mass in figure s2 in supplemental materials while it is more traditional to plot psds by mass the wide difference in envelop density of biochar and soil particles factor of 2 results in a mass based psd that does not reflect the distribution of particle volumes the relative volume of different particle sizes in a soil sample control the pore structure and capillary water retention because srbc contributes about 48 more particles by volume than plbc at 7 w w amendment srbc addition shifted the volume based psd mean particle diameter from d 50 0 27 mm to d 50 0 95 mm fig 2 while pblc addition increased it less to d 50 0 40 mm 4 3 porosity using the measured dry bulk densities of biochar sand and biochar sl mixtures in the water retention cells biochar envelope and skeletal densities and the particle densities of sand and sl interpore porosities of the water retention cell samples were computed and are reported in table 1 adding biochar to sand sieved to the same particle diameter increased interpore volume from 2 6 to 6 9 which is likely due to the elongated shape of some biochar particles compared to the more spherically shaped sand particles figure s7 increases in interpore porosity also occurred for 2 amendments to sl where interpore porosity increased from 0 8 to 4 8 at 7 biochar addition to sl though interpore porosity increased by 1 0 but decreased by 1 7 for plbc and srbc respectively changes in interpore porosity in sl due to amendment of relatively large biochar particles 0 545 mm d 0 595 mm were likely mitigated by the presence of small grains that filled larger pores while amendment of 7 srbc decreased interpores in sl total porosities were increased for all biochar amendments in both sand and sl on a relative basis total porosities increased most for biochar amended sand increasing by 13 5 and 27 0 for 7 plbc and srbc respectively similarly 7 biochar amendment to sl resulted in a 6 1 and 16 2 increase in total porosity for plbc and srbc respectively these results illustrate two factors affecting total sample porosity 1 plbc had smaller intrapore volume than srbc so equal masses added to sand where there was minimal change in interpore porosity resulted in smaller increases in total porosity for plbc than srbc amendment and 2 although srbc reduced interpore porosity at 7 amendment in sl the contribution of intrapore porosity offset this reduction causing a net increase in total sample porosity as will be shown below the interplay between intrapore and interpore volume affects water retention in biochar amended media 4 4 water retention pf 3 8 the sorption and desorption isotherms of rinsed biochar no soil are discussed in supplemental materials for pf 3 8 where sorption of water to surfaces is presumed to be the primary mechanism for water retention hysteresis in sorption was not observed for these biochars figure s4 while it has occurred for other biochar studies arthur et al 2015 sorption isotherms were also measured for sand and sl and for these media amended with 2 and 7 plbc srbc and water sorption data for plbc sand and srbc sand are shown in fig 3 measured water potential is plotted against volumetric water content θ sorb mc m t m v t ρ w of packed samples in the tension table and the pressure plate extractor sorption onto sand alone was negligible while amendment with plbc and srbc increased water sorption dramatically to estimate mc and θ sorb of these biochar amended sands mc for plbc srbc and sand measured separately were used in eq 1 and 2 to generate the model predictions in fig 3 corrections for osmotic pressures were not needed in model predictions for plbc sand mixtures because the mass fractions of plbc were sufficiently small that osmotic effects were not observed in the data the simple mixing model performed reasonably well for 2 plbc sand but over predicted sorbed water for 7 plbc sand at low pf the scatter in data is much more significant for water sorption onto plbc sand mixtures than measurements of plbc or sand alone which may be due to limitations in achieving a representative sample with the 10 0 0 1 cm3 sample volume of the dew point potentiometer with biochar mass fractions of 2 and 7 water sorption isotherms for srbc amended to sand are shown in fig 3b the root mean square error rmse for model predictions of θ sorb in all biochar sand mixtures were 0 413 rmse 0 961 water sorption isotherms for 2 and 7 plbc sl and srbc sl mixtures along with model predictions are shown in figures s5 and s6 while overall model predictions captured the effect of biochar amendment on water sorption just as in biochar amended sand there was significant scatter in the data and 0 210 rmse 0 304 over all biochar sl mixtures the data and model predictions shown in fig 3 and supplemental materials were used for the sorption regions of the swc θ intra sorb reported below for biochar soil mixtures 4 5 soil water characteristic model 4 5 1 plbc in sand swc s for sand and plbc sand are shown in fig 4 and combined measurements from tension table pressure plate extractor and dew point potentiometer all plots show a solid black line that connects mean water retention data for sand alone while the open and filled symbols are data from duplicate packings of 2 and 7 plbc sand respectively amendment of sand with plbc increased water retention for the entire range of matric potentials with significant increases in water retention at the dry end pf 5 but the largest increases near saturation at pf 1 as expected 7 plbc sand increased water retention by approximately 3 times as much as 2 plbc sand because sand and plbc were sieved to the same size plbc increased water retention primarily by retaining more water in biochar intrapores by sorption and capillarity figs 4b and c the effect on interpores was expected to be small the red vertical dashed line in fig 4a represents the air entry value for biochar intrapores estimated from sem and mip measurements to the right of this line the volume of water retained in biochar intrapores ml water retained per g biochar determined by mip is shown solid red line and represents water retained primarily by capillary forces the most significant contributions of biochar intrapores to water retention was between 1 9 pf 3 8 according to mip measurements also shown in fig 4 are predictions for water retention for the three water retention models model 1 is the reference model which is the swc for natural soil eq 15 in this case sand without biochar model 1 is shown in fig 4a for the 2 and 7 plbc sand as dashed and solid blue lines respectively that in this case overlap completely with the black line for sand data model 2 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 eq 16 model 2 is shown in fig 4b for the 2 and 7 plbc sand as dashed and solid blue lines respectively model 2 significantly improves the prediction of water retention for pf 3 with less accurate model predictions for pf 3 model 3 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 by capillarity for pf 3 8 eq 17 model 3 is shown in fig 4c for the 2 and 7 plbc sand as dashed and solid blue lines respectively while model 3 significantly improves the prediction of water retention near water saturation for pf 1 5 this model overpredicts water retention particularly for 7 plbc sand for 1 5 pf 3 8 model 3 was expected to be the most accurate and the overprediction of water retention for 1 5 pf 3 8 for 7 plbc sand was unexpected this overprediction may have been due to a slight change in water retention in interpores in this region with biochar addition table 1 plbc particles are more irregularly shaped than sand figure s7 yi et al 2015 and although both plbc and sand were sieved to the same size small changes in interpore volume occurred the irregular shape of biochar particles and their effect on interpore volume is not accounted for by model 3 nevertheless accounting for only the effect of biochar intrapores on water retention sorption capillary retention provided reasonable estimates of the influence of plbc amendment on water retention of the three models evaluated models 2 and 3 performed similarly and reduced rmse by 50 from model 1 for both 2 and 7 plbc amendment table 2 4 5 2 srbc in sand experiments in sand amended with srbc illustrate the effect of a significantly larger biochar intrapore volume on swcs for sand and results are shown in fig 5 with similar definitions for lines and data symbols as in fig 4 while plbc increased volumetric water content at saturation and total porosity to 0 395 at 7 amendment srbc increased total porosity to 0 442 at this same application rate table 1 this is because the intrapore volume in srbc is almost 4 times larger than that for plbc similar to plbc amendment amendment of sand with srbc increased water retention for the entire range of matric potentials with 7 srbc sand increasing water retention approximately 3 times as much as 2 srbc sand the volume of water retained primarily by capillarity in biochar intrapores and determined by mip is shown in fig 5a solid red line the most significant contributions of biochar intrapores to water retention was between 1 9 pf 3 3 according to mip measurements over this same range significant increases in water retention occurred for 2 and 7 srbc sand which indicates the significant role of capillary water in biochar intrapores in increasing water retention predictions from the three water retention models are also shown in fig 5 model 1 is the swc for natural soil eq 15 and overlaps the sand data in fig 5a model 2 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in water intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 eq 16 and is shown in fig 5b model 2 significantly improves the prediction of water retention for pf 4 with less accurate model predictions for pf 4 this is reasonable since the effect of capillary water retained in biochar intrapores for pf 3 8 is not accounted for in model 2 model 3 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 by capillarity for pf 3 8 eq 17 model 3 is shown in fig 5c and significantly improves the prediction of water retention for pf 4 for 2 and 7 srbc sand however model 3 underestimated water retention for 3 pf 4 for 7 srbc sand which was not observed for 2 srbc sand the cause for discrepancy between model 3 and data in this region is uncertain overall model 3 that included water retained in biochar intrapores by sorption and capillarity performed best rmses were 30 smaller for model 2 than model 1 but 50 smaller for model 3 than model 1 table 2 4 5 3 plbc in sandy loam the results for water retention in plbc and srbc amended to sand demonstrate that when biochar primarily affects intrapores these effects can be accounted for with reasonable accuracy using information obtained from dew point potentiometry primarily sorbed water in biochar intrapores and mip capillary water in biochar intrapores water retention measurements in biochar amended sl however were expected to reflect changes in water retention from both intrapores and interpores these experiments allowed evaluation of model 4 which predicts the effect of biochar amendment on water retention in intrapores and interpores swcs for sl and plbc sl are shown in fig 6 the influence of plbc amendment on water retention was much less significant than observed in plbc sand samples fig 4 the much smaller impact of plbc amendment occurred because large plbc particles amended to sl resulted in a wider range of grain sizes allowing more effective packing and smaller increases in interpore volume while plbc amendment increased total porosity from 0 396 sl to 0 405 2 plbc sl and 0 420 7 plbc sl interpore porosity increased less from 0 396 sl to 0 399 2 plbc sl and 0 400 7 plbc sl in sand plbc amendment increased interpore porosity more significantly from 0 348 sand alone to 0 357 2 plbc sand and 0 372 7 plbc sand thus the beneficial effect of biochar intrapores providing additional pore space were less significant in plbc sl mixtures since the impact of biochar amendment on interpore porosity was smaller these results illustrate the interplay between biochar intrapore volume biochar particle size and natural soil psd application of 2 and 7 plbc to sl increased water retention for pf 3 5 which is due to increased sorption of water over 3 8 pf 6 5 this is more readily seen in figure s5 where only data in this range are plotted however over 2 2 pf 3 1 biochar amendment reduced water retention this reduction is primarily due to the reduction in water retained in interpores the volume based psd shown in fig 2a indicates that addition of plbc to sl reduces particle volumes for particle diameters between 0 004 0 5 mm less particle volume results in less water retained in interpores associated with these size fractions according to the modified arya paris model eq 10 for smaller matric potentials 0 5 pf 2 2 the impact of plbc amendment on water retention is mixed amendment with 2 plbc reduces water retention while amendment with 7 plbc increases retention differences in water retention between sl 2 plbc sl and 7 plbc sl in this region are primarily associated with differences in total porosity and air entrapment while amendment with 2 and 7 plbc increased total porosity water retention was less for 2 plbc amendment than sl because air entrapment was more significant the measured water saturation at pf 1 was s w m 0 88 for 2 plbc sl but s w m 0 93 for sl air entrapment for 7 plbc sl was similar to that for sl s w m 0 92 air entrapment is accounted for in the modified arya paris model by using measured s w m in eq 10 predictions from the water retention models are shown in fig 6 with rmses for model fits reported in table 2 model 1 is the swc for the natural soil and in some regions falls above and in other regions below water retention data for 2 and 7 plbc sl thus biochar amendment enhanced water retention for some pf while in other regions it reduced it models 2 and 3 account for the influence of water sorption models 2 and 3 and capillary water retention model 3 in plbc intrapores rmse decreased from 0 016 and 0 019 for model 1 to 0 015 and 0 015 for model 2 but increased to 0 017 and 0 020 for model 3 in 2 and 7 plbc sand respectively thus accounting for the effect of plbc on water retention in biochar intrapores was inadequate for improving predictions of water retention in plbc amended sl when model 4 was employed that includes plbc s influence on both intrapores sorbed and capillary water and interpores modified arya paris model using the psd model predictions were significantly improved with rmses decreasing from model 1 by 44 and 42 for 2 and 7 plbc respectively as noted above total sample porosities for plbc sl samples were larger than measured volumetric water contents at saturation for both 2 and 7 amendments due to air entrapment if air entrapment was not accounted for model 4 would perform more poorly and would over predict water retention at small pf 4 5 4 srbc in sandy loam experiments in sl amended with plbc and srbc illustrate the effect of changes in water retention due to water stored in biochar intrapore volume and in the interpores of the biochar amended medium while plbc and srbc were expected have similar effects on interpores in sl since srbc s intrapore volume is 4 times larger than plbc srbc sl experiments were expected to more dramatically illustrate the influence of biochar intrapores on water retention swcs for sl and srbc sl are shown in fig 7 similar to plbc the influence of srbc amendment on water retention in sl was much less than in sand fig 5 while biochar amendment increased intrapore volume in both media interpore volume decreased slightly 2 srbc sl or decreased significantly 7 srbc sl when srbc amended sl although plbc and srbc were sieved to the same size the more elongated shapes of srbc particles figure s7 caused different effects on interpore volume while 2 plbc amendment reduced water retention in sl over a wide pf range 0 5 pf 3 5 2 srbc amendment decreased water retention only for 2 5 pf 3 5 overall water retention was improved more significantly with srbc than plbc amendment because of the greater intrapore volume of srbc and smaller air entrapment at pf 1 predictions from the water retention models are shown in fig 7 with rmses for model fits reported in table 2 similar to plbc sl mixtures including water retained by sorption and capillarity in srbc intrapores models 2 and 3 resulted in only modest improvement to fits of 2 srbc sl data when model 4 was employed that included srbc s influence on both intrapores sorbed and capillary water and interpores modified arya paris model model fits were significantly improved with rmses decreasing from model 1 by 33 and 46 for 2 and 7 srbc respectively model 3 that only accounts for biochar intrapores overpredicted water retention between 2 pf 3 5 but application of model 4 that accounts for the reduction clogging of soil interpores by biochar particles reduced the predicted water retention and improved the match to data similar to plbc sl mixtures because srbc alters water storage in both biochar intrapores and the interpores of the biochar soil mixture it is necessary to account for both effects to accurately predict the influence of biochar amendment on water retention it is important to note that the improvement in the model 4 prediction is due to two effects accounting for changes in interpore volume and air entrapment at pf 1 changes in interpore volume were estimated with the modified arya paris model using the biochar and soil psds particle densities and dry bulk density this information can be readily measured or estimated for most biochar soil mixtures while air entrapment can be determined directly from water retention measurements it is difficult to predict a priori for the pblc sl samples air entrapment was significant while in srbc sl this correction had a minor influence on model 4 results for situations where biochar amendment results in significant changes in air entrapment this effect may be difficult to predict 4 6 available water capacity available water capacity can be defined as the volumetric water content retained between field capacity pf 1 8 0 062 mpa and wilting point pf 4 2 1 55 mpa and has been used as a measure of biochar amendment on water retention abel et al 2013 kerre et al 2017 the available water capacity was determined for the samples in this study using measurements and predictions from model 4 where the contribution from δ θ i inter was negligible for biochar sand mixtures the predicted versus measured change in available water capacity is plotted for sample averages in fig 8 the available water capacity increased with biochar amendment to sand where higher available water capacity 0 03 to 0 07 was found in mixtures with higher biochar content however in biochar sl mixtures available water capacity decreased with plbc amendment 0 01 to 0 02 the available water capacity decreased with plbc amendment to sl but increased with srbc amendment since the water stored in intrapores was 4 times larger in srbc than plbc which offset the reduction in available water capacity from the reduction in interpore volume 7 srbc sl as shown in fig 8 model 4 was able to predict the direction and magnitude of the observed changes in available water capacity reasonably well for all but the 2 and 7 plbc sl mixtures biochar amendment resulted in an increase in available water content model 4 was able to predict the increases in available water capacity when plbc was amended to sand and the decreases when it was amended to sl model predictions of the change in available water capacity with biochar amendment for the eight biochar soil combinations had an average absolute error of 0 017 0 006 and an average relative error of 1 0 0 40 model 4 may be used to estimate the change in available water capacity for any biochar amended soil where the biochar is assumed to have sufficient environmental exposure to be hydrophilic kinney et al 2012 three types of biochar measurements are needed dew point potentiometry data quantifying water retained in water rinsed biochar at pf 4 2 figure s4 mip data quantifying biochar intrapore volume pore entry pressures and biochar particle densities fig 1 and psd from sieve and hydrometer measurements fig 2 mip data may be the most challenging to obtain although commercial laboratories can provide these measurements for 700us for soil the wilting point particle density and the psd are required along with the dry bulk density and entrapped air saturation of the soil before and after biochar amendment the dry bulk density and entrapped air saturation might be the most difficult to estimate for biochar amended media model 4 may hold promise as a screening tool to select appropriate biochars for improving the available water capacity of particular soils or stormwater treatment media first the psd for the soil or stormwater treatment media must be measured and soil particle density measured or estimated second the existing soil dry bulk density is measured from field cores or estimated from pedotransfer functions using soil texture and soil organic carbon e g chen et al 2018 third the effect of biochar amendment on dry bulk density is estimated ideally sample packings might be tested with varying biochar content and changes in bulk density noted alternatively the results from two meta analyses may be used where biochar amendment decreased bulk density by 8 9 on average omondi et al 2016 razzaghi et al 2020 finally the wilting point of the soil without biochar is measured or estimated from pedotransfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 and the saturated water content assumed to be equal to the total porosity for the biochar free and biochar amended media this information combined with psd mip and dew point potentiometry data pf 4 2 for the biochar is used to estimate the change in available water capacity with model 4 psd are reported by almost all commercial biochar producers while mip measurements are increasingly reported by large producers this analysis assumes sufficient environmental exposure that the biochar is hydrophilic it also excludes soil aggregation which biochar has been shown to enhance herath et al 2013 and soil structural changes due to vegetation 5 conclusions in this work a conceptual model for the effect of biochar amendment on water retention in soil was proposed that includes three processes changes in water retention due to sorption in biochar intrapores changes due to capillary water filling intrapores and changes due to modification of interpores this model was then tested on two types of biochar added to sand or sandy loam at two mass fractions four different model predictions for water retention data were evaluated model 1 is water retention in the natural soil model 2 adds to model 1 changes in retained water primarily from sorption for pf 3 8 0 62 mpa model 3 adds the additional capillary water retained in biochar intrapores and model 4 adds changes in water retention due to alteration of interpores these models rely on measured properties of biochar and soil but require no fitted parameters the impact of biochar amendment on water retained for pf 3 8 0 62 mpa was tested with mixtures of biochar sand and biochar sandy loam a simple mixing model that incorporates the mass fractions of soil and biochar and the independently measured retention properties of each material worked well mixtures of biochar and sand where there were minimal changes in interpore porosity allowed testing of model predictions for the influence of biochar intrapores alone on water retention model 3 described these data well demonstrating that mercury intrusion porosimetry and dew point potentiometer measurements of biochar were sufficient to predict the impact of biochar intrapores on water retention when biochars were amended to sandy loam changes in both intrapores and interpores were important amending sandy loam with 2 w w plbc reduced water retention for 0 5 pf 3 5 0 0003 mpa 0 31 while plbc increased water storage in biochar intrapores it caused a decrease in interpore porosity and water retention in interpores in sandy loam which exceeded the increase from intrapores if sandy loam was amended with 7 plbc or either 2 or 7 srbc though biochar addition increased water retention across the same range of matric potentials model 4 that accounted for both changes to intrapores and interpores described these data well although the model required air entrapment data in addition to advancing our conceptual understanding of how biochars alter water retention in soil this work provides the first example of using independent measurements of biochar and soil properties to predict water retention in biochar amended media for biochar mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements intrapore volume and particle densities dew point potentiometer data and the particle size distribution were needed for soil dew point potentiometer data particle density particle size distribution and water retention data were required in addition the dry bulk density of the biochar soil mixture was needed and an estimate of the degree of air entrapment these data can be readily obtained alternatively only biochar measurements may be made if the required soil properties can be estimated with such an approach predicting the benefit of biochar amendment on water retention for different biochar soil mixtures can be made independent of direct measurement this work is limited in several respects the models neglect soil aggregation which biochar has been shown to impact in some settings herath et al 2013 aggregate formation is a naturally occurring process influenced by soil chemistry six et al 2000 and microbial activity rillig et al 2010 both of which are affected by biochar in settings where soil aggregation is significant the models developed in this work will not apply in addition weathering will change biochar properties spokas et al 2014 potentially reducing the availability of biochar intrapores due to pore clogging or altering interpores through breakage of biochar particles liu et al 2017 weathering may also affect biochar wettability yi et al 2015 while biochars of uniform particle size were tested in this study verification of this model should be made with unsieved biochars where biochar intrapores may vary with particle size finally because the arya paris model assumes spherical particles for determining the solid volume in each particle class elongated particles which are often observed for large wood derived biochars e g liu et al 2017 may increase model error future work is necessary to address these issues to improve models for the impact of biochar amendment on water retention credit authorship

466,biochar is black carbon produced from pyrolysis of biomass and may be added to soil to sequester carbon and improve soil water retention to date models to predict changes in soil water retention with biochar amendment are still missing and therefore direct measurements are required for every biochar soil combination which can be time consuming here a predictive model for biochar s effect on soil water retention was developed and tested that includes water retained in biochar intrapores and biochar s impact on interpores between particles the independently measured parameters needed for the model are the particle size distributions psds and particle densities for biochar and soil water retention data for biochar free soil biochar intrapore volume distribution from mercury porosimetry amount of biochar added bulk density of the biochar soil mixture and dew point potentiometer measurements of biochar the model was tested using poultry litter and wood biochars amended to two soils sand and sandy loam at 2 and 7 mass fraction the model predicted changes in the soil water characteristic well for the biochar amendment with rmse decreasing by 50 when the full model was used model predictions of the change in available water capacity with biochar amendment for eight biochar soil combinations had an average absolute error of 0 017 0 006 and an average relative error of 1 0 0 40 the model correctly predicted the increase in available water content when sandy loam was amended with wood biochar and the decrease if amended with poultry litter biochar the model provides an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which biochar alters water retention and a means to estimate the initial change in available water capacity for a particular biochar soil combination if necessary biochar and soil properties are measured graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water retention biochar model available water capacity soil water characteristic 1 introduction biochar is a carbon rich solid produced by pyrolysis of organic materials that is added to soil to sequester carbon and to change chemical and physical properties of soils lehmann 2007 novak et al 2009 when amended to stormwater treatment media such as greenroofs or biofiltration media biochar may increase water retention beck et al 2011 tian et al 2019 and pollutant removal ashoori et al 2019 because of varying organic feedstock and pyrolysis conditions biochars are produced with a wide range of particle size distributions cetin et al 2004 liu et al 2016 internal pore volumes brewer et al 2014 and surface areas song and guo 2012 zabaniotou et al 2008 all of which affect water retention thus the influence of biochar on water retention will vary with each biochar media combination the soil water characteristic swc describes water retention in soil mualem 1976 tuller et al 1999 and tuller and or 2005 suggest that swc can be divided into the wet end where water retention is strongly influenced by capillary forces and pore structure and the dry end pf 5 0 pf log h and h matric potential expressed as cm h2o or matric potential 10 mpa where the adsorptive contribution generally dominates over the capillary contribution tuller et al 1999 tuller and or 2005 many studies have evaluated biochar s impact on water retention e g abel et al 2013 busscher et al 2010 kinney et al 2012 marsiello et al 2015 novak et al 2009 tryon 1948 with biochar sometimes increasing or decreasing water retention at specific matric potentials and for particular biochar soil combinations in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms by which biochar alters soil water retention laboratory experiments were conducted by amending mesquite biochar pyrolyzed at 400 c which was ground and separated into to fine 0 251 mm medium 0 251 0 853 mm and coarse 0 853 2 00 mm size fractions before amending to a uniform silica sand 0 251 0 853 mm at 2 w w liu et al 2017 by quantifying the total volume of biochar intrapores pores within the envelope of biochar particles and connected to external pores and the interpores of the biochar sand mixtures pores between the exterior particle surfaces the influence of biochar on intrapores and interpores was differentiated as matric potential increased from pf 6 100 mpa to pf 3 0 1 mpa mesquite biochar increased water retention by adding water in intrapores not present in 100 sand samples with further increases in matric potential the elongated shapes of biochar particles increased the interpore volume and thus water retention however because biochars were only amended to a coarse sand where interpores drained at high matric potential biochar effects on interpores did not alter the available water capacity the plant available water retained between field capacity and the permanent wilting point in addition liu et al 2017 did not measure the intrapore volume distribution of their biochars and were therefore unable to independently predict changes in available water capacity before biochar amendment the development and testing of a method to predict the magnitude and direction increase or decrease of changes to available water capacity with biochar amendment was an important objective of our work in a similar study a pinewood biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c was separated into unsieved fine 2 mm and coarse 2 mm size fractions and amended to a uniform sand d 50 0 90 mm at 0 5 and 10 v v trifunovic et al 2018 while measurements showed that biochar significantly affected water retention the most significant increases occurred for fine biochar which was attributed to the fine biochar filling large interpores between sand particles that created more intermediate sized pores that retained water via capillarity the effect of biochar amendment on available water capacity was not evaluated in their study since samples were not subjected to sufficiently small matric potentials while their experiments helped to elucidate the mechanisms by which biochar alters water retention trifunovic et al 2018 were also unable to independently predict changes in water retention due to biochar amendment many studies demonstrate the influence of biochar amendment on water retention and some have fitted the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 to describe these data abel et al 2013 liu et al 2017 however we are aware of no model that can predict the impact of biochar amendment on water retention as most studies have been observational abel et al 2013 arthur et al 2015 liu et al 2017 marsiello et al 2015 sun et al 2013 the recent efforts elucidating the mechanisms by which biochar amendment alters water retention liu et al 2017 trifunovic et al 2018 were unable to predict changes in water retention at specific capillary pressures with biochar addition since the intrapore volume distributions of biochar were not quantified we are aware of no model to predict the change in water retention including the change in field capacity wilting point or available water capacity if a particular biochar is amended to a given soil at a prescribed application rate development of such a model will result in an improved understanding of biochar s impact on water retention and guide the selection of biochar and the biochar application rates when increases in water retention are desired models to predict the swc for soil include mechanistic and empirical models brooks and corey 1964 campbell 1974 van genuchten 1980 fitted to a finite number of equilibrium matric potential water content measurements to describe the entire swc in a second approach measured soil properties are used in pedotransfer functions ptfs to predict swc for particular soil classes rawls and brakensiek 1982 schaap and leij 1998 to predict swc at particular matric potentials rajkai and varallyay 1992 rawls et al 1983 or to estimate the parameters in the swc models rawls and brakensiek 1982 a third approach was introduced by arya and paris 1981 who observed the similarity between particle size distributions psds and swc data here the mass fraction of particles associated with each soil size fraction usually at least 20 was used to estimate the pore volume associated with that soil size fraction assuming a cube shaped assemblage of particles with the bulk and particle densities of the assemblage identical to those measured for the natural sample the pore volume for each soil size fraction was represented with uniform size capillary tubes the pore radius of the capillary tubes was estimated assuming particles were spherical and the equivalent pore length was a function of the number of particles particle radius and a scaling parameter α the scaling parameter accounts for nonspherical soil particles with various shapes sizes and orientations the pore radius was then used to determine an equivalent soil water pressure for the pore volume formed from each soil size fraction using the young laplace equation jury et al 1991 in the original model the scaling parameter α was constant and determined empirically arya lalit m and paris 1981 more recently an alternative formulation for predicting the equivalent pore radius of each soil size fraction was developed that uses only information from the psd particle density and bulk density of the natural sample arya lalit m and heitman 2015 arya and heitman 2015 concluded that this new model without empirical parameters predicted swc with similar accuracy as the earlier approaches many other models for predicting swc using psds have been proposed chan and govindaraju 2004 haverkamp and parlange 1986 mishra et al 2003 mohammadi and vanclooster 2011 sakai 1994 the purpose of this work was to develop a model to predict changes in swc for a soil amended with biochar by accounting for biochar s separate influence on water retained in intrapores and interpores such a model would allow screening of biochars best suited for increasing water retention in a particular soil or stormwater treatment medium and provide a means to estimate the magnitude of the change in available water capacity if biochar was amended at a particular mass fraction experiments testing the model were conducted in both coarse and fine media and fill a gap in previous mechanistic studies liu et al 2017 trifunovic et al 2018 where biochar alterations of interpores did not affect the available water capacity or this effect was not measured for the model developed herein biochar s contributions to water stored in biochar intrapores in a biochar soil mixture were accounted for by measurement of water retained by pure biochar in the dry region of the swc defined operationally for this study as 3 8 pf 6 5 0 62 mpa matric potential 310 mpa these measurements account for water retained by adsorption onto surfaces absorption into organic matter and capillary retention in small intrapores mercury invasion porosimetry mip measurements were used to account for water retained in large intrapores by capillarity pf 3 8 to estimate biochar s impact on capillary water retained in the interpores of a biochar soil mixture the arya paris model first proposed by arya and paris arya lalit m and paris 1981 and later amended arya lalit m and heitman 2015 was selected and modified in this study this model was chosen over other models relating psd to swc because it uses information from the psd particle density and bulk density of the natural sample arya lalit m and heitman 2015 without relying on empirical parameters as earlier approaches arya lalit m and paris 1981 arya lm et al 1999 the arya paris model predicted swc with reasonable accuracy for 41 soils from the unsoda hydraulic properties database including 9 clay soils 12 loams 9 sandy loams and 11 sands arya lalit m and heitman 2015 the model developed herein excludes biochar s impact on air water interfacial tension and contact angle through dissolution of solutes e g yi et al 2015 clogging of biochar intrapores and changes in biochar particle size and porosity through weathering although these effects are discussed with this model the volumetric water content retained in a biochar soil mixture at each capillary pressure step is determined by summing the volumetric water content from 1 the natural soil without biochar addition cm3 cm 3 2 the change in intrapore water for 3 8 pf 6 5 due primarily to changes in sorbed water δθ intra sorb cm3 cm 3 3 the additional intrapore capillary water within biochar for pf 3 8 cm3 cm 3 and 4 the change in water stored in interpores cm3 cm 3 as shown below this model combined with appropriate laboratory data can be used to predict changes in water retention in biochar amended soil 2 theory 2 1 intrapore water for 3 8 pf 6 5 the intrapores of soil and biochar particles may retain both sorbed and capillary water for soil capillary water will be completely drained from pores formed by silt at pf 3 8 0 6 mpa and somewhere above pf 3 8 0 6 mpa for pores formed from clay and organic matter jensen et al 2015 at pf 5 9 8 mpa capillarity is negligible tuller and or 2005 thus water retained in intrapores over 3 8 pf 6 5 in our soil samples sand sandy loam is primarily retained by sorption including by organic matter and this water was measured using a dew point potentiometer described below the lower and upper pf limits specified here were selected based on instrument precision and accuracy decagon devices 2013 gubiani et al 2013 the water retained in a biochar soil mixture at 3 8 pf 6 5 can be estimated by using the water retained in the soil and biochar measured separately at each matric potential and the mass fraction of biochar and soil in the mixture 1 mc i m m s mc i s m bc mc i bc m s m bc where mc i m mc i s and mc i bc are moisture content g g 1 of the biochar soil mixture soil without biochar and biochar respectively at matric potential i and m bc and m s are dry mass of biochar and soil respectively in the biochar soil mixture a dew point potentiometer was used to measure the matric potential of soil and biochar samples prepared at different moisture contents which are used in eq 1 to estimate the moisture content of biochar soil mixtures to obtain the volumetric water content associated with water retention at each matric potential θ i intra sorb cm3 cm 3 eq 1 is divided by water density ρ w g cm 3 and multiplied by the dry bulk density ρ b m t m v t g cm 3 of the biochar soil mixture where m t m is the total dry mass g and v t is the total sample volume cm3 the change in water retention due to biochar amendment at 3 8 pf 6 5 is then the difference between this volumetric water content and that for the natural soil at step i 2 δ θ i intra sorb mc i m m t m mc i s m t s ρ w v t 2 2 intrapore water for pf 3 8 in addition to water sorbed or filling small cavities at pf 3 8 additional water may fill the cavities of large biochar intrapores the additional water retained in a biochar intrapores at pf 3 8 can be estimated by using the mip measurements of 100 biochar restricted to this pf range where care must be exercised to exclude interpore volume with these measurements described below and the known mass of biochar in a biochar soil mixture the additional intrapore water retained at matric potential i due to biochar amendment is determined from 3 δ θ i intra cap m bc v t j p f i v j intra where v j intra is the specific intrapore volume ml g 1 filled with water and determined by mip at the jth matric potential increment and pf 3 8 is the lower limit of detection of the dew point potentiometer in order to determine v j intra at a particular matric potential from mip data estimates of the contact angles of mercury and water in biochar intrapores are needed described below m bc and v t are based on biochar application rates 2 3 interpore water to predict the influence of biochar amendment on water retained in interpores δ θ i inter the arya paris model first proposed by arya and paris 1981 and later amended arya lalit m and heitman 2015 was adopted and modified for biochar soil mixtures particle density is an important parameter in the arya paris model and was assumed uniform for all soil particles in their model arya lalit m and paris 1981 however biochars are significantly less dense than soil particles envelope density which is the appropriate particle density to use in the arya paris model ranging from 0 25 0 6 g cm3 brewer et al 2014 for biochar and is 4 to 10 times smaller than soil particle density 2 65 g cm3 to account for the variability of particle densities a volume weighted particle density was determined because pore radii in the arya paris model are correlated to the number and size of spherical particles in a given size fraction arya lalit m and paris 1981 arya lalit m and heitman 2015 the volume weighted particle density is then defined as 4 ρ s i m v i bc ρ s bc v i s ρ s s v i bc v i s where ρ s i m is the volume weighted particle density g cm 3 of the mixture for size fraction i ρ s bc and ρ s s are envelope densities g cm 3 of biochar and soil particles respectively and v i bc and v i s are the volume ml of biochar and soil particles respectively in size fraction i these volumes are determined from 5 v i b c m i b c ρ s b c and v i s m i s ρ s s where m i bc and m i s are the mass g of biochar and soil respectively in each size fraction obtained from psd substituting eq 5 into 4 the particle density of the biochar soil mixture for size fraction i can also be expressed as 6 ρ s i m m i bc m i s m i bc ρ s bc m i s ρ s s the arya paris model also requires the sample void ratio ε cm3 cm 3 that is computed from 7 ε ρ s ρ b ρ b where ρ s is the average particle density g cm 3 of the entire sample 8 ρ s m bc m s m bc ρ s bc m s ρ s s and m bc and m s are the total dry mass g of biochar and soil respectively in the biochar soil mixture with these definitions the fraction of the total particle volume of the mixture v i m cm3 cm3 associated with size fraction i is 9 v i m m i bc ρ s bc m i s ρ s s ρ s m t m where m t m m s m bc is the total mixture mass g in the modified arya paris model the interpore volume created by each particle size class is assumed proportional to the volume of particles in that size class with this assumption the volumetric water content retained in pores associated with particle size fraction i of the mixture θ i m cm3 cm 3 is obtained from successive summations of water filled pore volumes for that particle class and smaller 10 θ i m ϕ m s w m j 1 i v j m where ϕ m is the total interparticle porosity cm3 cm 3 of the mixture not total porosity expressed as 11 ϕ m ε 1 ε and s w m is the ratio of the measured saturated water content to theoretical total porosity cm3 cm 3 and accounts for air entrapment arya lm et al 1999 subscript j is the index for particle size fraction and begins with the smallest particle class i eq 10 is applied to each particle size fraction i to determine the volumetric water content associated with water filled pores created by particles in that size class and smaller to obtain the matric potential associated with water retained in pores associated with particle size class i the number of particles in each size class i n i is determined for each size class 12 n i 3 m t i m 4 π ρ s i m r i 3 where m t i m m i bc m i s is the total mass g of particles in size class i and r i is the mean particle radius cm of size class i the pore radius for each size class i r i cm is then estimated using a relationship that combines the attributes of natural packed soil structure with those of a counterpart hypothetical structure consisting of spherical particles arya lalit m and heitman 2015 13 r i 0 0717 ϕ m m t i m ρ b n i 4 3 r i the matric potential associated with water retained for particle size class i θ i m is then determined from h i 2 γ cos θ ρ w g r i where γ is the air water interfacial tension dyne cm 1 θ is the contact angle ρ w is density of water g cm 3 and g is the gravitational constant this matric potential h i is then used with the volumetric water content θ i m from eq 10 to determine swc data in the application described below γ and θ are assumed the same for soil and biochar amended soil although any differences can be accounted for in the expression for h i this modified arya paris model is used to estimate the change in water retention due to change in interpores with biochar amendment the model is applied first to natural soil and then to the biochar soil mixture using the same particle size classes for each medium next the estimated change in interpore space associated with biochar amendment at each matric potential i is determined from 14 δ θ i inter θ i m θ i s where δ θ i inter is the change in water retention due to change in interpores from the biochar addition cm3 cm 3 and θ i m and θ i s are the modified arya paris model predicted volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 retained in the biochar soil mixture and natural soil respectively in applying these models to predict water retention for pf 3 8 the entire particle size distribution including data from sieve analysis and hydrometer measurements are used 2 4 models for water retention in biochar amended media to evaluate the different mechanisms that alter water retention with biochar addition four separate models were used in this study when examined in combination these models illustrate biochar s influence on water retention through alteration of a soil s

of biochar intrapores is accounted for in model 3 δ θ i intra cap while the contact angle of the outer particle surfaces is accounted for in model 4 δ θ i inter experiments described below were used to test the hypothesis that model 4 is sufficient to describe changes in water retention when biochar is amended to soils statistical measures to evaluate model fits are described in supplemental materials these models use several measured properties of biochar and soil but do not use any model fitted parameters 3 materials and methods 3 1 biochars two biochars were tested in this study poultry litter biochar plbc produced from poultry litter using a slow pyrolysis system at 300⁰c song and guo 2012 and soil reef biochar srbc produced by heating southern yellow pine in a continuous pyrolysis system at 550 c for 10 min the biochar company in berwyn pa usa additional information regarding the production and elemental composition of these biochars is found elsewhere song and guo 2012 teixido et al 2011 the biochars were rinsed in water to remove water soluble compounds and oven dried steps that in prior work were shown to remove hydrophobicity yi et al 2015 each biochar was separately rinsed in deionized di water three to four times at 1 50 ratio biochar to di water at 50 rpm until the electrical conductivity of the rinsate was 100 µs cm 1 the rinsed biochars were oven dried at 105 c for 12 to 15 h and cooled to room temperature both water drop penetration test 1 2 sec and the contact angle measurements 0 3 letey et al 2000 yi et al 2015 confirmed that biochars were water wetting and contact angles of 0 0 were assumed in all analyses the biochar samples were then separately sieved between 30 0 595 mm opening and 35 0 5 mm opening mesh resulting in particles with a geometric mean diameter of 0 545 mm the post treated biochars are referred to as plbc and srbc while samples that were sieved but not rinsed with water and oven dried are referred to as fresh plbc or fresh srbc uniform size biochar particles were used here to separately evaluate the effect of biochar intrapores on water retention which is discussed below following similar treatment procedures a well characterized sand 30 40 accusand unimin co le sueur mn usa was rinsed in di water until the water turned clear oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and then sieved to a geometric mean diameter of 0 545 mm a sandy loam agricultural soil 74 sand 13 silt 13 clay was collected from the top 30 cm at the delaware state university outreach and research center smyrna de usa dried at 105 c for 24 h and then crushed using a mortar and pestle to remove aggregates experiments in mixtures of biochar and sandy loam include biochar s effect on both intrapores and interpores the plbc and srbc were mixed separately with sand at 2 and 7 w w and designated as 2 plbc sand 7 plbc sand 2 srbc sand and 7 srbc sand because sand and biochar particles were sieved to the same size fraction the biochar sand mixtures were intended to have minimal change in interpores from biochar amendment thus the biochar sand mixtures primarily tested the effect of biochar on sorbed and capillary water in intrapores the sandy loam sl was also mixed with biochars at 2 and 7 w w and identified as 2 plbc sl 7 plbc sl 2 srbc sl and 7 srbc sl depending on the mass fraction of plbc or srbc these plbc and srbc samples mixed with sl represent samples where both intrapore and interpore spaces were modified with biochar amendment 3 2 biochar particle density surface area and intrapore volume duplicate samples of plbc and srbc were analyzed by micromeritics analytical services norcross ga usa to characterize biochar particle densities and intrapores using mercury intrusion porosimetry the pore volume distribution envelope density ρ s bc g cm 3 and skeletal density ρ sk bc g cm 3 were obtained from mip data astm standard d4404 10 2010 scanning electron microscopy sem images hitachi s4700 scanning electron microscope at 3 0 kv hitachi japan of biochar particles were used to determine the largest pore diameter hardie et al 2014 impoco et al 2006 specific surface area ssa measurements were carried out with an asap 2020 micromeritics physisorption analyzer norcross ga usa using n2 adsorption at 77 3 k for plbc and srbc before and after treatment astm standard d6556 14 2012 brunauer et al 1938 3 3 particle size distribution particle size distributions were obtained for sl using standard methods astm standard c136 06 2003 astm standard d7928 17 2017 and plotted as both mass and volume distributions using the density of sand sl envelope density of biochar and mass based psds for these materials the volume based psds for each material were determined and these used to calculate the volume based psds for each biochar soil mixture while mass based psds are more traditionally reported volume based distributions illustrate particle volume changes due to biochar amendment and may be more appropriate for use in the modified arya paris model as discussed above 3 4 intrapore water for 3 8 pf 6 5 a wp4c dew point potentiometer decagon pullman wa usa was used to obtain data to estimate δ θ i i n t r a s o r b for 3 8 pf 6 5 here the matric potential h i must be determined for various sample moisture contents to determine δ θ i i n t r a s o r b experimental procedures from the instrument manufacturer were followed to obtain the sorption and desorption isotherms for 3 8 pf 6 5 for all samples and sample mixtures plbc srbc sand 2 plbc sand 7 plbc sand 2 srbc sand 7 srbc sand sl 2 plbc sl 7 plbc sl 2 srbc sl and 7 srbc sl the number of independent samples used for each medium was large and varied for example biochar sorption data were collected from 9 or 10 samples of plbc or srbc respectively while biochar soil sorption data were collected from 47 samples of 7 plbc sl the average sample volume was 10 0 ml 0 1 standard error and measurement temperatures ranged from 19 23 c wp4c measurements determine the total water potential associated with sample gravimetric moisture content mc i for plbc only data indicated that osmotic effects were important and the measured total potential was corrected for osmotic effects following a procedure consistent with the manufacturer s guidelines decagon devices 2013 and discussed in supplemental materials 3 5 interpore water pf 3 8 the sand and biochar sand mixtures were tightly packed dry by pouring dry sand or biochar sand mixtures into a two layer nest of screens and then into aluminum cores 7 7 cm inside diameter 3 6 cm height to pack sl and biochar sl mixtures 1 cm thick layers of sample mixtures were dry packed in aluminum cores 5 4 cm inside diameter 3 0 cm height all samples were prepared in duplicate the sample cores were placed in a plastic bin and then slowly saturated from below with degassed di water until the water level reached slightly below the height of sample cores the plastic bin was then covered overnight to saturate the samples swc for pf 3 8 were measured by draining the saturated sample cores the water saturated sand and biochar sand mixtures were placed on a tension table dane and topp 2002 topp and zebchuk 1979 and matric potentials of 3 7 17 22 27 37 and 57 cm h2o were applied until equilibrium was reached with each step defined as a mass change 1 over 8 12 h period following tension table measurements samples were transferred to a pressure plate extractor 15 bar ceramic plate extractor soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa and matric potentials of 129 256 383 510 764 1400 3500 and 6330 cm h2o were applied sequentially to the samples samples were weighed through time at each pressure step until equilibrium was reached which was defined as mass change 1 over 3 4 d equilibration time due to the different equilibration times of sand and sl swc for sl mixtures were measured separately saturated sl samples were placed on a tension table at 6 5 and at 21 5 cm h2o samples were weighed through time at each pressure step until equilibrium was reached which was defined as mass change 1 over 2 4 d the samples were then transferred to the pressure plate extractor and matric potentials of 70 3 246 492 1000 1500 2100 and 5200 cm h2o applied sequentially to the samples sample equilibration times ranged from 6 d h 70 3 cm h2o to 31 d h 5200 cm h2o and were determined by sample mass changes 1 between successive measurements all samples were measured at ambient temperature 19 23 c as described above sample volumes for swc data collected from the wp4c tension table and pressure plate extractor varied and ranged from 10 0 0 1 ml for wp4c measurements to 168 and 68 8 ml for sand and sl samples respectively in the tension table and pressure plate extractor as will be shown below the smaller sample size for the wp4c measurements resulted in a relatively large variation in data for biochar soil mixtures using this instrument in these mixed samples biochar content was small 2 or 7 by mass and resulted in significant variability in water retention data much less variability was observed for wp4c measurements in pure biochar or soil 4 results and discussion 4 1 particle densities and specific surface area biochar envelope densities determined from mip measurements were ρ s bc 1 25 0 03 g cm 3 and 0 65 0 01 g cm 3 for plbc and srbc respectively because the envelope density is 1 9 times larger for plbc than srbc amending a soil with the same biochar mass will result in 80 more srbc than plbc particles if a soil is amended with a fixed mass of biochar srbc amendment is likely to have a more significant effect than plbc on interpores between particles since a larger volume of biochar would be added the skeletal densities for plbc and srbc were ρ sk bc 1 72 0 04 g cm 3 and 1 39 0 03 g cm 3 for plbc and srbc respectively and reflect the higher mineral content in biochar produced from poultry litter plbc than wood srbc from pycnometer measurements for sand and sl the skeletal density assumed equal to envelope density was 2 66 0 01 g ml 1 and 2 42 0 02 g ml 1 for sand and sl respectively the rinsing of biochars with di water increased ssa from 0 8 0 2 m2 g 1 to 1 53 0 15 m2 g 1 and from 41 19 m2 g 1 to 350 30 m2 g 1 for plbc and srbc respectively because higher ssa indicates more sorption sites srbc was expected to sorb significantly more water than plbc and thus retain more water at the dry end of the swc typical sem images of plbc and srbc biochars are shown in figure s1 in supplemental materials from the analysis of these and other images the largest pores are 33 µm in diameter for both biochars while intrusion pressures were measured for mercury they were converted to pf for water entry into air filled biochar assuming a contact angle of 0o and 130o giesche 2006 for air water and air mercury systems respectively the young laplace equation was then used to estimate the pore diameter at each intrusion pressure step assuming cylindrical pores cumulative invaded volumes are plotted against pf air water system in fig 1 a and invaded pore volumes associated with equivalent pore diameters are plotted in fig 1b the plotted pore diameter range 33 μm 0 1 μm represents the pressure range 1 9 pf 4 4 most of the intrapore volume occurs between 1 9 pf 4 4 for plbc and 1 9 pf 3 5 for srbc which is the range of matric pressures over which most biochar intrapores are filled by capillary forces the intrapore filling was linear for plbc and sigmoidal for srbc indicating that srbc intrapore volume is not distributed uniformly across pore sizes fig 1a the total intrapore volume was 0 23 0 01 cm3 g 1 for plbc and 0 83 0 01 cm3 g 1 for srbc which is consistent with the higher ssa measured for srbc in addition to retaining almost 4 times as much water in intrapores than plbc most of the water retained within srbc intrapores accessed by mip is accessible at matric potentials above the wilting point pf 4 2 and thus plant available thus srbc amendment to soils is expected to be more beneficial for water retention than equal quantities of plbc while mip measurements determined intrapore volume up to pf 6 data were only used in the water retention model for pf 3 8 since dew point potentiometer measurements characterized water retention accurately for 3 8 pf 6 5 4 2 particle size distribution while the addition of plbc or srbc to sand was not expected to change the psd since sand and biochar particles were sieved to the same size biochar amendment to sl would alter particle and pore size distributions the psd was measured for sl and computed for biochar sl mixtures using measured psd for sl and biochar particles sizes and envelop densities the psds of sl and biochar amended sl were used in model 4 to calculate δ θ i inter and are plotted by volume in fig 2 a and b for plbc sl and srbc sl respectively and by mass in figure s2 in supplemental materials while it is more traditional to plot psds by mass the wide difference in envelop density of biochar and soil particles factor of 2 results in a mass based psd that does not reflect the distribution of particle volumes the relative volume of different particle sizes in a soil sample control the pore structure and capillary water retention because srbc contributes about 48 more particles by volume than plbc at 7 w w amendment srbc addition shifted the volume based psd mean particle diameter from d 50 0 27 mm to d 50 0 95 mm fig 2 while pblc addition increased it less to d 50 0 40 mm 4 3 porosity using the measured dry bulk densities of biochar sand and biochar sl mixtures in the water retention cells biochar envelope and skeletal densities and the particle densities of sand and sl interpore porosities of the water retention cell samples were computed and are reported in table 1 adding biochar to sand sieved to the same particle diameter increased interpore volume from 2 6 to 6 9 which is likely due to the elongated shape of some biochar particles compared to the more spherically shaped sand particles figure s7 increases in interpore porosity also occurred for 2 amendments to sl where interpore porosity increased from 0 8 to 4 8 at 7 biochar addition to sl though interpore porosity increased by 1 0 but decreased by 1 7 for plbc and srbc respectively changes in interpore porosity in sl due to amendment of relatively large biochar particles 0 545 mm d 0 595 mm were likely mitigated by the presence of small grains that filled larger pores while amendment of 7 srbc decreased interpores in sl total porosities were increased for all biochar amendments in both sand and sl on a relative basis total porosities increased most for biochar amended sand increasing by 13 5 and 27 0 for 7 plbc and srbc respectively similarly 7 biochar amendment to sl resulted in a 6 1 and 16 2 increase in total porosity for plbc and srbc respectively these results illustrate two factors affecting total sample porosity 1 plbc had smaller intrapore volume than srbc so equal masses added to sand where there was minimal change in interpore porosity resulted in smaller increases in total porosity for plbc than srbc amendment and 2 although srbc reduced interpore porosity at 7 amendment in sl the contribution of intrapore porosity offset this reduction causing a net increase in total sample porosity as will be shown below the interplay between intrapore and interpore volume affects water retention in biochar amended media 4 4 water retention pf 3 8 the sorption and desorption isotherms of rinsed biochar no soil are discussed in supplemental materials for pf 3 8 where sorption of water to surfaces is presumed to be the primary mechanism for water retention hysteresis in sorption was not observed for these biochars figure s4 while it has occurred for other biochar studies arthur et al 2015 sorption isotherms were also measured for sand and sl and for these media amended with 2 and 7 plbc srbc and water sorption data for plbc sand and srbc sand are shown in fig 3 measured water potential is plotted against volumetric water content θ sorb mc m t m v t ρ w of packed samples in the tension table and the pressure plate extractor sorption onto sand alone was negligible while amendment with plbc and srbc increased water sorption dramatically to estimate mc and θ sorb of these biochar amended sands mc for plbc srbc and sand measured separately were used in eq 1 and 2 to generate the model predictions in fig 3 corrections for osmotic pressures were not needed in model predictions for plbc sand mixtures because the mass fractions of plbc were sufficiently small that osmotic effects were not observed in the data the simple mixing model performed reasonably well for 2 plbc sand but over predicted sorbed water for 7 plbc sand at low pf the scatter in data is much more significant for water sorption onto plbc sand mixtures than measurements of plbc or sand alone which may be due to limitations in achieving a representative sample with the 10 0 0 1 cm3 sample volume of the dew point potentiometer with biochar mass fractions of 2 and 7 water sorption isotherms for srbc amended to sand are shown in fig 3b the root mean square error rmse for model predictions of θ sorb in all biochar sand mixtures were 0 413 rmse 0 961 water sorption isotherms for 2 and 7 plbc sl and srbc sl mixtures along with model predictions are shown in figures s5 and s6 while overall model predictions captured the effect of biochar amendment on water sorption just as in biochar amended sand there was significant scatter in the data and 0 210 rmse 0 304 over all biochar sl mixtures the data and model predictions shown in fig 3 and supplemental materials were used for the sorption regions of the swc θ intra sorb reported below for biochar soil mixtures 4 5 soil water characteristic model 4 5 1 plbc in sand swc s for sand and plbc sand are shown in fig 4 and combined measurements from tension table pressure plate extractor and dew point potentiometer all plots show a solid black line that connects mean water retention data for sand alone while the open and filled symbols are data from duplicate packings of 2 and 7 plbc sand respectively amendment of sand with plbc increased water retention for the entire range of matric potentials with significant increases in water retention at the dry end pf 5 but the largest increases near saturation at pf 1 as expected 7 plbc sand increased water retention by approximately 3 times as much as 2 plbc sand because sand and plbc were sieved to the same size plbc increased water retention primarily by retaining more water in biochar intrapores by sorption and capillarity figs 4b and c the effect on interpores was expected to be small the red vertical dashed line in fig 4a represents the air entry value for biochar intrapores estimated from sem and mip measurements to the right of this line the volume of water retained in biochar intrapores ml water retained per g biochar determined by mip is shown solid red line and represents water retained primarily by capillary forces the most significant contributions of biochar intrapores to water retention was between 1 9 pf 3 8 according to mip measurements also shown in fig 4 are predictions for water retention for the three water retention models model 1 is the reference model which is the swc for natural soil eq 15 in this case sand without biochar model 1 is shown in fig 4a for the 2 and 7 plbc sand as dashed and solid blue lines respectively that in this case overlap completely with the black line for sand data model 2 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 eq 16 model 2 is shown in fig 4b for the 2 and 7 plbc sand as dashed and solid blue lines respectively model 2 significantly improves the prediction of water retention for pf 3 with less accurate model predictions for pf 3 model 3 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 by capillarity for pf 3 8 eq 17 model 3 is shown in fig 4c for the 2 and 7 plbc sand as dashed and solid blue lines respectively while model 3 significantly improves the prediction of water retention near water saturation for pf 1 5 this model overpredicts water retention particularly for 7 plbc sand for 1 5 pf 3 8 model 3 was expected to be the most accurate and the overprediction of water retention for 1 5 pf 3 8 for 7 plbc sand was unexpected this overprediction may have been due to a slight change in water retention in interpores in this region with biochar addition table 1 plbc particles are more irregularly shaped than sand figure s7 yi et al 2015 and although both plbc and sand were sieved to the same size small changes in interpore volume occurred the irregular shape of biochar particles and their effect on interpore volume is not accounted for by model 3 nevertheless accounting for only the effect of biochar intrapores on water retention sorption capillary retention provided reasonable estimates of the influence of plbc amendment on water retention of the three models evaluated models 2 and 3 performed similarly and reduced rmse by 50 from model 1 for both 2 and 7 plbc amendment table 2 4 5 2 srbc in sand experiments in sand amended with srbc illustrate the effect of a significantly larger biochar intrapore volume on swcs for sand and results are shown in fig 5 with similar definitions for lines and data symbols as in fig 4 while plbc increased volumetric water content at saturation and total porosity to 0 395 at 7 amendment srbc increased total porosity to 0 442 at this same application rate table 1 this is because the intrapore volume in srbc is almost 4 times larger than that for plbc similar to plbc amendment amendment of sand with srbc increased water retention for the entire range of matric potentials with 7 srbc sand increasing water retention approximately 3 times as much as 2 srbc sand the volume of water retained primarily by capillarity in biochar intrapores and determined by mip is shown in fig 5a solid red line the most significant contributions of biochar intrapores to water retention was between 1 9 pf 3 3 according to mip measurements over this same range significant increases in water retention occurred for 2 and 7 srbc sand which indicates the significant role of capillary water in biochar intrapores in increasing water retention predictions from the three water retention models are also shown in fig 5 model 1 is the swc for natural soil eq 15 and overlaps the sand data in fig 5a model 2 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in water intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 eq 16 and is shown in fig 5b model 2 significantly improves the prediction of water retention for pf 4 with less accurate model predictions for pf 4 this is reasonable since the effect of capillary water retained in biochar intrapores for pf 3 8 is not accounted for in model 2 model 3 is the swc for natural soil additional water retained in intrapores primarily by sorption for pf 3 8 by capillarity for pf 3 8 eq 17 model 3 is shown in fig 5c and significantly improves the prediction of water retention for pf 4 for 2 and 7 srbc sand however model 3 underestimated water retention for 3 pf 4 for 7 srbc sand which was not observed for 2 srbc sand the cause for discrepancy between model 3 and data in this region is uncertain overall model 3 that included water retained in biochar intrapores by sorption and capillarity performed best rmses were 30 smaller for model 2 than model 1 but 50 smaller for model 3 than model 1 table 2 4 5 3 plbc in sandy loam the results for water retention in plbc and srbc amended to sand demonstrate that when biochar primarily affects intrapores these effects can be accounted for with reasonable accuracy using information obtained from dew point potentiometry primarily sorbed water in biochar intrapores and mip capillary water in biochar intrapores water retention measurements in biochar amended sl however were expected to reflect changes in water retention from both intrapores and interpores these experiments allowed evaluation of model 4 which predicts the effect of biochar amendment on water retention in intrapores and interpores swcs for sl and plbc sl are shown in fig 6 the influence of plbc amendment on water retention was much less significant than observed in plbc sand samples fig 4 the much smaller impact of plbc amendment occurred because large plbc particles amended to sl resulted in a wider range of grain sizes allowing more effective packing and smaller increases in interpore volume while plbc amendment increased total porosity from 0 396 sl to 0 405 2 plbc sl and 0 420 7 plbc sl interpore porosity increased less from 0 396 sl to 0 399 2 plbc sl and 0 400 7 plbc sl in sand plbc amendment increased interpore porosity more significantly from 0 348 sand alone to 0 357 2 plbc sand and 0 372 7 plbc sand thus the beneficial effect of biochar intrapores providing additional pore space were less significant in plbc sl mixtures since the impact of biochar amendment on interpore porosity was smaller these results illustrate the interplay between biochar intrapore volume biochar particle size and natural soil psd application of 2 and 7 plbc to sl increased water retention for pf 3 5 which is due to increased sorption of water over 3 8 pf 6 5 this is more readily seen in figure s5 where only data in this range are plotted however over 2 2 pf 3 1 biochar amendment reduced water retention this reduction is primarily due to the reduction in water retained in interpores the volume based psd shown in fig 2a indicates that addition of plbc to sl reduces particle volumes for particle diameters between 0 004 0 5 mm less particle volume results in less water retained in interpores associated with these size fractions according to the modified arya paris model eq 10 for smaller matric potentials 0 5 pf 2 2 the impact of plbc amendment on water retention is mixed amendment with 2 plbc reduces water retention while amendment with 7 plbc increases retention differences in water retention between sl 2 plbc sl and 7 plbc sl in this region are primarily associated with differences in total porosity and air entrapment while amendment with 2 and 7 plbc increased total porosity water retention was less for 2 plbc amendment than sl because air entrapment was more significant the measured water saturation at pf 1 was s w m 0 88 for 2 plbc sl but s w m 0 93 for sl air entrapment for 7 plbc sl was similar to that for sl s w m 0 92 air entrapment is accounted for in the modified arya paris model by using measured s w m in eq 10 predictions from the water retention models are shown in fig 6 with rmses for model fits reported in table 2 model 1 is the swc for the natural soil and in some regions falls above and in other regions below water retention data for 2 and 7 plbc sl thus biochar amendment enhanced water retention for some pf while in other regions it reduced it models 2 and 3 account for the influence of water sorption models 2 and 3 and capillary water retention model 3 in plbc intrapores rmse decreased from 0 016 and 0 019 for model 1 to 0 015 and 0 015 for model 2 but increased to 0 017 and 0 020 for model 3 in 2 and 7 plbc sand respectively thus accounting for the effect of plbc on water retention in biochar intrapores was inadequate for improving predictions of water retention in plbc amended sl when model 4 was employed that includes plbc s influence on both intrapores sorbed and capillary water and interpores modified arya paris model using the psd model predictions were significantly improved with rmses decreasing from model 1 by 44 and 42 for 2 and 7 plbc respectively as noted above total sample porosities for plbc sl samples were larger than measured volumetric water contents at saturation for both 2 and 7 amendments due to air entrapment if air entrapment was not accounted for model 4 would perform more poorly and would over predict water retention at small pf 4 5 4 srbc in sandy loam experiments in sl amended with plbc and srbc illustrate the effect of changes in water retention due to water stored in biochar intrapore volume and in the interpores of the biochar amended medium while plbc and srbc were expected have similar effects on interpores in sl since srbc s intrapore volume is 4 times larger than plbc srbc sl experiments were expected to more dramatically illustrate the influence of biochar intrapores on water retention swcs for sl and srbc sl are shown in fig 7 similar to plbc the influence of srbc amendment on water retention in sl was much less than in sand fig 5 while biochar amendment increased intrapore volume in both media interpore volume decreased slightly 2 srbc sl or decreased significantly 7 srbc sl when srbc amended sl although plbc and srbc were sieved to the same size the more elongated shapes of srbc particles figure s7 caused different effects on interpore volume while 2 plbc amendment reduced water retention in sl over a wide pf range 0 5 pf 3 5 2 srbc amendment decreased water retention only for 2 5 pf 3 5 overall water retention was improved more significantly with srbc than plbc amendment because of the greater intrapore volume of srbc and smaller air entrapment at pf 1 predictions from the water retention models are shown in fig 7 with rmses for model fits reported in table 2 similar to plbc sl mixtures including water retained by sorption and capillarity in srbc intrapores models 2 and 3 resulted in only modest improvement to fits of 2 srbc sl data when model 4 was employed that included srbc s influence on both intrapores sorbed and capillary water and interpores modified arya paris model model fits were significantly improved with rmses decreasing from model 1 by 33 and 46 for 2 and 7 srbc respectively model 3 that only accounts for biochar intrapores overpredicted water retention between 2 pf 3 5 but application of model 4 that accounts for the reduction clogging of soil interpores by biochar particles reduced the predicted water retention and improved the match to data similar to plbc sl mixtures because srbc alters water storage in both biochar intrapores and the interpores of the biochar soil mixture it is necessary to account for both effects to accurately predict the influence of biochar amendment on water retention it is important to note that the improvement in the model 4 prediction is due to two effects accounting for changes in interpore volume and air entrapment at pf 1 changes in interpore volume were estimated with the modified arya paris model using the biochar and soil psds particle densities and dry bulk density this information can be readily measured or estimated for most biochar soil mixtures while air entrapment can be determined directly from water retention measurements it is difficult to predict a priori for the pblc sl samples air entrapment was significant while in srbc sl this correction had a minor influence on model 4 results for situations where biochar amendment results in significant changes in air entrapment this effect may be difficult to predict 4 6 available water capacity available water capacity can be defined as the volumetric water content retained between field capacity pf 1 8 0 062 mpa and wilting point pf 4 2 1 55 mpa and has been used as a measure of biochar amendment on water retention abel et al 2013 kerre et al 2017 the available water capacity was determined for the samples in this study using measurements and predictions from model 4 where the contribution from δ θ i inter was negligible for biochar sand mixtures the predicted versus measured change in available water capacity is plotted for sample averages in fig 8 the available water capacity increased with biochar amendment to sand where higher available water capacity 0 03 to 0 07 was found in mixtures with higher biochar content however in biochar sl mixtures available water capacity decreased with plbc amendment 0 01 to 0 02 the available water capacity decreased with plbc amendment to sl but increased with srbc amendment since the water stored in intrapores was 4 times larger in srbc than plbc which offset the reduction in available water capacity from the reduction in interpore volume 7 srbc sl as shown in fig 8 model 4 was able to predict the direction and magnitude of the observed changes in available water capacity reasonably well for all but the 2 and 7 plbc sl mixtures biochar amendment resulted in an increase in available water content model 4 was able to predict the increases in available water capacity when plbc was amended to sand and the decreases when it was amended to sl model predictions of the change in available water capacity with biochar amendment for the eight biochar soil combinations had an average absolute error of 0 017 0 006 and an average relative error of 1 0 0 40 model 4 may be used to estimate the change in available water capacity for any biochar amended soil where the biochar is assumed to have sufficient environmental exposure to be hydrophilic kinney et al 2012 three types of biochar measurements are needed dew point potentiometry data quantifying water retained in water rinsed biochar at pf 4 2 figure s4 mip data quantifying biochar intrapore volume pore entry pressures and biochar particle densities fig 1 and psd from sieve and hydrometer measurements fig 2 mip data may be the most challenging to obtain although commercial laboratories can provide these measurements for 700us for soil the wilting point particle density and the psd are required along with the dry bulk density and entrapped air saturation of the soil before and after biochar amendment the dry bulk density and entrapped air saturation might be the most difficult to estimate for biochar amended media model 4 may hold promise as a screening tool to select appropriate biochars for improving the available water capacity of particular soils or stormwater treatment media first the psd for the soil or stormwater treatment media must be measured and soil particle density measured or estimated second the existing soil dry bulk density is measured from field cores or estimated from pedotransfer functions using soil texture and soil organic carbon e g chen et al 2018 third the effect of biochar amendment on dry bulk density is estimated ideally sample packings might be tested with varying biochar content and changes in bulk density noted alternatively the results from two meta analyses may be used where biochar amendment decreased bulk density by 8 9 on average omondi et al 2016 razzaghi et al 2020 finally the wilting point of the soil without biochar is measured or estimated from pedotransfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 and the saturated water content assumed to be equal to the total porosity for the biochar free and biochar amended media this information combined with psd mip and dew point potentiometry data pf 4 2 for the biochar is used to estimate the change in available water capacity with model 4 psd are reported by almost all commercial biochar producers while mip measurements are increasingly reported by large producers this analysis assumes sufficient environmental exposure that the biochar is hydrophilic it also excludes soil aggregation which biochar has been shown to enhance herath et al 2013 and soil structural changes due to vegetation 5 conclusions in this work a conceptual model for the effect of biochar amendment on water retention in soil was proposed that includes three processes changes in water retention due to sorption in biochar intrapores changes due to capillary water filling intrapores and changes due to modification of interpores this model was then tested on two types of biochar added to sand or sandy loam at two mass fractions four different model predictions for water retention data were evaluated model 1 is water retention in the natural soil model 2 adds to model 1 changes in retained water primarily from sorption for pf 3 8 0 62 mpa model 3 adds the additional capillary water retained in biochar intrapores and model 4 adds changes in water retention due to alteration of interpores these models rely on measured properties of biochar and soil but require no fitted parameters the impact of biochar amendment on water retained for pf 3 8 0 62 mpa was tested with mixtures of biochar sand and biochar sandy loam a simple mixing model that incorporates the mass fractions of soil and biochar and the independently measured retention properties of each material worked well mixtures of biochar and sand where there were minimal changes in interpore porosity allowed testing of model predictions for the influence of biochar intrapores alone on water retention model 3 described these data well demonstrating that mercury intrusion porosimetry and dew point potentiometer measurements of biochar were sufficient to predict the impact of biochar intrapores on water retention when biochars were amended to sandy loam changes in both intrapores and interpores were important amending sandy loam with 2 w w plbc reduced water retention for 0 5 pf 3 5 0 0003 mpa 0 31 while plbc increased water storage in biochar intrapores it caused a decrease in interpore porosity and water retention in interpores in sandy loam which exceeded the increase from intrapores if sandy loam was amended with 7 plbc or either 2 or 7 srbc though biochar addition increased water retention across the same range of matric potentials model 4 that accounted for both changes to intrapores and interpores described these data well although the model required air entrapment data in addition to advancing our conceptual understanding of how biochars alter water retention in soil this work provides the first example of using independent measurements of biochar and soil properties to predict water retention in biochar amended media for biochar mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements intrapore volume and particle densities dew point potentiometer data and the particle size distribution were needed for soil dew point potentiometer data particle density particle size distribution and water retention data were required in addition the dry bulk density of the biochar soil mixture was needed and an estimate of the degree of air entrapment these data can be readily obtained alternatively only biochar measurements may be made if the required soil properties can be estimated with such an approach predicting the benefit of biochar amendment on water retention for different biochar soil mixtures can be made independent of direct measurement this work is limited in several respects the models neglect soil aggregation which biochar has been shown to impact in some settings herath et al 2013 aggregate formation is a naturally occurring process influenced by soil chemistry six et al 2000 and microbial activity rillig et al 2010 both of which are affected by biochar in settings where soil aggregation is significant the models developed in this work will not apply in addition weathering will change biochar properties spokas et al 2014 potentially reducing the availability of biochar intrapores due to pore clogging or altering interpores through breakage of biochar particles liu et al 2017 weathering may also affect biochar wettability yi et al 2015 while biochars of uniform particle size were tested in this study verification of this model should be made with unsieved biochars where biochar intrapores may vary with particle size finally because the arya paris model assumes spherical particles for determining the solid volume in each particle class elongated particles which are often observed for large wood derived biochars e g liu et al 2017 may increase model error future work is necessary to address these issues to improve models for the impact of biochar amendment on water retention credit authorship

467,the generalized integral transform technique gitt is employed in combination with a single domain reformulation strategy and a coupled eigenvalue problem expansion base to construct analytical or hybrid numerical analytical solutions for flow and transport in fractured porous media the problem formulation and provided formal solutions encompass both continuum multi porosity multi permeability and discrete fracture matrix interaction models for heterogeneous porous media the single domain representation is written with the aid of space variable coefficients that account for the abrupt physical properties and source terms transitions across the different subregions the aim is to provide an unified formalism that includes a wide class of problems in fluid flow heat and mass transfer in heterogeneous media with the integral transformation process for the potentials pressure velocities temperature or concentrations being applied over the whole physical domain at once thus markedly reducing the mathematical manipulations the space variable coefficients are then carried on to the eigenvalue problem formulation which provides the base for the eigenfunction expansion in addition a coupled eigenvalue problem alternative is proposed which is particularly useful in dealing with multi porosity multi permeability flow and transport models collapsing the multiple coupled potentials equations into one single integral transformation process two representative applications are briefly considered one dealing with contaminant transport with discrete fracture matrix interaction in

classical integral transform approaches for partial differential equations such as the best known laplace and fourier transforms have been and still remain very important in the advancement of research and application of transport phenomena in porous media though limited to linear formulations and especially handy for the situations of infinite and semi infinite media these classical approaches have provided a large number of analytical expressions that are common practice in different branches of engineering and physical sciences and have been derived for transport in porous media and compiled in different sources bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 van genuchten 1981 van genuchten and alves 1982 ungs et al 1986 despite the evident progress on the more flexible numerical methods in the last few decades the analytical methodologies were not abandoned at all first due to the unbeatable accuracy and fairly low computational costs that they allow for though quite restricted in terms of formulation complexity second because of the continuous need for reference benchmark results in verifying the increasingly more competitive numerical schemes and associated computational tools that have been made available third and most important in the present context is the proposition of alternative solution methodologies that combine such analytical concepts with modern numerical analysis that are continuously popping out in the open literature one such hybrid numerical analytical approach is the so called generalized integral transform technique gitt cotta 1990 cotta 1993 cotta 1994 cotta and mikhailov 1997 cotta 1998 cotta and mikhailov 2006 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b developed as an extension to the classical integral transform method mikhailov and özisik 1984 for a priori non transformable partial differential problems the basic idea behind this extended eigenfunction expansion approach is to extract from the original problem formulation a characteristic equation and boundary condition operators to construct an eigenvalue problem that will provide an informative base for the expansion leading to the development of the integral transform pair transformation and inverse upon integral transformation of the partial differential equations and employment of the integral transform pair an infinite coupled ordinary differential system for the transformed potentials is attained the transformed system may be handled analytically for linear problems or numerically for nonlinear formulations and then the inverse formula is recalled to reconstruct the desired potentials either in fully analytical form or as hybrid numerical analytical solution though the original development of the gitt was mostly undertaken within the thermal science and engineering field the progresses on drying in capillary porous bodies ribeiro et al 1993 ribeiro and cotta 1995 guigon et al 1999 dantas et al 2003 dantas et al 2007 and natural convective heat transfer in porous cavities baohua and cotta 1993 alves and cotta 2000 alves et al 2002 luz neto et al 2002 luz neto et al 2006 hirata et al 2006 hirata et al 2007 hirata et al 2009 have stimulated the application and extension of this hybrid approach to other topics involving transport phenomena in porous media such as in environmental petroleum and nuclear engineering almeida and cotta 1995 almeida and cotta 1996 cotta et al 1998 liu et al 1998 leal and ruperti jr 2000 liu et al 2000 leal and ruperti jr 2001 rocha and cruz 2001 heilbron filho et al 2002 cotta et al 2003 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 naveira cotta et al 2013 deucher et al 2016 deucher et al 2017 cotta et al 2020 among such developments two previous contributions on the gitt approach are directly related to the ideas here advanced first the analysis of contaminant transport with interaction between a discrete fracture and a porous matrix cotta et al 2003 second the handling of dual porosity dual permeability models for flow and contaminant transport in unsaturated fractured porous media rocha and cruz 2001 in light of recent developments on the gitt approach the present work is aimed at unifying and generalizing such treatment of both the continuum and discrete formulations of flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media first a single domain reformulation strategy hirata et al 2006 hirata et al 2007 hirata et al 2009 knupp et al 2012 knupp et al 2014 knupp et al 2015b knupp et al 2015a zotin et al 2017 almeida et al 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa et al 2018 is adopted which permits to rewrite a system of coupled convection diffusion problems that govern each subdomain of a heterogeneous complex configuration as one single formulation with space variable coefficients and source terms for each potential this strategy is particularly beneficial in reducing the analytical involvement in applying the gitt approach since only one integral transformation process is implemented at once towards elimination of the space variables dependence of any particular transformed potential instead of tediously transforming and coupling the transformed equations for individual subdomains then the space variable coefficients that are responsible for the subdomain transitions are carried along to the eigenvalue problem formulation thus accounting for the heterogeneities present in the original problem second a coupled eigenvalue problem choice is here proposed based on the exact integral transform solution of linear diffusion problems in heterogeneous media mikhailov and özisik 1984 mikhailov et al 1982 in which the eigenfunctions are coupled through source sink terms in every point of the domain this choice of eigenfunction expansion base is quite handy when dealing with multi porosity multi permeability flow and transport formulations which involve coupled potentials that characterize the exchange among two or more distinct porosities and permeabilities systems of the heterogeneous porous medium again there is substantial gain in the analytical and numerical steps of the methodology as the original multicomponent system undergoes one single integral transformation process for all the coupled potentials since the coupling is already accounted for by the eigenfunctions and respective eigenvalues in other words the use of coupled eigenvalue problems enables the integral transformation of all spatial variation and coupling information into a single set of ordinary differential equations for the transformed problem thereby markedly simplifying the solution of the problem the formal solutions here derived are then employed in the analysis of two applications dealing with both continuum and discrete modeling of transport phenomena in fractured heterogeneous porous media the first example provides a gitt solution for the transport of contaminants with finite half lives in a layered fractured porous medium the second example is related to the flow in unsaturated structured soils using a physical non equilibrium dual porosity dual permeability type model in both cases convergence analysis of the eigenfunction expansion is undertaken and a few numerical results are reported to illustrate the major parametric effects on the considered flow and transport phenomena 2 problem formulation and formal solutions problem formulation the analysis is initiated by recalling the general concept of the single domain reformulation strategy cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b before discussing the possible choices of eigenfunction expansions base let us consider a sufficiently general multidimensional linear or nonlinear convection diffusion problem defined in a heterogeneous configuration that is represented by nv different sub regions with volumes vl l 1 2 nv with potential and flux continuity at the interfaces as illustrated in fig 1 a the formulation consists of the partial differential equations that govern the behavior of n coupled potentials t k l x t k 1 2 n defined in each subregion vl and varying with time t and with the position vector x different potentials can be simultaneously determined in each sub region for instance temperature concentrations velocity components or pressure governed in the corresponding sub region through a general formulation including linear or nonlinear equation and boundary source terms respectively p k l x t t and ϕ k l x t t in the form 1a w k l x t k l x t t k k l x t k l x t d k l x t k l x t p k l x t t x v l t 0 k 1 2 n l 1 2 n v with initial interface and boundary conditions given respectively by 1b t k l x 0 f k l x x v l 1c t k l x t t k m x t x s l m t 0 1d k k l x t k l x t n k k m x t k m x t n x s l m t 0 1e α k l x β k l x k k l x n t k l x t ϕ k l x t t x s l t 0 where n denotes the outward drawn normal to the interfaces s l m and external surfaces sl the space variable linear coefficients in eqs 1 already imply the choice of eigenfunction expansion base that shall be proposed in what follows and do not restrict the class of problems that can be handled by the present approach the source terms p k l x t t and ϕ k l x t t may incorporate nonlinear coefficients convective terms or any remaining terms that were chosen not to be represented in the characteristic linear coefficients that provide the eigenfunction expansion base since potentials and fluxes continuity is warranted at the subdomains interfaces one may rewrite the multiregion problem of eqs 1 as a single domain formulation consisting of n coupled potentials tk x t k 1 2 n defined in the overall region v as illustrated in fig 1 b leading to the following linear or nonlinear convection diffusion problem 2a w k x t k x t t k k x t k x t d k x t k x t p k x t t x v t 0 with initial and boundary conditions given respectively by 2b t k x 0 f k x x v 2c α k x β k x k k x n t k x t ϕ k x t t x s t 0 where the potentials vector is given by 2d t t 1 t 2 t k t n and where the linear coefficients in each operator dependent only on the spatial variables besides implying the choice of characteristic functional behaviors to be accounted for in the eigenfunction expansion base already take into consideration the transitions between the different subregions in much the same way the source terms pk x t t and ϕ k x t t also account for the different subregion transitions here particular emphasis will be given to formulations when the potentials are coupled through source sink terms in every point of the domain mikhailov and özisik 1984 mikhailov et al 1982 and this linear coupling can be separated from the equations source terms in the form 3a p k x t t p k x t t b x p 1 n σ k p t p x t t k x t with the symmetry relation 3b σ k p σ p k gitt with uncoupled eigenvalue problems the generalized integral transform technique gitt cotta 1990 cotta 1993 cotta 1994 cotta and mikhailov 1997 cotta 1998 cotta and mikhailov 2006 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b allows for a general hybrid numerical analytical treatment of eqs 1 for any nonlinear coupling among the potentials as applied in different contexts this approach should automatically lead to an analytical solution for linear source terms as presented in cotta 1993 cotta and mikhailov 1997 cotta et al 2018a the most straightforward solution path is to adopt independent eigenvalue problems for each potential which preferably should carry the characteristic information on the equation and boundary condition coefficients as already discussed in the problem formulation section thus the recommended set of uncoupled auxiliary problems is given by 4a k k x ψ k i x μ k i 2 w k x d k x ψ k i x 0 x v 4b α k x β k x k k x n ψ k i x 0 x s where the eigenvalues μ ki and related eigenfunctions ψ ki x are assumed to be known from application of the gitt itself in the solution of sturm liouville type problems cotta 1993 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b problem 4 allows through the associated orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions the definition of the following integral transform pairs 5a t k i t v w k x ψ k i x t k x t d v transforms 5b t k x t i 1 1 n i ψ k i x t k i t inverses where the norms are given by 5c n k i v w k x ψ k i 2 x d v the integral transformation of eq 2a is accomplished by applying the operator v ψ ki x dv and making use of the boundary conditions given by eqs 2c and 4b yielding 6a d t k i t d t μ k i 2 t k i t g k i t t i 1 2 t 0 k 1 2 n where the transformed source term g k i t t is due to the integral transformation of the equation and the boundary source terms 6b g k i t t v ψ k i x p k x t t d v s ϕ k x t t ψ k i x k k x ψ k i x n α k x β k x d s the initial conditions given by eq 2b are transformed through the operator v wk x ψ ki x dv to provide 6c t k i 0 f k i v w k x ψ k i x f k x d v equations 6 form an infinite coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the transformed potentials t k i t which is unlikely to be analytically solvable for the more general nonlinear situation nevertheless reliable algorithms are readily available to numerically handle this ode system after truncation to a sufficiently large finite order n the mathematica system wolfram 2017 for instance provides the routine ndsolve for solving stiff ode systems such as those that result from application of the gitt for high truncation orders under automatic absolute and relative errors control once the transformed potentials have been numerically computed the mathematica routine automatically provides an interpolating function object that represents the t variable behavior of the solution in a continuous form then the inversion formula eq 5b can be recalled to yield each potential field representation at any desired position xand time t it should be noticed that the full transformed system is in fact formed by the reunion of n coupled sub systems of ode s for each potential and the total size of the truncated transformed system n comes from summation of the truncation orders for each sub system nk which may be chosen to be different due to the individual convergence rates differences gitt with coupled eigenvalue problems in mikhailov and özisik 1984 mikhailov et al 1982 a formal exact solution was provided employing the classical integral transform method for the case when the source terms are linear both at the equation and boundary conditions p k x t and ϕ k x t and the symmetric coupling appears in the equation source terms as expressed in eqs 3 then coined a class iv problem mikhailov and özisik 1984 the exact solution for this linear symmetrically coupled problem is presented in the appendix handled through the coupled eigenvalue problem a1 this exact solution provides a clue for the proposition of an extension to the gitt which is expected to improve convergence rates and reduce computational costs in the solution of linear or nonlinear coupled convection diffusion equations the idea behind the proposed advancement is based on the adoption of a coupled eigenvalue problem as the base for the eigenfunction expansion to be employed in the integral transformation of eqs 2 therefore if information on the coupling of the different potentials in the original formulation even though just via characteristic linear functional forms is carried on into a coupled eigenvalue problem such as in eqs a1 one may anticipate an improved convergence behavior with respect to the above discussed more traditional integral transformation with less informative independent eigenvalue problems for each potential therefore let us consider the coupled auxiliary problem given by eqs a1 where the single set of eigenvalues μ i and related eigenfunctions for each potential ψ ki x are again assumed to be determined analytically through symbolic computation wolfram 2017 or from application of the gitt itself cotta 1993 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b again the associated orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions allows for the definition of the integral transform pair defined by eqs a2a b with norms as in eq a2c the integral transformation of eq 2a is then accomplished by applying the operator k 1 n v w k x ψ k i x d v and making use of the boundary conditions given by eqs 2c and a1b yielding 7a d t i t d t μ i 2 t i t g i t t i 1 2 t 0 where the transformed source term g i t t is due to the integral transformation of the equation source term and to the boundary source term including the coupling parcels 7b g i t t k 1 n v ψ k i x p k x t t d v s ϕ k x t t ψ k i x k k x ψ k i x n α k x β k x d s where the equation source term after extracting the source sink linear coupling is still allowed to be nonlinear and coupled in this more general situation the initial conditions given by eq 2b are transformed through the operator k 1 n v w k x ψ k i x d v to provide 7c t i 0 f i k 1 n v w k x ψ k i x f k x d v equations 7 form an infinite coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the transformed potentials t i t which again can be numerically solved for the general nonlinear case then the inversion formula eq a2b can be recalled to recover each potential field representation it should be noticed that now the transformed system was established through just one integral transformation operation in light of the integral transform pair eqs a2a b that is derived from the coupled eigenvalue problem proposal 3 applications the formal solutions above summarized are now employed in the analysis of two applications related to discrete and continuum models for flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media rocha and cruz 2001 cotta et al 2003 the first application deals with a discrete fracture model for transport involving different fractures interactions with a finite double layered heterogeneous porous matrix which is aimed at illustrating the single domain reformulation strategy in association with the gitt approach this class of problems has been previously considered through the gitt for a single fracture cotta et al 2003 however the single domain approach was not yet advanced at that time and a two region fracture matrix formulation was then adopted the second example is related to multi porosity multi permeability continuum models for flow and transport in fractured porous media here considering a dual porosity test case for vertical infiltration in unsaturated soils this application is selected in order to illustrate the coupled eigenvalue problem choice for the expansion base the gitt methodology was also previously employed in this class of formulations rocha and cruz 2001 cotta et al 2020 but at that time based on the more usual decoupled eigenvalue problem proposal here reviewed 3 1 transport of contaminants in two layer fractured porous medium transient mass transport of species in porous media is central to the analysis of contaminants dispersion in soils and man made facilities such as in the safety of nuclear waste repositories thereby attracting the attention of several researchers in the last few decades medved and cerný 2019 the presence of fractures in engineered barriers or in soils induces a preferential path for the flow of contaminants greatly enhancing the region reached by the species rendering the understanding of its effects mandatory for a careful analysis of contaminants dispersion in such structures these fractures can be a result of flexural tensile and compressive loads that the material has to sustain along the years in addition fractures can appear in the presence of thermal contraction drying corrosion sulphate attack and decalcification page and page 2007 since the pioneering works on the transport of contaminants in fractured porous medium in the 80 s grisak and pickens 1980 grisak and pickens 1981 tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 several extensions have been made including the analysis of plane cotta et al 2003 wu and pruess 2000 sen et al 2015 and wavy fractures renu and kumar 2016 fractal patterns cai et al 2017 stagnant water zones in fractures shahkarami et al 2016 and fracture networks seetharam et al 2014 tecklenburg et al 2016 landereau et al 2001 different solution methodologies for flow and transport in fractured media have been proposed in the literature like the multiple interacting continua approach minc dreuzy et al 2013 the multiple rate mass transfer mrmt method dreuzy et al 2013 babey et al 2014 the iterative sensitivity analysis isa costa et al 2019 and the tunneling method tm gómez et al 2014 among others contributions with purely diffusive transport in two layered porous medium are also available in the literature liu and ball 1998 the interaction of fractured multi layered engineered barriers for contaminants containment potentially could lead to more effective composite structures if they are rationally designed to limit the advancement of the species however careful study on the interaction of such structures with fractures is still lacking the present section aims at the application of the single domain formulation and the gitt to the analysis of transport of contaminants with finite half lives in two layer fractured porous media comparison with benchmarks for limiting simpler cases that still allow for an analytical solution involving all physical phenomena present in the more general formulation is done to illustrate the robustness of the solution methodology and verify the computational code developed then a critical analysis of the influence of the transition between porous media and of the relative difference in porosity is carried out moreover design suggestions for engineered barriers for contaminants are offered with possible implications especially for the environmental assessment of the dispersion of radionuclides the geometry employed is similar to the one in previous works cotta et al 2003 sudicky and frind 1982 here analyzing a network of an arbitrary number of parallel distinct fractures in saturated porous media the main difference is the presence of different layers of porous matrices with different porosities as illustrated in fig 2 for two layers of porous media and one or two parallel fractures in order to demonstrate the generality of the proposed solution methodology two cases were considered in this study the first one includes only one fracture fig 2 a and the second one includes two parallel fractures fig 2 b with different thicknesses within the two layers of the porous domain in the latter case the second fracture labeled fracture 2 in fig 2 b is centered in the domain and has half the width of the first fracture a cartesian coordinates system and main dimensions are included in fig 2 to ease the understanding of the models at x 0 the domain is in contact with a contaminant reservoir considered to be sufficiently large so that the concentration of species at this boundary can be regarded as constant to emulate the network of several parallel and equally spaced fractures symmetry conditions are applied to the right side of fig 2 y h and the middle of the first fracture y 0 the porous medium permeability is assumed to be very small and therefore transport of species is considered to be due to diffusion only outside the fracture within the fracture fully developed parabolic flow is assumed the contaminant is considered to suffer a first order decay reaction being depleted over time and to be initially absent of the whole domain analyzed furthermore a linear isotherm sorption model is adopted the single domain reformulation is employed to avoid the cumbersome coupling of the different transport models through their common boundaries knupp et al 2012 knupp et al 2014 knupp et al 2015b knupp et al 2015a zotin et al 2017 almeida et al 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa et al 2018 this formulation is accomplished by defining abruptly varying properties therefore the model for the convection diffusion problem is given by cotta et al

transport model of eqs 11a i the eigenvalue problem required in the integral transform formalism was itself solved through the gitt mikhailov and cotta 1994 a computational code developed in the wolfram mathematica v 11 platform wolfram 2017 was used to undertake both the symbolic and numerical tasks involved after truncation of the eigenfunction expansions for the original eigenfunction and for the concentration to the finite orders m and n respectively 3 2 flow in dual porosity dual permeability unsaturated porous medium there are several porous systems of industrial or scientific interest in which flow and transport occur through two or more paths or porosities sahimi 1995 and cannot be modeled by a single equation such as in ordinary porous media the presence of fractures plays a primary role in flow and transport in various systems since they act as preferential paths through which fluid and solutes move at much larger velocities than in the porous matrix in the previous section transport phenomena in a fractured porous rock has been modeled as discrete fractures interacting with a porous matrix when the fractures are too numerous and physically different continuum models are generally considered such as the so called dual porosity models first introduced by barenblatt et al barenblatt et al 1960 in the dual porosity dual permeability model a fractured porous formation is assumed to consist of two porous systems the fracture network and the porous matrix system which are considered to overlap in the geometric domain this dual porosity dual permeability model was extended by liu and chen liu and chen 1990 to a multiple porosity multiple permeability model in which more than two distinct types of materials exist within a medium and inter porosity mass exchange is attributed to the pressure head difference between pore domains since the pioneering work of barenblatt et al barenblatt et al 1960 the dual porosity model has been extensively used and improved to model flow and solute transport through fractured porous media including numerical treatments that handle more complex physics gerke and van genuchten 1993 gwo et al 1995 gerke and van genuchten 1996 vogel et al 2000 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 here the aim is to briefly illustrate the suitability of adopting the gitt methodology in the realm of the coupled eigenvalue problem proposal to handle the multi porosity multi permeability modeling of flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media for this purpose the same problem considered in rocha and cruz 2001 then solved by gitt with decoupled eigenvalue problems is analyzed let us consider vertical infiltration assuming darcy flow in both the fractures and the porous matrix without sources or sinks the one dimensional transient flow is then described by the richards equations for the pressure head in both the fractures and porous matrix gerke and van genuchten 1993 12a c m h m t x k m h

to the fracture and porous matrix systems respectively with wm 1 wf the last terms on the right hand side of eqs 12a b represent the liquid exchange between the fracture and the matrix systems responsible for the coupling of the governing equations for both fracture and pore systems an uniform pressure head initial condition is considered and constant prescribed pressures are imposed at the

is liquid content subscripts r and s refer to the residual and saturated contents ks is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation and α l m and n are empirical fitting parameters equations 13 are valid for both fracture and pore systems with the corresponding parameters for each structure in order to develop the exact integral transform solution based on the proposed coupled eigenvalue problem which also serves as a possible eigenfunction expansion base for the nonlinear case constant medium properties are obtained from eqs 12 evaluated at hav h 0 hl 2 thus eqs 12a b reduce to 14a w m c m h m t w m k m 2 h m x 2 α l h f h m 14b w f c f h f t w f k f 2 h f x 2 α l h m h f with initial and boundary conditions given by eqs 12c h the first step in solving either the linear or the nonlinear

h 0 h l h 0 x l then following the formalism presented in section 2 a coupled eigenvalue problem is proposed to offer a base for the eigenfunction expansion such as 16a k 1 d 2 ψ 1 x d x 2 μ 2 w 1 ψ 1 x σ l ψ 2 x ψ 1 x 0 x 0 l 16b k 2 d 2 ψ 2 x d x 2 μ 2 w 2 ψ 2 x σ l ψ 1 x ψ 2 x 0 x 0 l with boundary conditions given by 16c f ψ 1 0 ψ 2 0 0 ψ 1 l ψ 2 l 0 where 16g j w 1 w m c m k 1 w m k m w 2 w f c f k 2 w f k f the coupled eigenvalue problem of eqs 16 provides an improved base for the eigenfunction expansion and can be employed in finding the exact integral transform solution of problem 14 as well in the gitt hybrid solution of the nonlinear problem eqs 12 through direct correspondence to the general problem in section 2 both solutions are obtained via integral transforms either with the above coupled eigenvalue problem proposal or with the more usual uncoupled eigenvalue problems choice these two solution paths shall then be compared in the next section 4 results and discussions 4 1 transport of contaminants in two layer fractured porous medium the computational code developed for an arbitrary network of parallel unequal fractures has been tested against limiting simpler formulations for which analytical solutions can be obtained these test cases are obtained from simplified versions of the model of eqs 11a i the first simplified model considers a single semi infinite one dimensional region either a saturated porous medium or a fluid stream and an uniform velocity plug flow as shown below 17a c t u m λ r a d a c x 2 c x 2 c x t 17b c x 0 0 17c d c 0 t 1 c x x 0 where the concentration is independent of the horizontal coordinate y by virtue of the boundary conditions of eqs 11e f and the absence of this coordinate in the coefficients the one dimensional partial differential model of eqs 17a d admits analytical solution through laplace transforms yielding 18a c x t 1 2 e ξ 2 ζ x 1 e 2 ζ x 1 erf ζ t x 2 t erf ζ t x 2 t where 18b c ξ u m λ r a d a ζ 1 ξ 2 4 two specific limiting cases can be extracted from the simplified solution eqs 18a c the first one is related to pure diffusion in a saturated porous medium which is obtained by setting ξ 0 in eqs 18a c results for the concentration along the vertical coordinate at four different times in this limiting case obtained from the analytical expression are presented as symbols in fig 3 a in the same figure results obtained with the integral transform procedure and its computational code for the simpler situation of the limiting case are included as solid lines the agreement between the results of the two different approaches is perfect to the graph scale providing verification of the built computational code the second test case is also associated with the analytical solution of eqs 18a c the physical situation for this case is that of a domain fully comprised of fluid flowing in the positive x direction for this case results obtained with eqs 18a c with ξ 2168 95 are presented as symbols in fig 3 b for the same simplified conditions the integral transform methodology of the present work yields the results shown in solid lines in fig 3 b the agreement of the concentration profiles along the vertical coordinate obtained with both approaches is once more perfect to the graph scale to test the capabilities of the methodology and the computational code on dealing with the abrupt transition between porous media of different porosities another simplified version of the complete model of eqs 11a i is considered suppressing the fracture domain from fig 2 i e considering only diffusion along two different porous media the model of eqs 11a i can be simplified to 19a w c t x d c x w c x t 19b c x 0 0 19c d c 0 t 1 c x x l 0 where the variation of the concentration with the horizontal direction has been dropped for the same reasons considered in eqs 17a d the simplified one dimensional model of eqs 19a d can be solved analytically through the integral transform method using multiregion eigenvalue problems mikhailov and özisik 1984 results from such analysis are offered as symbols in fig 3 c d for the entry data presented in table 1 except for the width of the fracture that is set to zero in this limiting case furthermore the height of the porous medium b a in fig 2 is fixed as 0 3 m two cases are considered the first one fig 3 c adopts a higher porosity for medium b in comparison with the porosity of medium a specifically θ b 4θ a 0 2 in the second case fig 3 d the porosity of medium b is considered to be smaller than the porosity of medium a with the same proportion i e θ b 0 25θ a 0 0125 results for the concentration profiles along the vertical coordinate obtained with the present more general integral transform framework are shown as solid lines in fig 3 c d the adherence with the analytical benchmark is excellent providing further confidence on the adequacy of the solution methodology and the computational code developed thus once the built algorithm was properly verified we may return to the more general problem originally proposed with an arbitrary number of distinct parallel fractures here illustrated for configurations with one or two parallel fractures within the layered porous matrix which does not have a known analytical solution table 2 shows the convergence behavior of the concentration of contaminants at the center of the fracture for two different dimensionless times the case of slower convergence among those here considered consisting of θ b 0 25θ a 0 0125 and a 0 25l was chosen to illustrate such behavior furthermore l is set to 80 in order to assure the accuracy of the boundary condition of eq 15 d the remainder of the parameters is taken from table 1 full convergence to at least three significant digits is achieved for both dimensionless times for truncation orders below n 2000 fig 4 presents results for two layered fractured porous media with θ b 0 0125 and the rest of the parameters as shown in table 1 concentration contours are provided in fig 4 a c for three different positions of the transition between the porous media namely a 0 25l 0 5l 0 75l and at t 2 roughly equivalent to 36 years according to the entry data and the definition of dimensionless time of eq 14 b vertical green lines indicate the position of the transition between the two porous media and the horizontal blue line represents the fracture position the concentration contours clearly show how for this case a shallower low porosity first layer suppresses the advancement of the contaminants concentration profiles for the most critical region i e the center of the fracture y 0 are presented in fig 4 d f to further demonstrate the aforementioned effect under the influence of the high porosity porous medium x a a steeper decrease of the concentration with depth can be observed in comparison with the low porosity zone of influence such behavior can be explained by the more prominent penetration of contaminants in the high porosity porous medium a depleting faster the contaminants from the fracture and spreading them more effectively along the y direction hence the presence of a large low porosity first layer is detrimental as far as contaminant containment is concerned in the case depicted in fig 4 f the species reaches a distance from the point of departure of approximately 24 m after 36 years have elapsed which is the maximum value analyzed for the case of a lower porosity first layer the results of fig 4 point to the possible benefits of positioning the high porosity layer first thus absorbing the contaminants and distributing them along a broader area and limiting its advancement to verify this assumption similar results are obtained for θ b 0 2 and the parameters of table 1 fig 5 a c present the concentration contours at t 2 for three different positions of the transition between porous media namely a 0 25l 0 5l 0 75l the total depth l is set to 30 determined by inspection as the length necessary for the assurance of the physical meaning of the boundary condition of eq 15 d once more vertical green lines are included to mark the position of the transition between porous media a marked reduction of the depth attained by the contaminants hinted by the value of l is visible in a comparison of figs 4 a c and 5 a c as discussed the high porosity first layer was so effective that for all cases the species seems to be confined to a neighborhood of the inlet boundary x 0 more information about the transport phenomena involved can be attained with the observation of the concentration profile along the centerline of the fracture y 0 in fact except for the case with a 0 25l both other cases severely restrict the contaminants presence to a dimensionless depth of roughly 10 which is equivalent to 3 m in 36 years this figure is 6x lower than the lowest depth achieved by the species in the case θ b θ a hence confirming the effectiveness of the presence of a highly porous first layer all the results presented in fig 4 and fig 5 were obtained considering only one fracture configuration within the domain that represents the network of fractures to illustrate the generality of the proposed solution methodology a more complex configuration was considered fig 6 shows the results obtained for the case with two parallel unequal fractures see fig 2 b that characterize the fracture network the results for θ b θ a were observed to be more interesting and therefore only such results are here presented in comparison with the results with one fracture type a more homogeneous concentration distribution along the y direction and an increase of the depth attained by the contaminants could be observed the latter fact required an extension of the domain by setting l 100 instead of l 80 used for the single fracture case the reason for this phenomenon is the additional convective transport source i e fracture 2 and the associated mass transport enhancement in the x direction for instance for the case with a 60 the presence of a second fracture extended the depth affected by the contaminant to 30 m after 36 years a 25 increase in comparison with the single fracture case 4 2 flow in dual porosity dual permeability unsaturated porous medium the dual porosity dual permeability flow model of eqs 12 is now analysed by the integral transform approach with emphasis on the adoption of the coupled eigenvalue problem of eqs 16 the linear version of the flow problem eqs 14 allows for a straightforward verification of the convergence enhancement effect achievable by this choice of coupled eigenvalue problem with respect to the more usual adoption of decoupled eigenvalue problems one for each potential fracture and porous matrix pressure heads as implemented in rocha and cruz 2001 for this verification the properties attributed to the fracture system are rocha and cruz 2001 wf 0 05 θ r 0 θ s 0 5 ks 2 3148 10 4 m s α 10 m 1 l 0 5 n 2 and the properties attributed to the porous matrix are wm 0 95 θ r 0 10526 θ s 0 5 ks 1 2183 10 7 m s α 0 5 m 1 l 0 5 n 1 5 the remaining input data are l 0 4 m h 0 0 5 m hl 0 h 0 5 m and the exchange term coefficient was estimated according to the procedure suggested in gerke and van genuchten 1993 yielding σ l 0 009535 a second test case was considered by increasing the exchange term coefficient to σ l 0 05959 which corresponds to a smaller value of the average matrix block size distance from the center of a fictitious matrix block to the fractures boundaries in the computations for both the coupled and the uncoupled eigenvalue problems basis a maximum truncation order of n 50 terms in the eigenfunction expansions was enough to guarantee convergence in the whole range of space and time variables considered fig 7 a d provide a critical comparison of convergence rates between the two integral transform solutions with coupled or uncoupled eigenvalue problems it is plotted the evolution of the absolute value of the pressure head relative error for both the porous matrix and the fractures and for the two different values of the exchange term coefficient σ l 0 009535 and σ l 0 05959 as the truncation order of the expansion is increased the relative error estimates are computed at mid height of the porous medium x 0 2m and the solution with n 50 terms was assumed as the exact solution in determining the relative errors of expansions truncated up to n 40 terms the solid lines represent the coupled eigenvalue problem solution and dashed lines represent the decoupled eigenvalue problem solution as usual in eigenfunction expansion approaches convergence is expected to be slower closer to the initial condition in the absence of time variable source terms therefore a few lower values of the time variable were considered to explore the differences and the results are plotted in red lines for t 15 sec blue lines for t 30 sec and green lines for t 45 sec the exchange term coefficient essentially governs the importance of the coupling term between the matrix and fracture pressure heads therefore it is expected that the advantage on convergence rate improvement due to the choice of a coupled eigenvalue problem becomes more evident when this coefficient is increased clearly for the smaller σ l fig 7 a b at the smallest value of time t 15 sec there is no significant difference between the convergence pattern of the two expansions which have the relative errors practically overlapping on the other hand in this same value of σ l for the other two higher values of time the coupled eigenvalue problem solution shows a more consistent behaviour with evident convergence enhancement over the more traditional alternative it can also be observed in both solution paths that the fractures region expansion has lower absolute values of the relative error than the porous matrix expansion for the higher σ l case fig 7 c d however one may observe the marked convergence rate improvement allowed for by the coupled eigenvalue problem proposed expansion once this coupling between the two potentials is more significant it can be seen that the truncation order of n 40 terms is not even necessary to achieve several fully converged digits in the coupled eigenvalue problem solution for the presented values of time fig 8 a d present pressure head profiles across the domain at different times respectively for the porous matrix and fractures and for the two different values of the exchange term coefficient σ l 0 009535 and σ l 0 05959 solid lines represent the gitt solution with the coupled eigenvalue problem n 50 while dashed lines represent a numerical solution obtained from the ndsolve routine of the mathematica v 12 system wolfram 2017 which implements the method of lines as for the time variable values the red lines indicate for fig 8 a and 8 b with σ l 0 009535 t 7 5 sec green lines for t 15 sec violet lines for t 50 sec light blue lines for t 150 sec and dark blue lines for t 1500 sec and for fig 8 c and 8 d with σ l 0 05959 t 3 75 sec green lines for t 7 5 sec violet lines for t 25 sec light blue lines for t 75 sec and dark blue lines for t 1500 sec clearly except for very short times the analytical and numerical solutions are fully overlapping since the purely numerical solution in wolfram 2017 requires that the boundary and initial conditions are consistent and a singularity in fact exists in the present example at x 0 there is a small loss of accuracy at shorter times though an artificially continuous boundary condition is imposed tables 3 a b illustrate the convergence behaviour of the pressure heads in the porous matrix and the fractures respectively at mid height of the medium x 0 2m and different times t 15 30 45 75 and 150 sec again for the integral transformation with coupled eigenvalue problem and truncation order n up to 50 only the results for the case with smaller value of the exchange term coefficient σ l 0 009535 are analyzed in tabular form for the convergence behavior since from fig 7 this case of weaker coupling was clearly the less enhanced in terms of convergence rate in comparison to the decoupled eigenvalue problem more traditional alternative from these tables it can be reconfirmed first of all that convergence for the fractures system is indeed faster than for the porous matrix also for the smallest value of t 15 sec n 35 already provides full convergence to five significant digits in the porous matrix head while this number decreases to n 15 terms for t 30 sec for the other values of t in the porous matrix full convergence to five digits is already achieved at very low truncation orders of n 5 finally fig 9 a b compare the pressure heads evolution at the fractures and porous matrix by showing the corresponding profiles for different times for σ l 0 009535 t 7 5 15 50 150 and 1500 sec and σ l 0 05959 t 3 75 7 5 25 75 and 1500 sec again these converged results were obtained from the gitt with coupled eigenvalue problem solution n 50 where the solid lines represent the porous matrix while the dot dashed lines represent the fractures in light of the relative importance of the exchange terms only in the early transient one may observe differences between the heads in the two systems which merge as the steady state is approached for the larger value of the exchange term coefficient corresponding to a smaller characteristic length of the matrix structure for instance a reduced fracture spacing in the case of parallel rectangular voids this more densely fractured media leads to a faster exchange between the two structures which equalize their pressure heads in a shorter time 5 conclusions a unified integral transform hybrid solution for the continuum and discrete formulations of flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media has been presented two complementary aspects have been emphasized first a systematic treatment of complex heterogeneous domains has been reviewed which involves rewriting the problem formulation as a single domain with space variable properties that encompasses all the subregions including individual fractures and different porous layers second an alternative of implementing the integral transformation of heterogeneous media on the basis of coupled eigenvalue problems has been explored the coupling through the source sink terms can then be carried along to the eigenfunctions which form the original potentials expansions such as in multi porosity multi permeability models of fractured porous media with an expected convergence rates improvement two applications were then considered which illustrate the complementary formalisms here advanced namely transport in a parallel unequal fractures matrix interaction problem with a layered porous matrix and flow in a dual porosity dual permeability vertical infiltration problem the obtained analytical and hybrid numerical analytical solutions were verified against exact solutions for limiting simplified cases or purely numerical solutions and convergence rates of the eigenfunction expansions were demonstrated for typical values of the governing parameters the formal solutions here provided have a promising applicability in advanced formulations of transport

467,the generalized integral transform technique gitt is employed in combination with a single domain reformulation strategy and a coupled eigenvalue problem expansion base to construct analytical or hybrid numerical analytical solutions for flow and transport in fractured porous media the problem formulation and provided formal solutions encompass both continuum multi porosity multi permeability and discrete fracture matrix interaction models for heterogeneous porous media the single domain representation is written with the aid of space variable coefficients that account for the abrupt physical properties and source terms transitions across the different subregions the aim is to provide an unified formalism that includes a wide class of problems in fluid flow heat and mass transfer in heterogeneous media with the integral transformation process for the potentials pressure velocities temperature or concentrations being applied over the whole physical domain at once thus markedly reducing the mathematical manipulations the space variable coefficients are then carried on to the eigenvalue problem formulation which provides the base for the eigenfunction expansion in addition a coupled eigenvalue problem alternative is proposed which is particularly useful in dealing with multi porosity multi permeability flow and transport models collapsing the multiple coupled potentials equations into one single integral transformation process two representative applications are briefly considered one dealing with contaminant transport with discrete fracture matrix interaction in

classical integral transform approaches for partial differential equations such as the best known laplace and fourier transforms have been and still remain very important in the advancement of research and application of transport phenomena in porous media though limited to linear formulations and especially handy for the situations of infinite and semi infinite media these classical approaches have provided a large number of analytical expressions that are common practice in different branches of engineering and physical sciences and have been derived for transport in porous media and compiled in different sources bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 van genuchten 1981 van genuchten and alves 1982 ungs et al 1986 despite the evident progress on the more flexible numerical methods in the last few decades the analytical methodologies were not abandoned at all first due to the unbeatable accuracy and fairly low computational costs that they allow for though quite restricted in terms of formulation complexity second because of the continuous need for reference benchmark results in verifying the increasingly more competitive numerical schemes and associated computational tools that have been made available third and most important in the present context is the proposition of alternative solution methodologies that combine such analytical concepts with modern numerical analysis that are continuously popping out in the open literature one such hybrid numerical analytical approach is the so called generalized integral transform technique gitt cotta 1990 cotta 1993 cotta 1994 cotta and mikhailov 1997 cotta 1998 cotta and mikhailov 2006 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b developed as an extension to the classical integral transform method mikhailov and özisik 1984 for a priori non transformable partial differential problems the basic idea behind this extended eigenfunction expansion approach is to extract from the original problem formulation a characteristic equation and boundary condition operators to construct an eigenvalue problem that will provide an informative base for the expansion leading to the development of the integral transform pair transformation and inverse upon integral transformation of the partial differential equations and employment of the integral transform pair an infinite coupled ordinary differential system for the transformed potentials is attained the transformed system may be handled analytically for linear problems or numerically for nonlinear formulations and then the inverse formula is recalled to reconstruct the desired potentials either in fully analytical form or as hybrid numerical analytical solution though the original development of the gitt was mostly undertaken within the thermal science and engineering field the progresses on drying in capillary porous bodies ribeiro et al 1993 ribeiro and cotta 1995 guigon et al 1999 dantas et al 2003 dantas et al 2007 and natural convective heat transfer in porous cavities baohua and cotta 1993 alves and cotta 2000 alves et al 2002 luz neto et al 2002 luz neto et al 2006 hirata et al 2006 hirata et al 2007 hirata et al 2009 have stimulated the application and extension of this hybrid approach to other topics involving transport phenomena in porous media such as in environmental petroleum and nuclear engineering almeida and cotta 1995 almeida and cotta 1996 cotta et al 1998 liu et al 1998 leal and ruperti jr 2000 liu et al 2000 leal and ruperti jr 2001 rocha and cruz 2001 heilbron filho et al 2002 cotta et al 2003 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 naveira cotta et al 2013 deucher et al 2016 deucher et al 2017 cotta et al 2020 among such developments two previous contributions on the gitt approach are directly related to the ideas here advanced first the analysis of contaminant transport with interaction between a discrete fracture and a porous matrix cotta et al 2003 second the handling of dual porosity dual permeability models for flow and contaminant transport in unsaturated fractured porous media rocha and cruz 2001 in light of recent developments on the gitt approach the present work is aimed at unifying and generalizing such treatment of both the continuum and discrete formulations of flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media first a single domain reformulation strategy hirata et al 2006 hirata et al 2007 hirata et al 2009 knupp et al 2012 knupp et al 2014 knupp et al 2015b knupp et al 2015a zotin et al 2017 almeida et al 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa et al 2018 is adopted which permits to rewrite a system of coupled convection diffusion problems that govern each subdomain of a heterogeneous complex configuration as one single formulation with space variable coefficients and source terms for each potential this strategy is particularly beneficial in reducing the analytical involvement in applying the gitt approach since only one integral transformation process is implemented at once towards elimination of the space variables dependence of any particular transformed potential instead of tediously transforming and coupling the transformed equations for individual subdomains then the space variable coefficients that are responsible for the subdomain transitions are carried along to the eigenvalue problem formulation thus accounting for the heterogeneities present in the original problem second a coupled eigenvalue problem choice is here proposed based on the exact integral transform solution of linear diffusion problems in heterogeneous media mikhailov and özisik 1984 mikhailov et al 1982 in which the eigenfunctions are coupled through source sink terms in every point of the domain this choice of eigenfunction expansion base is quite handy when dealing with multi porosity multi permeability flow and transport formulations which involve coupled potentials that characterize the exchange among two or more distinct porosities and permeabilities systems of the heterogeneous porous medium again there is substantial gain in the analytical and numerical steps of the methodology as the original multicomponent system undergoes one single integral transformation process for all the coupled potentials since the coupling is already accounted for by the eigenfunctions and respective eigenvalues in other words the use of coupled eigenvalue problems enables the integral transformation of all spatial variation and coupling information into a single set of ordinary differential equations for the transformed problem thereby markedly simplifying the solution of the problem the formal solutions here derived are then employed in the analysis of two applications dealing with both continuum and discrete modeling of transport phenomena in fractured heterogeneous porous media the first example provides a gitt solution for the transport of contaminants with finite half lives in a layered fractured porous medium the second example is related to the flow in unsaturated structured soils using a physical non equilibrium dual porosity dual permeability type model in both cases convergence analysis of the eigenfunction expansion is undertaken and a few numerical results are reported to illustrate the major parametric effects on the considered flow and transport phenomena 2 problem formulation and formal solutions problem formulation the analysis is initiated by recalling the general concept of the single domain reformulation strategy cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b before discussing the possible choices of eigenfunction expansions base let us consider a sufficiently general multidimensional linear or nonlinear convection diffusion problem defined in a heterogeneous configuration that is represented by nv different sub regions with volumes vl l 1 2 nv with potential and flux continuity at the interfaces as illustrated in fig 1 a the formulation consists of the partial differential equations that govern the behavior of n coupled potentials t k l x t k 1 2 n defined in each subregion vl and varying with time t and with the position vector x different potentials can be simultaneously determined in each sub region for instance temperature concentrations velocity components or pressure governed in the corresponding sub region through a general formulation including linear or nonlinear equation and boundary source terms respectively p k l x t t and ϕ k l x t t in the form 1a w k l x t k l x t t k k l x t k l x t d k l x t k l x t p k l x t t x v l t 0 k 1 2 n l 1 2 n v with initial interface and boundary conditions given respectively by 1b t k l x 0 f k l x x v l 1c t k l x t t k m x t x s l m t 0 1d k k l x t k l x t n k k m x t k m x t n x s l m t 0 1e α k l x β k l x k k l x n t k l x t ϕ k l x t t x s l t 0 where n denotes the outward drawn normal to the interfaces s l m and external surfaces sl the space variable linear coefficients in eqs 1 already imply the choice of eigenfunction expansion base that shall be proposed in what follows and do not restrict the class of problems that can be handled by the present approach the source terms p k l x t t and ϕ k l x t t may incorporate nonlinear coefficients convective terms or any remaining terms that were chosen not to be represented in the characteristic linear coefficients that provide the eigenfunction expansion base since potentials and fluxes continuity is warranted at the subdomains interfaces one may rewrite the multiregion problem of eqs 1 as a single domain formulation consisting of n coupled potentials tk x t k 1 2 n defined in the overall region v as illustrated in fig 1 b leading to the following linear or nonlinear convection diffusion problem 2a w k x t k x t t k k x t k x t d k x t k x t p k x t t x v t 0 with initial and boundary conditions given respectively by 2b t k x 0 f k x x v 2c α k x β k x k k x n t k x t ϕ k x t t x s t 0 where the potentials vector is given by 2d t t 1 t 2 t k t n and where the linear coefficients in each operator dependent only on the spatial variables besides implying the choice of characteristic functional behaviors to be accounted for in the eigenfunction expansion base already take into consideration the transitions between the different subregions in much the same way the source terms pk x t t and ϕ k x t t also account for the different subregion transitions here particular emphasis will be given to formulations when the potentials are coupled through source sink terms in every point of the domain mikhailov and özisik 1984 mikhailov et al 1982 and this linear coupling can be separated from the equations source terms in the form 3a p k x t t p k x t t b x p 1 n σ k p t p x t t k x t with the symmetry relation 3b σ k p σ p k gitt with uncoupled eigenvalue problems the generalized integral transform technique gitt cotta 1990 cotta 1993 cotta 1994 cotta and mikhailov 1997 cotta 1998 cotta and mikhailov 2006 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b allows for a general hybrid numerical analytical treatment of eqs 1 for any nonlinear coupling among the potentials as applied in different contexts this approach should automatically lead to an analytical solution for linear source terms as presented in cotta 1993 cotta and mikhailov 1997 cotta et al 2018a the most straightforward solution path is to adopt independent eigenvalue problems for each potential which preferably should carry the characteristic information on the equation and boundary condition coefficients as already discussed in the problem formulation section thus the recommended set of uncoupled auxiliary problems is given by 4a k k x ψ k i x μ k i 2 w k x d k x ψ k i x 0 x v 4b α k x β k x k k x n ψ k i x 0 x s where the eigenvalues μ ki and related eigenfunctions ψ ki x are assumed to be known from application of the gitt itself in the solution of sturm liouville type problems cotta 1993 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b problem 4 allows through the associated orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions the definition of the following integral transform pairs 5a t k i t v w k x ψ k i x t k x t d v transforms 5b t k x t i 1 1 n i ψ k i x t k i t inverses where the norms are given by 5c n k i v w k x ψ k i 2 x d v the integral transformation of eq 2a is accomplished by applying the operator v ψ ki x dv and making use of the boundary conditions given by eqs 2c and 4b yielding 6a d t k i t d t μ k i 2 t k i t g k i t t i 1 2 t 0 k 1 2 n where the transformed source term g k i t t is due to the integral transformation of the equation and the boundary source terms 6b g k i t t v ψ k i x p k x t t d v s ϕ k x t t ψ k i x k k x ψ k i x n α k x β k x d s the initial conditions given by eq 2b are transformed through the operator v wk x ψ ki x dv to provide 6c t k i 0 f k i v w k x ψ k i x f k x d v equations 6 form an infinite coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the transformed potentials t k i t which is unlikely to be analytically solvable for the more general nonlinear situation nevertheless reliable algorithms are readily available to numerically handle this ode system after truncation to a sufficiently large finite order n the mathematica system wolfram 2017 for instance provides the routine ndsolve for solving stiff ode systems such as those that result from application of the gitt for high truncation orders under automatic absolute and relative errors control once the transformed potentials have been numerically computed the mathematica routine automatically provides an interpolating function object that represents the t variable behavior of the solution in a continuous form then the inversion formula eq 5b can be recalled to yield each potential field representation at any desired position xand time t it should be noticed that the full transformed system is in fact formed by the reunion of n coupled sub systems of ode s for each potential and the total size of the truncated transformed system n comes from summation of the truncation orders for each sub system nk which may be chosen to be different due to the individual convergence rates differences gitt with coupled eigenvalue problems in mikhailov and özisik 1984 mikhailov et al 1982 a formal exact solution was provided employing the classical integral transform method for the case when the source terms are linear both at the equation and boundary conditions p k x t and ϕ k x t and the symmetric coupling appears in the equation source terms as expressed in eqs 3 then coined a class iv problem mikhailov and özisik 1984 the exact solution for this linear symmetrically coupled problem is presented in the appendix handled through the coupled eigenvalue problem a1 this exact solution provides a clue for the proposition of an extension to the gitt which is expected to improve convergence rates and reduce computational costs in the solution of linear or nonlinear coupled convection diffusion equations the idea behind the proposed advancement is based on the adoption of a coupled eigenvalue problem as the base for the eigenfunction expansion to be employed in the integral transformation of eqs 2 therefore if information on the coupling of the different potentials in the original formulation even though just via characteristic linear functional forms is carried on into a coupled eigenvalue problem such as in eqs a1 one may anticipate an improved convergence behavior with respect to the above discussed more traditional integral transformation with less informative independent eigenvalue problems for each potential therefore let us consider the coupled auxiliary problem given by eqs a1 where the single set of eigenvalues μ i and related eigenfunctions for each potential ψ ki x are again assumed to be determined analytically through symbolic computation wolfram 2017 or from application of the gitt itself cotta 1993 cotta et al 2018a cotta et al 2018b again the associated orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions allows for the definition of the integral transform pair defined by eqs a2a b with norms as in eq a2c the integral transformation of eq 2a is then accomplished by applying the operator k 1 n v w k x ψ k i x d v and making use of the boundary conditions given by eqs 2c and a1b yielding 7a d t i t d t μ i 2 t i t g i t t i 1 2 t 0 where the transformed source term g i t t is due to the integral transformation of the equation source term and to the boundary source term including the coupling parcels 7b g i t t k 1 n v ψ k i x p k x t t d v s ϕ k x t t ψ k i x k k x ψ k i x n α k x β k x d s where the equation source term after extracting the source sink linear coupling is still allowed to be nonlinear and coupled in this more general situation the initial conditions given by eq 2b are transformed through the operator k 1 n v w k x ψ k i x d v to provide 7c t i 0 f i k 1 n v w k x ψ k i x f k x d v equations 7 form an infinite coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the transformed potentials t i t which again can be numerically solved for the general nonlinear case then the inversion formula eq a2b can be recalled to recover each potential field representation it should be noticed that now the transformed system was established through just one integral transformation operation in light of the integral transform pair eqs a2a b that is derived from the coupled eigenvalue problem proposal 3 applications the formal solutions above summarized are now employed in the analysis of two applications related to discrete and continuum models for flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media rocha and cruz 2001 cotta et al 2003 the first application deals with a discrete fracture model for transport involving different fractures interactions with a finite double layered heterogeneous porous matrix which is aimed at illustrating the single domain reformulation strategy in association with the gitt approach this class of problems has been previously considered through the gitt for a single fracture cotta et al 2003 however the single domain approach was not yet advanced at that time and a two region fracture matrix formulation was then adopted the second example is related to multi porosity multi permeability continuum models for flow and transport in fractured porous media here considering a dual porosity test case for vertical infiltration in unsaturated soils this application is selected in order to illustrate the coupled eigenvalue problem choice for the expansion base the gitt methodology was also previously employed in this class of formulations rocha and cruz 2001 cotta et al 2020 but at that time based on the more usual decoupled eigenvalue problem proposal here reviewed 3 1 transport of contaminants in two layer fractured porous medium transient mass transport of species in porous media is central to the analysis of contaminants dispersion in soils and man made facilities such as in the safety of nuclear waste repositories thereby attracting the attention of several researchers in the last few decades medved and cerný 2019 the presence of fractures in engineered barriers or in soils induces a preferential path for the flow of contaminants greatly enhancing the region reached by the species rendering the understanding of its effects mandatory for a careful analysis of contaminants dispersion in such structures these fractures can be a result of flexural tensile and compressive loads that the material has to sustain along the years in addition fractures can appear in the presence of thermal contraction drying corrosion sulphate attack and decalcification page and page 2007 since the pioneering works on the transport of contaminants in fractured porous medium in the 80 s grisak and pickens 1980 grisak and pickens 1981 tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 several extensions have been made including the analysis of plane cotta et al 2003 wu and pruess 2000 sen et al 2015 and wavy fractures renu and kumar 2016 fractal patterns cai et al 2017 stagnant water zones in fractures shahkarami et al 2016 and fracture networks seetharam et al 2014 tecklenburg et al 2016 landereau et al 2001 different solution methodologies for flow and transport in fractured media have been proposed in the literature like the multiple interacting continua approach minc dreuzy et al 2013 the multiple rate mass transfer mrmt method dreuzy et al 2013 babey et al 2014 the iterative sensitivity analysis isa costa et al 2019 and the tunneling method tm gómez et al 2014 among others contributions with purely diffusive transport in two layered porous medium are also available in the literature liu and ball 1998 the interaction of fractured multi layered engineered barriers for contaminants containment potentially could lead to more effective composite structures if they are rationally designed to limit the advancement of the species however careful study on the interaction of such structures with fractures is still lacking the present section aims at the application of the single domain formulation and the gitt to the analysis of transport of contaminants with finite half lives in two layer fractured porous media comparison with benchmarks for limiting simpler cases that still allow for an analytical solution involving all physical phenomena present in the more general formulation is done to illustrate the robustness of the solution methodology and verify the computational code developed then a critical analysis of the influence of the transition between porous media and of the relative difference in porosity is carried out moreover design suggestions for engineered barriers for contaminants are offered with possible implications especially for the environmental assessment of the dispersion of radionuclides the geometry employed is similar to the one in previous works cotta et al 2003 sudicky and frind 1982 here analyzing a network of an arbitrary number of parallel distinct fractures in saturated porous media the main difference is the presence of different layers of porous matrices with different porosities as illustrated in fig 2 for two layers of porous media and one or two parallel fractures in order to demonstrate the generality of the proposed solution methodology two cases were considered in this study the first one includes only one fracture fig 2 a and the second one includes two parallel fractures fig 2 b with different thicknesses within the two layers of the porous domain in the latter case the second fracture labeled fracture 2 in fig 2 b is centered in the domain and has half the width of the first fracture a cartesian coordinates system and main dimensions are included in fig 2 to ease the understanding of the models at x 0 the domain is in contact with a contaminant reservoir considered to be sufficiently large so that the concentration of species at this boundary can be regarded as constant to emulate the network of several parallel and equally spaced fractures symmetry conditions are applied to the right side of fig 2 y h and the middle of the first fracture y 0 the porous medium permeability is assumed to be very small and therefore transport of species is considered to be due to diffusion only outside the fracture within the fracture fully developed parabolic flow is assumed the contaminant is considered to suffer a first order decay reaction being depleted over time and to be initially absent of the whole domain analyzed furthermore a linear isotherm sorption model is adopted the single domain reformulation is employed to avoid the cumbersome coupling of the different transport models through their common boundaries knupp et al 2012 knupp et al 2014 knupp et al 2015b knupp et al 2015a zotin et al 2017 almeida et al 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa and cotta 2018 lisboa et al 2018 this formulation is accomplished by defining abruptly varying properties therefore the model for the convection diffusion problem is given by cotta et al

transport model of eqs 11a i the eigenvalue problem required in the integral transform formalism was itself solved through the gitt mikhailov and cotta 1994 a computational code developed in the wolfram mathematica v 11 platform wolfram 2017 was used to undertake both the symbolic and numerical tasks involved after truncation of the eigenfunction expansions for the original eigenfunction and for the concentration to the finite orders m and n respectively 3 2 flow in dual porosity dual permeability unsaturated porous medium there are several porous systems of industrial or scientific interest in which flow and transport occur through two or more paths or porosities sahimi 1995 and cannot be modeled by a single equation such as in ordinary porous media the presence of fractures plays a primary role in flow and transport in various systems since they act as preferential paths through which fluid and solutes move at much larger velocities than in the porous matrix in the previous section transport phenomena in a fractured porous rock has been modeled as discrete fractures interacting with a porous matrix when the fractures are too numerous and physically different continuum models are generally considered such as the so called dual porosity models first introduced by barenblatt et al barenblatt et al 1960 in the dual porosity dual permeability model a fractured porous formation is assumed to consist of two porous systems the fracture network and the porous matrix system which are considered to overlap in the geometric domain this dual porosity dual permeability model was extended by liu and chen liu and chen 1990 to a multiple porosity multiple permeability model in which more than two distinct types of materials exist within a medium and inter porosity mass exchange is attributed to the pressure head difference between pore domains since the pioneering work of barenblatt et al barenblatt et al 1960 the dual porosity model has been extensively used and improved to model flow and solute transport through fractured porous media including numerical treatments that handle more complex physics gerke and van genuchten 1993 gwo et al 1995 gerke and van genuchten 1996 vogel et al 2000 šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 here the aim is to briefly illustrate the suitability of adopting the gitt methodology in the realm of the coupled eigenvalue problem proposal to handle the multi porosity multi permeability modeling of flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media for this purpose the same problem considered in rocha and cruz 2001 then solved by gitt with decoupled eigenvalue problems is analyzed let us consider vertical infiltration assuming darcy flow in both the fractures and the porous matrix without sources or sinks the one dimensional transient flow is then described by the richards equations for the pressure head in both the fractures and porous matrix gerke and van genuchten 1993 12a c m h m t x k m h m x k m α l w m h f h m 12b c f h f t x k f h f x k f α l w f h m h f where c is the specific liquid capacity of the medium h x t is the pressure head t is time x is the flow direction downward coordinate k is the hydraulic conductivity αl is a transfer coefficient for the liquid and w is the ratio of the fracture or pore system volume to the total medium volume the subscripts f and m refer to the fracture and porous matrix systems respectively with wm 1 wf the last terms on the right hand side of eqs 12a b represent the liquid exchange between the fracture and the matrix systems responsible for the coupling of the governing equations for both fracture and pore systems an uniform pressure head initial condition is considered and constant prescribed pressures are imposed at the domain limits x 0 and x l written as vogel et al 2000 12c d h m x 0 h f x 0 h 12e h h m 0 t h f 0 t h 0 h m l t h f l t h l the pressure head dependent soil properties are given by the following

is liquid content subscripts r and s refer to the residual and saturated contents ks is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation and α l m and n are empirical fitting parameters equations 13 are valid for both fracture and pore systems with the corresponding parameters for each structure in order to develop the exact integral transform solution based on the proposed coupled eigenvalue problem which also serves as a possible eigenfunction expansion base for the nonlinear case constant medium properties are obtained from eqs 12 evaluated at hav h 0 hl 2 thus eqs 12a b reduce to 14a w m c m h m t w m k m 2 h m x 2 α l h f h m 14b w f c f h f t w f k f 2 h f x 2 α l h m h f with initial and boundary conditions given by eqs 12c h the first step in solving either the linear or the nonlinear problems eqs 14 and eqs 12 respectively is the proposition of filtering solutions that at least make the boundary conditions 12e h homogeneous the simple filter is then given by 15a b h f m x h f f x h 0 h l h 0 x l then following the formalism presented in section 2 a coupled eigenvalue problem is proposed to offer a base for the eigenfunction expansion such as 16a k 1 d 2 ψ 1 x d x 2 μ 2 w 1 ψ 1 x σ l ψ 2 x ψ 1 x 0 x 0 l 16b k 2 d 2 ψ 2 x d x 2 μ 2 w 2 ψ 2 x σ l ψ 1 x ψ 2 x 0 x 0 l with boundary conditions given by 16c f ψ 1 0 ψ 2 0 0 ψ 1 l ψ 2 l 0 where 16g j w 1 w m c m k 1 w m k m w 2 w f c f k 2 w f k f the coupled eigenvalue problem of eqs 16 provides an improved base for the eigenfunction expansion and can be employed in finding the exact integral transform solution of problem 14 as well in the gitt hybrid solution of the nonlinear problem eqs 12 through direct correspondence to the general problem in section 2 both solutions are obtained via integral transforms either with the above coupled eigenvalue problem proposal or with the more usual uncoupled eigenvalue problems choice these two solution paths shall then be compared in the next section 4 results and discussions 4 1 transport of contaminants in two layer fractured porous medium the computational code developed for an arbitrary network of parallel unequal fractures has been tested against limiting simpler formulations for which analytical solutions can be obtained these test cases are obtained from simplified versions of the model of eqs 11a i the first simplified model considers a single semi infinite one dimensional region either a saturated porous medium or a fluid stream and an uniform velocity plug flow as shown below 17a c t u m λ r a d a c x 2 c x 2 c x t 17b c x 0 0 17c d c 0 t 1 c x x 0 where the concentration is independent of the horizontal coordinate y by virtue of the boundary conditions of eqs 11e f and the absence of this coordinate in the coefficients the one dimensional partial differential model of eqs 17a d admits analytical solution through laplace transforms yielding 18a c x t 1 2 e ξ 2 ζ x 1 e 2 ζ x 1 erf ζ t x 2 t erf ζ t x 2 t where 18b c ξ u m λ r a d a ζ 1 ξ 2 4 two specific limiting cases can be extracted from the simplified solution eqs 18a c the first one is related to pure diffusion in a saturated porous medium which is obtained by setting ξ 0 in eqs 18a c results for the concentration along the vertical coordinate at four different times in this limiting case obtained from the analytical expression are presented as symbols in fig 3 a in the same figure results obtained with the integral transform procedure and its computational code for the simpler situation of the limiting case are included as solid lines the agreement between the results of the two different approaches is perfect to the graph scale providing verification of the built computational code the second test case is also associated with the analytical solution of eqs 18a c the physical situation for this case is that of a domain fully comprised of fluid flowing in the positive x direction for this case results obtained with eqs 18a c with ξ 2168 95 are presented as symbols in fig 3 b for the same simplified conditions the integral transform methodology of the present work yields the results shown in solid lines in fig 3 b the agreement of the concentration profiles along the vertical coordinate obtained with both approaches is once more perfect to the graph scale to test the capabilities of the methodology and the computational code on dealing with the abrupt transition between porous media of different porosities another simplified version of the complete model of eqs 11a i is considered suppressing the fracture domain from fig 2 i e considering only diffusion along two different porous media the model of eqs 11a i can be simplified to 19a w c t x d c x w c x t 19b c x 0 0 19c d c 0 t 1 c x x l 0 where the variation of the concentration with the horizontal direction has been dropped for the same reasons considered in eqs 17a d the simplified one dimensional model of eqs 19a d can be solved analytically through the integral transform method using multiregion eigenvalue problems mikhailov and özisik 1984 results from such analysis are offered as symbols in fig 3 c d for the entry data presented in table 1 except for the width of the fracture that is set to zero in this limiting case furthermore the height of the porous medium b a in fig 2 is fixed as 0 3 m two cases are considered the first one fig 3 c adopts a higher porosity for medium b in comparison with the porosity of medium a specifically θ b 4θ a 0 2 in the second case fig 3 d the porosity of medium b is considered to be smaller than the porosity of medium a with the same proportion i e θ b 0 25θ a 0 0125 results for the concentration profiles along the vertical coordinate obtained with the present more general integral transform framework are shown as solid lines in fig 3 c d the adherence with the analytical benchmark is excellent providing further confidence on the adequacy of the solution methodology and the computational code developed thus once the built algorithm was properly verified we may return to the more general problem originally proposed with an arbitrary number of distinct parallel fractures here illustrated for configurations with one or two parallel fractures within the layered porous matrix which does not have a known analytical solution table 2 shows the convergence behavior of the concentration of contaminants at the center of the fracture for two different dimensionless times the case of slower convergence among those here considered consisting of θ b 0 25θ a 0 0125 and a 0 25l was chosen to illustrate such behavior furthermore l is set to 80 in order to assure the accuracy of the boundary condition of eq 15 d the remainder of the parameters is taken from table 1 full convergence to at least three significant digits is achieved for both dimensionless times for truncation orders below n 2000 fig 4 presents results for two layered fractured porous media with θ b 0 0125 and the rest of the parameters as shown in table 1 concentration contours are provided in fig 4 a c for three different positions of the transition between the porous media namely a 0 25l 0 5l 0 75l and at t 2 roughly equivalent to 36 years according to the entry data and the definition of dimensionless time of eq 14 b vertical green lines indicate the position of the transition between the two porous media and the horizontal blue line represents the fracture position the concentration contours clearly show how for this case a shallower low porosity first layer suppresses the advancement of the contaminants concentration profiles for the most critical region i e the center of the fracture y 0 are presented in fig 4 d f to further demonstrate the aforementioned effect under the influence of the high porosity porous medium x a a steeper decrease of the concentration with depth can be observed in comparison with the low porosity zone of influence such behavior can be explained by the more prominent penetration of contaminants in the high porosity porous medium a depleting faster the contaminants from the fracture and spreading them more effectively along the y direction hence the presence of a large low porosity first layer is detrimental as far as contaminant containment is concerned in the case depicted in fig 4 f the species reaches a distance from the point of departure of approximately 24 m after 36 years have elapsed which is the maximum value analyzed for the case of a lower porosity first layer the results of fig 4 point to the possible benefits of positioning the high porosity layer first thus absorbing the contaminants and distributing them along a broader area and limiting its advancement to verify this assumption similar results are obtained for θ b 0 2 and the parameters of table 1 fig 5 a c present the concentration contours at t 2 for three different positions of the transition between porous media namely a 0 25l 0 5l 0 75l the total depth l is set to 30 determined by inspection as the length necessary for the assurance of the physical meaning of the boundary condition of eq 15 d once more vertical green lines are included to mark the position of the transition between porous media a marked reduction of the depth attained by the contaminants hinted by the value of l is visible in a comparison of figs 4 a c and 5 a c as discussed the high porosity first layer was so effective that for all cases the species seems to be confined to a neighborhood of the inlet boundary x 0 more information about the transport phenomena involved can be attained with the observation of the concentration profile along the centerline of the fracture y 0 in fact except for the case with a 0 25l both other cases severely restrict the contaminants presence to a dimensionless depth of roughly 10 which is equivalent to 3 m in 36 years this figure is 6x lower than the lowest depth achieved by the species in the case θ b θ a hence confirming the effectiveness of the presence of a highly porous first layer all the results presented in fig 4 and fig 5 were obtained considering only one fracture configuration within the domain that represents the network of fractures to illustrate the generality of the proposed solution methodology a more complex configuration was considered fig 6 shows the results obtained for the case with two parallel unequal fractures see fig 2 b that characterize the fracture network the results for θ b θ a were observed to be more interesting and therefore only such results are here presented in comparison with the results with one fracture type a more homogeneous concentration distribution along the y direction and an increase of the depth attained by the contaminants could be observed the latter fact required an extension of the domain by setting l 100 instead of l 80 used for the single fracture case the reason for this phenomenon is the additional convective transport source i e fracture 2 and the associated mass transport enhancement in the x direction for instance for the case with a 60 the presence of a second fracture extended the depth affected by the contaminant to 30 m after 36 years a 25 increase in comparison with the single fracture case 4 2 flow in dual porosity dual permeability unsaturated porous medium the dual porosity dual permeability flow model of eqs 12 is now analysed by the integral transform approach with emphasis on the adoption of the coupled eigenvalue problem of eqs 16 the linear version of the flow problem eqs 14 allows for a straightforward verification of the convergence enhancement effect achievable by this choice of coupled eigenvalue problem with respect to the more usual adoption of decoupled eigenvalue problems one for each potential fracture and porous matrix pressure heads as implemented in rocha and cruz 2001 for this verification the properties attributed to the fracture system are rocha and cruz 2001 wf 0 05 θ r 0 θ s 0 5 ks 2 3148 10 4 m s α 10 m 1 l 0 5 n 2 and the properties attributed to the porous matrix are wm 0 95 θ r 0 10526 θ s 0 5 ks 1 2183 10 7 m s α 0 5 m 1 l 0 5 n 1 5 the remaining input data are l 0 4 m h 0 0 5 m hl 0 h 0 5 m and the exchange term coefficient was estimated according to the procedure suggested in gerke and van genuchten 1993 yielding σ l 0 009535 a second test case was considered by increasing the exchange term coefficient to σ l 0 05959 which corresponds to a smaller value of the average matrix block size distance from the center of a fictitious matrix block to the fractures boundaries in the computations for both the coupled and the uncoupled eigenvalue problems basis a maximum truncation order of n 50 terms in the eigenfunction expansions was enough to guarantee convergence in the whole range of space and time variables considered fig 7 a d provide a critical comparison of convergence rates between the two integral transform solutions with coupled or uncoupled eigenvalue problems it is plotted the evolution of the absolute value of the pressure head relative error for both the porous matrix and the fractures and for the two different values of the exchange term coefficient σ l 0 009535 and σ l 0 05959 as the truncation order of the expansion is increased the relative error estimates are computed at mid height of the porous medium x 0 2m and the solution with n 50 terms was assumed as the exact solution in determining the relative errors of expansions truncated up to n 40 terms the solid lines represent the coupled eigenvalue problem solution and dashed lines represent the decoupled eigenvalue problem solution as usual in eigenfunction expansion approaches convergence is expected to be slower closer to the initial condition in the absence of time variable source terms therefore a few lower values of the time variable were considered to explore the differences and the results are plotted in red lines for t 15 sec blue lines for t 30 sec and green lines for t 45 sec the exchange term coefficient essentially governs the importance of the coupling term between the matrix and fracture pressure heads therefore it is expected that the advantage on convergence rate improvement due to the choice of a coupled eigenvalue problem becomes more evident when this coefficient is increased clearly for the smaller σ l fig 7 a b at the smallest value of time t 15 sec there is no significant difference between the convergence pattern of the two expansions which have the relative errors practically overlapping on the other hand in this same value of σ l for the other two higher values of time the coupled eigenvalue problem solution shows a more consistent behaviour with evident convergence enhancement over the more traditional alternative it can also be observed in both solution paths that the fractures region expansion has lower absolute values of the relative error than the porous matrix expansion for the higher σ l case fig 7 c d however one may observe the marked convergence rate improvement allowed for by the coupled eigenvalue problem proposed expansion once this coupling between the two potentials is more significant it can be seen that the truncation order of n 40 terms is not even necessary to achieve several fully converged digits in the coupled eigenvalue problem solution for the presented values of time fig 8 a d present pressure head profiles across the domain at different times respectively for the porous matrix and fractures and for the two different values of the exchange term coefficient σ l 0 009535 and σ l 0 05959 solid lines represent the gitt solution with the coupled eigenvalue problem n 50 while dashed lines represent a numerical solution obtained from the ndsolve routine of the mathematica v 12 system wolfram 2017 which implements the method of lines as for the time variable values the red lines indicate for fig 8 a and 8 b with σ l 0 009535 t 7 5 sec green lines for t 15 sec violet lines for t 50 sec light blue lines for t 150 sec and dark blue lines for t 1500 sec and for fig 8 c and 8 d with σ l 0 05959 t 3 75 sec green lines for t 7 5 sec violet lines for t 25 sec light blue lines for t 75 sec and dark blue lines for t 1500 sec clearly except for very short times the analytical and numerical solutions are fully overlapping since the purely numerical solution in wolfram 2017 requires that the boundary and initial conditions are consistent and a singularity in fact exists in the present example at x 0 there is a small loss of accuracy at shorter times though an artificially continuous boundary condition is imposed tables 3 a b illustrate the convergence behaviour of the pressure heads in the porous matrix and the fractures respectively at mid height of the medium x 0 2m and different times t 15 30 45 75 and 150 sec again for the integral transformation with coupled eigenvalue problem and truncation order n up to 50 only the results for the case with smaller value of the exchange term coefficient σ l 0 009535 are analyzed in tabular form for the convergence behavior since from fig 7 this case of weaker coupling was clearly the less enhanced in terms of convergence rate in comparison to the decoupled eigenvalue problem more traditional alternative from these tables it can be reconfirmed first of all that convergence for the fractures system is indeed faster than for the porous matrix also for the smallest value of t 15 sec n 35 already provides full convergence to five significant digits in the porous matrix head while this number decreases to n 15 terms for t 30 sec for the other values of t in the porous matrix full convergence to five digits is already achieved at very low truncation orders of n 5 finally fig 9 a b compare the pressure heads evolution at the fractures and porous matrix by showing the corresponding profiles for different times for σ l 0 009535 t 7 5 15 50 150 and 1500 sec and σ l 0 05959 t 3 75 7 5 25 75 and 1500 sec again these converged results were obtained from the gitt with coupled eigenvalue problem solution n 50 where the solid lines represent the porous matrix while the dot dashed lines represent the fractures in light of the relative importance of the exchange terms only in the early transient one may observe differences between the heads in the two systems which merge as the steady state is approached for the larger value of the exchange term coefficient corresponding to a smaller characteristic length of the matrix structure for instance a reduced fracture spacing in the case of parallel rectangular voids this more densely fractured media leads to a faster exchange between the two structures which equalize their pressure heads in a shorter time 5 conclusions a unified integral transform hybrid solution for the continuum and discrete formulations of flow and transport in fractured heterogeneous porous media has been presented two complementary aspects have been emphasized first a systematic treatment of complex heterogeneous domains has been reviewed which involves rewriting the problem formulation as a single domain with space variable properties that encompasses all the subregions including individual fractures and different porous layers second an alternative of implementing the integral transformation of heterogeneous media on the basis of coupled eigenvalue problems has been explored the coupling through the source sink terms can then be carried along to the eigenfunctions which form the original potentials expansions such as in multi porosity multi permeability models of fractured porous media with an expected convergence rates improvement two applications were then considered which illustrate the complementary formalisms here advanced namely transport in a parallel unequal fractures matrix interaction problem with a layered porous matrix and flow in a dual porosity dual permeability vertical infiltration problem the obtained analytical and hybrid numerical analytical solutions were verified against exact solutions for limiting simplified cases or purely numerical solutions and convergence rates of the eigenfunction expansions were demonstrated for typical values of the governing parameters the formal solutions here provided have a promising applicability in advanced formulations of transport

468,the modelling and simulation of the unsaturated flow or the flow of two immiscible fluid phases in a porous medium is challenging as this flow takes place through the pores of the medium which form a highly complex domain next to the complexity of the domain a major challenge is to account for the interface separating the fluids or the unsaturated fluid from the inert filling part as the location of this interface is not known a priori the evolution of this interface depends on the flow of both fluids and of the surface tension moreover the surface tension may depend on the concentration of a surfactant dissolved in one fluid phase in this work such aspects are taken into account and effective darcy scale models are derived based on the known physics at the pore scale in this sense a thin strip is used as the representation of a single pore in the porous medium the darcy scale models are derived for various regimes accounting for different pore scale processes numerical examples show that the upscaled models are a good approximation of the transversal average of the solution to the pore scale models as the ratio of the width and the length of the pore approaches zero keywords two phase flow freely moving interface upscaled models marangoni effect capillary effect 1 introduction two phase flow in porous media is relevant for many industrial and environmental applications such as geological co2 sequestration or oil recovery common for all these applications is the need to describe the flow at the darcy scale from now on the macro scale the preferred scale for numerical simulations where the grain and void space and the two or more fluid phases cannot be explicitly separated but modelled through average quantities such as porosity and saturation at the darcy scale the flow of each fluid phase is described with the help of darcy scale quantities like the absolute permeability which depends strictly on the medium and the fluid specific relative permeability which is a function of the fluid saturation the two phase or more general the multi phase and multi component flow through a porous medium is inherently a process occurring at multiple scales in which the processes at the pore scale do affect the overall flow on the darcy scale when considering the process at the scale of pores here and below the micro scale the fluids are assumed immiscible and they are separated by a fluid fluid interface the location of this interface gives directly the volume occupied by each of the two fluids within one pore so it can be related directly to the saturation of the two fluids the interface is evolving in an a priori unknown manner depending on the velocities of the two fluids and on the surface tension this evolution has a high impact on the overall flow behaviour simply knowing the saturation of the two fluids is not sufficient for describing the overall flow behaviour we need to understand the processes affecting the fluid fluid interface to be able to describe the flow one of the first mathematical models for the darcy scale flow in a porous medium was formulated by henry darcy darcy 1856 based on experiments in these experiments only one fluid phase was considered occupying the entire pore space so the porous medium was fully saturated the experiments showed a proportionality between the pressure gradient and the flow rate subsequent extensions still based on experimental observations have considered unsaturated media richards 1931 two phase flow morrow and harris 1965 or reactive transport schechter and gidley 1969 in porous media traditionally the flow models involve the mass balance for each phase the darcy law with a saturation dependent relative permeability and that the phase pressure difference the capillary pressure is a nonlinear monotone function of the saturation of the say wetting fluid the relative permeability functions and the one for the capillary pressure are determined experimentally although extensively used such models need improvements as also motivated by experimental results as shown in morrow and harris 1965 the capillary pressure saturation function also depends on the process infiltration or drainage also the break through curves determined in bottero et al 2011 for the phase pressure difference respectively for the saturation reveal that the dependency of the former quantity on the latter is not necessarily monotone next to this there is indirect evidence of the limited validity of assuming a nonlinear relationship dependency of the capillary pressure and the saturation in this respect we mention that effects like saturation overshoot or finger formation clearly evidenced in experiments reported e g in dicarlo 2004 poulovassilis 1970 shiozawa and fujimaki 2004 zhuang et al 2019 and glass et al 1989 rezanezhad et al 2006 are ruled out by the mathematical models used traditionally to overcome these drawbacks extensions of darcy s law for unsaturated or two phase flow in porous media have been proposed in this sense we start by mentioning abreu et al 2019 beliaev and schotting 2001 beliaev and hassanizadeh 2001 van duijn and mitra 2018 plohr et al 2001 where different play type hysteresis models are being proposed an overview is provided in schweizer 2017 and beliaev and hassanizadeh 2001 hassanizadeh and gray 1993 for models incorporating dynamic effects in the capillary pressure saturation dependency inspired by the thin film model proposed in huppert 1982 a phase field model involving the second order spatial derivative of the saturation in the capillary pressure is proposed in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 for unsaturated flow in porous media also see armiti juber and rohde 2020 finally in doster and hilfer 2011 a model accounting for the differences between percolating and non percolating parts of a fluid is discussed whereas the interfacial area concept is incorporated in the porous media flow models discussed in niessner and hassanizadeh 2008 hassanizadeh and gray 1990 pop et al 2009 the effectiveness of such extensions in capturing phenomena like saturation overshoot and fingering is evidenced in zhuang et al 2019 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 chapwanya and stockie 2010 van duijn et al 2013 2018 hilfer et al 2012 lamacz et al 2011 rätz and schweizer 2014 schneider et al 2018 zhang and zegeling 2017 two different major strategies can be observed in these papers the first is to present numerical simulations for the extended models aiming to reproduce the experimental results quantitatively the second relies on mathematical analysis and in particular on travelling waves the focus being mainly on the qualitative behaviour of the solution and in particular the dependence on the parameters appearing in the extended models the extended models discussed above are stated at the darcy scale where no distinction is being made between the pore space where fluid flow takes place these models are describing the averaged behaviour of the system by considering so called representative elementary volumes and without focussing on the detailed description of the processes inside each pore alternatively one can consider the mathematical models valid at the scale of pores which leads to models posed in an extremely complex domain consisting of the entire pore space of the porous medium such an approach allows to incorporate detailed pore scale physics which is generally better understood there are various possibilities in this direction like the smoothed particle hydrodynamics based simulations in tartakovsky and meakin 2006 the pore network modelling in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 and we refer to golparvar et al 2018 for a review of such approaches closer to the present work are mehmani and tchelepi 2019 and mehmani and tchelepi 2018 where direct numerical simulations tools are developed to understand the flow and the interface dynamics at the scale of pores and these tools are then incorporated in a multi scale simulator however a numerical simulation at such detailed level and for the entire domain of interest remains simply infeasible for practical applications due to the computational complexity to overcome the difficulties related to the complexity of the domain one can apply upscaling techniques to derive darcy scale models such an approach is adopted in mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 by considering a simple pore geometry consisting of a long and thin pore and for which transversal averaging is applied to derive a darcy scale model in this way various model components and features can be included in a quite straightforward manner and the corresponding darcy scale models can be derived in a rational manner recently picchi and battiato 2018 proposed an upscaling technique where they considered different flow distributions and derived regime specific upscaled model to derive the upscaled models they assumed that the location of the fluid fluid interface is known and stationary here we follow the same approach as in mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 for deriving darcy scale models for two phase or unsaturated one phase flow in porous media in the former case a wetting and a non wetting fluid are present in the latter only a wetting fluid is present together with a fluid that has constant pressure say zero and infinite mobility the fluids are assumed incompressible and immiscible the derived models also take into account the possibility that one fluid is transporting a solute which has an impact on the surface tension coefficient we start with formulating the relevant models at the pore scale and then derive upscaled darcy scale models based on reasonable assumptions on the underlying physics at the pore scale we assume that the flow of each fluid phase is modelled by the navier stokes equations when referring to two fluid phases the unsaturated one phase case being similar a peculiar aspect in this approach is in the fact that since the fluids are assumed immiscible at the pore scale they are separated by an interface having a location that is not known a priori this interface moves depending on the fluid velocities and if applicable on the concentration of the solute at this interface in mathematical terms this interface represents a free boundary in the model jump conditions ensuring conservation of the involved quantities are used at the evolving interface as well as kinematic conditions to model its evolution we consider here a single pore as a representative for the porous medium the pore is long and thin specifically a thin strip although this is a very simple geometry upscaling thin strip models in other contexts e g biofilm growth van noorden et al 2010 and mineral precipitation van noorden 2009b has shown that the upscaled models have the same structure as commonly accepted darcy scale models in general porous media see van noorden 2009a and schulz and knabner 2017 the advantage of using a single pore is that analytical expressions for the upscaled quantities are obtained inside the thin strip we assume that the two fluids have a layered structure hence the location of the interface separating the two fluid phases can also uniquely describe the thickness of the wetting phase and hence the saturation such a fluid distribution is the same as the core annular flow in picchi and battiato 2018 and the thin film flow in mikelic and paoli 2000 in picchi and battiato 2018 upscaled models for core annular flow and other fluid distributions are derived but under steady state conditions here we explicitly account for the evolving fluid fluid interface by treating the width of the wetting phase as a variable for more complicated situations one can use e g a level set approach osher and fedkiw 2001 to track the location of the interface alternatively a diffuse interface approach can be considered using e g the phase field model in abels et al 2012 in any of these approaches the resulting models can be used for deriving the upscaled darcy scale counterparts which are more suited for numerical simulations for the simplified situation here we apply asymptotic expansion techniques and transversal averaging to derive the upscaled mathematical models in doing so we also include a solute dependent surface tension leading to so called marangoni effects in the upscaled equations an alternative to homogenization is the method of volume averaging which has been successfully applied to upscaling two phase flow in porous media in whitaker 1986 quintard and whitaker 1988 the upscaled model in quintard and whitaker 1988 was explored numerically in quintard and whitaker 1990b for stratified flows and compared to the dynamic setting in quintard and whitaker 1990a the work from quintard and whitaker 1988 has been extended in lasseux et al 1996 to further investigate the resulting permeability tensors derived by the volume averaging this work is builds on mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 where mathematically rigorous upscaling results are obtained for two phase flow in a single pore compared to mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 here we consider more regimes with respect to the capillary number and also include solute effects in the surface tension dependency we also mention that although not considering the flow in a porous medium in bresch 2009 a similar approach is used for deriving the shallow water equations in this context we mention that asymptotic homogenization methods in either a thin strip or in a periodic porous medium have been widely applied for many application in which evolving interfaces are encountered at the pore scale examples in this sense are the evolving fluid solid interface due to mineral precipitation and dissolution van noorden 2009b a bringedal et al 2015 2016b 2016a kumar et al 2011 schulz 2019b or to biofilm growth or other biological processes van noorden et al 2010 schulz and knabner 2017 landa marbán et al 2020 peszynska et al 2016 ray et al 2013 2012 schulz 2019a in all these cases the derived darcy scale models were resembling well many of the models that are commonly accepted in the literature but allow integrating additional effects in a rational manner the paper is organized as follows in the next section the physical processes at the pore scale and the corresponding mathematical models are introduced with ϵ being a small parameter representing the ratio of the pore width and length in section 3 the pore scale models are non dimensionalized and their dependence on ϵ is derived in section 4 asymptotic expansion methods are applied to the pore scale models and for various scaling regimes and the corresponding upscaled are derived in this sense the cases in which the marangoni effects do play a role at the darcy scale are evidenced also cases where the two upscaled fluid pressures are equal or where the capillary pressure depends on the saturation in a non standard way resembling the models in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 mikelic and paoli 2000 mikelić 2003 the results are summarized and discussed more closely in section 5 in section 6 provides some numerical examples that confirm the validity of the approach specifically the numerical solutions to the original pore scale models are computed for different situations and then their transversal averages are compared to the solutions to the upscaled models these results support that as ϵ approaches zero the upscaled models are describing well the averaged behaviour of the considered pore scale models finally in section 7 the different upscaled models are compared highlighting the upscaled behaviour of the considered physical phenomena 2 mathematical model a pore scale model is considered for two phase or unsaturated flow through a porous medium for simplicity we considered a thin two dimensional strip to represent the local pore geometry two incompressible and immiscible fluids where one is wetting and the other is non wetting are flowing through the strip densities and viscosities of the fluids are constant the wetting phase is attached to the pore wall and the wetting layer has a thickness that changes with time and varies with the location of the wall the two fluids are separated by a sharp interface with zero thickness which is changing with time the movement is not known a priori hence we have a moving boundary at the fluid fluid interface the interface that separates the fluids moves because of the surface tension and of the flow movement of the two fluids there is a solute present only in the wetting fluid and the concentration of the solute will change subject to diffusion and transport the surface tension is considered as a function of the solute concentration which results in a tangential stress at the moving interface which is called the marangoni stress the gravity effects are neglected 2 1 geometric settings the width and length of the thin strip are respectively 2 l and l with l l for simplicity we assume a symmetric case with respect to w r t the x axis the lower half of the strip is shown in fig 1 let t 0 be the time variable the thickness of the wetting fluid layer is denoted by d x t where 0 d x t l the void space consists of two domains the domain occupied by the non wetting fluid fluid i and by the wetting fluid ii fluid are denoted by respectively ω i t x y r 2 0 x l l d x t y 0 ω i i t x y r 2 0 x l l y l d x t the fluid fluid interface and the fluid solid interface are respectively γ f f t x y r 2 0 x l y l d x t γ f s x y r 2 0 x l y l the velocity vectors are denoted by q α q α 1 q α 2 where the index α i i i is distinguishing between the non wetting and the wetting fluid respectively since d x t gives the location of the fluid fluid interface the unit normal vector on the fluid fluid interface pointing into fluid i and the unit tangent vector are n x d 1 t 1 x d 2 and t 1 x d t 1 x d 2 given a point x l d x t on γ ff t its normal velocity is 1 v n t d 1 x d 2 2 2 equations in the pore domain we refer to patankar 1980 and assume that the flow of the two fluids is governed by the navier stokes equations ρ α t q α ρ α q α q α p α μ α 2 q α in ω α t α i i i q α 0 in ω α t α i i i where ρα and μα are respectively the constant viscosities and densities and the pressures are pα for simplicity gravity effects are neglected we assume that one chemical species solute is present in fluid ii its molar concentration being c additionally there is no mass transfer of the solute form fluid ii to fluid i hence the molar concentration of the solute in fluid i is zero the solute concentration changes both by diffusion and convection resulting in t c d c q i i c 0 in ω i i t where d is the constant diffusion coefficient to complete the model above appropriate initial conditions inflow and outflow boundary conditions can be added however as the upscaling procedure is independent of the choice of initial and external boundary conditions these will not be specified here 2 3 boundary conditions at the fluid fluid interface γ ff t here we specify the boundary conditions at γ ff t this means that all equations in this section are valid only at points at γ ff t firstly we assume that the velocities of the two fluids are equal at γ ff t q i q i i secondly we assume that the normal velocity of γ ff t as given in 1 equals the normal velocities of the two fluids q α n v n α i i i further conditions at γ ff t are involving the stress tensors t α p α i μ α q α q α t α i i i the curvature of γ ff t n x x d 1 x d 2 and the surface tension γ if γ is affected by the presence of the solute present in fluid ii one has γ γ c for example in smith and gillham 1999 the following law is proposed 2 γ c γ r e f 1 b ln c a c r e f 1 where a b are constants and γref is the surface tension at reference concentration cref its tangential stress gradients is s γ c γ c n n γ c with this the third boundary condition at γ ff t reads see leal 2007 t i t i i n γ c n n s γ c this jump can be written in terms of the normal and the tangential components at γ ff t for the normal component one has t i t i i n n γ c n while for the tangential component also known as marangoni stress one gets t i t i i n t t γ c finally the mass balance for the solute at γ ff t reads d c q i i c n v n c 2 4 boundary conditions at the fluid solid interface γ fs as before the equations hold only at the fluid solid interface γ fs where first no slip is assumed q i i 0 for the solute concentration the normal flux into the solid matrix is zero d c q i i c n 0 2 5 pore scale model for the two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension recall that the sub domain occupied by fluid α is time dependent ω α t and that the freely moving fluid fluid interface is γ ff t and considering the discussion above one has 3 ρ α t q α ρ α q α q α p α μ α 2 q α in ω α t α i i i 4 q α 0 in ω α t α i i i 5 t c d c q i i c 0 in ω i i t 6 q i q i i at γ f f t 7 q α n v n at γ f f t α i i i 8 t i t i i n n γ c n at γ

whenever the surface tension is constant as happening e g in the absence of a solute in fluid ii or with a constant solute concentration the tangential components of the normal stresses are equal at γ ff t in this case the pore scale model is simpler as 5 10 and 12 become superfluous while γ c γ in 8 and 9 reduces to t i t i i n n γ n at γ f f t t i t i i n t 0 at γ f f t the remaining equations are the same as in section 2 5 2 7 pore scale model for the unsaturated flow with constant surface tension a further simplification is to assume that the pressure in the fluid i is constant and that its mobility is infinite essentially this means that fluid i plays no role for the flow of fluid ii this situation appears e g if fluid i is air and is connected to the atmosphere alternatively this pore scale model can be interpreted as a thin film flow with an open surface where a liquid is attached to the wall of the pore and the middle domain is occupied by air then the number of variables reduces to those corresponding to fluid ii moreover we assume the solute is absent in fluid ii and the surface tension is constant in this case 5 10 and 12 are excessive moreover the model equations in section 2 5 are further simplified by giving up the equations for α i reducing to the navier stokes equations in ω ii t at γ ff t 7 is valid for α i i and 8 9 shortens to t i i n n γ n at γ f f t t i i n t 0 at γ f f t 3 the non dimensional model equations to identify the model components that have a larger or smaller impact than others we first bring the model to a non dimensional form to this aim we use reference quantities and rescale the dimensional ones as specified in table 1 in particular μii and ρii are taken as reference viscosity respectively density table 1 introduces two length scales l and l in a general porous medium l would reflect the length scale of the entire medium where l is the one of a pore as we let a single pore represent the porous medium we use the width and the length of the pore as described in section 2 1 in the same spirit here we define the non dimensional number ϵ l l 0 and assume that ϵ is small observe now that the x and y coordinates are scaled differently so that they become both of order 1 o 1 based on this the derivatives change into x l x y ϵ l y the non dimensional gradient is x 1 ϵ y due to the different scaling in x and y direction some assumptions are made in table 1 by choosing the scaling for μref dref and pref the ratio of the time scales for the diffusion and the convective transport referred to as the péclet number p e q r e f x r e f d r e f is chosen moderate w r t ϵ for simplicity the péclet number is taken equal to 1 however in van noorden et al 2010 van noorden 2009b a schulz and knabner 2017 bringedal et al 2015 2016a schulz 2019b landa marbán et al 2020 peszynska et al 2016 ray et al 2013 2012 the case of moderate péclet number when diffusion dominates or is in balance with the transport and in bringedal et al 2016b kumar et al 2011 van duijn et al 2008 mauri 2003 the case of high péclet number when the convective transport dominates the diffusion are considered additionally the scaling of the pref and μref are chosen such that the reynolds number r e ρ r e f q r e f x r e f μ r e f is moderate namely equal to 1 and the euler number e u p r e f q r e f 2 ρ r e f is equal to ϵ 2 these choices ensure laminar flow and that the pressure drop dominates the flow which are needed to ensure validity of darcy s law on the macro scale note that the dimensionless parameters m n appearing in table 1 m μ i i μ i n ρ i i ρ i may also depend on ϵ in this respect here we restrict to the case n 1 while m is assumed first o 1 and later the limit m is considered to show that the two phase model reduces to the unsaturated single phase one in the non dimensional setting the pore space occupied by the two fluids is 13 ω i ϵ t x y r 2 0 x 1 1 d ϵ x t y 0 14 ω i i ϵ t x y r 2 0 x 1 1 y 1 d ϵ x t the fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces become γ f f ϵ t x y r 2 0 x 1 y 1 d ϵ x t γ f s x y r 2 0 x 1 y 1 the normal and tangent unit vectors are respectively n ϵ ϵ x d ϵ 1 1 ϵ x d ϵ 2 and t ϵ 1 ϵ x d ϵ 1 ϵ x d ϵ

tension continuing as in section 2 7 assuming that fluid i does not influence the flow of fluid ii and in the absence of solute one ends up with 16 17 20 for α i i 24 and 28 t i i ϵ n ϵ n ϵ ϵ 2 ca n ϵ

section only the non dimensional variables are used for the ease of presentation the hats are suppressed we use the homogenization ansatz namely that all variables can be expanded regularly w r t ϵ we assume that 30 p α ϵ x y t p α 0 x y t ϵ p α 1 x y t o ϵ 2 α i i i q α ϵ k x y t q α 0 k x y t ϵ q α 1 k x y t o ϵ 2 α i i i k 1 2 c ϵ x y t c 0 x y t ϵ c 1 x y t o ϵ 2 d ϵ x t d 0 x t ϵ d 1 x t o ϵ 2 where p α j x y t q α j k x y t c j x y t d j x t are functions describing the o ϵ j order approximation for j 1 2 of the corresponding variables we will now insert these expansions in the model equations and equate terms of the same order in ϵ to find the transversally averaged equations we do this for different regimes and end up with different upscaled models 4 1 two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension we start with the model for two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension 15 25 at this point we assume that m is o 1 w r t ϵ 4 1 1 mass conservation to derive an effective equation for the mass conservation we follow the ideas in van noorden 2009b bringedal et al 2015 kumar et al 2011 substituting the asymptotic expansion 30 in the mass conservation equation 17 and restricting the writing up to the o ϵ 0 terms gives 31 1 ϵ y q α 0 2 x q α 0 1 y q α 1 2 o ϵ 0 in ω α ϵ t to show that q α 0 2 0 in ω α ϵ t we use 30 in the kinematic conditions 20 and obtain 32 q α 0 2 ϵ q α 1 2 q α 0 1 x d 0 t d 0 o ϵ 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t the lowest order terms in 31 32 give y q α 0 2 0 in ω α ϵ t and q α 0 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t while 24 and the symmetry condition at y 0 lead to 33 q α 0 2 0 in ω α ϵ t to upscale the mass balance for the fluids we consider a thin segment of the pore space as sketched in fig 2 let y i x y x 1 x x 1 δ x 0 y 1 d ϵ be the region in this segment that is occupied by fluid i by integrating 17 over yi one obtains y i q i ϵ d v i 0 in the above equation we apply the theorem of gauss and divide all terms by δx then using 20 and the asymptotic expansions 30 to get 1 δ x 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 d y x x 1 δ x 1 δ x 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 d y x x 1 1 δ x x 1 x 1 δ x q i 1 2 d x y 0 1 δ x x 1 x 1 δ x t d 0 d x o ϵ 0 using the symmetry condition at y 0 and equating the lowest order terms in the above gives 1 δ x 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 x x 1 δ x q i 0 1 x x 1 d y 1 δ x x 1 x 1 δ x t d 0 d x 0 defining the total flux of fluid i as 34 q i 0 1 x t 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 x y t d y and letting δx 0 one obtains 35 x q i 0 1 t d 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 similarly using the fluid ii region y i i x y x 1 x x 1 δ x 1 d ϵ y 1 for 36 q i i 0 1 x t 1 1 d 0 q i i 0 1 x y t d y one obtains 37 x q i i 0 1 t d 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 remark 1 recalling that the fluids are incompressible observe that since d 0 is the thickness of the wetting phase layer in the half pore it can be regarded as the saturation of the wetting fluid in this sense 35 and 37 are the effective mass balance equations for the two fluid phases 4 1 2 solute transport to upscale the solute transport which is needed when considering the marangoni effect one uses the asymptotic expansion 30 in 18 to get 38 t c 0 x 1 ϵ y d x 1 ϵ y c 0 ϵ c 1 ϵ 2 c 2 x 1 ϵ y q i i 0 1 q i i 0 2 ϵ q i i 1 2 c 0 ϵ c 1 o ϵ 0 in ω i i ϵ t first we show that c 0 and c 1 do not depend on y the ϵ 2 order term in 38 is leading to y y c 0 0 in ω i i ϵ t from the ϵ 1 order term in the boundary conditions 21 and 25 one obtains y c 0 0 at γ f f ϵ t and γ f s this implies that c 0 does not depend on y c 0 c 0 x t in ω i i ϵ t in a similar fashion using this 33 the ϵ 1 order term in 38 and ϵ0 order term in 21 25 one obtains c 1 c 1 x t in ω i i ϵ t the non dimensional equation describing the solute concentration 18 can be written as 1 ϵ 2 y d y c ϵ 1 ϵ y q i i ϵ 2 c ϵ t c ϵ x d x c ϵ q i i ϵ 1 c ϵ 0 we integrate the above equation w r t y from y 1 to y 1 d ϵ applying the leibniz rule in the last two terms and taking into account that d ϵ depends on x and t one gets 1 ϵ 2 d y c ϵ 1 ϵ q i i ϵ 2 c ϵ y 1 y 1 d ϵ t 1 1 d ϵ c ϵ d y t d ϵ c ϵ y 1 d ϵ x 1 1 d ϵ d x c ϵ q i i ϵ 1 c ϵ d y x d ϵ d x c ϵ q i i ϵ 1 c ϵ y 1 d ϵ 0 we insert the asymptotic expansion 30 in the above equation recalling that c 0 and c 1 do not depend on y and that y c 2 0 and q i i 1 2 0 at y 1 since q i i 0 2 0 in ω i i ϵ t one obtains d y c 2 q i i 1 2 c 0 y 1 d 0 t c 0 1 1 d 0 1 d y t d 0 c 0 y 1 d 0 x d x c 0 1 1 d 0 1 d y c 0 1 1 d

d 0 x c 0 q i i 0 1 x d d 0 x c 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 4 1 3 momentum conservation we apply the asymptotic expansion 30 in the horizontal and vertical component of the momentum equation for fluid ii 16 recalling that q i i 0 2 0 in ω i i ϵ t for all t 0 one has 40 y y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 ϵ y y q i i 1 1 ϵ x p i i 1 o ϵ 2 0 41 1 ϵ y p i i 0 y p i i 1 ϵ y p i i 2 ϵ y y q i i 1 2 o ϵ 2 0 restricting to ϵ 1 order term in 41 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one gets p i i 0 p i i 0 x t for all t 0 the dominant terms in 40 give 42 y y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 in ω i i ϵ t integrating the above equation in y and taking into account that p ii 0 is independent of y we obtain 43 y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 y a 1 x t in ω i i ϵ t where a 1 x t is an integrating constant that will be fixed using boundary condition for q i i 0 1 we now assume that the surface tension γ γ c ϵ depends smoothly on the solute concentration using 30 and expanding γ c ϵ around c 0 gives γ c ϵ γ c 0 ϵ c 1 γ c 0 o ϵ 2 we apply the asymptotic expansion 30 in the boundary condition 23 using the above equation and recalling that q α 0 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t and that c 0 is independent of y we get 44 1 ϵ 1 m y q i 0 1 y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 1 1 y q i i 1 1 ϵ 1 m y q i 2 1 y q i i 2 1 ϵ 1 m x q i 1 2 x q i i 1 2 2 ϵ x d 0 1 m y q i 1 2 y q i i 1 2 2 ϵ x d 0 1 m x q i 0 1 x q i i 0 1 ϵ x d 0 2 1 m y q i 0 1 y q i i 0 1 1 ca x γ c 0 ϵ ca x c 1 γ c 0 o ϵ 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t at this point the upscaling depends on the capillary number ca we will discuss the cases with ca ϵ β ca for 0 β 3 where ca o 1 we start by assuming ca o 1 thus β 0 from 44 one gets the tangential stress boundary condition 45 y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 0 1 at γ f f ϵ t using the above in 43 leads to 46 1 m y q i 0 1 y 1 d 0 1 d 0 x p i i 0 a 1 x t in ω i i ϵ t applying the asymptotic expansion 30 into 15 and using 33 for all t 0 one has 47 1 m y y q i 0 1 x p i 0 ϵ m y y q i 1 1 ϵ x p i 1 o ϵ 2 0 in ω i ϵ t 48 1 ϵ y p i 0 y p i 1 ϵ y p i 2 ϵ m y y q i 1 2 o ϵ 2 0 in ω i ϵ t the lowest order term in 48 gives 49 p i 0 p i 0 x t for all 0 x 1 for all t 0 the dominating terms in 47 satisfy 50 y y q i 0 1 m x p i 0 in ω i ϵ t we integrate the above equation w r t y we use 49 and the symmetry condition y q i 0 1 x y t 0 at y 0 which leads to 51 y q i 0 1 m x p i 0 y in ω i ϵ t we determine a 1 x t from 46 by using 51 at y 1 d 0 one gets for all t 0 52 y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 y 1 d 0 x p i 0 x p i i 0 in ω i i ϵ t the lowest order terms in 24 imply that q i i 0 1 0 at y 1 hence integrating the above equation in y one obtains 53 q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 y 2 1 2 1 d 0 x p i 0 x p i i 0 y 1 in ω i i ϵ t integrating the above in y from y 1 d 0 to y 1 and using 36 yields 54 q i i 0 1 x t d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 to derive an effective equation for the velocity of fluid i we integrate 51 twice w r t y to determine the integration constants we use the continuity of the velocity at the fluid fluid interface the lowest order terms in 19 imply q i 0 1 q i i 0 1 and hence 55 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 x p i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i i 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 4 1 4 effect of ca we recall that the boundary conditions coming from the normal 22 and the tangential 23 components of the jump in the normal stress depends on the capillary number ca to complete the upscaled model representing the effective behaviour for two phase flow we still have to find a relationship between the pressure difference of the fluids capillary pressure and the saturation in the porous medium to this aim we rewrite 22 as 56 1 ϵ 2 p i ϵ p i i ϵ 2 ϵ y q i ϵ 2 m y q i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ 2 p i ϵ p i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ y q i ϵ 1 m y q i i ϵ 1 2 ϵ x d ϵ x q i ϵ 2 m x q i i ϵ 2 ϵ γ c ϵ x x d ϵ ca o ϵ 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t whenever ca o 1 thus β 0 applying the asymptotic expansion 30 in the above equation and recalling 33 gives 57 p i 0 p i i 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 this means that in the upscaled model the pressures in both phases are equal since p i 0 p i i 0 in the pressure relation 57 for simplicity we set p 0 p α 0 and the effective velocities 54 and 55 become for all 0 x 1 and t 0 58 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 59 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 thus the upscaled model with ca o 1 is represented by the mass conservation equations 35 37 the effective velocities 58 59 and the solute transport 39 this can be expressed in terms of three primary variables the saturation of the wetting fluid d 0 the pressure p 0 recall that the two fluid pressures are equal and the concentration c 0 specifically for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 60 t d 0 x m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 0 t d 0 x d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 x d d 0 x c 0 0 this means that the surface tension γ plays no role in the effective equations and therefore the marangoni effect is lost for regimes where ca o ϵ β ca with β 0 the marangoni effect will play a role in the upscaled models for example if ca ϵ ca with ca o 1 from 44 one gets the marangoni stress boundary condition 61 y q i i 0 1 y q i 0 1 m x γ c 0 ca at γ f f ϵ t using this instead of 45 and repeating the same steps in section 4 1 3 one gets for 0 x 1 and t 0 62 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 1 d 0 d 0 ca x γ c 0 63 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 d 0 2 2 ca x γ c 0 the upscaled model consists of the mass conservation equations 35 37 effective velocities 62 63 and the solute transport 39 the model can be expressed in terms of three primary variables the water saturation d 0 the pressure p 0 recalling that the two fluid pressures are equal and the concentration c 0 specifically for 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 64 t d 0 x m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 1 d 0 d 0 ca x γ c 0 0 t d 0 x d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 d 0 2 2 ca x γ c 0 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 x d d 0 x c 0 0 assuming ca ϵ β ca with β 2 or 3 will lead to different marangoni stress condition than 61 involving the unknowns c 1 c 2 etc in this case one needs to find an effective solute transport equation involving c 1 c 2 etc this is beyond the scope of this paper 4 2 two phase flow with constant surface tension now we consider the pore scale model in section 3 2 we begin with the assumption that m o 1 we recall that for a constant surface tension the dynamic boundary conditions are now 26 27 4 2 1 mass conservation the derivation of the mass conservation equation in this section is identical to the one in section 4 1 1 the mass conservation equation for the two phase flow model with constant surface tension is the same as 35 and 37 4 2 2 momentum conservation to derive the effective velocities for fluid i and fluid ii we can follow the same steps discussed in section 4 1 3 since the surface tension γ is constant we use the continuity in the tangential component of the normal stress 27 it is worth to mention that the capillary number ca is absent in the tangential stress boundary condition applying asymptotic expansion 30 in the boundary condition 27 we get 1 ϵ 1 m y q i 0 1 y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 1 1 y q i i 1 1 o ϵ 0 at γ f f ϵ t the lowest order terms imply y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 0 1 at γ f f ϵ t which is same as 45 further as in section 4 1 3 one obtains the same effective velocities 54 and 55 4 2 3 effect of ca assuming ca ϵ β ca with β 3 and applying asymptotic expansion 30 in 56 recalling that here γ c ϵ 1 the lowest order term implies the same pressure relation as in 57 the upscaled model for the two phase flow with constant surface tension large or moderate capillary number can be represented by the mass conservation equations 35 37 by the effective velocities 59 58 and the pressure relation 57 this can be expressed in terms of two primary variables the water saturation d 0 and the pressure p 0 recall that the two fluid pressures are equal specifically for 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 65 t d 0 x m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 0 t d 0 x d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 0 if the capillary number is ca ϵ 3 ca applying 30 in 56 we obtain 66 p i 0 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca in this case the upscaled model for the two phase flow with constant surface tension is given by the mass conservation equations 35 37 the effective velocities 55 54 and the capillary pressure relationship 66 4 2 4 effect of large viscosity ratio between the fluids by now we assumed m o 1 here we consider m ϵ 1 m where m o 1 which means that the viscosity of fluid i is much smaller than that of fluid ii we show that the first order terms when m upscaling the equations in section 4 2 will only include the fluid ii flow whereas the fluid i flow component is vanishing reducing the model to the unsaturated flow in section 4 3 in this respect we first show that the pressure becomes constant and set as reference value to 0 for fluid i now considering m ϵ 1 m with m o 1 in 47 and 48 for all t 0 one has 67 x p i 0 ϵ x p i 1 ϵ m y y q i 0 1 o ϵ 2 0 in ω i ϵ t 68 1 ϵ y p i 0 y p i 1 o ϵ 0 in ω i ϵ t the lowest order terms in 67 and 68 give x p i 0 0 and y p i 0 0 in ω i ϵ t hence p i 0 is constant in space we assume it constant in time as well and set this value as a reference zero pressure implying p i 0 0 in ω i ϵ t considering the surface tension constant in 44 and m ϵ 1 m where m o 1 give 1 ϵ y q i i 0 1 y q i i 1 1 1 m y q i 0 1 o ϵ 0 at γ f f ϵ t the ϵ 1 order term in the above equation gives 69 y q i i 0 1 0 at γ f f ϵ t to find the effective velocity for fluid ii we use 69 instead of 45 when integrating 42 in y recalling that γ is constant and p i 0 is zero for fluid i we follow the same steps as in section 4 1 3 which results in 70 q i i 0 1 x p i 0 y 2 2 1 d 0 y 1 2 d 0 in ω i i ϵ t integrating 70 and using 36 gives the darcy law 71 q i i 0 1 d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 to find the pressure equation for fluid ii we take m ϵ 1 m in section 4 1 4 and we use the fact that the pressure for fluid i is zero then the capillary pressure relation in 57 for β 3 changes into 72 p i i 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 remark 2 since p i i 0 0 in 72 the same holds for q i i 0 1 in 71 and therefore the saturation is constant in space and time this is a trivial situation corresponding to steady state similarly if β 3 66 becomes 73 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca for all 0 x 1 and t 0 note that fluid i plays no role in the upscaled equations which now reduces to the equations for fluid ii specially the upscaled model consists of the mass conservation equation 37 the effective velocity 71 and the pressure equation 72 for β 3 respectively by 73 for β 3 hence in the limit when m only the flow of one phase is accounted for the lowest order and the upscaled model for two phase flow reduces to the upscaled model for the unsaturated flow as derived in section 4 3 4 3 unsaturated flow with constant surface tension we here now turn our attention to the model in section 3 3 4 3 1 mass conservation the derivation of the mass conservation equation in this section is identical to the one in section 4 1 1 the mass conservation equation for the unsaturated flow model with constant surface tension is the same as 37 4 3 2 momentum conservation we apply the asymptotic expansion 30 in the boundary condition 29 and recall that q i i 0 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t instead of 44 the boundary condition for unsaturated flow at γ f f ϵ t reduces to 74 1 ϵ y q i i 0 1 y q i i 1 1 o ϵ 0 the ϵ 1 order gives y q i i 0 1 0 at γ f f ϵ t which is same as in 69 to find the effective velocity for fluid ii we follow then the same steps as in section 4 2 4 which results in 71 the same effective law for fluid ii as in section 4 2 4 4 3 3 effects of ca in the unsaturated flow case we disregard fluid i in 56 which leads to 1 ϵ 2 p i i ϵ 2 ϵ y q i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ 2 p i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ y q i i ϵ 1 2 ϵ x d ϵ x q i i ϵ 2 ϵ γ c ϵ x x d ϵ ca o ϵ 3 0 at γ f f ϵ t applying 30 in the above equation and recalling q i i 0 1 0 at γ f f ϵ t we find the same capillary pressure relations as in section 4 2 4 in particular for β 3 we get 72 and in this case the upscaled model is trivial see remark 2 the case ca ϵ 3 ca is more interesting as it gives the pressure relation 73 the upscaled model in this case is then represented by 35 71 and 73 5 summary and discussion of upscaled models we recall that in the upscaled models the width of the wetting fluid fluid ii d 0 can be seen as its saturation and therefore the saturation of the non wetting fluid fluid i is 1 d 0 the effective equations on the darcy scale are now summarized and discussed in the sections below these models are obtained in the limit situation when ϵ 0 practically one has ϵ small but not zero therefore the upscaled models should be seen as an approximation of the pore scale models having a much simpler structure assuming ca ϵ β ca we have considered several regimes identified by the value of β and derived different upscaled models table 2 is summarising these results for β 1 the marangoni effects are relevant and for β 3 the phase pressures are equal but for β 3 the difference of the phase pressures depends on the second order derivative of the saturation 5 1 two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension if ca o 1 then for all 0 x 1 and t 0 the upscaled model for the pore scale model 15 25 becomes 75 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 q i i 0 1 x d d 0 x c 0 if ca ϵ ca then for all 0 x 1 and t 0 the upscaled counterpart of the pore scale model in section 2 5 becomes 76 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 1 d 0 d 0 ca x γ c 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 d 0 2 2 ca x γ c 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 q i i 0 1 x d d 0 x c 0 the upscaled models in 75 and 76 have a common structure they include the mass balance for both fluid phases and the darcy laws for the two fluid velocities finally the last equation gives the mass balance for the solute one can recognize the effective velocities in 75 and 76 as darcy type laws for the two fluid phases since d 0 respectively 1 d 0 are the saturation of the two fluids the factors multiplying the pressure gradients in these equations can be viewed as relative permeabilities of the two fluids compared to the effective velocities in 75 the influence of the surface tension gradient namely the marangoni effect is visible in the effective velocities in 76 the upscaled models in 75 and 76 are valid for the regimes where the capillary number is either moderate or large which corresponds to very small surface tension hence the two phase pressures are equal or equivalently the capillary pressure is zero as commonly assumed in petroleum reservoir simulation models aziz and settari 1979 5 2 two phase flow with constant surface tension if solute is not present in the fluid ii phase the surface tension coefficient is constant in this case the mass balance for solute is left out also no marangoni effect is encountered which simplifies the models specifically assuming ca ϵ β ca for ca o 1 and β 3 the upscaled counterpart of the pore scale model in section 2 6 is 77 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 here the upscaled model is valid in the flow regimes where the capillary number is moderate or large which again implies that the pressures for the two fluid phases are same assuming ca ϵ 3 ca with ca o 1 the upscaled model becomes 78 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 x p i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i i 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i 0 p i 0 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one can recognize the effective velocities in 77 and 78 as darcy type laws for the two fluid phases note that the effective velocities are depending on both pressure gradients from the two fluid phase a similar case as considered here was also upscaled in picchi and battiato 2018 as picchi and battiato 2018 considered steady state flow the phase pressure difference there is different from what we obtained here observe that compared to traditional two phase flow models in which the capillary pressure is a function of the saturation here this involves second order derivative of the saturation here we emphasize the differences between the regimes β 3 and β 3 in the capillary pressure relation in 77 and 78 in the former the pressures for both fluids are equal which is similar to saying that the capillary pressure is zero in the later case one gets a model in which the commonly used pressure saturation relation is replaced by a differential equation such a model is also derived in mikelić 2003 and mikelic and paoli 2000 by homogenization techniques also if the upscaled model derived here is reduced to a system of two equations the capillary pressure relation in 78 would lead to a fourth order derivative term which is similar to the ones accounting for surface tension effects as proposed in huppert 1982 for the case of a thin fluid film flowing down a plane and in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 for unsaturated one phase flow however when compared to cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 here a nonlinear algebraic function of the saturation is absent in the equation for the capillary pressure this is due to the simple setting adopted here on the other hand as in mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 the models are derived by upscaling whereas in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 they are formulated directly as upscaled models one can explain the different results in the two β depending regimes starting by observing that γ is the reciprocal of ca hence in the first regime γ is much smaller than in the second one as in the young laplace equation the pressure difference is proportional to γ whenever this is small in the upscaled limit one obtains that the two pressure are equal 5 3 unsaturated flow with constant surface tension continuing in the same spirit as before for the unsaturated case with constant surface tension in section 2 7 the upscaled models are simplified more precisely assuming ca ϵ β ca with ca o 1 for β 3 the upscaled fluid ii pressure becomes zero as the one for fluid i and therefore the flow is vanishing as well in this case the saturation becomes constant in both space and time which is actually steady state in this case the upscaled model is trivial for β 3 the upscaled model becomes 79 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 0 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca for all 0 x 1 and t 0 this can be expressed in terms of one primary variable the water saturation d 0 specifically for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 80 t d 0 x d 0 3 3 x x x d 0 ca 0 this equation resembles the thin film lubrication approximation oron et al 1997 similar to 78 the upscaled model in 79 is a non standard model in the sense that the capillary pressure relation is given by the second derivative of the effective saturation also for a large viscosity ratio the pore scale model for the two phase flow in section 3 2 reduces to the upscaled models in 79 remark 3 the marangoni effect is only visible for the upscaled model 76 for 75 the marangoni effect is lost and one immediately sees that 76 is equivalent to 75 for a constant surface tension additionally 76 is equivalent to 77 for a constant concentration and surface tension hence for the numerical validation in section 6 we will only consider the three upscaled models 76 78 and 79 as these three models represent the different effective behaviours we have considered 6 model validation in this section the upscaled models are validated by numerical experiments specifically the full solutions e g p α ϵ q α ϵ c ϵ d ϵ of the two dimensional pore scale models computed for pores having different width length ratios e g ϵ 0 1 0 07 0 05 0 01 and for different capillary numbers ca ϵ β ca with ca o 1 for β 1 3 are averaged in the transversal direction and compared to the approximate upscaled solutions e g p α 0 q α 0 c 0 d 0 to compute the full solutions of the pore scale models we use comsol multiphysics com for the simulations of the upscaled models we use a simple finite difference scheme on an equidistant mesh implemented in matlab first and second order central differences are used for the space discretization for the time discretization an explicit method with fixed time step size is used for 76 while for 78 and 79 an implicit method with fixed time step size is used we use harmonic averages for the relative permeabilities in the effective flow equations for the advective flux in 76 we use an upwind approximation we employ newton s method for solving the resulting non linear system of equations we specify the pore geometry as in 13 and 14 for 13 we define the inflow and outflow boundaries as γ i i n ϵ t x y r 2 x 0 1 d ϵ 0 t y 0 γ i o u t ϵ t x y r 2 x 1 1 d ϵ 1 t y 0 for 14 the inflow and outflow boundaries are given by γ i i i n ϵ t x y r 2 x 0 1 y l d ϵ 0 t γ i i o u t ϵ

initial and boundary conditions are chosen we use homogeneous neumann boundary conditions for d 0 at x 0 and x 1 the models are solved for a total time of t 1 in fig 6 7 fig 8 we have plotted the upscaled solutions of 78 together with the averaged pore scale solutions in section 3 2 for various ϵ at t 1 for decreasing ϵ the averaged pore scale solutions are converging to the upscaled solutions which we also see by calculating the l 2 norm of the difference between the solutions in table 4 6 3 unsaturated flow with constant surface tension the numerical computations of the pore scale model

homogeneous neumann boundary conditions for d 0 at x 0 and x 1 the models are solved for a total time of t 1 in fig 9 and fig 10 we have plotted the upscaled solutions of 79 together with the averaged pore scale solutions in section 3 3 for various ϵ at t 1 for decreasing ϵ the averaged pore scale solutions are converging to the upscaled solutions which we also see by calculating the l 2 norm of the difference between the solutions in table 5 7 model comparison in section 5 we have summarized all the upscaled models derived for different capillary regimes the goal of this section is to numerically compare the upscaled models valid in the same capillary regime the upscaled model 76 includes the marangoni effect which reduces to the upscaled model 77 of the two phase flow model when the surface tension is constant or when the concentration of the solute is equally distributed on the other hand when m the upscaled model 78 of the two phase flow reduces to the unsaturated flow upscaled model 79 for this comparison we solve 78 for increasing values of m and then compare with 79 7 1 comparison of marangoni flow and two phase flow here we compare between the upscaled models in 76 and 77 where the regime is ca ϵ ca with ca 1 the initial conditions are for 0 x 1 d 0 x 0 0 5 c 0 x 0 0 50 q α 0 1 x 0 0 p α 0 x 0 p 0 x 0 0 the inflow and outflow boundary conditions for the pressures are p α 0 0 t 0 023 and p α 0 1 t 0 depending on the inflow boundary conditions for the concentration we have tested three different cases to observe the marangoni flow here the outflow boundary condition is set to the same value as the initial concentration the three different cases are case i c 0 0 t 0 25 and c 0 1 t 0 50 case ii c 0 0 t 0 50 and c 0 1 t 0 50 case iii c 0 0 t 1 00 and c 0 1 t 0 50 at the fluid fluid interface the surface tension coefficient is chosen as 2 with a 1 and b 1 to include the marangoni effect the diffusion coefficient is chosen as d 1 and the viscosity ratio as m 1 the models are solved for a total time of t 0 1 we see in fig 11 that case ii corresponds to a constant concentration and thus x γ c 0 0 we want to emphasize that this is equivalent to the case of solving the upscaled model 77 for the two phase flow with constant surface tension this case will hence not include marangoni effect due to the difference in inlet and outlet pressure both fluid velocities are small but positive through the domain accompanied by a linear pressure drop and a constant saturation as seen in fig 12 and fig 13 for case i we see in fig 11 that this corresponds to x c 0 0 which implies x γ c 0 0 oppositely case iii corresponds to x γ c 0 0 the effect on the fluid velocities pressures and saturations in fig 12 and fig 13 is evident for case i we see how the negative surface tension gradient along the strip results in overall negative velocities of both fluids through the strip this is as expected from the darcy type laws in 76 and can be interpreted as the flow going towards the lower concentration of solute and hence towards the region of larger surface tension in particular we see how the pressure distribution through the strip adjusts and hence is a convex function in case i also the saturation becomes slightly decreased near the inlet which is due to the difference in response of the two fluid velocities the opposite behaviour is seen for case iii here the negative solute concentration gradient corresponding to a positive surface tension gradient gives an increased flow in the positive direction through the strip the pressure becomes concave while the saturation near the inlet is seen to increase slightly due to the difference in fluid velocity this simple test case shows how the marangoni effect can alter the flow and mass transfer through a pore due to processes at the fluid fluid interface we see how the flow is adjusted to be towards the region of larger surface tension as is expected for marangoni flow 7 2 comparison of two phase flow and unsaturated flow here we compare between the upscaled models in 78 and 79 where the regime is ca ϵ 3 ca with ca 1 the viscosity ratio is chosen as m 1 m 5 m 10 and m 15 in 78 and compared to 79 which corresponds to letting m the initial conditions are for 0 x 1 d 0 x 0 0 5 1 2 x 1 2 x 2 q α 0 1 x 0 0 p α 0 x 0 0 the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are p i 0 0 t 0 023 and p i 0 1 t 0 p i i 0 0 t 2 377 and p i i 0 1 t 2 4 the models are solved for a total time of t 1 fig 14 and fig 15 show that the upscaled wetting phase quantities in the two phase flow model are approaching the corresponding one in the unsaturated flow model as the viscosity ratio is increasing this is confirmed in table 6 presenting the l 2 norm of the difference between the wetting phase quantities in the two phase flow model and the corresponding ones for the unsaturated flow for different values of m at t 1 observe that the differences become smaller for larger viscosity ratios we see that the behaviour of the wetting fluid is well approximated by the simpler unsaturated flow model when the viscosity ratio increases hence if the velocity and saturation of the wetting fluid is of main interest one could use the unsaturated flow model instead of the two phase flow model already for relatively moderate viscosity ratios 8 conclusion we consider the flow of two immiscible and incompressible phases respectively the unsaturated flow in a thin strip representing a porous medium we account for the possible dependence of the surface tension on the solute transported by the wetting fluid for the two phase flow the unsaturated one phase flow being similar the starting point is the model at the pore scale where the two fluids are separated by an interface having an a priori unknown location but depending on the fluid velocities the flow is described by the navier stokes equations and the solute transport by the advection diffusion equation at the interface separating the two fluids relevant interface conditions are imposed in particular the difference in the normal stress tensors depend on the surface tension which may change depending on the solute considering a simplified situation namely a thin strip representing a single pore we have derived upscaled one dimensional models describing the averaged behaviour of the system for different capillary regimes we have validated our theoretical results with numerical experiments and we then compared the behaviour of the upscaled models in doing so different situations are considered in which the capillary number and the viscosity ratio have a certain behaviour w r t the ratio of the pore width and length in particular we see that the solute dependent surface tension the marangoni effect is relevant for the upscaled models only if the capillary number is small enough in the case when the viscosity ratio becomes large the two phase flow model reduces to the unsaturated one phase model one main conclusion is that for small capillary numbers instead of capillary pressure saturation curve we obtain capillary pressure saturation dependency involving the second order derivative of the saturation as also proposed in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 based on the numerical results we emphasize that the presence of solute dependent surface tension can strongly influence the flow although considering a simple geometry combining asymptotic expansions with various scaling of the non dimensional parameters show which processes are important at the larger scale and which can be neglected the upscaling procedure also shows how the capillary pressure depends on the saturation when the capillary pressure should be accounted for allowing for other types of fluid displacement such as a fluid fluid solid contact point and more general geometries open for also other types of upscaled models credit authorship

468,the modelling and simulation of the unsaturated flow or the flow of two immiscible fluid phases in a porous medium is challenging as this flow takes place through the pores of the medium which form a highly complex domain next to the complexity of the domain a major challenge is to account for the interface separating the fluids or the unsaturated fluid from the inert filling part as the location of this interface is not known a priori the evolution of this interface depends on the flow of both fluids and of the surface tension moreover the surface tension may depend on the concentration of a surfactant dissolved in one fluid phase in this work such aspects are taken into account and effective darcy scale models are derived based on the known physics at the pore scale in this sense a thin strip is used as the representation of a single pore in the porous medium the darcy scale models are derived for various regimes accounting for different pore scale processes numerical examples show that the upscaled models are a good approximation of the transversal average of the solution to the pore scale models as the ratio of the width and the length of the pore approaches zero keywords two phase flow freely moving interface upscaled models marangoni effect capillary effect 1 introduction two phase flow in porous media is relevant for many industrial and environmental applications such as geological co2 sequestration or oil recovery common for all these applications is the need to describe the flow at the darcy scale from now on the macro scale the preferred scale for numerical simulations where the grain and void space and the two or more fluid phases cannot be explicitly separated but modelled through average quantities such as porosity and saturation at the darcy scale the flow of each fluid phase is described with the help of darcy scale quantities like the absolute permeability which depends strictly on the medium and the fluid specific relative permeability which is a function of the fluid saturation the two phase or more general the multi phase and multi component flow through a porous medium is inherently a process occurring at multiple scales in which the processes at the pore scale do affect the overall flow on the darcy scale when considering the process at the scale of pores here and below the micro scale the fluids are assumed immiscible and they are separated by a fluid fluid interface the location of this interface gives directly the volume occupied by each of the two fluids within one pore so it can be related directly to the saturation of the two fluids the interface is evolving in an a priori unknown manner depending on the velocities of the two fluids and on the surface tension this evolution has a high impact on the overall flow behaviour simply knowing the saturation of the two fluids is not sufficient for describing the overall flow behaviour we need to understand the processes affecting the fluid fluid interface to be able to describe the flow one of the first mathematical models for the darcy scale flow in a porous medium was formulated by henry darcy darcy 1856 based on experiments in these experiments only one fluid phase was considered occupying the entire pore space so the porous medium was fully saturated the experiments showed a proportionality between the pressure gradient and the flow rate subsequent extensions still based on experimental observations have considered unsaturated media richards 1931 two phase flow morrow and harris 1965 or reactive transport schechter and gidley 1969 in porous media traditionally the flow models involve the mass balance for each phase the darcy law with a saturation dependent relative permeability and that the phase pressure difference the capillary pressure is a nonlinear monotone function of the saturation of the say wetting fluid the relative permeability functions and the one for the capillary pressure are determined experimentally although extensively used such models need improvements as also motivated by experimental results as shown in morrow and harris 1965 the capillary pressure saturation function also depends on the process infiltration or drainage also the break through curves determined in bottero et al 2011 for the phase pressure difference respectively for the saturation reveal that the dependency of the former quantity on the latter is not necessarily monotone next to this there is indirect evidence of the limited validity of assuming a nonlinear relationship dependency of the capillary pressure and the saturation in this respect we mention that effects like saturation overshoot or finger formation clearly evidenced in experiments reported e g in dicarlo 2004 poulovassilis 1970 shiozawa and fujimaki 2004 zhuang et al 2019 and glass et al 1989 rezanezhad et al 2006 are ruled out by the mathematical models used traditionally to overcome these drawbacks extensions of darcy s law for unsaturated or two phase flow in porous media have been proposed in this sense we start by mentioning abreu et al 2019 beliaev and schotting 2001 beliaev and hassanizadeh 2001 van duijn and mitra 2018 plohr et al 2001 where different play type hysteresis models are being proposed an overview is provided in schweizer 2017 and beliaev and hassanizadeh 2001 hassanizadeh and gray 1993 for models incorporating dynamic effects in the capillary pressure saturation dependency inspired by the thin film model proposed in huppert 1982 a phase field model involving the second order spatial derivative of the saturation in the capillary pressure is proposed in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 for unsaturated flow in porous media also see armiti juber and rohde 2020 finally in doster and hilfer 2011 a model accounting for the differences between percolating and non percolating parts of a fluid is discussed whereas the interfacial area concept is incorporated in the porous media flow models discussed in niessner and hassanizadeh 2008 hassanizadeh and gray 1990 pop et al 2009 the effectiveness of such extensions in capturing phenomena like saturation overshoot and fingering is evidenced in zhuang et al 2019 cueto felgueroso and juanes 2009 chapwanya and stockie 2010 van duijn et al 2013 2018 hilfer et al 2012 lamacz et al 2011 rätz and schweizer 2014 schneider et al 2018 zhang and zegeling 2017 two different major strategies can be observed in these papers the first is to present numerical simulations for the extended models aiming to reproduce the experimental results quantitatively the second relies on mathematical analysis and in particular on travelling waves the focus being mainly on the qualitative behaviour of the solution and in particular the dependence on the parameters appearing in the extended models the extended models discussed above are stated at the darcy scale where no distinction is being made between the pore space where fluid flow takes place these models are describing the averaged behaviour of the system by considering so called representative elementary volumes and without focussing on the detailed description of the processes inside each pore alternatively one can consider the mathematical models valid at the scale of pores which leads to models posed in an extremely complex domain consisting of the entire pore space of the porous medium such an approach allows to incorporate detailed pore scale physics which is generally better understood there are various possibilities in this direction like the smoothed particle hydrodynamics based simulations in tartakovsky and meakin 2006 the pore network modelling in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 and we refer to golparvar et al 2018 for a review of such approaches closer to the present work are mehmani and tchelepi 2019 and mehmani and tchelepi 2018 where direct numerical simulations tools are developed to understand the flow and the interface dynamics at the scale of pores and these tools are then incorporated in a multi scale simulator however a numerical simulation at such detailed level and for the entire domain of interest remains simply infeasible for practical applications due to the computational complexity to overcome the difficulties related to the complexity of the domain one can apply upscaling techniques to derive darcy scale models such an approach is adopted in mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 by considering a simple pore geometry consisting of a long and thin pore and for which transversal averaging is applied to derive a darcy scale model in this way various model components and features can be included in a quite straightforward manner and the corresponding darcy scale models can be derived in a rational manner recently picchi and battiato 2018 proposed an upscaling technique where they considered different flow distributions and derived regime specific upscaled model to derive the upscaled models they assumed that the location of the fluid fluid interface is known and stationary here we follow the same approach as in mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 for deriving darcy scale models for two phase or unsaturated one phase flow in porous media in the former case a wetting and a non wetting fluid are present in the latter only a wetting fluid is present together with a fluid that has constant pressure say zero and infinite mobility the fluids are assumed incompressible and immiscible the derived models also take into account the possibility that one fluid is transporting a solute which has an impact on the surface tension coefficient we start with formulating the relevant models at the pore scale and then derive upscaled darcy scale models based on reasonable assumptions on the underlying physics at the pore scale we assume that the flow of each fluid phase is modelled by the navier stokes equations when referring to two fluid phases the unsaturated one phase case being similar a peculiar aspect in this approach is in the fact that since the fluids are assumed immiscible at the pore scale they are separated by an interface having a location that is not known a priori this interface moves depending on the fluid velocities and if applicable on the concentration of the solute at this interface in mathematical terms this interface represents a free boundary in the model jump conditions ensuring conservation of the involved quantities are used at the evolving interface as well as kinematic conditions to model its evolution we consider here a single pore as a representative for the porous medium the pore is long and thin specifically a thin strip although this is a very simple geometry upscaling thin strip models in other contexts e g biofilm growth van noorden et al 2010 and mineral precipitation van noorden 2009b has shown that the upscaled models have the same structure as commonly accepted darcy scale models in general porous media see van noorden 2009a and schulz and knabner 2017 the advantage of using a single pore is that analytical expressions for the upscaled quantities are obtained inside the thin strip we assume that the two fluids have a layered structure hence the location of the interface separating the two fluid phases can also uniquely describe the thickness of the wetting phase and hence the saturation such a fluid distribution is the same as the core annular flow in picchi and battiato 2018 and the thin film flow in mikelic and paoli 2000 in picchi and battiato 2018 upscaled models for core annular flow and other fluid distributions are derived but under steady state conditions here we explicitly account for the evolving fluid fluid interface by treating the width of the wetting phase as a variable for more complicated situations one can use e g a level set approach osher and fedkiw 2001 to track the location of the interface alternatively a diffuse interface approach can be considered using e g the phase field model in abels et al 2012 in any of these approaches the resulting models can be used for deriving the upscaled darcy scale counterparts which are more suited for numerical simulations for the simplified situation here we apply asymptotic expansion techniques and transversal averaging to derive the upscaled mathematical models in doing so we also include a solute dependent surface tension leading to so called marangoni effects in the upscaled equations an alternative to homogenization is the method of volume averaging which has been successfully applied to upscaling two phase flow in porous media in whitaker 1986 quintard and whitaker 1988 the upscaled model in quintard and whitaker 1988 was explored numerically in quintard and whitaker 1990b for stratified flows and compared to the dynamic setting in quintard and whitaker 1990a the work from quintard and whitaker 1988 has been extended in lasseux et al 1996 to further investigate the resulting permeability tensors derived by the volume averaging this work is builds on mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 where mathematically rigorous upscaling results are obtained for two phase flow in a single pore compared to mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 here we consider more regimes with respect to the capillary number and also include solute effects in the surface tension dependency we also mention that although not considering the flow in a porous medium in bresch 2009 a similar approach is used for deriving the shallow water equations in this context we mention that asymptotic homogenization methods in either a thin strip or in a periodic porous medium have been widely applied for many application in which evolving interfaces are encountered at the pore scale examples in this sense are the evolving fluid solid interface due to mineral precipitation and dissolution van noorden 2009b a bringedal et al 2015 2016b 2016a kumar et al 2011 schulz 2019b or to biofilm growth or other biological processes van noorden et al 2010 schulz and knabner 2017 landa marbán et al 2020 peszynska et al 2016 ray et al 2013 2012 schulz 2019a in all these cases the derived darcy scale models were resembling well many of the models that are commonly accepted in the literature but allow integrating additional effects in a rational manner the paper is organized as follows in the next section the physical processes at the pore scale and the corresponding mathematical models are introduced with ϵ being a small parameter representing the ratio of the pore width and length in section 3 the pore scale models are non dimensionalized and their dependence on ϵ is derived in section 4 asymptotic expansion methods are applied to the pore scale models and for various scaling regimes and the corresponding upscaled are derived in this sense the cases in which the marangoni effects do play a role at the darcy scale are evidenced also cases where the two upscaled fluid pressures are equal or where the capillary pressure depends on the saturation in a non standard way resembling the models in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 mikelic and paoli 2000 mikelić 2003 the results are summarized and discussed more closely in section 5 in section 6 provides some numerical examples that confirm the validity of the approach specifically the numerical solutions to the original pore scale models are computed for different situations and then their transversal averages are compared to the solutions to the upscaled models these results support that as ϵ approaches zero the upscaled models are describing well the averaged behaviour of the considered pore scale models finally in section 7 the different upscaled models are compared highlighting the upscaled behaviour of the considered physical phenomena 2 mathematical model a pore scale model is considered for two phase or unsaturated flow through a porous medium for simplicity we considered a thin two dimensional strip to represent the local pore geometry two incompressible and immiscible fluids where one is wetting and the other is non wetting are flowing through the strip densities and viscosities of the fluids are constant the wetting phase is attached to the pore wall and the wetting layer has a thickness that changes with time and varies with the location of the wall the two fluids are separated by a sharp interface with zero thickness which is changing with time the movement is not known a priori hence we have a moving boundary at the fluid fluid interface the interface that separates the fluids moves because of the surface tension and of the flow movement of the two fluids there is a solute present only in the wetting fluid and the concentration of the solute will change subject to diffusion and transport the surface tension is considered as a function of the solute concentration which results in a tangential stress at the moving interface which is called the marangoni stress the gravity effects are neglected 2 1 geometric settings the width and length of the thin strip are respectively 2 l and l with l l for simplicity we assume a symmetric case with respect to w r t the x axis the lower half of the strip is shown in fig 1 let t 0 be the time variable the thickness of the wetting fluid layer is denoted by d x t where 0 d x t l the void space consists of two domains the domain occupied by the non wetting fluid fluid i and by the wetting fluid ii fluid are denoted by respectively ω i t x y r 2 0 x l l d x t y 0 ω i i t x y r 2 0 x l l y l d x t the fluid fluid interface and the fluid solid interface are respectively γ f f t x y r 2 0 x l y l d x t γ f s x y r 2 0 x l y l the velocity vectors are denoted by q α q α 1 q α 2 where the index α i i i is distinguishing between the non wetting and the wetting fluid respectively since d x t gives the location of the fluid fluid interface the unit normal vector on the fluid fluid interface pointing into fluid i and the unit tangent vector are n x d 1 t 1 x d 2 and t 1 x d t 1 x d 2 given a point x l d x t on γ ff t its normal velocity is 1 v n t d 1 x d 2 2 2 equations in the pore domain we refer to patankar 1980 and assume that the flow of the two fluids is governed by the navier stokes equations ρ α t q α ρ α q α q α p α μ α 2 q α in ω α t α i i i q α 0 in ω α t α i i i where ρα and μα are respectively the constant viscosities and densities and the pressures are pα for simplicity gravity effects are neglected we assume that one chemical species solute is present in fluid ii its molar concentration being c additionally there is no mass transfer of the solute form fluid ii to fluid i hence the molar concentration of the solute in fluid i is zero the solute concentration changes both by diffusion and convection resulting in t c d c q i i c 0 in ω i i t where d is the constant diffusion coefficient to complete the model above appropriate initial conditions inflow and outflow boundary conditions can be added however as the upscaling procedure is independent of the choice of initial and external boundary conditions these will not be specified here 2 3 boundary conditions at the fluid fluid interface γ ff t here we specify the boundary conditions at γ ff t this means that all equations in this section are valid only at points at γ ff t firstly we assume that the velocities of the two fluids are equal at γ ff t q i q i i secondly we assume that the normal velocity of γ ff t as given in 1 equals the normal velocities of the two fluids q α n v n α i i i further conditions at γ ff t are involving the stress tensors t α p α i μ α q α q α t α i i i the curvature of γ ff t n x x d 1 x d 2 and the surface tension γ if γ is affected by the presence of the solute present in fluid ii one has γ γ c for example in smith and gillham 1999 the following law is proposed 2 γ c γ r e f 1 b ln c a c r e f 1 where a b are constants and γref is the surface tension at reference concentration cref its tangential stress gradients is s γ c γ c n n γ c with this the third boundary condition at γ ff t reads see leal 2007 t i t i i n γ c n n s γ c this jump can be written in terms of the normal and the tangential components at γ ff t for the normal component one has t i t i i n n γ c n while for the tangential component also known as marangoni stress one gets t i t i i n t t γ c finally the mass balance for the solute at γ ff t reads d c q i i c n v n c 2 4 boundary conditions at the fluid solid interface γ fs as before the equations hold only at the fluid solid interface γ fs where first no slip is assumed q i i 0 for the solute concentration the normal flux into the solid matrix is zero d c q i i c n 0 2 5 pore scale model for the two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension recall that the sub domain occupied by fluid α is time dependent ω α t and that the freely moving fluid fluid interface is γ ff t and considering the discussion above one has 3 ρ α t q α ρ α q α q α p α μ α 2 q α in ω α t α i i i 4 q α 0 in ω α t α i i i 5 t c d c q i i c 0 in ω i i t 6 q i q i i at γ f f t 7 q α n v n at γ f f t α i i i 8 t i t i i n n γ c n at γ

whenever the surface tension is constant as happening e g in the absence of a solute in fluid ii or with a constant solute concentration the tangential components of the normal stresses are equal at γ ff t in this case the pore scale model is simpler as 5 10 and 12 become superfluous while γ c γ in 8 and 9 reduces to t i t i i n n γ n at γ f f t t i t i i n t 0 at γ f f t the remaining equations are the same as in section 2 5 2 7 pore scale model for the unsaturated flow with constant surface tension a further simplification is to assume that the pressure in the fluid i is constant and that its mobility is infinite essentially this means that fluid i plays no role for the flow of fluid ii this situation appears e g if fluid i is air and is connected to the atmosphere alternatively this pore scale model can be interpreted as a thin film flow with an open surface where a liquid is attached to the wall of the pore and the middle domain is occupied by air then the number of variables reduces to those corresponding to fluid ii moreover we assume the solute is absent in fluid ii and the surface tension is constant in this case 5 10 and 12 are excessive moreover the model equations in section 2 5 are further simplified by giving up the equations for α i reducing to the navier stokes equations in ω ii t at γ ff t 7 is valid for α i i and 8 9 shortens to t i i n n γ n at γ f f t t i i n t 0 at γ f f t 3 the non dimensional model equations to identify the model components that have a larger or smaller impact than others we first bring the model to a non dimensional form to this aim we use reference quantities and rescale the dimensional ones as specified in table 1 in particular μii and ρii are taken as reference viscosity respectively density table 1 introduces two length scales l and l in a general porous medium l would reflect the length scale of the entire medium where l is the one of a pore as we let a single pore represent the porous medium we use the width and the length of the pore as described in section 2 1 in the same spirit here we define the non dimensional number ϵ l l 0 and assume that ϵ is small observe now that the x and y coordinates are scaled differently so that they become both of order 1 o 1 based on this the derivatives change into x l x y ϵ l y the non dimensional gradient is x 1 ϵ y due to the different scaling in x and y direction some assumptions are made in table 1 by choosing the scaling for μref dref and pref the ratio of the time scales for the diffusion and the convective transport referred to as the péclet number p e q r e f x r e f d r e f is chosen moderate w r t ϵ for simplicity the péclet number is taken equal to 1 however in van noorden et al 2010 van noorden 2009b a schulz and knabner 2017 bringedal et al 2015 2016a schulz 2019b landa marbán et al 2020 peszynska et al 2016 ray et al 2013 2012 the case of moderate péclet number when diffusion dominates or is in balance with the transport and in bringedal et al 2016b kumar et al 2011 van duijn et al 2008 mauri 2003 the case of high péclet number when the convective transport dominates the diffusion are considered additionally the scaling of the pref and μref are chosen such that the reynolds number r e ρ r e f q r e f x r e f μ r e f is moderate namely equal to 1 and the euler number e u p r e f q r e f 2 ρ r e f is equal to ϵ 2 these choices ensure laminar flow and that the pressure drop dominates the flow which are needed to ensure validity of darcy s law on the macro scale note that the dimensionless parameters m n appearing in table 1 m μ i i μ i n ρ i i ρ i may also depend on ϵ in this respect here we restrict to the case n 1 while m is assumed first o 1 and later the limit m is considered to show that the two phase model reduces to the unsaturated single phase one in the non dimensional setting the pore space occupied by the two fluids is 13 ω i ϵ t x y r 2 0 x 1 1 d ϵ x t y 0 14 ω i i ϵ t x y r 2 0 x 1 1 y 1 d ϵ x t the fluid fluid

section only the non dimensional variables are used for the ease of presentation the hats are suppressed we use the homogenization ansatz namely that all variables can be expanded regularly w r t ϵ we assume that 30 p α ϵ x y t p α 0 x y t ϵ p α 1 x y t o ϵ 2 α i i i q α ϵ k x y t q α 0 k x y t ϵ q α 1 k x y t o ϵ 2 α i i i k 1 2 c ϵ x y t c 0 x y t ϵ c 1 x y t o ϵ 2 d ϵ x t d 0 x t ϵ d 1 x t o ϵ 2 where p α j x y t q α j k x y t c j x y t d j x t are functions describing the o ϵ j order approximation for j 1 2 of the corresponding variables we will now insert these expansions in the model equations and equate terms of the same order in ϵ to find the transversally averaged equations we do this for different regimes and end up with different upscaled models 4 1 two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension we start with the model for two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension 15 25 at this point we assume that m is o 1 w r t ϵ 4 1 1 mass conservation to derive an effective equation for the mass conservation we follow the ideas in van noorden 2009b bringedal et al 2015 kumar et al 2011 substituting the asymptotic expansion 30 in the mass conservation equation 17 and restricting the writing up to the o ϵ 0 terms gives 31 1 ϵ y q α 0 2 x q α 0 1 y q α 1 2 o ϵ 0 in ω α ϵ t to show that q α 0 2 0 in ω α ϵ t we use 30 in the kinematic conditions 20 and obtain 32 q α 0 2 ϵ q α 1 2 q α 0 1 x d 0 t d 0 o ϵ 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t the lowest order terms in 31 32 give y q α 0 2 0 in ω α ϵ t and q α 0 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t while 24 and the symmetry condition at y 0 lead to 33 q α 0 2 0 in ω α ϵ t to upscale the mass balance for the fluids we consider a thin segment of the pore space as sketched in fig 2 let y i x y x 1 x x 1 δ x 0 y 1 d ϵ be the region in this segment that is occupied by fluid i by integrating 17 over yi one obtains y i q i ϵ d v i 0 in the above equation we apply the theorem of gauss and divide all terms by δx then using 20 and the asymptotic expansions 30 to get 1 δ x 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 d y x x 1 δ x 1 δ x 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 d y x x 1 1 δ x x 1 x 1 δ x q i 1 2 d x y 0 1 δ x x 1 x 1 δ x t d 0 d x o ϵ 0 using the symmetry condition at y 0 and equating the lowest order terms in the above gives 1 δ x 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 x x 1 δ x q i 0 1 x x 1 d y 1 δ x x 1 x 1 δ x t d 0 d x 0 defining the total flux of fluid i as 34 q i 0 1 x t 1 d 0 0 q i 0 1 x y t d y and letting δx 0 one obtains 35 x q i 0 1 t d 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 similarly using the fluid ii region y i i x y x 1 x x 1 δ x 1 d ϵ y 1 for 36 q i i 0 1 x t 1 1 d 0 q i i 0 1 x y t d y one obtains 37 x q i i 0 1 t d 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 remark 1 recalling that the fluids are incompressible observe that since d 0 is the thickness of the wetting phase layer in the half pore it can be regarded as the saturation of the wetting fluid in this sense 35 and 37 are the effective mass balance equations for the two fluid phases 4 1 2 solute transport to upscale the solute transport which is needed when considering the marangoni effect one uses the asymptotic expansion 30 in 18 to get 38 t c 0 x 1 ϵ y d x 1 ϵ y c 0 ϵ c 1 ϵ 2 c 2 x 1 ϵ y q i i 0 1 q i i 0 2 ϵ q i i 1 2 c 0 ϵ c 1 o ϵ 0 in ω i i ϵ t first we show that c 0 and c 1 do not depend on y the ϵ 2 order term in 38 is leading to y y c 0 0 in ω i i ϵ t from the ϵ 1 order term in the boundary conditions 21 and 25 one obtains y c 0 0 at γ f f ϵ t and γ f s this implies that c 0 does not depend on y c 0 c 0 x t in ω i i ϵ t in a similar fashion using this 33 the ϵ 1 order term in 38 and ϵ0 order term in 21 25 one obtains c 1 c 1 x t in ω i i ϵ t the non dimensional equation describing the solute concentration 18 can be written as 1 ϵ 2 y d y c ϵ 1 ϵ y q i i ϵ 2 c ϵ t c ϵ x d x c ϵ q i i ϵ 1 c ϵ 0 we integrate the above equation w r t y from y 1 to y 1 d ϵ applying the leibniz rule in the last two terms and taking into account that d ϵ depends on x and t one gets 1 ϵ 2 d y c ϵ 1 ϵ q i i ϵ 2 c ϵ y 1 y 1 d ϵ t 1 1 d ϵ c ϵ d y t d ϵ c ϵ y 1 d ϵ x 1 1 d ϵ d x c ϵ q i i ϵ 1 c ϵ d y x d ϵ d x c ϵ q i i ϵ 1 c ϵ y 1 d ϵ 0 we insert the asymptotic expansion 30 in the above equation recalling that c 0 and c 1 do not depend on y and that y c 2 0 and q i i 1 2 0 at y 1 since q i i 0 2 0 in ω i i ϵ t one obtains d y c 2 q i i 1 2 c 0 y 1 d 0 t c 0 1 1 d 0 1 d y t d 0 c 0 y 1 d 0 x d x c 0 1 1 d 0 1 d y c 0 1 1 d

d 0 x c 0 q i i 0 1 x d d 0 x c 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 4 1 3 momentum conservation we apply the asymptotic expansion 30 in the horizontal and vertical component of the momentum equation for fluid ii 16 recalling that q i i 0 2 0 in ω i i ϵ t for all t 0 one has 40 y y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 ϵ y y q i i 1 1 ϵ x p i i 1 o ϵ 2 0 41 1 ϵ y p i i 0 y p i i 1 ϵ y p i i 2 ϵ y y q i i 1 2 o ϵ 2 0 restricting to ϵ 1 order term in 41 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one gets p i i 0 p i i 0 x t for all t 0 the dominant terms in 40 give 42 y y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 in ω i i ϵ t integrating the above equation in y and taking into account that p ii 0 is independent of y we obtain 43 y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 y a 1 x t in ω i i ϵ t where a 1 x t is an integrating constant that will be fixed using boundary condition for q i i 0 1 we now assume that the surface tension γ γ c ϵ depends smoothly on the solute concentration using 30 and expanding γ c ϵ around c 0 gives γ c ϵ γ c 0 ϵ c 1 γ c 0 o ϵ 2 we apply the asymptotic expansion 30 in the boundary condition 23 using the above equation and recalling that q α 0 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t and that c 0 is independent of y we get 44 1 ϵ 1 m y q i 0 1 y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 1 1 y q i i 1 1 ϵ 1 m y q i 2 1 y q i i 2 1 ϵ 1 m x q i 1 2 x q i i 1 2 2 ϵ x d 0 1 m y q i 1 2 y q i i 1 2 2 ϵ x d 0 1 m x q i 0 1 x q i i 0 1 ϵ x d 0 2 1 m y q i 0 1 y q i i 0 1 1 ca x γ c 0 ϵ ca x c 1 γ c 0 o ϵ 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t at this point the upscaling depends on the capillary number ca we will discuss the cases with ca ϵ β ca for 0 β 3 where ca o 1 we start by assuming ca o 1 thus β 0 from 44 one gets the tangential stress boundary condition 45 y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 0 1 at γ f f ϵ t using the above in 43 leads to 46 1 m y q i 0 1 y 1 d 0 1 d 0 x p i i 0 a 1 x t in ω i i ϵ t applying the asymptotic expansion 30 into 15 and using 33 for all t 0 one has 47 1 m y y q i 0 1 x p i 0 ϵ m y y q i 1 1 ϵ x p i 1 o ϵ 2 0 in ω i ϵ t 48 1 ϵ y p i 0 y p i 1 ϵ y p i 2 ϵ m y y q i 1 2 o ϵ 2 0 in ω i ϵ t the lowest order term in 48 gives 49 p i 0 p i 0 x t for all 0 x 1 for all t 0 the dominating terms in 47 satisfy 50 y y q i 0 1 m x p i 0 in ω i ϵ t we integrate the above equation w r t y we use 49 and the symmetry condition y q i 0 1 x y t 0 at y 0 which leads to 51 y q i 0 1 m x p i 0 y in ω i ϵ t we determine a 1 x t from 46 by using 51 at y 1 d 0 one gets for all t 0 52 y q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 y 1 d 0 x p i 0 x p i i 0 in ω i i ϵ t the lowest order terms in 24 imply that q i i 0 1 0 at y 1 hence integrating the above equation in y one obtains 53 q i i 0 1 x p i i 0 y 2 1 2 1 d 0 x p i 0 x p i i 0 y 1 in ω i i ϵ t integrating the above in y from y 1 d 0 to y 1 and using 36 yields 54 q i i 0 1 x t d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 to derive an effective equation for the velocity of fluid i we integrate 51 twice w r t y to determine the integration constants we use the continuity of the velocity at the fluid fluid interface the lowest order terms in 19 imply q i 0 1 q i i 0 1 and hence 55 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 x p i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i i 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 4 1 4 effect of ca we recall that the boundary conditions coming from the normal 22 and the tangential 23 components of the jump in the normal stress depends on the capillary number ca to complete the upscaled model representing the effective behaviour for two phase flow we still have to find a relationship between the pressure difference of the fluids capillary pressure and the saturation in the porous medium to this aim we rewrite 22 as 56 1 ϵ 2 p i ϵ p i i ϵ 2 ϵ y q i ϵ 2 m y q i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ 2 p i ϵ p i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ y q i ϵ 1 m y q i i ϵ 1 2 ϵ x d ϵ x q i ϵ 2 m x q i i ϵ 2 ϵ γ c ϵ x x d ϵ ca o ϵ 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t whenever ca o 1 thus β 0 applying the asymptotic expansion 30 in the above equation and recalling 33 gives 57 p i 0 p i i 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 this means that in the upscaled model the pressures in both phases are equal since p i 0 p i i 0 in the pressure relation 57 for simplicity we set p 0 p α 0 and the effective velocities 54 and 55 become for all 0 x 1 and t 0 58 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 59 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 thus the upscaled model with ca o 1 is represented by the mass conservation equations 35 37 the effective velocities 58 59 and the solute transport 39 this can be expressed in terms of three primary variables the saturation of the wetting fluid d 0 the pressure p 0 recall that the two fluid pressures are equal and the concentration c 0 specifically for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 60 t d 0 x m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 0 t d 0 x d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 x d d 0 x c 0 0 this means that the surface tension γ plays no role in the effective equations and therefore the marangoni effect is lost for regimes where ca o ϵ β ca with β 0 the marangoni effect will play a role in the upscaled models for example if ca ϵ ca with ca o 1 from 44 one gets the marangoni stress boundary condition 61 y q i i 0 1 y q i 0 1 m x γ c 0 ca at γ f f ϵ t using this instead of 45 and repeating the same steps in section 4 1 3 one gets for 0 x 1 and t 0 62 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 1 d 0 d 0 ca x γ c 0 63 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 d 0 2 2 ca x γ c 0 the upscaled model consists of the mass conservation equations 35 37 effective velocities 62 63 and the solute transport 39 the model can be expressed in terms of three primary variables the water saturation d 0 the pressure p 0 recalling that the two fluid pressures are equal and the concentration c 0 specifically for 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 64 t d 0 x m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 1 d 0 d 0 ca x γ c 0 0 t d 0 x d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 d 0 2 2 ca x γ c 0 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 x d d 0 x c 0 0 assuming ca ϵ β ca with β 2 or 3 will lead to different marangoni stress condition than 61 involving the unknowns c 1 c 2 etc in this case one needs to find an effective solute transport equation involving c 1 c 2 etc this is beyond the scope of this paper 4 2 two phase flow with constant surface tension now we consider the pore scale model in section 3 2 we begin with the assumption that m o 1 we recall that for a constant surface tension the dynamic boundary conditions are now 26 27 4 2 1 mass conservation the derivation of the mass conservation equation in this section is identical to the one in section 4 1 1 the mass conservation equation for the two phase flow model with constant surface tension is the same as 35 and 37 4 2 2 momentum conservation to derive the effective velocities for fluid i and fluid ii we can follow the same steps discussed in section 4 1 3 since the surface tension γ is constant we use the continuity in the tangential component of the normal stress 27 it is worth to mention that the capillary number ca is absent in the tangential stress boundary condition applying asymptotic expansion 30 in the boundary condition 27 we get 1 ϵ 1 m y q i 0 1 y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 1 1 y q i i 1 1 o ϵ 0 at γ f f ϵ t the lowest order terms imply y q i i 0 1 1 m y q i 0 1 at γ f f ϵ t which is same as 45 further as in section 4 1 3 one obtains the same effective velocities 54 and 55 4 2 3 effect of ca assuming ca ϵ β ca with β 3 and applying asymptotic expansion 30 in 56 recalling that here γ c ϵ 1 the lowest order term implies the same pressure relation as in 57 the upscaled model for the two phase flow with constant surface tension large or moderate capillary number can be represented by the mass conservation equations 35 37 by the effective velocities 59 58 and the pressure relation 57 this can be expressed in terms of two primary variables the water saturation d 0 and the pressure p 0 recall that the two fluid pressures are equal specifically for 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 65 t d 0 x m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 0 t d 0 x d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 0 if the capillary number is ca ϵ 3 ca applying 30 in 56 we obtain 66 p i 0 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca in this case the upscaled model for the two phase flow with constant surface tension is given by the mass conservation equations 35 37 the effective velocities 55 54 and the capillary pressure relationship 66 4 2 4 effect of large viscosity ratio between the fluids by now we assumed m o 1 here we consider m ϵ 1 m where m o 1 which means that the viscosity of fluid i is much smaller than that of fluid ii we show that the first order terms when m upscaling the equations in section 4 2 will only include the fluid ii flow whereas the fluid i flow component is vanishing reducing the model to the unsaturated flow in section 4 3 in this respect we first show that the pressure becomes constant and set as reference value to 0 for fluid i now considering m ϵ 1 m with m o 1 in 47 and 48 for all t 0 one has 67 x p i 0 ϵ x p i 1 ϵ m y y q i 0 1 o ϵ 2 0 in ω i ϵ t 68 1 ϵ y p i 0 y p i 1 o ϵ 0 in ω i ϵ t the lowest order terms in 67 and 68 give x p i 0 0 and y p i 0 0 in ω i ϵ t hence p i 0 is constant in space we assume it constant in time as well and set this value as a reference zero pressure implying p i 0 0 in ω i ϵ t considering the surface tension constant in 44 and m ϵ 1 m where m o 1 give 1 ϵ y q i i 0 1 y q i i 1 1 1 m y q i 0 1 o ϵ 0 at γ f f ϵ t the ϵ 1 order term in the above equation gives 69 y q i i 0 1 0 at γ f f ϵ t to find the effective velocity for fluid ii we use 69 instead of 45 when integrating 42 in y recalling that γ is constant and p i 0 is zero for fluid i we follow the same steps as in section 4 1 3 which results in 70 q i i 0 1 x p i 0 y 2 2 1 d 0 y 1 2 d 0 in ω i i ϵ t integrating 70 and using 36 gives the darcy law 71 q i i 0 1 d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 to find the pressure equation for fluid ii we take m ϵ 1 m in section 4 1 4 and we use the fact that the pressure for fluid i is zero then the capillary pressure relation in 57 for β 3 changes into 72 p i i 0 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 remark 2 since p i i 0 0 in 72 the same holds for q i i 0 1 in 71 and therefore the saturation is constant in space and time this is a trivial situation corresponding to steady state similarly if β 3 66 becomes 73 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca for all 0 x 1 and t 0 note that fluid i plays no role in the upscaled equations which now reduces to the equations for fluid ii specially the upscaled model consists of the mass conservation equation 37 the effective velocity 71 and the pressure equation 72 for β 3 respectively by 73 for β 3 hence in the limit when m only the flow of one phase is accounted for the lowest order and the upscaled model for two phase flow reduces to the upscaled model for the unsaturated flow as derived in section 4 3 4 3 unsaturated flow with constant surface tension we here now turn our attention to the model in section 3 3 4 3 1 mass conservation the derivation of the mass conservation equation in this section is identical to the one in section 4 1 1 the mass conservation equation for the unsaturated flow model with constant surface tension is the same as 37 4 3 2 momentum conservation we apply the asymptotic expansion 30 in the boundary condition 29 and recall that q i i 0 2 0 at γ f f ϵ t instead of 44 the boundary condition for unsaturated flow at γ f f ϵ t reduces to 74 1 ϵ y q i i 0 1 y q i i 1 1 o ϵ 0 the ϵ 1 order gives y q i i 0 1 0 at γ f f ϵ t which is same as in 69 to find the effective velocity for fluid ii we follow then the same steps as in section 4 2 4 which results in 71 the same effective law for fluid ii as in section 4 2 4 4 3 3 effects of ca in the unsaturated flow case we disregard fluid i in 56 which leads to 1 ϵ 2 p i i ϵ 2 ϵ y q i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ 2 p i i ϵ 2 x d ϵ y q i i ϵ 1 2 ϵ x d ϵ x q i i ϵ 2 ϵ γ c ϵ x x d ϵ ca o ϵ 3 0 at γ f f ϵ t applying 30 in the above equation and recalling q i i 0 1 0 at γ f f ϵ t we find the same capillary pressure relations as in section 4 2 4 in particular for β 3 we get 72 and in this case the upscaled model is trivial see remark 2 the case ca ϵ 3 ca is more interesting as it gives the pressure relation 73 the upscaled model in this case is then represented by 35 71 and 73 5 summary and discussion of upscaled models we recall that in the upscaled models the width of the wetting fluid fluid ii d 0 can be seen as its saturation and therefore the saturation of the non wetting fluid fluid i is 1 d 0 the effective equations on the darcy scale are now summarized and discussed in the sections below these models are obtained in the limit situation when ϵ 0 practically one has ϵ small but not zero therefore the upscaled models should be seen as an approximation of the pore scale models having a much simpler structure assuming ca ϵ β ca we have considered several regimes identified by the value of β and derived different upscaled models table 2 is summarising these results for β 1 the marangoni effects are relevant and for β 3 the phase pressures are equal but for β 3 the difference of the phase pressures depends on the second order derivative of the saturation 5 1 two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension if ca o 1 then for all 0 x 1 and t 0 the upscaled model for the pore scale model 15 25 becomes 75 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 q i i 0 1 x d d 0 x c 0 if ca ϵ ca then for all 0 x 1 and t 0 the upscaled counterpart of the pore scale model in section 2 5 becomes 76 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 1 d 0 d 0 ca x γ c 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 d 0 2 2 ca x γ c 0 t c 0 d 0 x c 0 q i i 0 1 x d d 0 x c 0 the upscaled models in 75 and 76 have a common structure they include the mass balance for both fluid phases and the darcy laws for the two fluid velocities finally the last equation gives the mass balance for the solute one can recognize the effective velocities in 75 and 76 as darcy type laws for the two fluid phases since d 0 respectively 1 d 0 are the saturation of the two fluids the factors multiplying the pressure gradients in these equations can be viewed as relative permeabilities of the two fluids compared to the effective velocities in 75 the influence of the surface tension gradient namely the marangoni effect is visible in the effective velocities in 76 the upscaled models in 75 and 76 are valid for the regimes where the capillary number is either moderate or large which corresponds to very small surface tension hence the two phase pressures are equal or equivalently the capillary pressure is zero as commonly assumed in petroleum reservoir simulation models aziz and settari 1979 5 2 two phase flow with constant surface tension if solute is not present in the fluid ii phase the surface tension coefficient is constant in this case the mass balance for solute is left out also no marangoni effect is encountered which simplifies the models specifically assuming ca ϵ β ca for ca o 1 and β 3 the upscaled counterpart of the pore scale model in section 2 6 is 77 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 d 0 2 x p 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 2 3 d 0 6 x p 0 for all 0 x 1 and t 0 here the upscaled model is valid in the flow regimes where the capillary number is moderate or large which again implies that the pressures for the two fluid phases are same assuming ca ϵ 3 ca with ca o 1 the upscaled model becomes 78 t d 0 x q i 0 1 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 q i 0 1 m 1 d 0 3 3 d 0 1 d 0 2 x p i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i i 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 1 d 0 d 0 2 2 x p i 0 p i 0 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one can recognize the effective velocities in 77 and 78 as darcy type laws for the two fluid phases note that the effective velocities are depending on both pressure gradients from the two fluid phase a similar case as considered here was also upscaled in picchi and battiato 2018 as picchi and battiato 2018 considered steady state flow the phase pressure difference there is different from what we obtained here observe that compared to traditional two phase flow models in which the capillary pressure is a function of the saturation here this involves second order derivative of the saturation here we emphasize the differences between the regimes β 3 and β 3 in the capillary pressure relation in 77 and 78 in the former the pressures for both fluids are equal which is similar to saying that the capillary pressure is zero in the later case one gets a model in which the commonly used pressure saturation relation is replaced by a differential equation such a model is also derived in mikelić 2003 and mikelic and paoli 2000 by homogenization techniques also if the upscaled model derived here is reduced to a system of two equations the capillary pressure relation in 78 would lead to a fourth order derivative term which is similar to the ones accounting for surface tension effects as proposed in huppert 1982 for the case of a thin fluid film flowing down a plane and in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 for unsaturated one phase flow however when compared to cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 here a nonlinear algebraic function of the saturation is absent in the equation for the capillary pressure this is due to the simple setting adopted here on the other hand as in mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 the models are derived by upscaling whereas in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 they are formulated directly as upscaled models one can explain the different results in the two β depending regimes starting by observing that γ is the reciprocal of ca hence in the first regime γ is much smaller than in the second one as in the young laplace equation the pressure difference is proportional to γ whenever this is small in the upscaled limit one obtains that the two pressure are equal 5 3 unsaturated flow with constant surface tension continuing in the same spirit as before for the unsaturated case with constant surface tension in section 2 7 the upscaled models are simplified more precisely assuming ca ϵ β ca with ca o 1 for β 3 the upscaled fluid ii pressure becomes zero as the one for fluid i and therefore the flow is vanishing as well in this case the saturation becomes constant in both space and time which is actually steady state in this case the upscaled model is trivial for β 3 the upscaled model becomes 79 t d 0 x q i i 0 1 0 q i i 0 1 d 0 3 3 x p i i 0 0 p i i 0 x x d 0 ca for all 0 x 1 and t 0 this can be expressed in terms of one primary variable the water saturation d 0 specifically for all 0 x 1 and t 0 one has 80 t d 0 x d 0 3 3 x x x d 0 ca 0 this equation resembles the thin film lubrication approximation oron et al 1997 similar to 78 the upscaled model in 79 is a non standard model in the sense that the capillary pressure relation is given by the second derivative of the effective saturation also for a large viscosity ratio the pore scale model for the two phase flow in section 3 2 reduces to the upscaled models in 79 remark 3 the marangoni effect is only visible for the upscaled model 76 for 75 the marangoni effect is lost and one immediately sees that 76 is equivalent to 75 for a constant surface tension additionally 76 is equivalent to 77 for a constant concentration and surface tension hence for the numerical validation in section 6 we will only consider the three upscaled models 76 78 and 79 as these three models represent the different effective behaviours we have considered 6 model validation in this section the upscaled models are validated by numerical experiments specifically the full solutions e g p α ϵ q α ϵ c ϵ d ϵ of the two dimensional pore scale models computed for pores having different width length ratios e g ϵ 0 1 0 07 0 05 0 01 and for different capillary numbers ca ϵ β ca with ca o 1 for β 1 3 are averaged in the transversal direction and compared to the approximate upscaled solutions e g p α 0 q α 0 c 0 d 0 to compute the full solutions of the pore scale models we use comsol multiphysics com for the simulations of the upscaled models we use a simple finite difference scheme on an equidistant mesh implemented in matlab first and second order central differences are used for the space discretization for the time discretization an explicit method with fixed time step size is used for 76 while for 78 and 79 an implicit method with fixed time step size is used we use harmonic averages for the relative permeabilities in the effective flow equations for the advective flux in 76 we use an upwind approximation we employ newton s method for solving the resulting non linear system of equations we specify the pore geometry as in 13 and 14 for 13 we define the inflow and outflow boundaries as γ i i n ϵ t x y r 2 x 0 1 d ϵ 0 t y 0 γ i o u t ϵ t x y r 2 x 1 1 d ϵ 1 t y 0 for 14 the inflow and outflow boundaries are given by γ i i i n ϵ t x y r 2 x 0 1 y l d ϵ 0 t γ i i o u t ϵ t x y r 2 x 1 1 y 1 d ϵ 1 t in the following all the presented numerical results are non dimensional 6 1 two phase flow with solute dependent surface tension here we consider a numerical example of the pore scale model in section 3 1 where the regime is ca ϵ ca with ca 1 at the fluid fluid interface the surface tension coefficient is chosen as 2 with a 1 and b 1 to include the marangoni effect the diffusion coefficient is chosen as d 1 and the viscosity ratio as m 1 the initial conditions are d ϵ x t 0 0 5 at γ f f ϵ t 0 c ϵ x y t 0 0 25 in ω i i ϵ t 0 q α ϵ x y t 0 0 in ω α ϵ t 0 p α ϵ x y t 0 0 in ω α ϵ t 0 the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are p α ϵ 0 023 at γ α i n ϵ t and p α ϵ 0 at γ α o u t ϵ t c ϵ 1 at γ i i i n ϵ t and c ϵ 0 25 at γ i i o u t ϵ t compatible initial and boundary conditions are chosen by recalling the capillary pressure relation 57 to solve the upscaled model 76 the same initial and boundary conditions are chosen we use homogeneous neumann boundary conditions for d 0 at x 0 and x 1 the models are solved for a total time of t 0 1 in fig 3 4 fig 5 we have plotted the upscaled solutions of 76 together with the transversally averaged pore scale solutions in section 3 1 for four different ϵ for decreasing ϵ the averaged pore scale solutions are converging to the upscaled solutions which we also observe by calculating the l 2 norm of the difference between the solutions in table 3 6 2 two phase flow with constant surface tension here we consider a numerical example of the pore scale model in section 3 2 where the regime is ca ϵ 3 ca with ca 1 the viscosity ratio is chosen as m 1 the initial conditions are d ϵ x t 0 0 5 1 2 x 1 2 x 2 at γ ff ϵ t 0 q α ϵ x y t 0 0 in ω α ϵ t 0 p α ϵ x y t 0 0 in ω α ϵ t 0 the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are p i ϵ 0 023 at γ i i n ϵ t and p i ϵ 0 at γ i o u t ϵ t p i i ϵ 2 377 at γ i i i n ϵ t and p i i ϵ 2 4 at γ i i o u t ϵ t to avoid a non smooth behaviour of the fluids the values chosen above ensures that the initial and the boundary conditions are compatible moreover the capillary pressure relation 66 is also satisfied for t 0 to solve the upscaled model 78 the same initial and boundary conditions are chosen we use homogeneous neumann boundary conditions for d 0 at x 0 and x 1 the models are solved for a total time of t 1 in fig 6 7 fig 8 we have plotted the upscaled solutions of 78 together with the averaged pore scale solutions in section 3 2 for various ϵ at t 1 for decreasing ϵ the averaged pore scale solutions are converging to the upscaled solutions which we also see by calculating the l 2 norm of the difference between the solutions in table 4 6 3 unsaturated flow with constant surface tension the numerical computations of the pore scale model in section 3 3 are considered for the regime in ca ϵ 3 ca with ca o 1 the initial conditions are d ϵ x t 0 0 5 at γ ff ϵ t 0 q ii ϵ x y t 0 0 in ω ii ϵ t 0 p ii ϵ x y t 0 0 in ω ii ϵ t 0 the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are p i i ϵ 0 023 at γ i i i n ϵ t and p i i ϵ 0 at γ i i o u t ϵ t the initial conditions and the boundary conditions are same as for the pore scale model we use homogeneous neumann boundary conditions for d 0 at x 0 and x 1 the models are solved for a total time of t 1 in fig 9 and fig 10 we have plotted the upscaled solutions of 79 together with the averaged pore scale solutions in section 3 3 for various ϵ at t 1 for decreasing ϵ the averaged pore scale solutions are converging to the upscaled solutions which we also see by calculating the l 2 norm of the difference between the solutions in table 5 7 model comparison in section 5 we have summarized all the upscaled models derived for different capillary regimes the goal of this section is to numerically compare the upscaled models valid in the same capillary regime the upscaled model 76 includes the marangoni effect which reduces to the upscaled model 77 of the two phase flow model when the surface tension is constant or when the concentration of the solute is equally distributed on the other hand when m the upscaled model 78 of the two phase flow reduces to the unsaturated flow upscaled model 79 for this comparison we solve 78 for increasing values of m and then compare with 79 7 1 comparison of marangoni flow and two phase flow here we compare between the upscaled models in 76 and 77 where the regime is ca ϵ ca with ca 1 the initial conditions are for 0 x 1 d 0 x 0 0 5 c 0 x 0 0 50 q α 0 1 x 0 0 p α 0 x 0 p 0 x 0 0 the inflow and outflow boundary conditions for the pressures are p α 0 0 t 0 023 and p α 0 1 t 0 depending on the inflow boundary conditions for the concentration we have tested three different cases to observe the marangoni flow here the outflow boundary condition is set to the same value as the initial concentration the three different cases are case i c 0 0 t 0 25 and c 0 1 t 0 50 case ii c 0 0 t 0 50 and c 0 1 t 0 50 case iii c 0 0 t 1 00 and c 0 1 t 0 50 at the fluid fluid interface the surface tension coefficient is chosen as 2 with a 1 and b 1 to include the marangoni effect the diffusion coefficient is chosen as d 1 and the viscosity ratio as m 1 the models are solved for a total time of t 0 1 we see in fig 11 that case ii corresponds to a constant concentration and thus x γ c 0 0 we want to emphasize that this is equivalent to the case of solving the upscaled model 77 for the two phase flow with constant surface tension this case will hence not include marangoni effect due to the difference in inlet and outlet pressure both fluid velocities are small but positive through the domain accompanied by a linear pressure drop and a constant saturation as seen in fig 12 and fig 13 for case i we see in fig 11 that this corresponds to x c 0 0 which implies x γ c 0 0 oppositely case iii corresponds to x γ c 0 0 the effect on the fluid velocities pressures and saturations in fig 12 and fig 13 is evident for case i we see how the negative surface tension gradient along the strip results in overall negative velocities of both fluids through the strip this is as expected from the darcy type laws in 76 and can be interpreted as the flow going towards the lower concentration of solute and hence towards the region of larger surface tension in particular we see how the pressure distribution through the strip adjusts and hence is a convex function in case i also the saturation becomes slightly decreased near the inlet which is due to the difference in response of the two fluid velocities the opposite behaviour is seen for case iii here the negative solute concentration gradient corresponding to a positive surface tension gradient gives an increased flow in the positive direction through the strip the pressure becomes concave while the saturation near the inlet is seen to increase slightly due to the difference in fluid velocity this simple test case shows how the marangoni effect can alter the flow and mass transfer through a pore due to processes at the fluid fluid interface we see how the flow is adjusted to be towards the region of larger surface tension as is expected for marangoni flow 7 2 comparison of two phase flow and unsaturated flow here we compare between the upscaled models in 78 and 79 where the regime is ca ϵ 3 ca with ca 1 the viscosity ratio is chosen as m 1 m 5 m 10 and m 15 in 78 and compared to 79 which corresponds to letting m the initial conditions are for 0 x 1 d 0 x 0 0 5 1 2 x 1 2 x 2 q α 0 1 x 0 0 p α 0 x 0 0 the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are p i 0 0 t 0 023 and p i 0 1 t 0 p i i 0 0 t 2 377 and p i i 0 1 t 2 4 the models are solved for a total time of t 1 fig 14 and fig 15 show that the upscaled wetting phase quantities in the two phase flow model are approaching the corresponding one in the unsaturated flow model as the viscosity ratio is increasing this is confirmed in table 6 presenting the l 2 norm of the difference between the wetting phase quantities in the two phase flow model and the corresponding ones for the unsaturated flow for different values of m at t 1 observe that the differences become smaller for larger viscosity ratios we see that the behaviour of the wetting fluid is well approximated by the simpler unsaturated flow model when the viscosity ratio increases hence if the velocity and saturation of the wetting fluid is of main interest one could use the unsaturated flow model instead of the two phase flow model already for relatively moderate viscosity ratios 8 conclusion we consider the flow of two immiscible and incompressible phases respectively the unsaturated flow in a thin strip representing a porous medium we account for the possible dependence of the surface tension on the solute transported by the wetting fluid for the two phase flow the unsaturated one phase flow being similar the starting point is the model at the pore scale where the two fluids are separated by an interface having an a priori unknown location but depending on the fluid velocities the flow is described by the navier stokes equations and the solute transport by the advection diffusion equation at the interface separating the two fluids relevant interface conditions are imposed in particular the difference in the normal stress tensors depend on the surface tension which may change depending on the solute considering a simplified situation namely a thin strip representing a single pore we have derived upscaled one dimensional models describing the averaged behaviour of the system for different capillary regimes we have validated our theoretical results with numerical experiments and we then compared the behaviour of the upscaled models in doing so different situations are considered in which the capillary number and the viscosity ratio have a certain behaviour w r t the ratio of the pore width and length in particular we see that the solute dependent surface tension the marangoni effect is relevant for the upscaled models only if the capillary number is small enough in the case when the viscosity ratio becomes large the two phase flow model reduces to the unsaturated one phase model one main conclusion is that for small capillary numbers instead of capillary pressure saturation curve we obtain capillary pressure saturation dependency involving the second order derivative of the saturation as also proposed in cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 2009 mikelić 2003 mikelic and paoli 2000 based on the numerical results we emphasize that the presence of solute dependent surface tension can strongly influence the flow although considering a simple geometry combining asymptotic expansions with various scaling of the non dimensional parameters show which processes are important at the larger scale and which can be neglected the upscaling procedure also shows how the capillary pressure depends on the saturation when the capillary pressure should be accounted for allowing for other types of fluid displacement such as a fluid fluid solid contact point and more general geometries open for also other types of upscaled models credit authorship

469,quantitatively evaluating the gravity effect on spontaneous imbibition in fractured porous media is challenging due to the lack of a suitable model and the complex fracture distribution in this paper new analytical solutions for spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture with and without gravity are first derived then assuming a fractal distribution of fractures and with the tortuous plate fracture model a semianalytical model for spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into gas saturated fractured porous media is derived expressions of the wetting phase weight imbibed into fractured porous media with and without gravity are derived finally the effects of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture and core scale fractured porous media are quantitatively evaluated with the inverse bond number the research results show that our newly derived analytical solutions attain a better performance in predicting the imbibition height over time in a fracture compared with the lucas washburn model or the fries and dreyer model which has been verified with experimental data from the literature when n b 1 is smaller than 3 57 the relative error of the imbibition height in a single fracture η l s will be larger than 10 in core scale fractured porous media the relative error of the total imbibition weight η m is larger than 10 when n b c 1 is smaller

introduction spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into gas saturated porous media is an important natural phenomenon and studying its mechanism is of great significance to many engineering fields such as groundwater engineering geothermal engineering coal engineering and petroleum engineering liu et al 2017 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 for instance the successful development of shale gas reservoirs requires hydraulic fracturing and millions of tons of fracturing liquid are injected into shale formations to create artificial fracture networks however in field applications it has been reported that less than 50 of the fracturing liquid is recovered wattenbarger and alkouh 2013 and spontaneous forced imbibition is one of the reasons accounting for the low recovery of fracturing liquid backflow zhou et al 2016 studying the mechanism of imbibition of the fracturing liquid in artificial natural fracture networks and shale matrix is important for the development of shale gas reservoirs many models have been proposed to describe the spontaneous imbibition process in porous media cai et al 2014 andersen et al 2019 li et al 2019 qin and van brummelen 2019 such as the lucas washburn model lucas 1918 washburn 1921 handy model handy 1960 aronofsky model aronofsky et al 1958 li and horne model li and horne 2004 fries and dreyer model fries and dreyer 2008 and cai model cai et al 2012 2014 among them the lucas washburn model is the simplest and has been widely used to describe spontaneous flow in a capillary tube lucas 1918 washburn 1921 1 l s λ σ cos θ 4 μ τ 2 t where ls is the imbibition front λ is the capillary tube diameter σ is the interfacial tension ift between the wetting phase and gas θ is the contact angle between the wetting phase and gas μ is the viscosity of the wetting phase τ is the tortuosity and t is the imbibition time a linear relationship between l and t can be identified in the lucas washburn model schwiebert and leong 1996 derived an equation for describing viscous flow between parallel plates driven by capillary pressure but the gravity and fracture tortuosity are not considered ignoring gravity in the lucas washburn model schwiebert and leong model may lead to differences between model predictions and actual results li et al 2015 examined the criteria for applying the lucas washburn model fries and dreyer 2008 presented an analytical model for imbibition in a single capillary tube with gravity over time 2 t α β 2 ln 1 β α l s l s β where α λ σ cos θ 8 μ τ 2 β λ 2 ρ g 32 μ τ 2 ρ is the density of the wetting phase and g is the acceleration of gravity the lucas washburn and fries and dreyer models are based on the assumption that porous media are made up of bundles of capillary tubes but the mathematical model for spontaneous imbibition in fractures is rarely reported zhao et al 2019 however fractures play an extremely important role in unconventional reservoirs as the main flow channels for oil and gas between the matrix and wellbore moreover the fluid in fractures is usually described with the cubic law which is different from the hagen poiseuille equation used in the capillary tube model brabazon et al 2019 presented an analytical model for the early time spontaneous imbibition of a wetting fluid into a single gas filled fracture with fractal surfaces without considering gravity effect several experiments have been conducted to investigate the difference in spontaneous imbibition between the matrix and fractures cheng et al 2015 used neutron radiography to measure the early time imbibition front in fractured cores and found that fractures have higher sorptivities than the matrix zhao et al 2019 conducted a water imbibition experiment in fractured sandstone and discovered via neutron radiography monitoring that the imbibition fronts in the matrix and fractures do not obey the lucas washburn model the actual rock pore structure is very complicated and the fractal theory has successfully and widely been used to describe the complex pore structure and fluid flow properties in porous media yu and cheng 2002 wu and yu 2007 shao et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 many studies have demonstrated that some of the parameters of many natural porous media have fractal characteristics such as the pore diameter and fracture length and aperture barton and zoback 1992 watanabe and takahashi 1995 andrade et al 2009 jafari and babadagli 2013 liu et al 2015 miao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 2019 wang and cheng 2020 kruhl 2013 reviewed the fractal theory which has been extensively applied in complex rock structures and deemed it an attractive tool schultz et al 2008 and torabi and berg 2011 also reported that the fracture distribution has fractal characteristics when the ratio of the fracture aperture to the length is constant based on the fractal characteristics of porous media and capillary tube models many spontaneous imbibition models have been proposed based on the fractal theory li and zhao 2012 proposed a fractal prediction rate model for spontaneous imbibition by utilizing the fractal dimension as one of the parameters to characterize rocks cai et al 2012 derived an analytical model for spontaneous imbibition including gravity by assuming fractal porous media consisting of bundles of capillary tubes cai et al 2014 further recommended a generalized model of spontaneous imbibition based on the capillary bundle model with different pore shapes shi et al 2018 developed a modified capillary bundle model for spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase based on the fractal theory there are two fundamental problems that need to be solved for studying spontaneous imbibition in fractures first there are no specific equations for describing spontaneous imbibition in fractures previous studies usually use the lucas washburn model to describe the flow in fractures by replacing the capillary tube diameter in eq 1 with the fracture aperture cheng et al 2015 but the flow equations describing the flow rate in a capillary tube and a fracture are different the hagen poiseuille equation is usually used to describe the flow rate in a capillary tube but the flow rate in a fracture is usually described with the cubic law simply applying the lucas washburn model to describe spontaneous imbibition may lead to errors the second problem is that the gravity effect on spontaneous imbibition in fractures is unclear gravity is usually ignored at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition hay et al 2008 this may be reasonable for the capillary tube model but for fractures with large apertures ignoring gravity can reduce the imbibition rate and over time the reduction in imbibition rate will become more significant however for spontaneous imbibition in fractured porous media the critical condition where gravity must be considered remains uncertain the main objectives of this paper are to i derive new analytical solutions for spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture with and without gravity and compare them with the fries and dreyer model and lucas washburn model which are commonly used for the capillary tube model and ii propose a novel method for quantitatively evaluating the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical fracture and fractured porous media 2 model description mathematical models of spontaneous wetting phase imbibition into gas saturated fractured porous media are introduced first the fracture distribution is characterized with the fractal theory then based on imbibition in a single fracture core scale imbibition models with and without gravity are derived a schematic view of spontaneous imbibition in a fractured core sample is shown in fig 1 the following assumptions are made before the model is derived fractured porous media are assumed to consist of bundles of tortuous plate fractures without intersection the fracture length obeys the fractal distribution and the ratio of the fracture aperture to the fracture length is the same for every fracture the fluid is a newtonian fluid and flow in the fractures can be described with the cubic law while concurrent imbibition occurs the effects of the gas viscosity and density on spontaneous imbibition are negligible there is no spontaneous imbibition of the wetting fluid into the matrix from the fracture fracture is parallel to the gravity direction and fracture heights are all the same and are equal to the height of the core sample 2 1 the distribution of fractures characterized with the fractal theory the fracture distribution is an important subject in fracture research as discussed in the introduction the fractal distribution of fractures has been demonstrated in the literature we deduce the fracture distribution function based on the fractal theory as shown in fig 2 there are numerous natural fractures inside the core sample and the fractures in a representative area au of the core sample cross section are studied it is assumed that the ratio of the fracture aperture to the fracture length n is the same for every fracture and can be described as follows hatton et al 1994 3 a n l where a is the fracture aperture and l is the fracture length it is assumed that the fracture length distribution obeys the fractal scaling law and the cumulative number of fractures in the representative area au can be expressed as miao et al 2015 4 n l ζ l max l d f where n l ζ is the number of fractures with a fracture length larger than ζ l max is the maximum fracture length and df is the fractal dimension which is 0 df 2 in two dimensional space or 0 df 3 in three dimensional space in this paper the fractal dimension in two dimensional space is used because it reflects the characteristics of the fracture distribution in the core sample cross section assuming eq 4 is continuous and differentiable the number of fractures with fracture lengths ranging from l to l d l can be expressed as yu and cheng 2002 5 d n l d f l max d f l d f 1 d l the total pore area of the fractures ap in the representative area au can be calculated by 6 a p l min l max a l d n n d f l max 2 2 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f the representative area au can be expressed in terms of ap as 7 a u a p ϕ f n d f l max 2 2 d f ϕ f 1 l min l max 2 d f where ϕ f is the fracture porosity then the total number of fractures in the core sample cross section af can be calculated as cai et al 2012 8 n f l a f a u n a f a u l max l d f a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f d f ϕ f 1 l min l max 2 d f l d f where af is the core sample cross sectional area nf l is the total number of fractures with a fracture length larger than l in the cross sectional area af and l min is the minimum fracture length differentiating eq 8 with respect to l the number of fractures with a fracture length ranging from l to l dlin area af can be obtained as 9 d n f a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f 1 l min l max 2 d f l d f 1 d l according to eq 8 the incremental number of fractures n l can be calculated as 10 n l n f l n f l δ l a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l d f l δ l d f where nf l and nf l δl are the total numbers of fractures with fracture lengths larger than l and l δl respectively and δlis the length interval 2 2 spontaneous imbibition in a vertical tortuous single fracture according to the cubic law nazridoust et al 2006 the flow rate of spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture shown in fig 3 can be expressed as 11 q a 3 l 12 μ l f 2 σ cos θ n l ρ g l s where q is the imbibition rate in a single fracture lf is the tortuous length of the imbibition front ls is the height of the imbibition front μ is the viscosity of the wetting phase liquid ρ is the liquid density g is the acceleration of gravity σ is ift between witting phase and gas and θ is the contact angle for liquid wet fractures the range of contact angle is 0 θ 90 and we assume that θ is constant during imbibition process the term ρgls in eq 11 is the weight of the wetting phase liquid and the minus sign in front indicates that gravity inhibits spontaneous imbibition and opposes the capillary force as the flow rate in a single fracture can be expressed as q a l d l f d t the movement velocity of imbibition front d l f d t can be derived from eq 11 as 12 d l f d t a 2 12 μ l f 2 σ cos θ a ρ g l s the tortuous fracture height lf can be expressed in terms of the straight fracture height ls as childs 1972 13 l f τ l s where τ is the fracture tortuosity substituting eq 13 into eq 12 yields 14 d l s d t a 2 12 μ τ 2 l s 2 σ cos θ a ρ g l s eq 14 can be rewritten as 15 l s d l s a σ cos θ 6 μ τ 2 a 2 ρ g l s 12 μ τ 2 d t 2 3 spontaneous imbibition model without gravity when gravity is neglected eq 15 can be written as 16 l s d l s a σ cos θ 6 μ τ 2 d t then the imbibition height ls in a single tortuous fracture without gravity can be obtained as 17 l s a σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t the imbibition height ls is proportional to the square root of time t which is the same as eq 1 however there is a notable difference between eqs 1 and 17 in a capillary tube ls is proportional to λ 4 but in a fracture ls is proportional to a 3 therefore predicting spontaneous imbibition in a fracture with the lucas washburn model by replacing the pore diameter λ with the fracture aperture a will cause errors which will be discussed in detail in the model validation section it should be noted that schwiebert and leong 1996 derived a similar equation but tortuosity was not considered in their model when τ 1 eq 17 can be reduced to schwiebert and leong model eq 17 shows that the larger the fracture aperture is the larger the imbibition height will be for the same imbibition time indicating that large fractures result in a higher imbibition rate the imbibition weight m in imbibition time t can be calculated as 18 m ρ l a a σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t when the imbibition time is long enough the wetting phase will completely occupy the fracture volume as a function of the capillary force the total liquid imbibition weight in a single fracture can be expressed as 19 m e q ρ l a τ h where h is the fracture height meq is the final imbibition weight and m meq for a given imbibition time t the total imbibition weight in fractured porous media equals the sum of the imbibition weights in two fractures of different sizes in large fractures where the spontaneous imbibition process has finished due to the high imbibition rate the imbibition weight can be calculated as 20 m e q l m e q n l ρ l i a i τ h a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f where n l is the fracture number with the fracture length ranging from li to li δl in small fractures where the spontaneous imbibition process is ongoing the imbibition weight can be calculated as 21 m i l m i n l l i ρ a i 3 σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f the total imbibition weight equals the sum of the imbibition weight in these two parts 22 m l i l min l i l c m i l i l i l c l i l max m e q l i l i l min l i l c l i ρ a i 3 σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t a f n l max 2 d

where spontaneous imbibition has just finished it can be determined as 23 l c a c n 3 μ τ 2 h 2 n σ t cos θ where ac is the critical fracture aperture where imbibition has just finished within imbibition time t 2 4 spontaneous imbibition model with gravity for fractures with large apertures the effect of gravity on fluid imbibition cannot be neglected at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition with the increase in imbibition height the weight of the wetting phase increases and the imbibition process ends when gravity equals the capillary force the two constants in eq 15 are defined as follows 24 a a σ cos θ 6 μ τ 2 25 b a 2 ρ g 12 μ τ 2 then eq 15 can be rearranged as 26 l s d l s a b l s d t the imbibition time t for a given imbibition distance ls can be obtained by integrating dt in eq 26 as 27 t a b 2 ln 1 b a l s l s b eq 27 is the implicit analytical form of the imbibition height of the wetting phase fluid in a single fracture although eq 27 has the same form as eq 2 their coefficients are substantially different as the fracture and capillary tube have different pore structures and the flow equations are different eq 27 is an implicit expression that can cause difficulties in subsequent calculations similar to the method proposed by fries and dreyer 2008 the lambert function w x is introduced to derive the explicit solution of eq 27 as 28 l s t a b 1 w e 1 b 2 a t eq 28 is the explicit analytical expression of the imbibition height for a given imbibition time the w x function can be approximately calculated by the following equation fries and dreyer 2008 29 w x 2 e x 10 7036 7 56859 2 2 e x 12 7036 5 13501 2 2 e x e 1 x 0 where e is euler s number the analytical expressions for spontaneous imbibition in a capillary tube with gravity are the same as eqs 27 and 28 but the coefficients are different to verify the accuracy of the explicit analytical expression the imbibition height calculated by eq 28 is compared with the result calculated by eq 27 as shown in fig 4 the curve of the imbibition height versus time obtained by eq 28 is identical to the curve obtained by eq 27 indicating that the full analytical expression of the imbibition height is valid when the tilt angle between fracture and horizontal line α is considered the forms of implicit and full analytical expressions are the same as those of eqs 27 and 28 but the constant b should be defined as b a 2 ρ g sin α 12 μ τ 2 the detailed derivation process can be found in appendix when α 0 the analytical expression can be reduced to eq 17 the imbibition weight m in a single tortuous fracture with gravity can be expressed as 30 m ρ a l s τ ρ a l τ a b 1 w e 1 b 2 a t where the imbibition height does not exceed the core height i e ls h eq 26 can also be rearranged as follows 31 d l s d t a l s b when ls reaches its highest value i e d l s d t 0 the equilibrium height le can be calculated as fries and dreyer 2008 cai et al 2012 32 l e a b 2 σ cos θ a ρ g as the end time of imbibition is close to infinity when submitting ls le into eq 27 usually it can be considered that the spontaneous imbibition process has already finished when ls 0 99le fries and dreyer 2008 cai et al 2012 substituting ls 0 99le into eq 27 the end time of imbibition trc can be calculated as 33 t r c 3 62 a b 2 3 62 l e b 86 88 μ τ 2 σ cos θ a 3 ρ 2 g 2 as shown in fig 5 when the fracture aperture is reduced from 100 to 1 μm the equilibrium height increases from 0 12 to 12 25 m while the corresponding end time of spontaneous imbibition increases from 102 to 108 s which is a difference of 6 orders of magnitude although the final imbibition equilibrium height in small fractures can be very large the imbibition time required is very long the total imbibition rate in a core sample with gravity consists of two parts the imbibition process tends to reach the equilibrium state in large fractures due to the high imbibition rate in this case according to eqs 10 and 32 the imbibition weight in these fractures can be calculated as 34 m i e q l m i d n f ρ l i a i τ l e a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f in small fractures where spontaneous imbibition is ongoing the imbibition weight can be calculated as 35 m i g l m i d n f ρ a i l i τ a b 1 w e 1 b 2 a t a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f the total imbibition weight can be obtained by summing the imbibition weights of these two parts 36 m l i l min l i l c m i g l i l i l c l i l max m e q l i l i l min l i l c ρ a i l i τ a b 1 w e

the semianalytical model for spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into fractured porous media with gravity it should be noted that there is an implicit condition whereby ls h eq 36 can be calculated numerically and the program flowchart is shown in fig 6 3 model validation experimental data from the literature are used to validate our model as shown in fig 7 zhao et al 2019 experimentally measured water imbibition in fractured sandstone and the wetting front in a vertical fracture was monitored by neutron radiography the parameters of the fracture and fluid used in their experiment are listed in table 1 zhao et al 2019 also proposed an empirical model to predict the wetting front in the fracture and matrix as ls 39 61t 0 38 to verify the proposed model in this study the imbibition height over time in a fracture is predicted with eq 28 and compared with the experimental data and the parameters used are the same as those provided by zhao et al 2019 in addition eq 1 the lucas washburn model without gravity and eq 2 the fries and dreyer model with gravity are also implemented to predict the imbibition height over time and the diameter λ in eqs 1 and 2 is replaced with the fracture aperture a the empirical model proposed by zhao et al 2019 is also plotted in the same figure as shown in fig 8 compared with the other three models the results of our new model eq 28 are the closest to the experimental data at the late stage of spontaneous imbibition when the imbibition time is shorter than 0 5 s the predicted imbibition heights are slightly larger than the experimental heights which may be caused by the loss of water into the matrix around the fracture in addition the roughness of the fracture and a variable fracture aperture can also lead to prediction errors the experimental results demonstrate that the imbibition height tends to stabilize after 0 6 s because the imbibition height approaches the equilibrium height where the capillary pressure becomes equivalent to the gravity when gravity is considered the prediction results obtained with eqs 1 and 2 are different from the experimental results as the lucas washburn and fries and dreyer models were developed for predicting spontaneous imbibition in capillary tubes rather than in fractures proving that spontaneous imbibition in fractures is different from that in capillary tubes the imbibition height predicted by the empirical model proposed by zhao et al 2019 continuously increases at the late stage and does not exactly match the experimental data compared with the empirical model proposed by zhao et al 2019 the main advantage of our model is that there are no empirical parameters in eq 28 and each parameter in the model has a clear physical meaning the imbibition heights in the sandstone matrix were also measured in previous experiments zhao et al 2019 assuming a sandstone matrix consisting of bundles of capillary tubes with the same diameter the imbibition heights over time in a single capillary tube with and without gravity can be predicted with eqs 2 and 1 respectively according to zhao et al 2019 the diameter of the flow channels in the sandstone matrix ranges from 5 to 13 μm therefore the imbibition height in capillary tubes with diameters of 5 and 13 μm was predicted fig 9 shows that the data points of the measured imbibition heights over time are within the region between the curves of the imbibition height over time for λ 5 and 13 μm in addition gravity has no influence on spontaneous imbibition in the matrix at the initial stage of spontaneous imbibition clearly compared with the spontaneous imbibition results in the fracture eqs 1 and 2 perform better in predicting spontaneous imbibition in the matrix therefore the spontaneous imbibition models for the matrix and fractures should be different although the new spontaneous imbibition models for a fracture eqs 17 and 27 proposed in this paper have the same form as eqs 1 and 2 they are actually quite different eqs 1 and 2 cannot be used to predict spontaneous imbibition in a fracture and our new models have a higher prediction performance 4 the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical tortuous fracture the effects of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single tortuous fracture are shown in fig 10 gravity has almost no effect on the imbibition height in the fracture with an aperture of 10 μm in the first 1000s but the difference in imbibition height with and without gravity increases with increasing fracture aperture for instance when a 389 μm the imbibition height with gravity is smaller than that without gravity and the difference can clearly be observed even at 0 01 s after 0 7 s the increase in imbibition height with gravity can be ignored and the final equilibrium height is 36 36 mm the effect of gravity on the fracture imbibition front in fig 7 must be considered at the initial stage of spontaneous imbibition the imbibition height is linearly related to time with a slope of 0 5 in the log log plot with increasing imbibition time gravity gradually affects spontaneous imbibition and the curve of the imbibition height over time deviates from the straight line and finally stabilizes the bond number is commonly used to evaluate the gravity and capillary forces during spontaneous imbibition schechter et al 1994 the inverse bond number n b 1 is defined as the ratio of the capillary force to gravity for quantitatively evaluating the gravity effect on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical fracture 37 n b 1 2 σ cos θ a ρ g l s the smaller n b 1 is the larger the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition is n b 1 is time dependent and decreases with increasing ls until gravity equals the capillary pressure which occurs at n b 1 1 the relative reduction in imbibition height η l s is defined to quantitatively evaluate the gravity effect on the imbibition height as 38 η l s l s without gravity l s with gravity l s without gravity where ls withoutgravity is the imbibition height without gravity calculated with eq 17 and ls withgravity is the imbibition height with gravity calculated with eq 28 the larger η l s is the larger the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition is figs 11 and 12 reveal that the curve of η l s versus n b 1 is independent of the fracture aperture contact angle and ift which can be used as a diagnostic plot to quantitatively evaluate the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition generally log η l s is linearly and negatively correlated with log n b 1 but η l s sharply decreases at approximately n b 1 1 the value of η l s at n b 1 1 is approximately 80 and when n b 1 increases from 1 to 1 96 η l s decreases significantly from 80 to 10 when n b 1 is larger than 32 86 η l s is smaller than 1 which means that the gravity effect can be ignored table 2 lists the value of n b 1 for different η l s values based on the required modeling accuracy and the correlation between n b 1 and η l s identified before the critical time imbibition height when where the gravity effect should be considered can be determined according to eq 37 the critical imbibition height lsc where gravity should be considered can be expressed as 39 l s c 2 σ cos θ a ρ g n b 1 substituting eq 39 into eq 17 the critical time tc when gravity should be considered can be calculated as 40 t c 12 μ τ 2 σ cos θ a 3 ρ 2 g 2 n b 1 2 fig 13 reveals that tc and lsc decrease logarithmically with increasing fracture aperture as η l s increases tc and lsc increase taking a 50 μm as an example at t 1 55 s η l s is larger than 5 and lsc is only 0 04 m for a large fracture such as for a 100 μm only after 0 2 s η l s becomes larger than 5 therefore for fractures with large apertures the gravity effect should be considered even at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition 5 the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media according to the cubic law and eq 7 the total flow rate q for a core with a height of h can be obtained by summarizing the flow rate in every fracture as 41 q l min l max q d n f n 2 l max 2 ϕ f δ p a f 12 μ h 2 d f 4 d f 1 l min l max 4 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f according to darcy s law the total flow rate can be expressed as 42 q k a f δ p μ h combining eqs 41 and 42 the permeability of a fractured core sample can be expressed as 43 k n 2 ϕ f l max 2 12 2 d f 4 d f 1 l min l max 4 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f fractured porous media with a variable fracture aperture can be represented as a series of fractures with the same aperture size whose permeability can be expressed as chen et al 1999 44 k ϕ f l e a e 2 12 ϕ f n 2 l e 2 12 where ae is the equivalent fracture aperture le is the equivalent fracture length and ae nle then the equivalent fracture aperture ae can be calculated as follows 45 a e n l e l max 2 2 d f 4 d f 1 l min l max 4 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f the imbibition heights in fractures with different apertures are different the average imbibition height lse is calculated to evaluate the core scale weight of the wetting phase which can be calculated as 46 l s e m m max h where m is the imbibition weight at imbibition time t h is the core height and m max is the maximum imbibition weight which can be calculated from the total pore volume of the core sample as 47 m max π d 2 4 h ϕ f ρ with the effective fracture aperture ae and the average imbibition height lse the core scale inverse bond number n b c 1 is defined as 48 n b c 1 2 σ cos θ a e ρ g l s e as lse increases during the spontaneous imbibition process until the end the core scale n b c 1 is also dependent on time the relative reduction in the imbibition weight η m is defined to evaluate the effect of gravity on the imbibition weight as 49 η m m without gravity m with gravity m without gravity where m withoutgravity is the imbibition weight of the core sample without gravity which can be calculated with eq 22 and m withgravity is the imbibition weight of the core sample with gravity which can be calculated with eq 36 several case studies are conducted to investigate the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media the parameters of the fluid and core samples are summarized in table 3 as shown in fig 14 at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition t 103 s the effect of gravity on the imbibition weight is insignificant for t 103 s the differences in imbibition weight between core samples with different h increase when h 0 5 m the curves of the imbibition weight over time with and without gravity almost coincide which implies that gravity can be ignored when h is small enough as h increases the gravity effect increases and the final imbibition weight with gravity is smaller than that without gravity the reason is that the equilibrium height le of a large fracture is smaller than the core height h when the gravity and capillary pressure attain equilibrium as shown in fig 15 when gravity is ignored the final water saturation can reach 1 which means that water can fill all the fractures when gravity is considered the final water saturation decreases from 1 to 0 85 as h increases from 0 5 m to 2 m for the core sample with h 0 5 m although the final water saturation can reach 1 the curves of the water saturation over time with and without gravity do not exactly coincide between 102 and 103 s as gravity reduces the imbibition rate as the equilibrium height of a large fracture exceeds 0 5 m the final water saturation approaches 1 however for the core samples with h 1 and 2 m the equilibrium heights of the large fractures are smaller than h and the final water saturation does not reach 1 as shown in fig 16 the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media can be quantitatively evaluated with the log log plot of η m versus n b c 1 the curve of η m versus n b c 1 can be divided into two segments at a large n b c 1 log η m is linearly and negatively correlated with log n b c 1 which means that as n b c 1 decreases the gravity effect increases until η m reaches its maximum value then η m decreases with decreasing n b c 1 which indicates that the relative reduction in imbibition weight due to the gravity effect decreases as mentioned above this phenomenon occurs due to the core height being limited and the imbibition front already reaches the core height before the equilibrium height is achieved the larger h is the smaller n b c 1 is where the maximum η m is attained for instance as h increases from 0 5 to 2 m the maximum η m increases from 11 49 to 35 61 the curve of η m versus n b c 1 for h 100 m is also plotted the figure shows that η m continuously increases even as n b c 1 is reduced to 1 and the straight line of log η m log n b c 1 coincides with the other curves of η m versus n b c 1 for different h values table 4 lists the values of n b c 1 for different η m values in the linear part of the curve of η m versus n b c 1 when n b c 1 is smaller than 8 8 η m will exceed 10 therefore the curve of η m versus n b c 1 can be used as a diagnostic plot for quantitatively evaluating the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media for fractured porous media the critical time when the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition must be considered can be determined the value of n b c 1 can be determined for a given η m according to fig 15 and the average imbibition height lse can then be calculated with eq 46 as 50 l s e 2 σ cos θ a e ρ g n b c 1 therefore the total imbibition weight m at this time can be calculated according to eq 46 and the corresponding imbibition time can then be obtained fig 17 demonstrates that the smaller the fracture length is the longer the required imbibition time to attain equilibrium will be the final total imbibition weight in small fractures is larger than that in large fractures due to the larger number of small fractures as shown in fig 18 the imbibition weight increases with increasing fracture length n the reason this occurs is that when the fracture length remains fixed the increase in n results in an increase in the fracture aperture fractures with large apertures experience high imbibition rates at n 0 01 the imbibition weight considering gravity is close to that without considering gravity this indicates that gravity has little effect on the imbibition weight for fractures with small apertures as n increases from 0 01 to 0 05 the differences between the imbibition weights with and without gravity become more significant as the gravity effect becomes more pronounced with increasing fracture aperture 6 conclusions a model for the concurrent spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into gas saturated fractured porous media is derived based on the tortuous plate fracture model with the fractal theory the expressions for the cumulative imbibition weight with the imbibition time with and without gravity are derived the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture and core scale fractured porous media is quantitatively evaluated with the inverse bond number the main conclusions include the following the lucas washburn and fries and dreyer models cannot be directly used to predict spontaneous imbibition in fractures by simply replacing the pore diameter with the fracture aperture as this can lead to significant prediction errors new spontaneous imbibition models for predicting the imbibition height over time in a single fracture with and without gravity have been proposed in this paper although they have the same form as the spontaneous imbibition models in a capillary tube the coefficients are different the experimental data from the literature demonstrate that our model can accurately predict spontaneous imbibition in a fracture the dimensionless plot of n b 1 versus η l s can be used as a diagnostic plot for quantitively evaluating the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical fracture except for a sharp decrease in η l s at approximately n b 1 1 η l s decreases almost linearly with increasing n b 1 in a log log plot as n b 1 decreases from 3 57 to 1 the relative reduction in the imbibition height due to gravity increases from 10 to 80 the critical time when the gravity effect should be considered can be determined with the curve of n b 1 versus η l s for fractures with large apertures the gravity effect should be considered even at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media can be quantitatively evaluated with the log log plot of n b c 1 versus η m where η m increases almost linearly with decreasing n b c 1 until the maximum value is reached due to the limitation of the core height and then η m decreases with decreasing n b c 1 the larger the core height is the smaller n b c 1 is at which the maximum η m is observed in the absence of core height limitations with n b c 1 decreasing from 8 8 to 1 43 the relative reduction in the imbibition weight due to the gravity effect will increase from 10 to 50 credit authorship contribution statement fuyong wang conceptualization methodology writing review editing hui cheng visualization

469,quantitatively evaluating the gravity effect on spontaneous imbibition in fractured porous media is challenging due to the lack of a suitable model and the complex fracture distribution in this paper new analytical solutions for spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture with and without gravity are first derived then assuming a fractal distribution of fractures and with the tortuous plate fracture model a semianalytical model for spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into gas saturated fractured porous media is derived expressions of the wetting phase weight imbibed into fractured porous media with and without gravity are derived finally the effects of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture and core scale fractured porous media are quantitatively evaluated with the inverse bond number the research results show that our newly derived analytical solutions attain a better performance in predicting the imbibition height over time in a fracture compared with the lucas washburn model or the fries and dreyer model which has been verified with experimental data from the literature when n b 1 is smaller than 3 57 the relative error of the imbibition height in a single fracture η l s will be larger than 10 in core scale fractured porous media the relative error of the total imbibition weight η m is larger than 10 when n b c 1 is smaller

introduction spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into gas saturated porous media is an important natural phenomenon and studying its mechanism is of great significance to many engineering fields such as groundwater engineering geothermal engineering coal engineering and petroleum engineering liu et al 2017 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 for instance the successful development of shale gas reservoirs requires hydraulic fracturing and millions of tons of fracturing liquid are injected into shale formations to create artificial fracture networks however in field applications it has been reported that less than 50 of the fracturing liquid is recovered wattenbarger and alkouh 2013 and spontaneous forced imbibition is one of the reasons accounting for the low recovery of fracturing liquid backflow zhou et al 2016 studying the mechanism of imbibition of the fracturing liquid in artificial natural fracture networks and shale matrix is important for the development of shale gas reservoirs many models have been proposed to describe the spontaneous imbibition process in porous media cai et al 2014 andersen et al 2019 li et al 2019 qin and van brummelen 2019 such as the lucas washburn model lucas 1918 washburn 1921 handy model handy 1960 aronofsky model aronofsky et al 1958 li and horne model li and horne 2004 fries and dreyer model fries and dreyer 2008 and cai model cai et al 2012 2014 among them the lucas washburn model is the simplest and has been widely used to describe spontaneous flow in a capillary tube lucas 1918 washburn 1921 1 l s λ σ cos θ 4 μ τ 2 t where ls is the imbibition front λ is the capillary tube diameter σ is the interfacial tension ift between the wetting phase and gas θ is the contact angle between the wetting phase and gas μ is the viscosity of the wetting phase τ is the tortuosity and t is the imbibition time a linear relationship between l and t can be identified in the lucas washburn model schwiebert and leong 1996 derived an equation for describing viscous flow between parallel plates driven by capillary pressure but the gravity and fracture tortuosity are not considered ignoring gravity in the lucas washburn model schwiebert and leong model may lead to differences between model predictions and actual results li et al 2015 examined the criteria for applying the lucas washburn model fries and dreyer 2008 presented an analytical model for imbibition in a single capillary tube with gravity over time 2 t α β 2 ln 1 β α l s l s β where α λ σ cos θ 8 μ τ 2 β λ 2 ρ g 32 μ τ 2 ρ is the density of the wetting phase and g is the acceleration of gravity the lucas washburn and fries and dreyer models are based on the assumption that porous media are made up of bundles of capillary tubes but the mathematical model for spontaneous imbibition in fractures is rarely reported zhao et al 2019 however fractures play an extremely important role in unconventional reservoirs as the main flow channels for oil and gas between the matrix and wellbore moreover the fluid in fractures is usually described with the cubic law which is different from the hagen poiseuille equation used in the capillary tube model brabazon et al 2019 presented an analytical model for the early time spontaneous imbibition of a wetting fluid into a single gas filled fracture with fractal surfaces without considering gravity effect several experiments have been conducted to investigate the difference in spontaneous imbibition between the matrix and fractures cheng et al 2015 used neutron radiography to measure the early time imbibition front in fractured cores and found that fractures have higher sorptivities than the matrix zhao et al 2019 conducted a water imbibition experiment in fractured sandstone and discovered via neutron radiography monitoring that the imbibition fronts in the matrix and fractures do not obey the lucas washburn model the actual rock pore structure is very complicated and the fractal theory has successfully and widely been used to describe the complex pore structure and fluid flow properties in porous media yu and cheng 2002 wu and yu 2007 shao et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 many studies have demonstrated that some of the parameters of many natural porous media have fractal characteristics such as the pore diameter and fracture length and aperture barton and zoback 1992 watanabe and takahashi 1995 andrade et al 2009 jafari and babadagli 2013 liu et al 2015 miao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 2019 wang and cheng 2020 kruhl 2013 reviewed the fractal theory which has been extensively applied in complex rock structures and deemed it an attractive tool schultz et al 2008 and torabi and berg 2011 also reported that the fracture distribution has fractal characteristics when the ratio of the fracture aperture to the length is constant based on the fractal characteristics of porous media and capillary tube models many spontaneous imbibition models have been proposed based on the fractal theory li and zhao 2012 proposed a fractal prediction rate model for spontaneous imbibition by utilizing the fractal dimension as one of the parameters to characterize rocks cai et al 2012 derived an analytical model for spontaneous imbibition including gravity by assuming fractal porous media consisting of bundles of capillary tubes cai et al 2014 further recommended a generalized model of spontaneous imbibition based on the capillary bundle model with different pore shapes shi et al 2018 developed a modified capillary bundle model for spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase based on the fractal theory there are two fundamental problems that need to be solved for studying spontaneous imbibition in fractures first there are no specific equations for describing spontaneous imbibition in fractures previous studies usually use the lucas washburn model to describe the flow in fractures by replacing the capillary tube diameter in eq 1 with the fracture aperture cheng et al 2015 but the flow equations describing the flow rate in a capillary tube and a fracture are different the hagen poiseuille equation is usually used to describe the flow rate in a capillary tube but the flow rate in a fracture is usually described with the cubic law simply applying the lucas washburn model to describe spontaneous imbibition may lead to errors the second problem is that the gravity effect on spontaneous imbibition in fractures is unclear gravity is usually ignored at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition hay et al 2008 this may be reasonable for the capillary tube model but for fractures with large apertures ignoring gravity can reduce the imbibition rate and over time the reduction in imbibition rate will become more significant however for spontaneous imbibition in fractured porous media the critical condition where gravity must be considered remains uncertain the main objectives of this paper are to i derive new analytical solutions for spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture with and without gravity and compare them with the fries and dreyer model and lucas washburn model which are commonly used for the capillary tube model and ii propose a novel method for quantitatively evaluating the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical fracture and fractured porous media 2 model description mathematical models of spontaneous wetting phase imbibition into gas saturated fractured porous media are introduced first the fracture distribution is characterized with the fractal theory then based on imbibition in a single fracture core scale imbibition models with and without gravity are derived a schematic view of spontaneous imbibition in a fractured core sample is shown in fig 1 the following assumptions are made before the model is derived fractured porous media are assumed to consist of bundles of tortuous plate fractures without intersection the fracture length obeys the fractal distribution and the ratio of the fracture aperture to the fracture length is the same for every fracture the fluid is a newtonian fluid and flow in the fractures can be described with the cubic law while concurrent imbibition occurs the effects of the gas viscosity and density on spontaneous imbibition are negligible there is no spontaneous imbibition of the wetting fluid into the matrix from the fracture fracture is parallel to the gravity direction and fracture heights are all the same and are equal to the height of the core sample 2 1 the distribution of fractures characterized with the fractal theory the fracture distribution is an important subject in fracture research as discussed in the introduction the fractal distribution of fractures has been demonstrated in the literature we deduce the fracture distribution function based on the fractal theory as shown in fig 2 there are numerous natural fractures inside the core sample and the fractures in a representative area au of the core sample cross section are studied it is assumed that the ratio of the fracture aperture to the fracture length n is the same for every fracture and can be described as follows hatton et al 1994 3 a n l where a is the fracture aperture and l is the fracture length it is assumed that the fracture length distribution obeys the fractal scaling law and the cumulative number of fractures in the representative area au can be expressed as miao et al 2015 4 n l ζ l max l d f where n l ζ is the number of fractures with a fracture length larger than ζ l max is the maximum fracture length and df is the fractal dimension which is 0 df 2 in two dimensional space or 0 df 3 in three dimensional space in this paper the fractal dimension in two dimensional space is used because it reflects the characteristics of the fracture distribution in the core sample cross section assuming eq 4 is continuous and differentiable the number of fractures with fracture lengths ranging from l to l d l can be expressed as yu and cheng 2002 5 d n l d f l max d f l d f 1 d l the total pore area of the fractures ap in the representative area au can be calculated by 6 a p l min l max a l d n n d f l max 2 2 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f the representative area au can be expressed in terms of ap as 7 a u a p ϕ f n d f l max 2 2 d f ϕ f 1 l min l max 2 d f where ϕ f is the fracture porosity then the total number of fractures in the core sample cross section af can be calculated as cai et al 2012 8 n f l a f a u n a f a u l max l d f a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f d f ϕ f 1 l min l max 2 d f l d f where af is the core sample cross sectional area nf l is the total number of fractures with a fracture length larger than l in the cross sectional area af and l min is the minimum fracture length differentiating eq 8 with respect to l the number of fractures with a fracture length ranging from l to l dlin area af can be obtained as 9 d n f a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f 1 l min l max 2 d f l d f 1 d l according to eq 8 the incremental number of fractures n l can be calculated as 10 n l n f l n f l δ l a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l d f l δ l d f where nf l and nf l δl are the total numbers of fractures with fracture lengths larger than l and l δl respectively and δlis the length interval 2 2 spontaneous imbibition in a vertical tortuous single fracture according to the cubic law nazridoust et al 2006 the flow rate of spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture shown in fig 3 can be expressed as 11 q a 3 l 12 μ l f 2 σ cos θ n l ρ g l s where q is the imbibition rate in a single fracture lf is the tortuous length of the imbibition front ls is the height of the imbibition front μ is the viscosity of the wetting phase liquid ρ is the liquid density g is the acceleration of gravity σ is ift between witting phase and gas and θ is the contact angle for liquid wet fractures the range of contact angle is 0 θ 90 and we assume that θ is constant during imbibition process the term ρgls in eq 11 is the weight of the wetting phase liquid and the minus sign in front indicates that gravity inhibits spontaneous imbibition and opposes the capillary force as the flow rate in a single fracture can be expressed as q a l d l f d t the movement velocity of imbibition front d l f d t can be derived from eq 11 as 12 d l f d t a 2 12 μ l f 2 σ cos θ a ρ g l s the tortuous fracture height lf can be expressed in terms of the straight fracture height ls as childs 1972 13 l f τ l s where τ is the fracture tortuosity substituting eq 13 into eq 12 yields 14 d l s d t a 2 12 μ τ 2 l s 2 σ cos θ a ρ g l s eq 14 can be rewritten as 15 l s d l s a σ cos θ 6 μ τ 2 a 2 ρ g l s 12 μ τ 2 d t 2 3 spontaneous imbibition model without gravity when gravity is neglected eq 15 can be written as 16 l s d l s a σ cos θ 6 μ τ 2 d t then the imbibition height ls in a single tortuous fracture without gravity can be obtained as 17 l s a σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t the imbibition height ls is proportional to the square root of time t which is the same as eq 1 however there is a notable difference between eqs 1 and 17 in a capillary tube ls is proportional to λ 4 but in a fracture ls is proportional to a 3 therefore predicting spontaneous imbibition in a fracture with the lucas washburn model by replacing the pore diameter λ with the fracture aperture a will cause errors which will be discussed in detail in the model validation section it should be noted that schwiebert and leong 1996 derived a similar equation but tortuosity was not considered in their model when τ 1 eq 17 can be reduced to schwiebert and leong model eq 17 shows that the larger the fracture aperture is the larger the imbibition height will be for the same imbibition time indicating that large fractures result in a higher imbibition rate the imbibition weight m in imbibition time t can be calculated as 18 m ρ l a a σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t when the imbibition time is long enough the wetting phase will completely occupy the fracture volume as a function of the capillary force the total liquid imbibition weight in a single fracture can be expressed as 19 m e q ρ l a τ h where h is the fracture height meq is the final imbibition weight and m meq for a given imbibition time t the total imbibition weight in fractured porous media equals the sum of the imbibition weights in two fractures of different sizes in large fractures where the spontaneous imbibition process has finished due to the high imbibition rate the imbibition weight can be calculated as 20 m e q l m e q n l ρ l i a i τ h a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f where n l is the fracture number with the fracture length ranging from li to li δl in small fractures where the spontaneous imbibition process is ongoing the imbibition weight can be calculated as 21 m i l m i n l l i ρ a i 3 σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f the total imbibition weight equals the sum of the imbibition weight in these two parts 22 m l i l min l i l c m i l i l i l c l i l max m e q l i l i l min l i l c l i ρ a i 3 σ cos θ 3 μ τ 2 t a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f l i l c l i l max ρ l i a i τ h a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f where lc is the critical fracture length where spontaneous imbibition has just finished it can be determined as 23 l c a c n 3 μ τ 2 h 2 n σ t cos θ where ac is the critical fracture aperture where imbibition has just finished within imbibition time t 2 4 spontaneous imbibition model with gravity for fractures with large apertures the effect of gravity on fluid imbibition cannot be neglected at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition with the increase in imbibition height the weight of the wetting phase increases and the imbibition process ends when gravity equals the capillary force the two constants in eq 15 are defined as follows 24 a a σ cos θ 6 μ τ 2 25 b a 2 ρ g 12 μ τ 2 then eq 15 can be rearranged as 26 l s d l s a b l s d t the imbibition time t for a given imbibition distance ls can be obtained by integrating dt in eq 26 as 27 t a b 2 ln 1 b a l s l s b eq 27 is the implicit analytical form of the imbibition height of the wetting phase fluid in a single fracture although eq 27 has the same form as eq 2 their coefficients are substantially different as the fracture and capillary tube have different pore structures and the flow equations are different eq 27 is an implicit expression that can cause difficulties in subsequent calculations similar to the method proposed by fries and dreyer 2008 the lambert function w x is introduced to derive the explicit solution of eq 27 as 28 l s t a b 1 w e 1 b 2 a t eq 28 is the explicit analytical expression of the imbibition height for a given imbibition time the w x function can be approximately calculated by the following equation fries and dreyer 2008 29 w x 2 e x 10 7036 7 56859 2 2 e x 12 7036 5 13501 2 2 e x e 1 x 0 where e is euler s number the analytical expressions for spontaneous imbibition in a capillary tube with gravity are the same as eqs 27 and 28 but the coefficients are different to verify the accuracy of the explicit analytical expression the imbibition height calculated by eq 28 is compared with the result calculated by eq 27 as shown in fig 4 the curve of the imbibition height versus time obtained by eq 28 is identical to the curve obtained by eq 27 indicating that the full analytical expression of the imbibition height is valid when the tilt angle between fracture and horizontal line α is considered the forms of implicit and full analytical expressions are the same as those of eqs 27 and 28 but the constant b should be defined as b a 2 ρ g sin α 12 μ τ 2 the detailed derivation process can be found in appendix when α 0 the analytical expression can be reduced to eq 17 the imbibition weight m in a single tortuous fracture with gravity can be expressed as 30 m ρ a l s τ ρ a l τ a b 1 w e 1 b 2 a t where the imbibition height does not exceed the core height i e ls h eq 26 can also be rearranged as follows 31 d l s d t a l s b when ls reaches its highest value i e d l s d t 0 the equilibrium height le can be calculated as fries and dreyer 2008 cai et al 2012 32 l e a b 2 σ cos θ a ρ g as the end time of imbibition is close to infinity when submitting ls le into eq 27 usually it can be considered that the spontaneous imbibition process has already finished when ls 0 99le fries and dreyer 2008 cai et al 2012 substituting ls 0 99le into eq 27 the end time of imbibition trc can be calculated as 33 t r c 3 62 a b 2 3 62 l e b 86 88 μ τ 2 σ cos θ a 3 ρ 2 g 2 as shown in fig 5 when the fracture aperture is reduced from 100 to 1 μm the equilibrium height increases from 0 12 to 12 25 m while the corresponding end time of spontaneous imbibition increases from 102 to 108 s which is a difference of 6 orders of magnitude although the final imbibition equilibrium height in small fractures can be very large the imbibition time required is very long the total imbibition rate in a core sample with gravity consists of two parts the imbibition process tends to reach the equilibrium state in large fractures due to the high imbibition rate in this case according to eqs 10 and 32 the imbibition weight in these fractures can be calculated as 34 m i e q l m i d n f ρ l i a i τ l e a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f in small fractures where spontaneous imbibition is ongoing the imbibition weight can be calculated as 35 m i g l m i d n f ρ a i l i τ a b 1 w e 1 b 2 a t a f n l max 2 d f 2 d f ϕ f d f 1 l min l max 2 d f l i d f l i δ l d f the total imbibition weight can be obtained by summing the imbibition weights of these two parts 36 m l i l min l i l c m i g l i l i l c l i l max m e q l i l i l min l i l c ρ a i l i τ a b 1 w e

the semianalytical model for spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into fractured porous media with gravity it should be noted that there is an implicit condition whereby ls h eq 36 can be calculated numerically and the program flowchart is shown in fig 6 3 model validation experimental data from the literature are used to validate our model as shown in fig 7 zhao et al 2019 experimentally measured water imbibition in fractured sandstone and the wetting front in a vertical fracture was monitored by neutron radiography the parameters of the fracture and fluid used in their experiment are listed in table 1 zhao et al 2019 also proposed an empirical model to predict the wetting front in the fracture and matrix as ls 39 61t 0 38 to verify the proposed model in this study the imbibition height over time in a fracture is predicted with eq 28 and compared with the experimental data and the parameters used are the same as those provided by zhao et al 2019 in addition eq 1 the lucas washburn model without gravity and eq 2 the fries and dreyer model with gravity are also implemented to predict the imbibition height over time and the diameter λ in eqs 1 and 2 is replaced with the fracture aperture a the empirical model proposed by zhao et al 2019 is also plotted in the same figure as shown in fig 8 compared with the other three models the results of our new model eq 28 are the closest to the experimental data at the late stage of spontaneous imbibition when the imbibition time is shorter than 0 5 s the predicted imbibition heights are slightly larger than the experimental heights which may be caused by the loss of water into the matrix around the fracture in addition the roughness of the fracture and a variable fracture aperture can also lead to prediction errors the experimental results demonstrate that the imbibition height tends to stabilize after 0 6 s because the imbibition height approaches the equilibrium height where the capillary pressure becomes equivalent to the gravity when gravity is considered the prediction results obtained with eqs 1 and 2 are different from the experimental results as the lucas washburn and fries and dreyer models were developed for predicting spontaneous imbibition in capillary tubes rather than in fractures proving that spontaneous imbibition in fractures is different from that in capillary tubes the imbibition height predicted by the empirical model proposed by zhao et al 2019 continuously increases at the late stage and does not exactly match the experimental data compared with the empirical model proposed by zhao et al 2019 the main advantage of our model is that there are no empirical parameters in eq 28 and each parameter in the model has a clear physical meaning the imbibition heights in the sandstone matrix were also measured in previous experiments zhao et al 2019 assuming a sandstone matrix consisting of bundles of capillary tubes with the same diameter the imbibition heights over time in a single capillary tube with and without gravity can be predicted with eqs 2 and 1 respectively according to zhao et al 2019 the diameter of the flow channels in the sandstone matrix ranges from 5 to 13 μm therefore the imbibition height in capillary tubes with diameters of 5 and 13 μm was predicted fig 9 shows that the data points of the measured imbibition heights over time are within the region between the curves of the imbibition height over time for λ 5 and 13 μm in addition gravity has no influence on spontaneous imbibition in the matrix at the initial stage of spontaneous imbibition clearly compared with the spontaneous imbibition results in the fracture eqs 1 and 2 perform better in predicting spontaneous imbibition in the matrix therefore the spontaneous imbibition models for the matrix and fractures should be different although the new spontaneous imbibition models for a fracture eqs 17 and 27 proposed in this paper have the same form as eqs 1 and 2 they are actually quite different eqs 1 and 2 cannot be used to predict spontaneous imbibition in a fracture and our new models have a higher prediction performance 4 the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical tortuous fracture the effects of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single tortuous fracture are shown in fig 10 gravity has almost no effect on the imbibition height in the fracture with an aperture of 10 μm in the first 1000s but the difference in imbibition height with and without gravity increases with increasing fracture aperture for instance when a 389 μm the imbibition height with gravity is smaller than that without gravity and the difference can clearly be observed even at 0 01 s after 0 7 s the increase in imbibition height with gravity can be ignored and the final equilibrium height is 36 36 mm the effect of gravity on the fracture imbibition front in fig 7 must be considered at the initial stage of spontaneous imbibition the imbibition height is linearly related to time with a slope of 0 5 in the log log plot with increasing imbibition time gravity gradually affects spontaneous imbibition and the curve of the imbibition height over time deviates from the straight line and finally stabilizes the bond number is commonly used to evaluate the gravity and capillary forces during spontaneous imbibition schechter et al 1994 the inverse bond number n b 1 is defined as the ratio of the capillary force to gravity for quantitatively evaluating the gravity effect on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical fracture 37 n b 1 2 σ cos θ a ρ g l s the smaller n b 1 is the larger the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition is n b 1 is time dependent and decreases with increasing ls until gravity equals the capillary pressure which occurs at n b 1 1 the relative reduction in imbibition height η l s is defined to quantitatively evaluate the gravity effect on the imbibition height as 38 η l s l s without gravity l s with gravity l s without gravity where ls withoutgravity is the imbibition height without gravity calculated with eq 17 and ls withgravity is the imbibition height with gravity calculated with eq 28 the larger η l s is the larger the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition is figs 11 and 12 reveal that the curve of η l s versus n b 1 is independent of the fracture aperture contact angle and ift which can be used as a diagnostic plot to quantitatively evaluate the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition generally log η l s is linearly and negatively correlated with log n b 1 but η l s sharply decreases at approximately n b 1 1 the value of η l s at n b 1 1 is approximately 80 and when n b 1 increases from 1 to 1 96 η l s decreases significantly from 80 to 10 when n b 1 is larger than 32 86 η l s is smaller than 1 which means that the gravity effect can be ignored table 2 lists the value of n b 1 for different η l s values based on the required modeling accuracy and the correlation between n b 1 and η l s identified before the critical time imbibition height when where the gravity effect should be considered can be determined according to eq 37 the critical imbibition height lsc where gravity should be considered can be expressed as 39 l s c 2 σ cos θ a ρ g n b 1 substituting eq 39 into eq 17 the critical time tc when gravity should be considered can be calculated as 40 t c 12 μ τ 2 σ cos θ a 3 ρ 2 g 2 n b 1 2 fig 13 reveals that tc and lsc decrease logarithmically with increasing fracture aperture as η l s increases tc and lsc increase taking a 50 μm as an example at t 1 55 s η l s is larger than 5 and lsc is only 0 04 m for a large fracture such as for a 100 μm only after 0 2 s η l s becomes larger than 5 therefore for fractures with large apertures the gravity effect should be considered even at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition 5 the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media according to the cubic law and eq 7 the total flow rate q for a core with a height of h can be obtained by summarizing the flow rate in every fracture as 41 q l min l max q d n f n 2 l max 2 ϕ f δ p a f 12 μ h 2 d f 4 d f 1 l min l max 4 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f according to darcy s law the total flow rate can be expressed as 42 q k a f δ p μ h combining eqs 41 and 42 the permeability of a fractured core sample can be expressed as 43 k n 2 ϕ f l max 2 12 2 d f 4 d f 1 l min l max 4 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f fractured porous media with a variable fracture aperture can be represented as a series of fractures with the same aperture size whose permeability can be expressed as chen et al 1999 44 k ϕ f l e a e 2 12 ϕ f n 2 l e 2 12 where ae is the equivalent fracture aperture le is the equivalent fracture length and ae nle then the equivalent fracture aperture ae can be calculated as follows 45 a e n l e l max 2 2 d f 4 d f 1 l min l max 4 d f 1 l min l max 2 d f the imbibition heights in fractures with different apertures are different the average imbibition height lse is calculated to evaluate the core scale weight of the wetting phase which can be calculated as 46 l s e m m max h where m is the imbibition weight at imbibition time t h is the core height and m max is the maximum imbibition weight which can be calculated from the total pore volume of the core sample as 47 m max π d 2 4 h ϕ f ρ with the effective fracture aperture ae and the average imbibition height lse the core scale inverse bond number n b c 1 is defined as 48 n b c 1 2 σ cos θ a e ρ g l s e as lse increases during the spontaneous imbibition process until the end the core scale n b c 1 is also dependent on time the relative reduction in the imbibition weight η m is defined to evaluate the effect of gravity on the imbibition weight as 49 η m m without gravity m with gravity m without gravity where m withoutgravity is the imbibition weight of the core sample without gravity which can be calculated with eq 22 and m withgravity is the imbibition weight of the core sample with gravity which can be calculated with eq 36 several case studies are conducted to investigate the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media the parameters of the fluid and core samples are summarized in table 3 as shown in fig 14 at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition t 103 s the effect of gravity on the imbibition weight is insignificant for t 103 s the differences in imbibition weight between core samples with different h increase when h 0 5 m the curves of the imbibition weight over time with and without gravity almost coincide which implies that gravity can be ignored when h is small enough as h increases the gravity effect increases and the final imbibition weight with gravity is smaller than that without gravity the reason is that the equilibrium height le of a large fracture is smaller than the core height h when the gravity and capillary pressure attain equilibrium as shown in fig 15 when gravity is ignored the final water saturation can reach 1 which means that water can fill all the fractures when gravity is considered the final water saturation decreases from 1 to 0 85 as h increases from 0 5 m to 2 m for the core sample with h 0 5 m although the final water saturation can reach 1 the curves of the water saturation over time with and without gravity do not exactly coincide between 102 and 103 s as gravity reduces the imbibition rate as the equilibrium height of a large fracture exceeds 0 5 m the final water saturation approaches 1 however for the core samples with h 1 and 2 m the equilibrium heights of the large fractures are smaller than h and the final water saturation does not reach 1 as shown in fig 16 the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media can be quantitatively evaluated with the log log plot of η m versus n b c 1 the curve of η m versus n b c 1 can be divided into two segments at a large n b c 1 log η m is linearly and negatively correlated with log n b c 1 which means that as n b c 1 decreases the gravity effect increases until η m reaches its maximum value then η m decreases with decreasing n b c 1 which indicates that the relative reduction in imbibition weight due to the gravity effect decreases as mentioned above this phenomenon occurs due to the core height being limited and the imbibition front already reaches the core height before the equilibrium height is achieved the larger h is the smaller n b c 1 is where the maximum η m is attained for instance as h increases from 0 5 to 2 m the maximum η m increases from 11 49 to 35 61 the curve of η m versus n b c 1 for h 100 m is also plotted the figure shows that η m continuously increases even as n b c 1 is reduced to 1 and the straight line of log η m log n b c 1 coincides with the other curves of η m versus n b c 1 for different h values table 4 lists the values of n b c 1 for different η m values in the linear part of the curve of η m versus n b c 1 when n b c 1 is smaller than 8 8 η m will exceed 10 therefore the curve of η m versus n b c 1 can be used as a diagnostic plot for quantitatively evaluating the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media for fractured porous media the critical time when the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition must be considered can be determined the value of n b c 1 can be determined for a given η m according to fig 15 and the average imbibition height lse can then be calculated with eq 46 as 50 l s e 2 σ cos θ a e ρ g n b c 1 therefore the total imbibition weight m at this time can be calculated according to eq 46 and the corresponding imbibition time can then be obtained fig 17 demonstrates that the smaller the fracture length is the longer the required imbibition time to attain equilibrium will be the final total imbibition weight in small fractures is larger than that in large fractures due to the larger number of small fractures as shown in fig 18 the imbibition weight increases with increasing fracture length n the reason this occurs is that when the fracture length remains fixed the increase in n results in an increase in the fracture aperture fractures with large apertures experience high imbibition rates at n 0 01 the imbibition weight considering gravity is close to that without considering gravity this indicates that gravity has little effect on the imbibition weight for fractures with small apertures as n increases from 0 01 to 0 05 the differences between the imbibition weights with and without gravity become more significant as the gravity effect becomes more pronounced with increasing fracture aperture 6 conclusions a model for the concurrent spontaneous imbibition of the wetting phase into gas saturated fractured porous media is derived based on the tortuous plate fracture model with the fractal theory the expressions for the cumulative imbibition weight with the imbibition time with and without gravity are derived the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single fracture and core scale fractured porous media is quantitatively evaluated with the inverse bond number the main conclusions include the following the lucas washburn and fries and dreyer models cannot be directly used to predict spontaneous imbibition in fractures by simply replacing the pore diameter with the fracture aperture as this can lead to significant prediction errors new spontaneous imbibition models for predicting the imbibition height over time in a single fracture with and without gravity have been proposed in this paper although they have the same form as the spontaneous imbibition models in a capillary tube the coefficients are different the experimental data from the literature demonstrate that our model can accurately predict spontaneous imbibition in a fracture the dimensionless plot of n b 1 versus η l s can be used as a diagnostic plot for quantitively evaluating the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in a single vertical fracture except for a sharp decrease in η l s at approximately n b 1 1 η l s decreases almost linearly with increasing n b 1 in a log log plot as n b 1 decreases from 3 57 to 1 the relative reduction in the imbibition height due to gravity increases from 10 to 80 the critical time when the gravity effect should be considered can be determined with the curve of n b 1 versus η l s for fractures with large apertures the gravity effect should be considered even at the early stage of spontaneous imbibition the effect of gravity on spontaneous imbibition in core scale fractured porous media can be quantitatively evaluated with the log log plot of n b c 1 versus η m where η m increases almost linearly with decreasing n b c 1 until the maximum value is reached due to the limitation of the core height and then η m decreases with decreasing n b c 1 the larger the core height is the smaller n b c 1 is at which the maximum η m is observed in the absence of core height limitations with n b c 1 decreasing from 8 8 to 1 43 the relative reduction in the imbibition weight due to the gravity effect will increase from 10 to 50 credit authorship contribution statement fuyong wang conceptualization methodology writing review editing hui cheng visualization
