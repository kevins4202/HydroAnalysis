4050,estimation of the water budget is essential for water resources and environmental management however a reliable assessment of the water budget and water yield for the indian sub continental river basins has been lacking we used 0 25 gridded meteorological observations and five hydrological models to construct water budget estimates for the indian sub continental river basins for the 1951 2016 period the hydrological models i e vic clm noah mp h08 and cwatm were calibrated against observed streamflow and evaluated for evapotranspiration et and soil moisture considerable uncertainty in the water budget components et and total runoff was found due to the process representation and parameterization of hydrological models multimodel ensemble mean of the five hydrological models performed better than individual models for most basins for water budget components west coast brahmaputra and brahmani are the three wettest river basins at the same time sabarmati indus and pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the indian sub continent the three transboundary river basins brahmaputra ganga and indus have the highest water yield of 731 9 50 2 582 4 89 4 and 231 1 71 km3 respectively the budyko framework showed that only two basins west coast and the brahmaputra over the indian sub continent fall under the energy limited relatively lower atmospheric water demands conditions in comparison the other sixteen river basins are in water limited higher atmospheric water demands condition our findings have implications for water resources planning and management in one of the world s most populated regions keywords multimodel water budget streamflow intercomparison water yield 1 introduction the hydrological cycle is a crucial component of the earth system which is projected to intensify under the warming climate huntington 2006 an intensified hydrological cycle faster rate of evaporation may cause unusual dry and wet extreme events dai et al 2016 wu et al 2013 moreover anthropogenic climate change and other factors such as aerosols land use change and irrigation can also significantly impact water budget components huntington 2006 recent studies show an increasing frequency of hydrological extremes due to climate warming ali et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2021 trenberth 2011 nonetheless river discharge and water availability remain the two major indicators of the changes in the hydrological cycle over land however internal climate variability observational errors and other factors aerosols irrigation and land use change cause considerable uncertainty limiting the confidence in attributing the changes in the hydrological cycle to anthropogenic climate change hegerl et al 2015 estimating the water budget at the river basin scale is critical for understanding water availability and water management under the observed and future climate water budget components can be obtained by ground based monitoring stations and satellite based precipitation and et estimates sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2014 however a significant bias in satellite precipitation can lead to overestimation in streamflow gao et al 2010 sheffield et al 2009 and erroneous estimates of water availability sahoo et al 2011 similar to precipitation estimates there can be considerable uncertainty in et estimates based on different sources for instance long et al 2014 reported that uncertainty in et is the lowest moderate and highest when estimated using land surface models satellite moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace respectively a large part of the uncertainty in remote sensing based et estimates depends on the choice of vegetation parameterization while additional uncertainty comes from sources of net radiation ferguson et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 similarly satellite based soil moisture estimates also show considerable uncertainty dorigo et al 2017 wanders et al 2012 wanders et al 2014 showed the benefits of using remotely sensed soil moisture for parameter identification of hydrological models moreover uncertainty in individual water budget components can be higher than the measured streamflow due to process algorithms and input data sheffield et al 2009 hydrological models are often used for the estimation of water budget components and water scarcity at the river basin scale to overcome the issues in the in situ observations and satellite based estimates in water budget closure martin et al 2016 hydrological models have shown their global significance in understanding land surface processes and estimation of water availability baroni et al 2019 zhao and li 2015 hydrological models can have uncertainty in estimating water cycle components resulting from parametrization and process representation schmied et al 2014 for instance hydrological models represent various components of the land and atmosphere in different ways bonan et al 2011 niu et al 2011 the differences in model performance arise primarily due to the representation of physical processes assumptions and input forcing cailliez and pernot 2011 therefore understanding the differences in the models estimates of the water budget is essential niraula et al 2017 water budget estimates based on the multiple hydrological models with good performance may be more reliable than an individual hydrological model for instance the multimodel ensemble approach outperforms the individual models by minimizing the model error uncertainty kumar et al 2017 therefore the ensemble modelling approach has been used to estimate water scarcity schewe et al 2014 floods dankers et al 2014 and water budget cai et al 2014 the usefulness of the multimodel ensemble approach has been demonstrated at the global scale schewe et al 2014 warszawski et al 2014 however efforts related to hydrological model intercomparison for water budget in the indian sub continent have been lacking moreover hydrological models in the global model intercomparison projects are often not calibrated at river basin scales schewe et al 2014 several hydrological models including the variable infiltration capacity vic model behera et al 2019 mishra et al 2018 soil water assessment tool swat desai et al 2021 mishra and lilhare 2016 community land model clm mishra et al 2018 tiwari et al 2009 and noah mp ali et al 2019 have been applied over the indian sub continental isc hereafter river basins for different hydrological applications most previous hydrological modelling studies were limited to only a single hydrological model except mishra et al 2018 intercomparison of hydrological models directed towards specific aims has been limited over the isc river basins mishra et al 2018 reconstructed agricultural droughts over india using soil moisture simulations uncertainty in drought estimation can be reduced using the ensemble mean from the three hydrological models over india mishra et al 2018 despite the considerable uncertainty in the water budget estimates over the isc river basins planning commission 2007 narasimhan 2008 yoon et al 2019 the efforts towards a multimodel based estimate of the water budget have been lacking narasimhan 2008 showed that an estimate of et 40 of total precipitation is considerably underestimated by the planning commission 2007 on the other hand jain 2012 reported et as 23 of total precipitation in the ganga river basin shah and mishra 2016 used the vic model to show that mean annual et and total runoff over the indian sub continent are 48 and 52 of total precipitation respectively here we estimate the water budget and water availability in the isc river basins using five hydrological models clm h08 noah mp vic and cwatm all the five models are physics based consider distributed input of soil and vegetation and simulates water and energy budget for each grid the scientific questions we address are i does the ensemble mean of the five hydrological models perform better than the individual models for the water budget components ii which are the river basins that show higher inter model uncertainty in the water budget estimates 2 methodology 2 1 observed and reanalysis data daily gridded precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures were obtained from the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 for the 1951 2016 period for the indian region the gridded precipitation was developed at 0 25 spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method shepard 1968 based on more than 6500 rain gauge stations situated across india pai et al 2015 pai et al 2014 the gridded precipitation captures the spatial variability of the summer monsoon june september rainfall in india pai et al 2014 we obtained gridded daily minimum and maximum temperatures from imd which were developed at 1 spatial resolution using 395 gage stations located across india daily minimum and maximum temperatures were further re gridded at 0 25 using bi linear interpolation for the part of the transboundary river basins ganga brahmaputra and indus that falls outside india we used gridded precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures from the princeton meteorological forcing dataset sheffield et al 2006 for the same period 1951 2016 in addition to precipitation and temperature we obtained gridded daily wind speed at 0 25 from the princeton meteorological dataset sheffield et al 2006 the wind direction is computed using horizontal and vertical wind components u and v which was obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis era5 c3s 2017 hersbach dee 2016 the imd and princeton datasets have been widely used for hydroclimatic assessments in the isc river basins chawla and mujumdar 2015 mahto and mishra 2019 we selected 18 river basins of the indian subcontinent for the hydrological model intercomparison for the water budget estimates fig 1 the area of these river basins varies between 0 04 and 1 12 million km2 table 3 the observed streamflow for fifteen river basins was collected from the india water resources information system india wris www indiawris gov in www indiawris gov in which is a collaborative project of the central water commission cwc and indian space research organisation isro we obtained observed streamflow for the remaining three transboundary river basins indus ganga and the brahmaputra from the centre for sustainability and the global environment sage https nelson wisc edu sage data and models riverdata observed streamflow for indus ganga and brahmaputra basins is not available in the public domain as it is classified the streamflow gauge stations were selected based on the availability of long term continuous data and the minimal impact of reservoir operations as mentioned in shah and mishra 2016 fig 1 we obtained gridded et and soil moisture from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 2 which is available at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolutions the gleam dataset provides different hydrological cycle components martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 which have been used globally schellekens et al 2017 the gleam et estimates are based on priestley and taylor s method miralles et al 2011 et from the gleam was evaluated against 91 eddy covariance towers around the world martens et al 2017 which compares well against the flux tower dataset in addition we obtained et from modis to evaluate the hydrological models we used monthly et from modis mod16et for the period 2000 2007 et and soil moisture based on satellite data have been used to evaluate the hydrologic models in india mishra et al 2016 shah and mishra 2016 land use land cover lulc and soil information are crucial for hydrological modelling we used lulc and soil data as per the requirements of the hydrological models table s1 2 2 hydrological models we used five hydrological models hms hereafter namely vic cherkauer et al 2003 liang et al 1996 noah mp niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 clm lawrence et al 2019 vertenstein et al 2004 h08 hanasaki et al 2018 and cwatm burek et al 2020 to examine their performance for water budget in the isc river basins we used the same meteorological forcing in all the hms and simulations were conducted for the 1951 2016 period at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolutions the descriptions specifications and physical processes of the individual models are discussed in the following sections table s2 2 2 1 the variable infiltration capacity vic model the vic model liang et al 1996 is a semi distributed physically based macroscale hydrological model that simulates water and surface energy fluxes daily or sub daily time step in each grid cell the vic model considers vegetation and soil parameters and meteorological forcings as inputs using the penman monteith method monteith 1965 penman 1948 the vic model calculates total et as the sum of the canopy and bare soil evaporation and transpiration from vegetation mosaics runoff in the vic model is estimated using the variable infiltration capacity curve while soil moisture is calculated using richard s equation the arno model formulation is used to estimate baseflow from the bottom layer franchini and pacciani 1991 the avhrr of the noaa was used to obtain land cover parameters for the vic model the vic model s soil parameters were developed using the harmonised world soil database hwsd the vic model uses daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures and wind speed as input meteorological forcing simulated runoff and baseflow from each grid cell were routed using a standalone routing model lohmann 1996 previous studies can provide more details on the calibration of the vic model gao et al 2010 shah and mishra 2016 2 2 2 the h08 model the h08 h zero 8 is a grid based global hydrological model with six main modules land surface reservoir operation river routing environmental flow estimation crop growth and anthropogenic water withdrawal hanasaki et al 2008 recently six more schemes have been implemented in the coupled h08 model hanasaki et al 2018 in the coupled h08 model the influence of cropping intensity and irrigation efficiency döll and siebert 2002 cropland and pasture area ramankutty et al 2008 harvested area for each crop monfreda et al 2008 and irrigation based on the global map of irrigated areas gmia v5 siebert et al 2010 have been incorporated each grid cell in the h08 can be divided into fractions of double crop irrigated cropland rainfed cropland single crop irrigated cropland and other land use types et in the h08 model is estimated using the bulk transfer approach dalton 1802 while soil moisture is based on the soil water balance approach hanasaki et al 2008 the h08 model estimates runoff based on saturation excess non linear flow while baseflow is calculated using a leaky bucket model hanasaki et al 2008 streamflow routing in the h08 model is based on total runoff integrated pathways trip oki and sud 1998 cropland in the h08 model is based on ramankutty and foley 1998 while irrigated and crop type information is obtained from monfreda et al 2008 and siebert et al 2010 soil parameters to run the h08 model were estimated using the hwsd the h08 model uses precipitation air temperature short and longwave radiations wind speed surface pressure and specific humidity as meteorological forcing coupled h08 model framework is used to simulate the hydrological processes and the anthropogenic water use at regional and global scales hanasaki et al 2018 the h08 model is used to assess the water resources including agricultural water withdrawals hanasaki et al 2008 and virtual water flow hanasaki et al 2010 2 2 3 community land model clm the community land model clm3 0 is a component of the community earth system model oleson 2004 which was developed by the national centre for atmospheric research ncar in collaboration with the climate and global dynamics division cgd and terrestrial sciences section tss the key feature that makes clm3 0 different from the other hydrological models is the coupling with individual schemes such as topmodel clm uses the topmodel based scheme for runoff generation developed by beven and kirkby 1979 clm also represents frozen soil and groundwater as reported in niu et al 2007 niu et al 2005 clm3 0 includes 17 plant functional types pfts ten soil layers at different depths with an improved canopy interception scheme land cover data for clm are based on noaa avhrr and modis bonan et al 2002b oleson and bonan 2000 bonan et al 2002a soil parameters for the clm model are derived from food and agricultural organization fao dickinson et al 1993 zeng et al 2002 clm takes precipitation air temperature short and longwave radiation surface pressure wind speed and specific humidity as meteorological inputs besides the capability of providing soil moisture at ten different depths a good representation of a groundwater table in clm is available which fluctuates dynamically especially during heavy groundwater pumping niu et al 2007 et in clm is estimated using the boreal ecosystem simulator chen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 while soil moisture estimates are based on richard s equation oleson 2004 runoff and baseflow are simulated using the topmodel approach beven and kirkby 1979 table s2 after simulating runoff and baseflow for each grid we used a standalone routing model lohmann et al 1996 to obtain streamflow at desired locations in the isc river basins 2 2 4 noah multi parameterization land surface model noah mp noah mp is a new generation hydrological model hm with multiple physics options for different land atmospheric interaction processes niu et al 2011 noah mp is developed by the ncar national centre for environmental prediction ncep national aeronautics and space administration nasa and university groups under the combined effort noah mp integrates the recently improved physics based schemes from the different land surface models niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 noah mp is an improved physics version of the noah land surface model noah lsm we used the one dimensional noah mp model version 3 1 which simulates each grid cell s water and energy fluxes soil parameters for the noah mp model are based on the statsgo and fao the noah mp model considers precipitation wind speed air temperature humidity short and longwave radiations pressure and wind direction as meteorological forcing lulc for noah mp is acquired from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp loveland and belward 1997 sulla and friedl 2018 multiple schemes are available in noah mp with the default topmodel scheme to simulate hydrological variables niu et al 2007 the noah mp model estimates surface runoff based on the exponential distribution of the infiltration capacity a proportionality function based on soil moisture storage is used to estimate the baseflow in noah mp noah mp uses the spatial variability in precipitation and infiltration to estimate the different runoff components et in noah mp is estimated using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator liu et al 2003 yang et al 2011 table s2 soil moisture and runoff baseflow are estimated based on richard s equation niu et al 2011 and simtop schemes niu et al 2005 respectively we used a standalone routing model lohmann et al 1996 for streamflow routing we calibrated the noah mp using the depth of four soil layers the zilintikevich coefficient a surface runoff parameter and a bare soil evaporation component mishra et al 2018 niu et al 2011 2 2 5 community water model cwatm the cwatm is an integrated hydrological and channel routing model which is developed at the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa burek et al 2020 cwatm simulates surface and groundwater processes for each grid at 1 km to 50 km at daily time steps the cwatm model framework considers human activities e g water use groundwater pumping reservoir regulations and irrigation in simulating hydrological variables the cwatm solves water and energy budget components using a physics based module et in cwatm is estimated using penman monteith allen et al 1998 table s2 while soil moisture is estimated using van genuchten simplification van genuchten 1980 cwatm estimates runoff using a triangular weighting function as described in burek et al 2020 baseflow in cwatm is calculated using a linear reservoir approach roo et al 2000 cwatm uses the saint venant equation for river routing lulc classes used in cwatm are obtained from different sources for instance forest land cover is based on hansen et al 2013 while the impervious area is obtained from elvidge et al 2007 the irrigated area in the model is based on siebert et al 2010 soil parameters for cwatm are developed using the hwsd the cwatm takes daily precipitation temperature shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed and humidity as meteorological inputs further details can be obtained from burek et al 2020 2 3 analysis approach we calibrated and evaluated all the five hydrological models for 18 major river basins in india fig 1 the models were manually calibrated by adjusting the calibration parameters for each model table s5 against the monthly observed streamflow at the selected locations we selected the streamflow gauge stations to calibrate the hydrological models that were not considerably affected by major reservoirs shah and mishra 2016 the calibration period was not the same for all the river basins which varied based on the availability of the observed streamflow after the calibration all the hydrological models were evaluated against the observed monthly streamflow at the same locations but for a different period we further examined the models performance against satellite based et and soil moisture across the isc river basins as streamflow was calibrated at the stations that are not necessarily located at the outlet of the river basins we evaluated the simulated et model against gleam and modis whereas soil moisture against gleam data in addition evaluating the hydrological models at multiple locations and for numerous variables is better than the calibration and evaluation against the single observed variable krysanova et al 2018 mishra et al 2020 the performance of hydrological models against observed streamflow was estimated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse we compared the water budget for all the 18 isc river basins from all the five hydrological models after calibration and evaluation we estimated basin averaged mean annual et and total runoff tr to compare the water budget components the river basin scale uncertainty in the water budget components was estimated considering one standard deviation of the five hydrological models estimates further we compared model estimates for streamflow and et simulations using the coefficient of correlation r root means square error rmse bias and overall score graham et al 2019 the overall score combines several statistical measures and provides a single measure to understand the suitability of the hydrological models and can be estimated using the following equation 1 overall score r 1 abs bias range 1 root mean square error range x10 3 range is the difference between the minimum and maximum values of the observed datasets we also analyzed the ensemble mean of all models for all the variables i e streamflow total runoff et soil moisture we estimated potential evapotranspiration pet using penman monteith zotarelli et al 2010 method all the variables required for pet estimation were obtained from the era5 reanalysis 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pet is the reference evapotranspiration rate mm d 1 t is mean air temperature c and u2 refers to wind speed m s 1 at 2 m above the ground 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation first we calibrated and evaluated all the five hydrological models against the observed flow for all the 18 sub continental river basins fig 1 we find that nse is higher than 0 7 for 15 15 14 11 14 11 12 14 and 10 8 river basins during calibration evaluation for clm h08 noah mp vic and cwatm respectively fig 2 a b fig s1 s5 table 1 all the five hms showed a better agreement for the ganga nse 0 8 basin on the other hand all the hms performed poorly nse 0 7 in the south coast river basin fig 2 table 1 the vic model outperformed the other hms in krishna narmada and pennar river basins fig 2 table 1 similarly h08 performed better in ganga mahi subarnarekha and tapi river basins than the other hms table 1 on the other hand the noah mp performed better than other hms in cauvery east coast and ganga river basins we find a lower performance in the coastal basins cauvery east coast and south coast from all the hms fig 2a b and table 1 we note a good agreement among the hms in the three major transboundary river basins i e indus ganga and the brahmaputra among all the five hms the clm showed the best agreement with the observed streamflow on the other hand the cwatm showed a poorer agreement for the observed monthly flow among all the five hms figs 2a b and and s1 s5 our results show no single hydrological model that performs better than the other hms across the isc river basins we used the coefficient of correlation r to assess the performance of individual hms and the ensemble mean of all the five hms for et and sm fig 2c d we compared the monthly simulated et from all the hms against monthly et from modis and gleam for the 2000 to 2007 period figs 2c and s6 all the hms capture et s temporal dynamics and seasonal cycle fig s7 our results show that the hms simulated et is in good agreement r 0 8 against modis and gleam based et for the majority of the river basins except for the coastal basins table s3 and fig 2c the vic noah mp and cwatm underestimated et in the west coast and the brahmaputra river basins fig s2 on the other hand the cwatm overestimated et in narmada and mahi basins located in the semi arid regions of western india compared to the other hms h08 and vic show relatively better performance r 0 85 to simulate et against modis and gleam datasets among all the hms noah mp simulated et showed a lower agreement against et from modis and gleam in the coastal basins the relatively weaker performance of the noah mp to simulate et can be associated with the static vegetation parameters for instance yang et al 2011 reported that the dynamic vegetation model in noah mp captures seasonal dynamics and spatial variability in leaf area index and green vegetation fraction in a better manner the multimodel ensemble means et shows better skill than the individual hms by cancelling errors and uncertainties xia et al 2012 xia et al 2012b therefore the ensemble mean et from all the hms performs better than many individual models next we compared the hms simulated soil moisture with the gleam soil moisture gleam sm fig 2d we used the root zone soil moisture 60 cm for both hms simulated soil moisture and gleam soil moisture for evaluation mean correlation r for all 18 sub continental river basins was found to be 0 59 0 81 0 73 0 76 0 75 and 0 79 for the clm h08 noah mp vic cwatm and multi model ensemble mean respectively h08 showed a good agreement in all the 18 river basins with a correlation of more than 0 7 while the least agreement was found between the clm and gleam soil moisture fig 2d relatively better performance of the h08 model for soil moisture simulations can be linked with the runoff parameterization in the model which is based on the bucket model concept manabe 1969 the bucket model is a modified version of the leaky bucket in which sub surface runoff occurs continuously as soil moisture soil moisture in the h08 model is expressed as single layer reservoirs unlike other hms with soil layers the linkage between a single reservoir and subsurface runoff in the h08 might contribute to better soil moisture simulations clm overestimates soil moisture in the godavari and pennar river basins while underestimates soil moisture in the cauvery east coast mahi south coast and west coast river basins compared to soil moisture simulated from the gleam on the other hand cwatm underestimates soil moisture in the south coast and west coast basins while overestimates soil moisture in east coast and tapi river basins fig s8 noah mp underestimates soil moisture in the south coast cauvery and east coast basins the ensemble mean soil moisture from all the hms showed a better agreement against soil moisture from gleam in a few river basins compared to individual hms for tapi and narmada basins the ensemble sm showed the best correlation r 0 89 among all hms differences in lsms simulated soil moisture are associated with their soil water holding capacity mishra et al 2018 the h08 model captures the temporal dynamics of soil moisture in most of the sub continental river basins overall we find the h08 model and ensemble mean show a better performance against the gleam soil moisture in most isc river basins 3 2 multimodel estimates of water budget we compared the hms for the water budget during the 1951 2016 period in the isc river basins figs 3 7 mean annual et from the individual hms and their ensemble mean was compared against the gleam based estimates as a reference we estimated the overall score graham et al 2019 based on several performance measures to examine the performance of hms in the isc river basins see methods for details long term 1951 2016 mean monthly precipitation shows the dominance of the summer june september monsoon in the majority of the isc river basins except for the south coast east coast pennar and cauvery river basins fig s9 on the other hand south coast and indus river basins show the bi modal seasonal cycle of precipitation which can be attributed to the influence of the northeast monsoon october december and western disturbance during the winter season respectively fig 3 in addition long term annual mean precipitation is higher in the river basins located in the northeastern central and west coast regions fig s10 and table 3 most hms simulate long term mean annual et well in all the river basins in the indian sub continent fig 3 for instance the ensemble mean annual et from the five hydrological models is about 676 mm which compares well against the gleam estimates fig 3a table 2 most hms except the h08 model underestimate the mean annual et in the brahmaputra river basin fig 3b multimodel ensemble mean et is in better agreement with gleam et in eight brahmani cauvery krishna mahanadi pennar south coast subarnarekha and tapi out of 18 river basins based on the overall score fig 3 and table s4 the h08 model performs the best to simulate long term mean annual et in four brahmaputra east coast northeast coast west coast out of 18 sub continental river basins the performance of clm to simulate the mean annual et is the best in the three ganga mahi narmada river basins noah mp and cwatm perform the best only in the godavari and sabarmati river basin respectively fig 3 the vic model did not show the best performance for mean annual et in any river basins which can be linked with the representation of groundwater reservoir in the vic model in addition the performance of the land surface models to simulate et depends on the dynamic representation of vegetation cai et al 2014 consistent with our findings cai et al 2014 also reported a weaker performance of the vic model for et indus west coast and brahmaputra river basins show the highest intermodal uncertainty in mean annual et estimates table 2 on the other hand godavari pennar and tapi river basins show the least uncertainty in mean annual et estimates inter model uncertainty in mean annual et in the ganga river basin is about 10 of the long term mean table 2 our results highlight the considerable uncertainty in the et estimates because of different hydrological models in the isc river basins overall we find that the multimodel ensemble mean can provide the best estimates of mean annual et in most river basins understanding the partitioning of precipitation to et is essential for the water budget the evaporative ratio et p mean annual evaporation mean annual precipitation may vary in different hms in the sub continental river basins therefore we compared the evaporative ratio from the selected hms and their ensemble mean fig 4 table 2 most hms and their ensemble mean show a higher more than 0 7 evaporative ratio for the river basins in the semi arid and arid regions fig s11 for instance the evaporative ratio is relatively higher for the southern indus and sabarmati basins for which approximately 70 of mean annual precipitation is being used for et in contrast upper indus brahmaputra and eastern and western coastal river basins have lower less than 0 5 evaporative ratio which indicates that these river basins have either equal partitioning or dominance of total runoff fig 4 table 2 multimodal ensemble mean evaporative ratio is the lowest 28 for the west coast while the highest 78 8 for the sabarmati river basin fig 4g and table 2 the multimodel estimate of evaporative ratio for the ganga river basin is 51 5 close to the estimate 49 6 provided in shah and mishra 2016 shah and mishra 2016 used the vic model to estimate the water budget in the sub continental river basins moreover our estimates of et p is much higher than jain 2012 who found that et is about 23 of mean annual precipitation in the ganga basin similarly considerable differences in our et estimates and those from jain 2012 are found for narmada godavari cauvery krishna and indus river basins while most of the hms agree on the estimates of evaporative ratio there is relatively higher uncertainty among the hms in the brahmaputra and west coast river basins fig 4g table 2 which can be attributed to the performance of the hms in these basins fig 2 overall relatively lesser uncertainty in the estimates of evaporative ratio in most sub continental river basins shows that the ensemble mean can be a better measure than the individual hms for mean annual et fig 4 we compared the mean annual total runoff simulated from the five hms for all the 18 sub continental river basins for the 1951 2016 period fig 5 unlike et there is no standard observational product available for total runoff therefore our assessment is limited to the intercomparison of total runoff from hms and their ensemble mean the hm performs the best to simulate streamflow assuming that total runoff estimates from the same hm can be considered better than others our results show a considerable uncertainty in indus sabarmati east coast and krishna river basins in the total runoff estimates fig 5 table 2 on the other hand ganga brahmaputra godavari narmada and tapi river basins have relatively lower uncertainty in total runoff regardless of the calibration and evaluation of hms uncertainty in the estimates of mean annual total runoff can be considerable for instance the vic model has the best performance to simulate streamflow in the indus river basin compared to the vic model based estimates of mean annual total runoff there is a considerable underestimation in total runoff in the h08 model at the same time overestimation in the noah mp and cwatm simulated total runoff for the indus river basin fig 5g similarly significant differences can be seen in the estimated total runoff for sabarmati krishna and east coast river basins our results show that mean annual total runoff simulated using the different hms can have considerable uncertainty table 2 and fig 5 multimodel ensemble mean can be considered a more robust estimate of mean annual total runoff than the individual hms in most river basins fig 5 we estimated the runoff ratio tr p total runoff divided by precipitation for all the 18 isc river basins from the five hms fig 6 the runoff ratio from most of the hms is consistent with the mean annual precipitation during 1951 2016 fig 6 and fig s12 for instance upper indus ganga brahmaputra mahanadi brahmani and west coast basins have higher runoff ratios than the other basins the runoff ratio is also higher in the foothills of himalaya consistent with the higher orographic precipitation in the region figs 6 and s10 on the other hand the river basins runoff ratio in the semi arid and arid regions e g southern indus sabarmati and tapi is considerably lower 0 3 similarly the river basins located in peninsular india also show a relatively lower runoff ratio than basins located in central eastern india the runoff coefficient s magnitude and spatial pattern are consistent for most hms except cwatm fig 6 for instance the north south divide in the runoff ratio in the indus basin does not exist in the estimates based on the cwatm fig 6e moreover the river basins runoff ratio in peninsular india is also considerably higher for the cwatm than the other four hms we find that the magnitude and spatial pattern of the runoff ratio in the multimodel ensemble mean is consistent with the other four hms clm h08 noah mp and vic the four river basins with the highest runoff coefficient are brahmaputra brahmani mahanadi and west coast table 2 on the other hand the four river basins with the lowest runoff coefficient are sabarmati pennar east coast and cauvery figs 6 s12 and table 2 overall four out of five hms are consistent for runoff coefficient in the isc river basins moreover the ensemble mean of runoff ratio can provide better estimates than the individual hms in most isc river basins 3 3 intercomparison of water availability we compared the hms for basin wise water availability at the selected locations against the observed flow in the isc river basins fig 7 we find that the hms perform well in most of the river basins to simulate mean annual streamflow except for some of the coastal basins for instance the observed mean annual streamflow 12000 m3 s of the ganga basin at the farakka was well simulated by all the hms except the vic model fig 7e relatively higher intermodal uncertainty was observed for mahanadi east coast south coast north east coast and west coast basin for instance the cwatm shows a large underestimation in streamflow in the mahanadi basin at the basantpur station fig 7i similarly the h08 model underestimates the observed mean annual streamflow in the west coast and pennar basin fig 7m 7r the multimodel ensemble mean streamflow shows a better agreement against the observed streamflow for six cauvery ganga godavari narmada pennar and west coast out of 18 isc river basins based on the overall score fig 7 in comparison the vic model and clm are in good agreement with observed mean annual streamflow for five brahmani indus subarnarekha tapi and mahanadi and four krishna north east coast sabarmati and south coast basins respectively fig 7 table s4 the h08 performs the best in east coast and mahi while noah mp shows promising results in the brahmaputra table s4 overall we find that among hms the vic model performs the best however the ensemble mean performs better than the individual hms in most basins fig 7 we ranked the river basins based on mean annual precipitation total runoff and et mm during 1951 2016 to understand the basin wise water availability simulated by the individual hms we performed this analysis to examine variability in the atmospheric input precipitation atmospheric demands et and total runoff generated among the river basins in the indian sub continent in addition we used the budyko framework donohue et al 2006 roderick and farquhar 2011 which provides information on the river basins that are water or energy limited fig 8 budyko s framework compares the relationship between aridity index potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and evapotranspiration index et p pet was estimated using penman monteith method using the required variables from era5 reanalysis see methods for details to examine the variability among the basin while precipitation was obtained from imd and princeton forcing see methods for more details et simulated from different hms was used to estimate the evaporative index used in budyko s framework the domain average mean annual precipitation over the isc river basins is about 1145 mm fig 8 fig s10 however there is considerable variability in the mean annual precipitation among the river basins in the indian sub continent for instance mean annual precipitation over the isc river basins varies from 476 mm to 2699 mm fig 8 the highest mean annual precipitation occurs in the west coast basin whereas the lowest falls in sabarmati and indus basin fig 8a west coast brahmaputra and brahmani are the three wettest river basins at the same time sabarmati indus and pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the indian sub continent fig 8a like precipitation mean annual total runoff has a large spatial variability over the isc river basins for instance the west coast river basin generate about 1928 mm mean annual total runoff based on multimodel estimates while the sabarmati basin has mean annual total runoff of 95 mm fig 8b the top three river basins based on mean annual total runoff are west coast brahmaputra and brahmani consistent with the mean annual precipitation on the other hand the top three basins with the lowest mean annual runoff are sabarmati pennar and indus fig 8b based on the multimodel estimates the three river basins with the highest mean annual et are south coast west coast and east coast while the basins with the lowest mean annual et are indus sabarmati and krishna fig 8c our multimodel estimates show that there can be considerable uncertainty in the estimate of water yield in the sub continental river basins due to hydrological models table 3 for instance both sabarmati and indus basins show uncertainty higher than 30 of long term mean water yield on the other hand brahmaputra and tapi basins showed the lowest less than 10 uncertainty in water yield the three transboundary river basins brahmaputra ganga and indus have the highest water yield of 731 9 50 2 582 4 89 4 and 231 1 71 km3 respectively our multimodel estimates of water yield for narmada godavari cauvery krishna ganga and brahmaputra differ from the estimates provided in jain 2012 for instance our ensemble mean estimates of water yield for narmada godavari cauvery krishna ganga and the brahmaputra are 48 4 130 8 16 5 67 9 582 4 and 731 9 km3 differ from the estimates 45 64 110 54 21 36 69 81 525 02 629 km3 from jain 2012 the differences in the estimates of water yield can be attributed to the methodology used in the two studies the budyko framework budyko 1948 budyko et al 1974 shows that only two basins west coast and the brahmaputra over the indian sub continent fall under the energy limited conditions fig 8d on the other hand the sixteen river basins are in water limited condition fig 8d the highest aridity index was found for the sabarmati river basin 4 discussion water budget components simulated from the hms showed pronounced variations which could be associated with the uncertainties involved in model parameters input datasets and representation of physical processes in the hms telteu et al 2021 zhou and huang 2012 we used the same meteorological forcing in all the five hms as the accuracy of meteorological forcing plays an important role in the water budget estimation from hms for instance precipitation and radiation can contribute significantly to errors and uncertainty in et estimates zhang et al 2016 zhou and huang 2012 moreover et can also be influenced by the static inputs associated with soil and vegetation parameters haddeland et al 2010 hagemann et al 2013 telteu et al 2021 different hms use different methods to estimate et which can also contribute to the variations in the water budget estimates for instance the vic and cwatm compute et using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 yang and dickinson 1996 while h08 uses the bulk transfer approach dalton 1802 on the other hand the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator has been used for et estimation in clm and noah mp chen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 similarly different runoff schemes in the models can also contribute to intermodal variation in mean annual runoff estimations in the isc river basins table s2 besides the meteorological forcing and static inputs model calibration can also contribute to water budget estimates we manually calibrated and evaluated the hms in the sub continental river basins against the observed streamflow and satellite based et and soil moisture however the performance of the calibrated models can lead to errors and uncertainty in the water budget estimates while elevation and soil parameters were obtained from similar sources for all the hms table s1 there is a considerable difference in land use land cover input that can also contribute to uncertainty in the water budget estimates zhou and huang 2012 the multimodel ensemble mean outperforms individual hms for streamflow et and soil moisture previous studies reported that combining individual hms improves estimates of hydrological variables by reducing uncertainties gudmundsson et al 2012 xia et al 2012c xia et al 2012a multimodel ensemble means provides better estimates of water budget over the indian sub continent which can help indian decision makers to plan water resources management previous efforts on the hydrological model intercomparison did not use calibrated hydrological models vetter et al 2015 our estimates are based on the calibrated models as hms simulations are improved using well calibrated model parameters furthermore developing an efficient parameter estimation scheme can reduce errors that could arise from the model parameters however there is difficulty obtaining reliable benchmark data for model calibration telteu et al 2021 for instance many river basins in the indian sub continent are highly affected by human interventions reservoir storage and irrigation which can significantly affect the water budget shah et al 2019 shah et al 2019 reported a considerable increase in et due to irrigation over the indo gangetic plain we did not simulate the influence of human interventions to estimate the water budget in the indian sub continent as not all the hms realistically represent the influence of reservoirs irrigation and groundwater pumping the other reason for not simulating the role of human interventions is the lack of reliable long term observations of irrigation water use cropping patterns and storage and diversions therefore future work may be dedicated to estimating human influence on water availability and water budget over the sub continental river basins using multiple hydrologic models we demonstrated that no single model outperforms others across the isc river basins among the five hydrological models used in our study in addition there is considerable variability in the performance of the hydrological models in simulating the water budget components we showed that the multimodel estimates based on the five hydrological models could better estimate the water budget in the isc river basins therefore the water budget estimated based on the ensemble mean of models can be more reliable than the single hydrological models without proper calibration and evaluation the hydrological models can also lead to considerable uncertainty in the water budget estimates therefore it is essential to evaluate the models performance against observed streamflow at multiple locations and against spatially distributed satellite observations since water budget estimates provide critical information for the water resources planning and management care must be taken while using the estimates with high uncertainty that could arise due to a hydrologic model input datasets and model parameterizations zhou and huang 2012 in addition there are water budget estimates available based on the past observations substantial changes in climate and land use land cover over the isc river basins need to be considered in water budget estimates before planning 5 conclusions we used five hydrological models to estimate the water budget in the isc river basins considering the considerable uncertainty highlighted in the previous studies jain et al 2007 narasimhan 2008 planning commission 2007 shah and mishra 2016 water budget estimates based on the multiple hydrological models are required based on our findings the major conclusions are the following we calibrated and evaluated five hydrological models using observed streamflow and satellite based et and soil moisture models showed good performance against the observed monthly streamflow however all the hydrological models performed poorly in the coastal river basins moreover no single hydrological model performed better than the other models across the isc river basins and hydrological variables in addition none of the hydrological models showed better performance for all the water budget components in the sub continental river basins the multimodel ensemble mean of the five hydrological models performed better than the individual models for et and soil moisture across the isc river basins therefore considering multiple hydrological models can provide more reliable estimates of the water budget and water yield hydrological model based estimates of mean annual total runoff showed a significant uncertainty in indus sabarmati east coast and krishna river basins while ganga godavari narmada and tapi river basins exhibited relatively lower uncertainty in total runoff multimodel ensemble mean can be considered a more robust estimate of mean annual total runoff than the individual hms in most river basins west coast brahmaputra and brahmani are the three wettest river basins at the same time sabarmati indus and pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the indian sub continent the budyko framework showed that only two basins west coast and the brahmaputra over the indian sub continent fall under the energy limited conditions in comparison the sixteen river basins are in water limited condition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4050,estimation of the water budget is essential for water resources and environmental management however a reliable assessment of the water budget and water yield for the indian sub continental river basins has been lacking we used 0 25 gridded meteorological observations and five hydrological models to construct water budget estimates for the indian sub continental river basins for the 1951 2016 period the hydrological models i e vic clm noah mp h08 and cwatm were calibrated against observed streamflow and evaluated for evapotranspiration et and soil moisture considerable uncertainty in the water budget components et and total runoff was found due to the process representation and parameterization of hydrological models multimodel ensemble mean of the five hydrological models performed better than individual models for most basins for water budget components west coast brahmaputra and brahmani are the three wettest river basins at the same time sabarmati indus and pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the indian sub continent the three transboundary river basins brahmaputra ganga and indus have the highest water yield of 731 9 50 2 582 4 89 4 and 231 1 71 km3 respectively the budyko framework showed that only two basins west coast and the brahmaputra over the indian sub continent fall under the energy limited relatively lower atmospheric water demands conditions in comparison the other sixteen river basins are in water limited higher atmospheric water demands condition our findings have implications for water resources planning and management in one of the world s most populated regions keywords multimodel water budget streamflow intercomparison water yield 1 introduction the hydrological cycle is a crucial component of the earth system which is projected to intensify under the warming climate huntington 2006 an intensified hydrological cycle faster rate of evaporation may cause unusual dry and wet extreme events dai et al 2016 wu et al 2013 moreover anthropogenic climate change and other factors such as aerosols land use change and irrigation can also significantly impact water budget components huntington 2006 recent studies show an increasing frequency of hydrological extremes due to climate warming ali et al 2019 gudmundsson et al 2021 trenberth 2011 nonetheless river discharge and water availability remain the two major indicators of the changes in the hydrological cycle over land however internal climate variability observational errors and other factors aerosols irrigation and land use change cause considerable uncertainty limiting the confidence in attributing the changes in the hydrological cycle to anthropogenic climate change hegerl et al 2015 estimating the water budget at the river basin scale is critical for understanding water availability and water management under the observed and future climate water budget components can be obtained by ground based monitoring stations and satellite based precipitation and et estimates sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2014 however a significant bias in satellite precipitation can lead to overestimation in streamflow gao et al 2010 sheffield et al 2009 and erroneous estimates of water availability sahoo et al 2011 similar to precipitation estimates there can be considerable uncertainty in et estimates based on different sources for instance long et al 2014 reported that uncertainty in et is the lowest moderate and highest when estimated using land surface models satellite moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace respectively a large part of the uncertainty in remote sensing based et estimates depends on the choice of vegetation parameterization while additional uncertainty comes from sources of net radiation ferguson et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 similarly satellite based soil moisture estimates also show considerable uncertainty dorigo et al 2017 wanders et al 2012 wanders et al 2014 showed the benefits of using remotely sensed soil moisture for parameter identification of hydrological models moreover uncertainty in individual water budget components can be higher than the measured streamflow due to process algorithms and input data sheffield et al 2009 hydrological models are often used for the estimation of water budget components and water scarcity at the river basin scale to overcome the issues in the in situ observations and satellite based estimates in water budget closure martin et al 2016 hydrological models have shown their global significance in understanding land surface processes and estimation of water availability baroni et al 2019 zhao and li 2015 hydrological models can have uncertainty in estimating water cycle components resulting from parametrization and process representation schmied et al 2014 for instance hydrological models represent various components of the land and atmosphere in different ways bonan et al 2011 niu et al 2011 the differences in model performance arise primarily due to the representation of physical processes assumptions and input forcing cailliez and pernot 2011 therefore understanding the differences in the models estimates of the water budget is essential niraula et al 2017 water budget estimates based on the multiple hydrological models with good performance may be more reliable than an individual hydrological model for instance the multimodel ensemble approach outperforms the individual models by minimizing the model error uncertainty kumar et al 2017 therefore the ensemble modelling approach has been used to estimate water scarcity schewe et al 2014 floods dankers et al 2014 and water budget cai et al 2014 the usefulness of the multimodel ensemble approach has been demonstrated at the global scale schewe et al 2014 warszawski et al 2014 however efforts related to hydrological model intercomparison for water budget in the indian sub continent have been lacking moreover hydrological models in the global model intercomparison projects are often not calibrated at river basin scales schewe et al 2014 several hydrological models including the variable infiltration capacity vic model behera et al 2019 mishra et al 2018 soil water assessment tool swat desai et al 2021 mishra and lilhare 2016 community land model clm mishra et al 2018 tiwari et al 2009 and noah mp ali et al 2019 have been applied over the indian sub continental isc hereafter river basins for different hydrological applications most previous hydrological modelling studies were limited to only a single hydrological model except mishra et al 2018 intercomparison of hydrological models directed towards specific aims has been limited over the isc river basins mishra et al 2018 reconstructed agricultural droughts over india using soil moisture simulations uncertainty in drought estimation can be reduced using the ensemble mean from the three hydrological models over india mishra et al 2018 despite the considerable uncertainty in the water budget estimates over the isc river basins planning commission 2007 narasimhan 2008 yoon et al 2019 the efforts towards a multimodel based estimate of the water budget have been lacking narasimhan 2008 showed that an estimate of et 40 of total precipitation is considerably underestimated by the planning commission 2007 on the other hand jain 2012 reported et as 23 of total precipitation in the ganga river basin shah and mishra 2016 used the vic model to show that mean annual et and total runoff over the indian sub continent are 48 and 52 of total precipitation respectively here we estimate the water budget and water availability in the isc river basins using five hydrological models clm h08 noah mp vic and cwatm all the five models are physics based consider distributed input of soil and vegetation and simulates water and energy budget for each grid the scientific questions we address are i does the ensemble mean of the five hydrological models perform better than the individual models for the water budget components ii which are the river basins that show higher inter model uncertainty in the water budget estimates 2 methodology 2 1 observed and reanalysis data daily gridded precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures were obtained from the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 for the 1951 2016 period for the indian region the gridded precipitation was developed at 0 25 spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method shepard 1968 based on more than 6500 rain gauge stations situated across india pai et al 2015 pai et al 2014 the gridded precipitation captures the spatial variability of the summer monsoon june september rainfall in india pai et al 2014 we obtained gridded daily minimum and maximum temperatures from imd which were developed at 1 spatial resolution using 395 gage stations located across india daily minimum and maximum temperatures were further re gridded at 0 25 using bi linear interpolation for the part of the transboundary river basins ganga brahmaputra and indus that falls outside india we used gridded precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures from the princeton meteorological forcing dataset sheffield et al 2006 for the same period 1951 2016 in addition to precipitation and temperature we obtained gridded daily wind speed at 0 25 from the princeton meteorological dataset sheffield et al 2006 the wind direction is computed using horizontal and vertical wind components u and v which was obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis era5 c3s 2017 hersbach dee 2016 the imd and princeton datasets have been widely used for hydroclimatic assessments in the isc river basins chawla and mujumdar 2015 mahto and mishra 2019 we selected 18 river basins of the indian subcontinent for the hydrological model intercomparison for the water budget estimates fig 1 the area of these river basins varies between 0 04 and 1 12 million km2 table 3 the observed streamflow for fifteen river basins was collected from the india water resources information system india wris www indiawris gov in www indiawris gov in which is a collaborative project of the central water commission cwc and indian space research organisation isro we obtained observed streamflow for the remaining three transboundary river basins indus ganga and the brahmaputra from the centre for sustainability and the global environment sage https nelson wisc edu sage data and models riverdata observed streamflow for indus ganga and brahmaputra basins is not available in the public domain as it is classified the streamflow gauge stations were selected based on the availability of long term continuous data and the minimal impact of reservoir operations as mentioned in shah and mishra 2016 fig 1 we obtained gridded et and soil moisture from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 2 which is available at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolutions the gleam dataset provides different hydrological cycle components martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 which have been used globally schellekens et al 2017 the gleam et estimates are based on priestley and taylor s method miralles et al 2011 et from the gleam was evaluated against 91 eddy covariance towers around the world martens et al 2017 which compares well against the flux tower dataset in addition we obtained et from modis to evaluate the hydrological models we used monthly et from modis mod16et for the period 2000 2007 et and soil moisture based on satellite data have been used to evaluate the hydrologic models in india mishra et al 2016 shah and mishra 2016 land use land cover lulc and soil information are crucial for hydrological modelling we used lulc and soil data as per the requirements of the hydrological models table s1 2 2 hydrological models we used five hydrological models hms hereafter namely vic cherkauer et al 2003 liang et al 1996 noah mp niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 clm lawrence et al 2019 vertenstein et al 2004 h08 hanasaki et al 2018 and cwatm burek et al 2020 to examine their performance for water budget in the isc river basins we used the same meteorological forcing in all the hms and simulations were conducted for the 1951 2016 period at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolutions the descriptions specifications and physical processes of the individual models are discussed in the following sections table s2 2 2 1 the variable infiltration capacity vic model the vic model liang et al 1996 is a semi distributed physically based macroscale hydrological model that simulates water and surface energy fluxes daily or sub daily time step in each grid cell the vic model considers vegetation and soil parameters and meteorological forcings as inputs using the penman monteith method monteith 1965 penman 1948 the vic model calculates total et as the sum of the canopy and bare soil evaporation and transpiration from vegetation mosaics runoff in the vic model is estimated using the variable infiltration capacity curve while soil moisture is calculated using richard s equation the arno model formulation is used to estimate baseflow from the bottom layer franchini and pacciani 1991 the avhrr of the noaa was used to obtain land cover parameters for the vic model the vic model s soil parameters were developed using the harmonised world soil database hwsd the vic model uses daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures and wind speed as input meteorological forcing simulated runoff and baseflow from each grid cell were routed using a standalone routing model lohmann 1996 previous studies can provide more details on the calibration of the vic model gao et al 2010 shah and mishra 2016 2 2 2 the h08 model the h08 h zero 8 is a grid based global hydrological model with six main modules land surface reservoir operation river routing environmental flow estimation crop growth and anthropogenic water withdrawal hanasaki et al 2008 recently six more schemes have been implemented in the coupled h08 model hanasaki et al 2018 in the coupled h08 model the influence of cropping intensity and irrigation efficiency döll and siebert 2002 cropland and pasture area ramankutty et al 2008 harvested area for each crop monfreda et al 2008 and irrigation based on the global map of irrigated areas gmia v5 siebert et al 2010 have been incorporated each grid cell in the h08 can be divided into fractions of double crop irrigated cropland rainfed cropland single crop irrigated cropland and other land use types et in the h08 model is estimated using the bulk transfer approach dalton 1802 while soil moisture is based on the soil water balance approach hanasaki et al 2008 the h08 model estimates runoff based on saturation excess non linear flow while baseflow is calculated using a leaky bucket model hanasaki et al 2008 streamflow routing in the h08 model is based on total runoff integrated pathways trip oki and sud 1998 cropland in the h08 model is based on ramankutty and foley 1998 while irrigated and crop type information is obtained from monfreda et al 2008 and siebert et al 2010 soil parameters to run the h08 model were estimated using the hwsd the h08 model uses precipitation air temperature short and longwave radiations wind speed surface pressure and specific humidity as meteorological forcing coupled h08 model framework is used to simulate the hydrological processes and the anthropogenic water use at regional and global scales hanasaki et al 2018 the h08 model is used to assess the water resources including agricultural water withdrawals hanasaki et al 2008 and virtual water flow hanasaki et al 2010 2 2 3 community land model clm the community land model clm3 0 is a component of the community earth system model oleson 2004 which was developed by the national centre for atmospheric research ncar in collaboration with the climate and global dynamics division cgd and terrestrial sciences section tss the key feature that makes clm3 0 different from the other hydrological models is the coupling with individual schemes such as topmodel clm uses the topmodel based scheme for runoff generation developed by beven and kirkby 1979 clm also represents frozen soil and groundwater as reported in niu et al 2007 niu et al 2005 clm3 0 includes 17 plant functional types pfts ten soil layers at different depths with an improved canopy interception scheme land cover data for clm are based on noaa avhrr and modis bonan et al 2002b oleson and bonan 2000 bonan et al 2002a soil parameters for the clm model are derived from food and agricultural organization fao dickinson et al 1993 zeng et al 2002 clm takes precipitation air temperature short and longwave radiation surface pressure wind speed and specific humidity as meteorological inputs besides the capability of providing soil moisture at ten different depths a good representation of a groundwater table in clm is available which fluctuates dynamically especially during heavy groundwater pumping niu et al 2007 et in clm is estimated using the boreal ecosystem simulator chen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 while soil moisture estimates are based on richard s equation oleson 2004 runoff and baseflow are simulated using the topmodel approach beven and kirkby 1979 table s2 after simulating runoff and baseflow for each grid we used a standalone routing model lohmann et al 1996 to obtain streamflow at desired locations in the isc river basins 2 2 4 noah multi parameterization land surface model noah mp noah mp is a new generation hydrological model hm with multiple physics options for different land atmospheric interaction processes niu et al 2011 noah mp is developed by the ncar national centre for environmental prediction ncep national aeronautics and space administration nasa and university groups under the combined effort noah mp integrates the recently improved physics based schemes from the different land surface models niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 noah mp is an improved physics version of the noah land surface model noah lsm we used the one dimensional noah mp model version 3 1 which simulates each grid cell s water and energy fluxes soil parameters for the noah mp model are based on the statsgo and fao the noah mp model considers precipitation wind speed air temperature humidity short and longwave radiations pressure and wind direction as meteorological forcing lulc for noah mp is acquired from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp loveland and belward 1997 sulla and friedl 2018 multiple schemes are available in noah mp with the default topmodel scheme to simulate hydrological variables niu et al 2007 the noah mp model estimates surface runoff based on the exponential distribution of the infiltration capacity a proportionality function based on soil moisture storage is used to estimate the baseflow in noah mp noah mp uses the spatial variability in precipitation and infiltration to estimate the different runoff components et in noah mp is estimated using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator liu et al 2003 yang et al 2011 table s2 soil moisture and runoff baseflow are estimated based on richard s equation niu et al 2011 and simtop schemes niu et al 2005 respectively we used a standalone routing model lohmann et al 1996 for streamflow routing we calibrated the noah mp using the depth of four soil layers the zilintikevich coefficient a surface runoff parameter and a bare soil evaporation component mishra et al 2018 niu et al 2011 2 2 5 community water model cwatm the cwatm is an integrated hydrological and channel routing model which is developed at the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa burek et al 2020 cwatm simulates surface and groundwater processes for each grid at 1 km to 50 km at daily time steps the cwatm model framework considers human activities e g water use groundwater pumping reservoir regulations and irrigation in simulating hydrological variables the cwatm solves water and energy budget components using a physics based module et in cwatm is estimated using penman monteith allen et al 1998 table s2 while soil moisture is estimated using van genuchten simplification van genuchten 1980 cwatm estimates runoff using a triangular weighting function as described in burek et al 2020 baseflow in cwatm is calculated using a linear reservoir approach roo et al 2000 cwatm uses the saint venant equation for river routing lulc classes used in cwatm are obtained from different sources for instance forest land cover is based on hansen et al 2013 while the impervious area is obtained from elvidge et al 2007 the irrigated area in the model is based on siebert et al 2010 soil parameters for cwatm are developed using the hwsd the cwatm takes daily precipitation temperature shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed and humidity as meteorological inputs further details can be obtained from burek et al 2020 2 3 analysis approach we calibrated and evaluated all the five hydrological models for 18 major river basins in india fig 1 the models were manually calibrated by adjusting the calibration parameters for each model table s5 against the monthly observed streamflow at the selected locations we selected the streamflow gauge stations to calibrate the hydrological models that were not considerably affected by major reservoirs shah and mishra 2016 the calibration period was not the same for all the river basins which varied based on the availability of the observed streamflow after the calibration all the hydrological models were evaluated against the observed monthly streamflow at the same locations but for a different period we further examined the models performance against satellite based et and soil moisture across the isc river basins as streamflow was calibrated at the stations that are not necessarily located at the outlet of the river basins we evaluated the simulated et model against gleam and modis whereas soil moisture against gleam data in addition evaluating the hydrological models at multiple locations and for numerous variables is better than the calibration and evaluation against the single observed variable krysanova et al 2018 mishra et al 2020 the performance of hydrological models against observed streamflow was estimated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse we compared the water budget for all the 18 isc river basins from all the five hydrological models after calibration and evaluation we estimated basin averaged mean annual et and total runoff tr to compare the water budget components the river basin scale uncertainty in the water budget components was estimated considering one standard deviation of the five hydrological models estimates further we compared model estimates for streamflow and et simulations using the coefficient of correlation r root means square error rmse bias and overall score graham et al 2019 the overall score combines several statistical measures and provides a single measure to understand the suitability of the hydrological models and can be estimated using the following equation 1 overall score r 1 abs bias range 1 root mean square error range x10 3 range is the difference between the minimum and maximum values of the observed datasets we also analyzed the ensemble mean of all models for all the variables i e streamflow total runoff et soil moisture we estimated potential evapotranspiration pet using penman monteith zotarelli et al 2010 method all the variables required for pet estimation were obtained from the era5 reanalysis 2 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pet is the reference evapotranspiration rate mm d 1 t is mean air temperature c and u2 refers to wind speed m s 1 at 2 m above the ground 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation first we calibrated and evaluated all the five hydrological models against the observed flow for all the 18 sub continental river basins fig 1 we find that nse is higher than 0 7 for 15 15 14 11 14 11 12 14 and 10 8 river basins during calibration evaluation for clm h08 noah mp vic and cwatm respectively fig 2 a b fig s1 s5 table 1 all the five hms showed a better agreement for the ganga nse 0 8 basin on the other hand all the hms performed poorly nse 0 7 in the south coast river basin fig 2 table 1 the vic model outperformed the other hms in krishna narmada and pennar river basins fig 2 table 1 similarly h08 performed better in ganga mahi subarnarekha and tapi river basins than the other hms table 1 on the other hand the noah mp performed better than other hms in cauvery east coast and ganga river basins we find a lower performance in the coastal basins cauvery east coast and south coast from all the hms fig 2a b and table 1 we note a good agreement among the hms in the three major transboundary river basins i e indus ganga and the brahmaputra among all the five hms the clm showed the best agreement with the observed streamflow on the other hand the cwatm showed a poorer agreement for the observed monthly flow among all the five hms figs 2a b and and s1 s5 our results show no single hydrological model that performs better than the other hms across the isc river basins we used the coefficient of correlation r to assess the performance of individual hms and the ensemble mean of all the five hms for et and sm fig 2c d we compared the monthly simulated et from all the hms against monthly et from modis and gleam for the 2000 to 2007 period figs 2c and s6 all the hms capture et s temporal dynamics and seasonal cycle fig s7 our results show that the hms simulated et is in good agreement r 0 8 against modis and gleam based et for the majority of the river basins except for the coastal basins table s3 and fig 2c the vic noah mp and cwatm underestimated et in the west coast and the brahmaputra river basins fig s2 on the other hand the cwatm overestimated et in narmada and mahi basins located in the semi arid regions of western india compared to the other hms h08 and vic show relatively better performance r 0 85 to simulate et against modis and gleam datasets among all the hms noah mp simulated et showed a lower agreement against et from modis and gleam in the coastal basins the relatively weaker performance of the noah mp to simulate et can be associated with the static vegetation parameters for instance yang et al 2011 reported that the dynamic vegetation model in noah mp captures seasonal dynamics and spatial variability in leaf area index and green vegetation fraction in a better manner the multimodel ensemble means et shows better skill than the individual hms by cancelling errors and uncertainties xia et al 2012 xia et al 2012b therefore the ensemble mean et from all the hms performs better than many individual models next we compared the hms simulated soil moisture with the gleam soil moisture gleam sm fig 2d we used the root zone soil moisture 60 cm for both hms simulated soil moisture and gleam soil moisture for evaluation mean correlation r for all 18 sub continental river basins was found to be 0 59 0 81 0 73 0 76 0 75 and 0 79 for the clm h08 noah mp vic cwatm and multi model ensemble mean respectively h08 showed a good agreement in all the 18 river basins with a correlation of more than 0 7 while the least agreement was found between the clm and gleam soil moisture fig 2d relatively better performance of the h08 model for soil moisture simulations can be linked with the runoff parameterization in the model which is based on the bucket model concept manabe 1969 the bucket model is a modified version of the leaky bucket in which sub surface runoff occurs continuously as soil moisture soil moisture in the h08 model is expressed as single layer reservoirs unlike other hms with soil layers the linkage between a single reservoir and subsurface runoff in the h08 might contribute to better soil moisture simulations clm overestimates soil moisture in the godavari and pennar river basins while underestimates soil moisture in the cauvery east coast mahi south coast and west coast river basins compared to soil moisture simulated from the gleam on the other hand cwatm underestimates soil moisture in the south coast and west coast basins while overestimates soil moisture in east coast and tapi river basins fig s8 noah mp underestimates soil moisture in the south coast cauvery and east coast basins the ensemble mean soil moisture from all the hms showed a better agreement against soil moisture from gleam in a few river basins compared to individual hms for tapi and narmada basins the ensemble sm showed the best correlation r 0 89 among all hms differences in lsms simulated soil moisture are associated with their soil water holding capacity mishra et al 2018 the h08 model captures the temporal dynamics of soil moisture in most of the sub continental river basins overall we find the h08 model and ensemble mean show a better performance against the gleam soil moisture in most isc river basins 3 2 multimodel estimates of water budget we compared the hms for the water budget during the 1951 2016 period in the isc river basins figs 3 7 mean annual et from the individual hms and their ensemble mean was compared against the gleam based estimates as a reference we estimated the overall score graham et al 2019 based on several performance measures to examine the performance of hms in the isc river basins see methods for details long term 1951 2016 mean monthly precipitation shows the dominance of the summer june september monsoon in the majority of the isc river basins except for the south coast east coast pennar and cauvery river basins fig s9 on the other hand south coast and indus river basins show the bi modal seasonal cycle of precipitation which can be attributed to the influence of the northeast monsoon october december and western disturbance during the winter season respectively fig 3 in addition long term annual mean precipitation is higher in the river basins located in the northeastern central and west coast regions fig s10 and table 3 most hms simulate long term mean annual et well in all the river basins in the indian sub continent fig 3 for instance the ensemble mean annual et from the five hydrological models is about 676 mm which compares well against the gleam estimates fig 3a table 2 most hms except the h08 model underestimate the mean annual et in the brahmaputra river basin fig 3b multimodel ensemble mean et is in better agreement with gleam et in eight brahmani cauvery krishna mahanadi pennar south coast subarnarekha and tapi out of 18 river basins based on the overall score fig 3 and table s4 the h08 model performs the best to simulate long term mean annual et in four brahmaputra east coast northeast coast west coast out of 18 sub continental river basins the performance of clm to simulate the mean annual et is the best in the three ganga mahi narmada river basins noah mp and cwatm perform the best only in the godavari and sabarmati river basin respectively fig 3 the vic model did not show the best performance for mean annual et in any river basins which can be linked with the representation of groundwater reservoir in the vic model in addition the performance of the land surface models to simulate et depends on the dynamic representation of vegetation cai et al 2014 consistent with our findings cai et al 2014 also reported a weaker performance of the vic model for et indus west coast and brahmaputra river basins show the highest intermodal uncertainty in mean annual et estimates table 2 on the other hand godavari pennar and tapi river basins show the least uncertainty in mean annual et estimates inter model uncertainty in mean annual et in the ganga river basin is about 10 of the long term mean table 2 our results highlight the considerable uncertainty in the et estimates because of different hydrological models in the isc river basins overall we find that the multimodel ensemble mean can provide the best estimates of mean annual et in most river basins understanding the partitioning of precipitation to et is essential for the water budget the evaporative ratio et p mean annual evaporation mean annual precipitation may vary in different hms in the sub continental river basins therefore we compared the evaporative ratio from the selected hms and their ensemble mean fig 4 table 2 most hms and their ensemble mean show a higher more than 0 7 evaporative ratio for the river basins in the semi arid and arid regions fig s11 for instance the evaporative ratio is relatively higher for the southern indus and sabarmati basins for which approximately 70 of mean annual precipitation is being used for et in contrast upper indus brahmaputra and eastern and western coastal river basins have lower less than 0 5 evaporative ratio which indicates that these river basins have either equal partitioning or dominance of total runoff fig 4 table 2 multimodal ensemble mean evaporative ratio is the lowest 28 for the west coast while the highest 78 8 for the sabarmati river basin fig 4g and table 2 the multimodel estimate of evaporative ratio for the ganga river basin is 51 5 close to the estimate 49 6 provided in shah and mishra 2016 shah and mishra 2016 used the vic model to estimate the water budget in the sub continental river basins moreover our estimates of et p is much higher than jain 2012 who found that et is about 23 of mean annual precipitation in the ganga basin similarly considerable differences in our et estimates and those from jain 2012 are found for narmada godavari cauvery krishna and indus river basins while most of the hms agree on the estimates of evaporative ratio there is relatively higher uncertainty among the hms in the brahmaputra and west coast river basins fig 4g table 2 which can be attributed to the performance of the hms in these basins fig 2 overall relatively lesser uncertainty in the estimates of evaporative ratio in most sub continental river basins shows that the ensemble mean can be a better measure than the individual hms for mean annual et fig 4 we compared the mean annual total runoff simulated from the five hms for all the 18 sub continental river basins for the 1951 2016 period fig 5 unlike et there is no standard observational product available for total runoff therefore our assessment is limited to the intercomparison of total runoff from hms and their ensemble mean the hm performs the best to simulate streamflow assuming that total runoff estimates from the same hm can be considered better than others our results show a considerable uncertainty in indus sabarmati east coast and krishna river basins in the total runoff estimates fig 5 table 2 on the other hand ganga brahmaputra godavari narmada and tapi river basins have relatively lower uncertainty in total runoff regardless of the calibration and evaluation of hms uncertainty in the estimates of mean annual total runoff can be considerable for instance the vic model has the best performance to simulate streamflow in the indus river basin compared to the vic model based estimates of mean annual total runoff there is a considerable underestimation in total runoff in the h08 model at the same time overestimation in the noah mp and cwatm simulated total runoff for the indus river basin fig 5g similarly significant differences can be seen in the estimated total runoff for sabarmati krishna and east coast river basins our results show that mean annual total runoff simulated using the different hms can have considerable uncertainty table 2 and fig 5 multimodel ensemble mean can be considered a more robust estimate of mean annual total runoff than the individual hms in most river basins fig 5 we estimated the runoff ratio tr p total runoff divided by precipitation for all the 18 isc river basins from the five hms fig 6 the runoff ratio from most of the hms is consistent with the mean annual precipitation during 1951 2016 fig 6 and fig s12 for instance upper indus ganga brahmaputra mahanadi brahmani and west coast basins have higher runoff ratios than the other basins the runoff ratio is also higher in the foothills of himalaya consistent with the higher orographic precipitation in the region figs 6 and s10 on the other hand the river basins runoff ratio in the semi arid and arid regions e g southern indus sabarmati and tapi is considerably lower 0 3 similarly the river basins located in peninsular india also show a relatively lower runoff ratio than basins located in central eastern india the runoff coefficient s magnitude and spatial pattern are consistent for most hms except cwatm fig 6 for instance the north south divide in the runoff ratio in the indus basin does not exist in the estimates based on the cwatm fig 6e moreover the river basins runoff ratio in peninsular india is also considerably higher for the cwatm than the other four hms we find that the magnitude and spatial pattern of the runoff ratio in the multimodel ensemble mean is consistent with the other four hms clm h08 noah mp and vic the four river basins with the highest runoff coefficient are brahmaputra brahmani mahanadi and west coast table 2 on the other hand the four river basins with the lowest runoff coefficient are sabarmati pennar east coast and cauvery figs 6 s12 and table 2 overall four out of five hms are consistent for runoff coefficient in the isc river basins moreover the ensemble mean of runoff ratio can provide better estimates than the individual hms in most isc river basins 3 3 intercomparison of water availability we compared the hms for basin wise water availability at the selected locations against the observed flow in the isc river basins fig 7 we find that the hms perform well in most of the river basins to simulate mean annual streamflow except for some of the coastal basins for instance the observed mean annual streamflow 12000 m3 s of the ganga basin at the farakka was well simulated by all the hms except the vic model fig 7e relatively higher intermodal uncertainty was observed for mahanadi east coast south coast north east coast and west coast basin for instance the cwatm shows a large underestimation in streamflow in the mahanadi basin at the basantpur station fig 7i similarly the h08 model underestimates the observed mean annual streamflow in the west coast and pennar basin fig 7m 7r the multimodel ensemble mean streamflow shows a better agreement against the observed streamflow for six cauvery ganga godavari narmada pennar and west coast out of 18 isc river basins based on the overall score fig 7 in comparison the vic model and clm are in good agreement with observed mean annual streamflow for five brahmani indus subarnarekha tapi and mahanadi and four krishna north east coast sabarmati and south coast basins respectively fig 7 table s4 the h08 performs the best in east coast and mahi while noah mp shows promising results in the brahmaputra table s4 overall we find that among hms the vic model performs the best however the ensemble mean performs better than the individual hms in most basins fig 7 we ranked the river basins based on mean annual precipitation total runoff and et mm during 1951 2016 to understand the basin wise water availability simulated by the individual hms we performed this analysis to examine variability in the atmospheric input precipitation atmospheric demands et and total runoff generated among the river basins in the indian sub continent in addition we used the budyko framework donohue et al 2006 roderick and farquhar 2011 which provides information on the river basins that are water or energy limited fig 8 budyko s framework compares the relationship between aridity index potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and evapotranspiration index et p pet was estimated using penman monteith method using the required variables from era5 reanalysis see methods for details to examine the variability among the basin while precipitation was obtained from imd and princeton forcing see methods for more details et simulated from different hms was used to estimate the evaporative index used in budyko s framework the domain average mean annual precipitation over the isc river basins is about 1145 mm fig 8 fig s10 however there is considerable variability in the mean annual precipitation among the river basins in the indian sub continent for instance mean annual precipitation over the isc river basins varies from 476 mm to 2699 mm fig 8 the highest mean annual precipitation occurs in the west coast basin whereas the lowest falls in sabarmati and indus basin fig 8a west coast brahmaputra and brahmani are the three wettest river basins at the same time sabarmati indus and pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the indian sub continent fig 8a like precipitation mean annual total runoff has a large spatial variability over the isc river basins for instance the west coast river basin generate about 1928 mm mean annual total runoff based on multimodel estimates while the sabarmati basin has mean annual total runoff of 95 mm fig 8b the top three river basins based on mean annual total runoff are west coast brahmaputra and brahmani consistent with the mean annual precipitation on the other hand the top three basins with the lowest mean annual runoff are sabarmati pennar and indus fig 8b based on the multimodel estimates the three river basins with the highest mean annual et are south coast west coast and east coast while the basins with the lowest mean annual et are indus sabarmati and krishna fig 8c our multimodel estimates show that there can be considerable uncertainty in the estimate of water yield in the sub continental river basins due to hydrological models table 3 for instance both sabarmati and indus basins show uncertainty higher than 30 of long term mean water yield on the other hand brahmaputra and tapi basins showed the lowest less than 10 uncertainty in water yield the three transboundary river basins brahmaputra ganga and indus have the highest water yield of 731 9 50 2 582 4 89 4 and 231 1 71 km3 respectively our multimodel estimates of water yield for narmada godavari cauvery krishna ganga and brahmaputra differ from the estimates provided in jain 2012 for instance our ensemble mean estimates of water yield for narmada godavari cauvery krishna ganga and the brahmaputra are 48 4 130 8 16 5 67 9 582 4 and 731 9 km3 differ from the estimates 45 64 110 54 21 36 69 81 525 02 629 km3 from jain 2012 the differences in the estimates of water yield can be attributed to the methodology used in the two studies the budyko framework budyko 1948 budyko et al 1974 shows that only two basins west coast and the brahmaputra over the indian sub continent fall under the energy limited conditions fig 8d on the other hand the sixteen river basins are in water limited condition fig 8d the highest aridity index was found for the sabarmati river basin 4 discussion water budget components simulated from the hms showed pronounced variations which could be associated with the uncertainties involved in model parameters input datasets and representation of physical processes in the hms telteu et al 2021 zhou and huang 2012 we used the same meteorological forcing in all the five hms as the accuracy of meteorological forcing plays an important role in the water budget estimation from hms for instance precipitation and radiation can contribute significantly to errors and uncertainty in et estimates zhang et al 2016 zhou and huang 2012 moreover et can also be influenced by the static inputs associated with soil and vegetation parameters haddeland et al 2010 hagemann et al 2013 telteu et al 2021 different hms use different methods to estimate et which can also contribute to the variations in the water budget estimates for instance the vic and cwatm compute et using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 yang and dickinson 1996 while h08 uses the bulk transfer approach dalton 1802 on the other hand the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator has been used for et estimation in clm and noah mp chen et al 2013 liu et al 2003 similarly different runoff schemes in the models can also contribute to intermodal variation in mean annual runoff estimations in the isc river basins table s2 besides the meteorological forcing and static inputs model calibration can also contribute to water budget estimates we manually calibrated and evaluated the hms in the sub continental river basins against the observed streamflow and satellite based et and soil moisture however the performance of the calibrated models can lead to errors and uncertainty in the water budget estimates while elevation and soil parameters were obtained from similar sources for all the hms table s1 there is a considerable difference in land use land cover input that can also contribute to uncertainty in the water budget estimates zhou and huang 2012 the multimodel ensemble mean outperforms individual hms for streamflow et and soil moisture previous studies reported that combining individual hms improves estimates of hydrological variables by reducing uncertainties gudmundsson et al 2012 xia et al 2012c xia et al 2012a multimodel ensemble means provides better estimates of water budget over the indian sub continent which can help indian decision makers to plan water resources management previous efforts on the hydrological model intercomparison did not use calibrated hydrological models vetter et al 2015 our estimates are based on the calibrated models as hms simulations are improved using well calibrated model parameters furthermore developing an efficient parameter estimation scheme can reduce errors that could arise from the model parameters however there is difficulty obtaining reliable benchmark data for model calibration telteu et al 2021 for instance many river basins in the indian sub continent are highly affected by human interventions reservoir storage and irrigation which can significantly affect the water budget shah et al 2019 shah et al 2019 reported a considerable increase in et due to irrigation over the indo gangetic plain we did not simulate the influence of human interventions to estimate the water budget in the indian sub continent as not all the hms realistically represent the influence of reservoirs irrigation and groundwater pumping the other reason for not simulating the role of human interventions is the lack of reliable long term observations of irrigation water use cropping patterns and storage and diversions therefore future work may be dedicated to estimating human influence on water availability and water budget over the sub continental river basins using multiple hydrologic models we demonstrated that no single model outperforms others across the isc river basins among the five hydrological models used in our study in addition there is considerable variability in the performance of the hydrological models in simulating the water budget components we showed that the multimodel estimates based on the five hydrological models could better estimate the water budget in the isc river basins therefore the water budget estimated based on the ensemble mean of models can be more reliable than the single hydrological models without proper calibration and evaluation the hydrological models can also lead to considerable uncertainty in the water budget estimates therefore it is essential to evaluate the models performance against observed streamflow at multiple locations and against spatially distributed satellite observations since water budget estimates provide critical information for the water resources planning and management care must be taken while using the estimates with high uncertainty that could arise due to a hydrologic model input datasets and model parameterizations zhou and huang 2012 in addition there are water budget estimates available based on the past observations substantial changes in climate and land use land cover over the isc river basins need to be considered in water budget estimates before planning 5 conclusions we used five hydrological models to estimate the water budget in the isc river basins considering the considerable uncertainty highlighted in the previous studies jain et al 2007 narasimhan 2008 planning commission 2007 shah and mishra 2016 water budget estimates based on the multiple hydrological models are required based on our findings the major conclusions are the following we calibrated and evaluated five hydrological models using observed streamflow and satellite based et and soil moisture models showed good performance against the observed monthly streamflow however all the hydrological models performed poorly in the coastal river basins moreover no single hydrological model performed better than the other models across the isc river basins and hydrological variables in addition none of the hydrological models showed better performance for all the water budget components in the sub continental river basins the multimodel ensemble mean of the five hydrological models performed better than the individual models for et and soil moisture across the isc river basins therefore considering multiple hydrological models can provide more reliable estimates of the water budget and water yield hydrological model based estimates of mean annual total runoff showed a significant uncertainty in indus sabarmati east coast and krishna river basins while ganga godavari narmada and tapi river basins exhibited relatively lower uncertainty in total runoff multimodel ensemble mean can be considered a more robust estimate of mean annual total runoff than the individual hms in most river basins west coast brahmaputra and brahmani are the three wettest river basins at the same time sabarmati indus and pennar are the three driest basins in terms of mean annual precipitation in the indian sub continent the budyko framework showed that only two basins west coast and the brahmaputra over the indian sub continent fall under the energy limited conditions in comparison the sixteen river basins are in water limited condition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4051,pakistan relies greatly on the water of the upper indus basin uib for its vast agriculture in the indus basin irrigation system ibis there are already concerns about the extent of unsustainable water use in the ibis particularly of groundwater and these concerns are likely to increase in the future due to population increase and associated increased demand for food in addition climate change continuing reservoir sedimentation in the major dams and other impacts on water supply and demand are likely to have an impact on the practical implementation of the landmark inter provincial water apportionment accord the accord which governs surface water allocation in the ibis there is therefore a need to assess the sustainability of irrigation in light of the potential variations of water availability in the basin under a series of plausible climate change and reservoir sedimentation scenarios in this paper we examine the impact of continuing reservoir sedimentation and climate change by 2050 on the water balance of canal commands in the ibis firstly we used a river system model the first to include water management rules as in the accord to propagate climate induced changes on flows in the uib and their impact on ibis flow regulation and canal deliveries icw with and without reservoir sedimentation secondly we used a selection of general circulation models gcms that showed skill at simulating the local climate of the ibis to assess the projected changes to rainfall pn and evapotranspiration eta the analysis revealed that water balances in ibis canal command areas are more significantly affected by changed inflows from the uib than by localised climate induced changes i e pn and eta continuing reservoir sedimentation in the dams to 2050 will diminish the capacity of the system to store flows during the wet summer kharif season for its later release in the dry winter rabi season this will decrease the supply of icw in the rabi season to the downstream ibis areas in sindh and balochistan provinces and potentially increase supplies in the kharif season the impact of reservoir sedimentation on the rabi water supply 33 mm 13 decrease in median i cw equivalent to 1 89 km3 is greater than the impact of projected localised climate change within the ibis 2 mm 12 decrease in median pn equivalent to 0 13 km3 sedimentation combined with climate change decreases the median icw by 51 mm 20 equivalent to 2 91 km3 in rabi in the low flow scenario and increases it by 48 mm 8 equivalent to 2 72 km3 in kharif in the high flow scenario in the upstream punjab province however reservoir sedimentation will have limited impact by 2050 due to lower eta in rabi and the availability of groundwater continued reservoir sedimentation beyond 2050 will also affect punjab again diminishing the supply of icw in rabi and increasing it in kharif concurrently declining icw could lead to a substantial reduction in crop areas in the rabi season to avoid this undesirable scenario pakistan needs to explore both demand and supply management options to achieve food and economic security as well as controlling sedimentation rates in reservoirs keywords water accounting climate change hydrological extremes water outlook irrigation food security 1 introduction many major food and fibre producing irrigation basins and regions around the world face multiple challenges including aging irrigation infrastructure ward 2010 unsustainable surface water diversion wada et al 2014 increasing and often unsustainable groundwater withdrawals aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 and competition from other water uses such as domestic and environmental uses gorelick and zheng 2015 at the same time demand for food and fibre and hence irrigation water is increasing with population growth ibarrola rivas et al 2017 and food consumption habits are changing as societies become more affluent and urbanised climate change is projected to exacerbate these challenges elliott et al 2014 our focus is the indus basin in pakistan which faces all of the challenges noted above immerzeel and bierkens 2012 assessed the basin as the most vulnerable in asia in terms of water availability we seek to understand the potential changes to water availability across the irrigation canal commands of the basin to build up a regional and national picture and thence to assess policy and management options for future water and food security in pakistan we anticipate that lessons from the indus basin will have application in many other basins pakistan s food and fibre depend heavily on irrigated agriculture in the indus basin irrigation system ibis irrigation in the ibis relies on surface inflows from the upper indus basin uib and their regulation and distribution according to the 1991 inter provincial water apportionment accord government of pakistan 1991 1992 in fresh groundwater quality areas generally in the upstream punjab province surface water supplies are supplemented with groundwater to meet the irrigation requirement and expand irrigated areas in the downstream province of sindh groundwater use is limited due to salinity there are concerns over unsustainable water use in some parts of the ibis and even on the adequacy of water supplies for current uses ahmad et al 2007 ahmad et al 2021 kirby et al 2017 these concerns which cover both the adequacy of surface water supplies and the sustainability of groundwater use are likely to grow as a growing population demands more food and hence more irrigation water kirby et al 2017 lytton et al 2021 qureshi 2011 2020 watto and mugera 2016 yang et al 2014 ahmad et al 2021 recently presented a unique study on the water balances in the main canal commands of the ibis and their annual hydrological year from 1 april to next 31 march trends from 1981 82 to 2012 13 one of the main conclusions was that many canal commands in punjab province showed increasingly unsustainable water use over that period resulting partly from a decline in surface water deliveries via the canal system and partly from increases in evapotranspiration due to the increase in area of irrigated crops given the high dependence of pakistan on the ibis for food it is important to understand the potential impact of climate change on future water availability and demand and how this may place further pressure on the sustainability of existing surface and groundwater resources there are many studies on climate change in the indus river basin and the potential impact on the flows of the indus river see the review by charles 2016 temperatures have increased over the indus basin over recent decades particularly at the higher altitudes in the uib whereas changes in rainfall show no consistent trend across the basin or with time charles 2016 climate change will likely result in increasing temperatures across the basin particularly at higher altitudes anjum et al 2021 charles 2016 shrestha et al 2019 this is projected to result in more glacier melting for the next few decades although the overall impacts of climate change on flows in the indus river are highly uncertain lutz et al 2016 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 the general expectation is for greater flows in the next few decades immerzeel and bierkens 2012 khan et al 2020 lutz et al 2016 nepal and shrestha 2015 yu et al 2013 and decreased flows in the longer term laghari et al 2012 lutz et al 2016 while rainfall projections are uncertain rajbhandari et al 2015 suggest that rainfall will increase over the uib but decrease over the ibis on the other hand archer et al 2010 suggest that rainfall may increase over the ibis particularly in the wet summer kharif season the volume and timing of the supply of water to the ibis both rely on water storage in the major tarbela and mangla reservoirs capacity 16 km3 however there is continuing sedimentation of these reservoirs fodp wstf 2012 wapda 2020 unpublished results which has already resulted in less water storage volume in the indus basin archer et al 2010 haqraratnain 1994 morris 2018 podger et al 2021 roca 2012 the objective of this paper is to examine the likely provincial scale impacts on water availability and demand in the canal commands of the ibis under scenarios of reservoir sedimentation and their interaction with and without climate change we further examine the potential changes to crop areas implied by the changing balance of water supply and demand we use the historical canal command water balances of ahmad et al 2021 as a baseline the drivers of change on irrigation supply considered here are i continuing reservoir sedimentation and operation under the accord principles ii projected climate change impacts on the inflows from the uib into the ibis iii projected climate change impacts on rainfall and evapotranspiration i e changes in local hydrology within the ibis and iv the implications of changes in the water balance for potential changes to areas of irrigated crops in the ibis we are not aware of any other study that presents such a comprehensive picture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is presented in fig 1 and shows the ibis canal commands of punjab and sindh and balochistan hereafter sindh balochistan in the ibis plains the climate of this region is semi arid and typically represents the low lying interior of the indo pakistan sub continent temperature and rainfall show large seasonal fluctuations within the basin the summer is long and hot lasting from april through to september with maximum air temperature ranging from 21 c to 49 c winter lasts from december through to february with maximum air temperature ranging from 25 c to 27 c during the day and sometimes falling below zero at night the mean annual rainfall in the ibis is about 250 mm year of which about 75 occurs between june and september which coincides with the peak inflows from the mountainous regions of the uib lutz et al 2016 stewart et al 2020 stewart et al 2018 yang et al 2014 due to the low and variable rainfall year round agriculture is only possible through irrigation which is allocated in accordance with the accord and supplied through a gravity fed upstream control irrigation system the key infrastructure of the ibis consists of two large surface supply storages tarbela capacity of 7 38 km3 in 2020 and mangla capacity of 9 08 km3 in 2018 and a network of regulating infrastructure including chashma barrage capacity of 0 34 km3 and 15 other headworks controlling flows to 12 inter river link canals and 48 irrigation canals fig 1 based on time series transboundary inflow data for the 1976 2019 hydrological years 1 april to 31 march the chenab jhelum indus and kabul rivers provide approximately 159 3 km3 per year to the ibis indus river system authority irsa unpublished data from 2020 whereas flows from the eastern sutlej beas and ravi rivers contribute approximately 7 8 km3 per year into the ibis the majority of upstream flows in these eastern rivers are diverted within india as per the indus water treaty united nations 1960 due to variations in flow regime in each tributary and limited storage capacity irsa apportions the available water between different provinces through a complex reservoir operation and allocation process while ensuring equity in the indus and jhelum chenab management zones within the ibis fig 1 and minimising temporal variations within a growing season indus river system authority 2020 podger et al 2021 approximately 71 of the mean annual flow of the river network is diverted for agricultural and domestic use purposes ahmad et al 2021 excess flows above surface storage and canal diversion capacity flow below kotri barrage the end of system to the arabian sea the indus river and its tributaries supply approximately 60 of the total water used for irrigation in the ibis and the remaining is sourced from groundwater to meet evapotranspiration demand ahmad et al 2021 kirby et al 2017 predominantly in the fresh groundwater quality regions of punjab and small isolated pockets of sindh province ahmad et al 2014 the prevailing temperature and rainfall patterns govern two distinct cropping seasons the wet summer kharif april to september and dry rabi october to march wheat and fodder are the dominant crops during the dry rabi winter season among other main crops cotton rice maize and fodder are produced during the wet kharif summer season whereas sugarcane is an annual crop 2 2 data in this study we have used the time series datasets describing water flow and climate from ahmad et al 2021 and podger et al 2021 to represent the historical baseline for 1990 91 to 2012 13 this includes daily observed precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures obtained from the pakistan meteorological department and the water and power development authority wapda daily inflow data at remote inflow measurement rim stations at tarbela mangla nowshera balloki and sulemanki as shown in fig 1 and end of system outflow at kotri from wapda 10 day flow volume datasets obtained from wapda and irsa were used for data gap filling daily canal diversion data for all ibis canals were obtained from provincial irrigation departments of punjab and sindh and 10 day datasets obtained from wapda and irsa were used for data gap filling groundwater depths unpublished data were obtained from wapda and interpolated and spatially averaged for each canal command area irrigated crop area for each canal was derived by disaggregating district crop statistics to canal command boundaries through geographic information system gis overlay analysis updated from kirby and ahmad 2016 time series level and volume data for tarbela chashma and mangla storages were obtained from wapda and irsa to assess time series historical sedimentation in the reservoirs system operations and water sharing rules data were obtained from irsa punjab irrigation department and sindh irrigation department 2 3 the indus river system model the indus river system model irsm was used in this study to model inflows to canal command areas for several sedimentation and climate change scenarios under the existing accord principles the irsm represents both the current infrastructure constraints and management characteristics of the river system in the ibis it simulates river and canal flows using either historical or simulated daily inflow time series at rim stations and follows the accord principles to store and distribute water to provinces and then to canal commands stewart et al 2020 stewart et al 2018 it is a daily time step model developed in the ewater source river system modelling framework welsh et al 2013 and considers management rules for the various dams and barrages hydraulic capacity of canals travel times and flow dependent unaccounted differences in major river reaches having this level of resolution in the model means that it can represent the current infrastructure constraints of the ibis better than longer time step 10 day or monthly models which do not adequately capture the variability in the system the irsm s performance in replicating provincial allocation ratios is within 0 1 on average and the modelling of water flow at barrages and water delivered to irrigation canal commands is in agreement with recorded data with average canal bias of 5 and most canals modelled within measurement error at 10 bias podger et al 2021 similarly the model daily nash sutcliffe efficiencies at major barrages are about 0 7 a detailed description of the conceptualisation structure calibration and evaluation of the model is provided in stewart et al 2018 stewart et al 2020 and podger et al 2021 2 4 scenarios we examined 10 scenarios current conditions base case scenario and nine potential future scenarios that represent reservoir sedimentation climate change and combined reservoir and climate change impacts on the canal command water balances of the ibis for each scenario two remote sensing methods that estimate actual evapotranspiration eta were applied to gauge the potential influence of method choice on the modelling outcomes cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration in peña arancibia and ahmad 2020 and etlook bastiaanssen et al 2012 2 4 1 base case scenario the base case scenario is used to assess the relative change to other scenarios it represents the current infrastructure under historical 1990 91 to 2012 13 climate it is described in detail in section 2 5 2 4 2 indus water storage dam sedimentation scenario this scenario is designed to depict the impact of reduced storage capacity in the dams sedimentation of the large reservoirs in the ibis is steadily reducing the volume of water that may be stored khan et al 2012 podger et al 2021 raza et al 2015 roca 2012 wapda 2020 unpublished results and may seriously disrupt the reliability and ability to supply irrigation water in the next few decades reduced storage capacity results in less capture of the high flows in the wet kharif season that exceed canal capacity less water in storage also results in reduced ability to distribute water in the dry rabi season as defined in stewart et al 2020 this scenario assumes that current sedimentation rates in tarbela and mangla continue to 2050 and then assesses the potential impact on water deliveries to the canal commands in punjab and sindh balochistan 2 4 3 climate change scenarios climate change scenarios under the current reservoir capacity see section 2 1 are designed to evaluate potential impacts from two changes i inflows to the ibis from the uib impacting canal deliveries and ii changes to rainfall and evapotranspiration over the canal commands four broad scenarios were investigated to provide an envelope for potential water balance changes associated with climate change these are described further in table 1 no general circulation model gcm is able to simulate all aspects of the precipitation dynamics across the indus basin hence different gcms were selected for the uib and the ibis to cover the entire spectrum of projected changes in the temperature and rainfall for the estimation of canal deliveries to the ibis we used the irsm with historical inflows scaled to match estimated changes to flow magnitudes and patterns from the two lutz et al 2016 gcms inmcm4 and miroc5 these gcms are associated with low and high future annual inflows consistently across all rim stations in 2050 from the uib which provide the envelope of possible future canal delivery outcomes under extreme climate change stewart et al 2020 for canal command rainfall and evapotranspiration changes in the ibis we developed projections of changed climates to 2050 based on an empirical downscaling or change factor approach zheng et al 2018 we applied the approach only to gcms with skill to reproduce historical ibis rainfall patterns and then to a subset of these that reflect the more extreme situations which provide an envelope of possible futures ranging from dry to wet we evaluated the range of cmip5 gcms and selected the miroc esm and fgoals s2 under the rcp8 5 scenario which gave the driest and wettest projected climates respectively the details of the approach to calculate the projected climates and select the dry and wet climates in the ibis as well as the procedure to scale both the rainfall and evapotranspiration using the change factor approach are given in appendix a 2 4 4 interaction of storage dam sedimentation with climate change scenarios the next four scenarios assess the interaction of the 2050 sedimentation with projected future climate as it affects inflows into the headwaters of the indus and associated canal supplies to the ibis and also the impact of climate change as it affects rainfall and crop water demand in the ibis canal commands of punjab and sindh balochistan these four scenarios thus extend the climate change scenarios with the current level of sedimentation in the reservoirs to climate change with estimated 2050 sedimentation levels as described above the reservoir sedimentation scenarios assume that current sedimentation rates in tarbela and mangla continue to 2050 the complete set of 10 scenarios is shown in table 1 2 4 5 groundwater use behaviour in the scenarios in assessing future water availability in all scenarios we assume that future groundwater use will be managed much as it is currently in sindh groundwater from fresh shallow aquifers is used in a few places ahmed et al 2020 however as noted by ahmed et al 2020 and discussed in young et al 2019 and ahmad et al 2021 groundwater use in sindh is relatively small because most groundwater is too saline year to year groundwater levels have generally varied little over the historical period thus we assume in the water balance scenarios that the change in the annual groundwater storage is insignificant over the long term in punjab groundwater level change represents a relatively small component of the overall water balance see ahmad et al 2021 measurements show that groundwater is declining at a rate of approximately 110 mm per year equivalent to 11 mm depth of water using an assumed specific yield of 0 1 averaged over the area of the canal commands across individual canal commands this rate of change varies with the maximum rate of decline equivalent to 52 mm per year depth of water canal deliveries have undergone a slight decline over recent decades whereas the area under crops has increased this has resulted in greater groundwater use and hence declining groundwater level we assume for the scenarios in this study that the current rate of groundwater decline in each canal command will continue and hence the current rate of groundwater use will continue reflecting current management practices 2 5 water balance assessment water balance assessment for canal commands is based on the approach of ahmad et al 2021 which modified the surface water balance of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 to derive the following one dimensional surface water balance equation 1 0 p n i cw i ngw e t a b where eta is the outflow of water due to evapotranspiration of crops and other vegetation within the canal command area pn is the water inflow from rainfall icw is the inflow due to diversion of water into the area via canals ingw is the net groundwater use and b is an unaccounted difference term equivalent to the depth of water required to set the right hand side of the equation to zero the signs of all terms in eq 1 are reversed from the convention used in ahmad et al 2021 the convention used here makes interpreting δb in eq 2 more intuitive all terms are given as equivalent depths of water ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 considered term pn as the net rainfall after runoff was accounted for here we note that runoff is small and also not measured or known with any precision therefore we take pn to be the rainfall as measured the small amount of runoff if any will be accounted for in the unaccounted difference term b ahmad et al 2021 assessed all terms in the water balance as monthly time series from 1981 82 to 2012 13 eta in eq 1 was estimated from two remote sensing methods as explained in section 2 4 pn was assessed from rainfall observations and icw was from measured canal flow records the net groundwater use ingw was assessed from observed changes in groundwater levels multiplied by a specific yield to obtain an equivalent depth of groundwater change thus a fall in the groundwater level represents a net supply to the surface if the groundwater recharge and extraction is strictly one dimensional this calculation is correct subject to measurement error most groundwater recharge occurs through rainfall in the north of the basin and seepage from the distributed canal network bonsor et al 2017 khan et al 2017 and so is largely one dimensional any subsurface lateral flows in the groundwater appear as an unaccounted inflow or outflow in the balance term b ahmad et al 2021 found that the observed water balance terms did not close the water balance i e did not sum to zero the lack of closure is the sum of measurement errors plus unaccounted flows as represented by b b generally was up to about 10 and not more than 20 of the sum of the observed terms in the water balance for the canal commands of pakistan a result that compares favourably with other large scale water balance assessments ahmad et al 2021 declining groundwater levels are often used to assess sustainable water use though the interpretation can be problematic zhou 2009 table 1 in ahmad et al 2021 showed that the time series behaviour of b allowed a better assessment of trends in the sustainability of water use than did changes to groundwater levels alone there is likely to be a change in seasonal groundwater storage between the rabi and kharif seasons however the changes over the long term will average approximately to equal and opposite the groundwater level will fall during the rabi dry season but rise again during the kharif wet season using eq 1 to evaluate seasonal water balances therefore introduces an error which will be seen in the difference i e balance term the balance term will be affected by an approximately equal and opposite amount in the two seasons however as we will show we are mainly concerned with how the balance term changes with scenarios of reservoir sedimentation and so on short term fluctuations in groundwater storage are not considered important relative to the difference in the balance term between scenarios in this study we use the historical monthly water balances of ahmad et al 2021 as a current baseline against which to assess the potential impacts under future climate scenarios however we make one modification to their method rather than use measured canal deliveries for the historical baseline we use modelled deliveries during the period 1990 91 to 2012 13 rather than 1981 82 to 2012 13 as assessed by ahmad et al 2021 because modelled canal deliveries described further below were available only for 1990 onwards we do this so that the comparison of scenario generated canal water deliveries which must be modelled with simulated historical deliveries reflects current management and infrastructure the icw term is calculated from a simulation of historical inflows to canal commands using the daily time step irsm canal deliveries as modelled by the irsm were divided by the canal command area to give the results in depth of water impacts may differ between canal commands however as provincial irrigation authorities may choose to redistribute canal deliveries to even out the impacts it was deemed appropriate to aggregate and report results at provincial level while maintaining model resolution at the canal command level in the scenario results that follow the monthly rainfall evapotranspiration and canal deliveries terms in eq 1 were re assessed using climate change projections as described below net groundwater use was assumed not to change as discussed in section 2 4 5 the time series of b was then recalculated from eq 1 we then focus on the change in the b term δb from the base historical case to the scenario 2 δ b b scen b hist p n i cw et a scen p n i cw et a hist where scen and hist indicate scenario and historical values respectively there is no net groundwater term in eq 2 as it was assumed not to change and so ingw scen ingw hist 0 δb in eq 2 is positive when bscen bhist i e when the supply pn icw of water in the scenario is greater relative to the demand eta than was the case historically similarly δb is negative when bscen bhist i e when the supply of water in the scenario is smaller relative to the demand than was the case historically to evaluate the impact of the projected local wet and dry climate change we modified eq 2 to 3 δ b b wet b dry p n i cw et a wet p n i cw et a dry where wet and dry indicate the wet and dry climate change scenarios values and are taken as the average of the two wet and two dry scenario values similarly for the impact of high and low flows due to climate change in the uib we modified eq 2 to 4 δ b b h i g h f l o w b l o w f l o w p n i cw et a h i g h f l o w p n i cw et a l o w f l o w where high flow and low flow indicate the high flow and low flow climate change scenarios values and are taken as the average of the two high flow and low flow scenario values 3 change in the balance term δb and isolating effects in the scenarios presented in this study δb is influenced by four effects i the projected change in climate within the canal commands ii inflows to the ibis and hence canal deliveries resulting from climate change in the uib iii inflows and hence canal deliveries resulting from sedimentation in the reservoirs and iv the method of estimating eta isolating these potential effects provides insight into their relative importance thus providing guidance for future studies to reduce the uncertainty in these terms to isolate the climate within canal command effect the average difference in δb between the two dry climate scenarios and two wet climate scenarios is evaluated eq 3 to isolate the canal deliveries effect the average difference in δb between the two high flow scenarios and two low flow scenarios is evaluated eq 4 to isolate the sedimentation effect the average difference in δb between the sedimentation scenario and base case scenario is evaluated eq 2 to isolate the potential effect due to actual evapotranspiration calculation method the average difference in δb between the etlook and cmrset eta estimates for all scenarios is evaluated all data presented in this paper represent spatial averages for each canal command aggregated to the province level punjab and sindh balochistan 3 1 responding to change in water availability implied change in crop areas changes to δb as calculated above may seem somewhat abstract and not convey the real impact on irrigation a practical way of interpreting δb that conveys the impact on cropping is to derive potential area changes for the key crops table 2 that may be required to return the balance term to the current levels i e set δb to zero the change in area of crops δa required to restore the balance to make δb equal to zero is calculated from the anticipated change in canal deliveries and the crop water requirement from the simulated scenarios eq 5 5 δ a a cc i cw s c e n i cw h i s t et o s c e n et o h i s t cwr crop p

the historical case cwrcrop is the current crop water requirement of the crop under consideration calculated as etww using a crop coefficient approach with the crop coefficients based on ullah et al 2001 pscen is the rainfall in a scenario and ie is the irrigation efficiency the fraction of diverted water that reaches the plants and contributes to the crop evapotranspiration and is discussed

is then the crop water requirement after rainfall is accounted for for the crops listed in table 2 the change in crop area implied by δb was calculated for each of the 23 years modelled in the scenarios the selection of the value of ie has a significant impact on the value of δa in the present study ie is interpreted to include the losses in the canals and fields from the diversion point to the point of use of the crops i e the root zone and not the river losses for this study by comparing the change in cropped areas with the change in canal water deliveries for sindh we derived an ie of 57 which is in agreement with the figures suggested by bhutta and smedema 2007 hussain et al 2011 and yu et al 2013 details of the approach to calculate the ie are in appendix b we do not suggest that the crop areas will necessarily change as indicated by the calculation in sindh balochistan crop areas in the past few decades have increased and decreased more or less in line with water supply ahmad et al 2021 whereas in punjab the crop areas have increased continuously by using ever greater quantities of groundwater 4 results in this section after a brief description of the rainfall actual evapotranspiration and canal delivery results we focus on how the difference between the supply of water and evapotranspiration demand is changed in the different seasons under the various scenarios i e how the balance term changes with the scenarios we then examine the implied changes in areas of the crops in table 2 that could be undertaken to make δb 0 in what follows we shall for brevity show mainly the results derived using the cmrset method for assessing actual evapotranspiration the etlook method led to small differences in predicted actual evapotranspiration but as we will show the outcome on δb is very similar for the two methods for comparison of the two methods we show the results for the base case current conditions of the cmrset and etlook methods but we do not show the other scenario results for the etlook method 4 1 rainfall the kharif and rabi rainfall pn projections in the various scenarios are summarised in fig 2 in punjab the median of annual rainfall averaged across the canal commands from 1990 91 to 2012 13 was 342 mm 34 01 km3 whereas it was 125 mm 7 11 km3 in the canal commands of sindh balochistan during the same period the medians of kharif and rabi rainfall in punjab were 271 mm 26 99 km3 and 56 mm 5 54 km3 respectively whereas in sindh balochistan they were 84 mm 4 76 km3 and 19 mm 1 10 km3 with climate change in punjab the median rainfall is projected to increase by between 1 09 dry scenario and 1 66 times wet scenario during kharif and by between 0 77 i e a decrease and 1 17 times during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by between 0 94 and 1 56 times during kharif and by between 0 96 and 0 88 times during rabi 4 2 canal deliveries the modelled canal deliveries icw are summarised in fig 3 the median of annual canal deliveries averaged across the canal commands from 1990 91 to 2012 13 was 551 mm 54 85 km3 in punjab and 868 mm 49 31 km3 in sindh balochistan the corresponding medians of kharif and rabi canal deliveries for punjab were 382 mm 37 96 km3 and 166 mm 16 53 km3 respectively and sindh balochistan were 621 mm 35 27 km3 and 251 mm 14 27 km3 respectively with reservoir sedimentation by 2050 but without climate change in punjab the median canal delivery is projected to increase by 1 002 times during kharif and decrease by 0 996 times during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to increase by 1 03 during kharif and decrease by 0 87 times during rabi with climate change in punjab the median canal delivery is projected to scale between 0 98 low flow scenario i e a decrease and 1 03 times high flow scenario during kharif and by between 0 93 and 1 06 times during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by between 0 93 and 1 08 times during kharif and by between 0 90 and 1 04 times during rabi when 2050 sedimentation is combined with climate change in punjab the median canal delivery is projected to scale by between 0 98 sedimentation with low flow scenario and 1 04 times sedimentation with high flow scenario during kharif and by between 0 87 and 0 96 times i e a decrease during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by between 0 95 and 1 08 times during kharif and by between 0 80 and 0 92 times during rabi 4 3 actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration eta projections in the various scenarios are summarised in fig 4 in punjab the median annual actual evapotranspiration averaged across the canal commands from 1990 91 to 2012 13 was 895 mm 89 03 km3 for the etlook estimation method and 887 mm 88 26 km3 for the cmrset method whereas in the canal commands of sindh balochistan it was 917 52 10 km3 and 918 mm 52 19 km3 in both punjab and sindh balochistan the etlook method gave slightly greater evapotranspiration in kharif and less in rabi than the cmrset method the corresponding medians of kharif and rabi cmrset eta for punjab were 543 mm 54 02 km3 and 349 mm 34 70 km3 respectively and sindh balochistan were 539 mm 30 63 km3 and 380 mm 21 60 km3 respectively with climate change all scenarios project an increase in median actual evapotranspiration in punjab the median actual evapotranspiration is projected to scale by between 1 07 dry scenario and 1 08 times wet scenario during kharif and by 1 13 dry scenario and 1 14 wet scenario in rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by 1 05 times during kharif both scenarios and by between 1 09 and 1 12 times in rabi 4 4 change in the balance between supply and demand the estimated change in the balance term δb from the various scenarios are summarised in fig 5 as described in section 2 5 if δb is negative it implies less supply of water in relation to demand if it is positive it implies more supply of water in relation to demand with climate change in the kharif season in punjab the median value of δb was 100 mm equivalent to 9 95 km3 or more in the future wet climate high flow scenario it decreased in the dry climate low flow scenario in sindh balochistan but was unchanged in the dry climate low flow scenario in punjab in the rabi season the median values of δb were negative in all scenarios in both provinces with the lowest values in the low flow scenarios in the kharif season the reservoir sedimentation resulted in a positive δb in the sindh whereas it changed little from the base value for punjab δb was also positive in most kharif scenarios of reservoir sedimentation combined with climate change by values of more than 100 mm equivalent to 5 68 km3 in the future wet climate high flow scenarios the only kharif scenario with a negative δb was the low flow in sindh balochistan in the rabi season the median value of δb was negative in all scenarios sedimentation only and sedimentation combined with climate change in both provinces though only marginally in the case of 2050 sedimentation only in punjab with the negative values being greater in the low flow scenarios 4 5 relative influence on δb of changes in canal deliveries the local climate and eta calculation method the four influencing drivers for the estimate of δb investigated in this study have been grouped as described in section 2 4 to indicate their relative impact and are shown in fig 6 the results show that the method of estimating actual evapotranspiration in isolation has the least impact on the overall mass balance this arises because while the two methods yield different absolute estimates of actual evapotranspiration their estimations of change in actual evapotranspiration in a given scenario are similar we will return to this point in the discussion below with regard to the influence of the remaining driving factors investigated in this study in the kharif season in punjab the local climate effect is the major effect median increase of 106 87 132 mm followed by the flow effect median increase of 25 16 35 mm and then the 2050 sedimentation effect nearly unchanged in the rabi season the factors are the same with local climate as the major effect median increase of 25 14 33 mm then the effect of flow median increase of 9 4 44 mm and then the effect of 2050 sedimentation nearly unchanged in the kharif season in sindh balochistan the flow effect is the major effect median increase of 75 56 116 mm followed by local climate median increase of 51 28 110 mm and 2050 sedimentation median increase of 17 3 28 mm in the rabi season the 2050 sedimentation is the major effect median decrease of 34 30 37 mm then the flow effect median increase of 24 7 57 mm and then local climate effect remain nearly unchanged in contrast to punjab the 2050 sedimentation effect is quite large in both seasons in sindh balochistan the reservoir sedimentation effects are opposite in the kharif and rabi seasons increasing the supply relative to demand in kharif and decreasing it in rabi 4 6 change in the area of crops implied by the changes to supply and demand the implied changes to the areas of three kharif and three rabi crops table 2 are shown in fig 7 the changed areas shown are for each crop individually not in combination in other words they show the implied changes in area as if they were all to be concentrated on a single crop to assist policy makers to explore sustainable cropping patterns and or areas for all crops in both provinces the 2050 sedimentation scenario leads to an increase in the area that may be cropped in the kharif season and a reduction in rabi in line with expectations for all crops in both provinces the low flow scenarios result in an implied reduction in crops whereas the high flow scenarios result in an implied increase the implied changes to the areas of crops in punjab are greater than those in sindh balochistan partly because the current areas of cropping are greater table 2 so a similar proportional change gives a larger absolute change it should also be noted that whereas the implied changes to crop areas are those required to restore the balance term to its current level there is a significant difference between the change in balance fig 6 and the implied change in crop areas fig 7 this is most clearly seen in the rabi season results where the median change in the balance term is negative for all four climate change scenarios implying less water in relation to demand in both provinces but the calculated change to the areas of the three rabi crops is positive i e an increase in area for the high flow scenarios in both provinces this arises because the changes in the water balance are lumped figures for whole canal commands aggregated to the province but the changes in canal deliveries are applied to the cropped areas only eq 3 thus the impact of a proportionate change in canal deliveries is greater in terms of a change to crop areas than it is in terms of the water balance to a whole canal command which includes areas of cropping and non cropped areas it also has a greater impact on a change to crop areas than does a similar proportionate change in rainfall for all crops in both provinces all reservoir sedimentation with climate change scenarios lead to a reduction in the area that may be cropped in the rabi season in the kharif season the reservoir sedimentation with low flow scenarios also result in an implied reduction in crops whereas the high flow scenarios result in an implied increase 5 discussion the results for the modelled scenarios show that there is considerable uncertainty in the impact of projected climate change within the irrigated areas of the indus basin in pakistan the canal commands water balance suggests that the areas of crops that could be grown at the current level of sustainable water use may increase or decrease depending on the scenario the prospects of increasing the areas of crops may be greater in the kharif season while decreasing the areas of crops may be more necessary in the rabi season sedimentation in the reservoirs affects the overall picture the results described in the previous section show that the impacts in the canal commands in punjab differ from those in sindh balochistan and differ between kharif and rabi seasons future water resources management may need to adjust to cope with these likely changes 5 1 difference in water balance drivers between the provinces reservoir sedimentation impacts differ significantly between the provinces overall punjab is barely affected by the 2050 sedimentation scenario whereas sindh balochistan is significantly affected this result is partly because of groundwater use and lower evaporative demand in punjab during the rabi season punjab also generally has higher rainfall than sindh balochistan particularly in the northern and north eastern parts of the province the canal commands of punjab therefore require and receive less additional irrigation water per unit area of canal command unsurprisingly as shown in fig 6 punjab is estimated to be impacted more by the projected climate change within the canal commands than it is by the potential climate change in the uib influencing canal deliveries during the kharif season the difference in water balance changes between dry and wet climate scenarios is larger than 100 mm 10 55 km3 in punjab compared to 25 mm 2 44 km3 between low and high flow scenarios overall the projected local climate change is the dominant effect in punjab followed by flow changes canal delivery and reservoir sedimentation in sindh balochistan rainfall is very low and in absolute terms is not much affected by climate change the canal commands of sindh balochistan therefore require and receive a higher proportional crop water supply from canals than do those of punjab sindh balochistan are therefore projected to be impacted more by the changes in canal deliveries and less by projected climate change within the canal commands the difference in water balance changes particularly in the rabi season is less than 10 mm 0 57 km3 between dry and wet climate scenarios but larger than 20 mm 1 14 km3 between low and high flow scenarios overall in sindh balochistan the flow canal delivery effect is dominant followed by sedimentation in rabi and projected local climate change in kharif the combined effect of 2050 sedimentation and climate change reported here is estimated to be greater than the effect of climate change alone however the difference is small in punjab because of the small effect of 2050 sedimentation whereas the difference is large in sindh balochistan as noted above the implied changes to crop areas are greater in the punjab than in sindh balochistan 5 2 differences between kharif and rabi projected impacts the impact of reservoir sedimentation differs in the kharif and rabi seasons the reduced storage capacity due to sedimentation means that in the kharif season less water is stored and therefore more water is subsequently allocated to irrigation areas augmenting supply conversely in rabi the lesser storage capacity reduces the supply available for irrigation as expected the kharif rainfall is projected to increase under both the wet and dry climates in punjab and in the wet climate in sindh balochistan and this is consistent with archer et al 2010 and yu et al 2013 this increase combined with the projected increases to canal deliveries in the high flow scenario is generally greater than the projected increase in actual evapotranspiration thereby showing a positive change ranging from 20 to 138 mm equivalent to 1 15 13 70 km3 to the balance term in most scenarios in the kharif season fig 5 the effect is stronger in punjab where rainfall totals are greater than in sindh balochistan and the projected absolute increases in rainfall totals under climate change is correspondingly greater in the rabi season the dry climate scenario rainfall is projected to decline in both provinces yu et al 2013 and the wet climate scenario rainfall represents a small increase in absolute terms this combined with reductions in canal deliveries low flow scenario or modest increases high flow scenario is insufficient to offset the projected increases in evapotranspiration leading to a negative change ranging from 19 to 77 mm equivalent to 1 07 7 65 km3 to the balance term in all scenarios in both provinces in the rabi season as noted above the combined effect of 2050 sedimentation and climate change as reported here is greater than the effect of climate change alone particularly in sindh balochistan in the kharif season the greater supply relative to demand is enhanced by reservoir sedimentation combined with climate change conversely in rabi the lesser supply relative to demand is exacerbated by the two effects combined 5 3 uncertainties in the estimation of actual evapotranspiration the estimates of actual evapotranspiration differed in the two methods etlook and cmrset however in contrast to the impact of the dry and wet climate scenarios and the low and high flow scenarios the evapotranspiration method had very little impact on the change in the water balance in the future scenarios this is because while the absolute magnitude of the estimated actual evapotranspiration varies with the method the change in evapotranspiration under the wet and dry climate scenarios is similar for the two estimates actual evapotranspiration is influenced by the potential evapotranspiration crop factors and soil water availability allen et al 1998 the impact of future climate is likely to be felt primarily through a change in potential evapotranspiration changes to crop factors may of course occur but the biggest influence on them is likely to be the area and type of crop sown to examine that we have looked at the potential impact of changed climate and sedimentation on the areas of crops that can be sown on the issue of soil water availability farming practices in sindh are often criticised for over watering and widespread waterlogging van steenbergen et al 2015 in the punjab lack of surface supply is generally made up from groundwater at the level of the individual canal it is widely accepted that the head end tends to be over watered and the tail end experiences a shortfall often made up with groundwater murray rust and vander velde 1994 the impact of soil water availability changes is therefore likely to be affected by improved practices to deliver just the right amount of water at the right time rather than through the influence of climate change ahmad et al 2009 peña arancibia and ahmad 2020 5 4 the impact of groundwater use behaviour and sustainability implications in sindh balochistan less groundwater is used than in the punjab and generally crop areas are adjusted in response to canal water availability see appendix b if this practice were to continue future water use would not necessarily be less sustainable than at present in these provinces however while annual net groundwater use in punjab might be a small component of the overall water balance groundwater declines over many years are cumulatively sufficient to cause concern over unsustainable groundwater use in several canal commands ahmad et al 2021 basharat et al 2014 in recent years crop areas have increased while canal deliveries remain static ahmad et al 2021 ever greater quantities of groundwater have been pumped to irrigate this greater area of crops kirby et al 2017 punjab has the option to respond to future changes in water availability by changing the amount of groundwater pumped and or changing the irrigated area since the water availability relative to demand is projected to decrease in all scenarios in the rabi season for punjab it appears likely that groundwater use will become increasingly unsustainable in rabi if cropping areas are to remain static the challenge then remains to moderate the potential cropping area increases in kharif so that sufficient groundwater recharge can offset the additional rabi groundwater requirement however in some scenarios the water use in the kharif season may also increase in punjab thus becoming less sustainable the unsustainable nature of the use is partly the mining of a finite resource and partly the consequent likelihood of mobilising migration of salty groundwater into previously fresh groundwater zones lytton et al 2021 the least sustainable option would be to continue historical groundwater extractions in kharif while expanding crop areas under scenarios indicating increased surface flows and then make up the shortfall in rabi from additional groundwater pumping we note however that as the groundwater levels continue to decline the cost of pumping will likely increase until extraction becomes economically unviable and groundwater use may be constrained to the natural recharge rate furthermore there will be increasing risk of secondary salinity by pumping saline groundwater from deep saline aquifers and or expansion of saline groundwater pockets punjab would then face the same options as sindh and resort to changing seasonal cropping areas as shown in fig 7 this would require alternative demand management strategies such as increasing productivity growing smaller areas of water intensive crops like cotton rice and sugar importing more food or exporting less see kirby et al 2017 to meet the demand for increased food in pakistan in the future the other key consideration from the analysis is that the reservoir sedimentation in the dams will by 2050 change considerably the areas of crops that can be grown in sindh balochistan in the kharif and rabi seasons more land could be cropped in kharif but more would stand idle in rabi due to reduced canal flows and the inability to use saline groundwater to supplement supply given that current farm management input supply and product marketing are geared to the present distribution of crops between the two seasons this would appear to be undesirable it would therefore seem important for sindh balochistan in particular that reservoir sedimentation be controlled in the longer term punjab will also be adversely affected by sedimentation and will then also gain benefit from sedimentation control for example controlling sedimentation will benefit the maintenance of hydropower production ahmed and sanchez 2011 for irrigation supply building a new storage dam would achieve the same outcome of mitigating sedimentation impacts on existing storages 6 conclusions we conclude that 1 projected climate change in the uib as it affects flows in the indus river and its tributaries is the major climate change impact on future water balance in the canal commands of sindh balochistan and is greater than local climate change impacts this outcome contrasts with that found for punjab where changes in rainfall within the areas of the canal commands are a more important climate change impact than estimated changes in canal deliveries 2 the range of plausible climate change scenarios indicate both projected increases and decreases in water availability relative to provincial irrigation demand the kharif season has an increase in water availability in high flow scenarios while the rabi season has a decrease in most scenarios 3 reservoir sedimentation to 2050 will diminish the supply of irrigation water in the rabi season to sindh balochistan and increase the kharif supply however punjab will not be greatly affected by 2050 by water balance changes arising from reservoir sedimentation 4 sedimentation combined with climate change in sindh balochistan exacerbates the decrease in supply in rabi and increases the supply in kharif more than either effect alone 5 sindh balochistan assuming current cropping behaviour persists will continue to adjust crops to match the water availability this implies that the sustainability of water use in sindh balochistan will remain similar to present levels under plausible climate change scenarios on this basis the change in crop areas in sindh balochistan is likely to be an increase in kharif and a decrease in rabi 6 in punjab if current cropping behaviour persists the groundwater resource will continue to be used to buffer changes in surface water availability as well as supporting increases in irrigated areas consequently the amount of water pumped for rabi crops will increase while that pumped in the kharif season will depend on the trade off between increases in surface water availability versus growth in area this implies that overall water use in the punjab will become less sustainable as groundwater resources are depleted further in rabi unless kharif canal deliveries are used the key learning arising from this research is that despite the challenges there are opportunities for pakistan to achieve water and food security it appears that no single strategy will suffice both supply side and demand side policies and management are needed supply management options include reservoir sedimentation management construction of new storages irrigation efficiency improvements desalinisation of saline sea and groundwater and improved conjunctive use whereas key demand strategies are improving land and water productivity and promoting resilient and sustainable cropping patterns according to water availability supply side options will take time to implement so the immediate focus could be to promote demand management and public awareness the increased understanding of how the system functions will enable better management decisions knowing what to do in what circumstance and how actions will affect the system s operation backed up by observations to enable adaptive management credit authorship contribution statement mobin ud din ahmad

review process appendix a details of the climate change scenarios we developed projections of changed climates for the period 2046 to 2075 for the canal commands based on an empirical downscaling or change factor approach zheng et al 2018 the changed climates were calculated as monthly totals we did not apply the approach to all gcms since some appear to simulate rainfall in sindh poorly li et al 2017 and downscaling the projections for future scenarios appeared to give unreasonable results this arose because in the scaling factor approach some months in some locations would be assigned large sometimes very large scaling factors the large scaling factors resulted from dividing a future projected rainfall by a near zero rainfall in the month and location in question the large scaling factors when applied to the historical data in months when there was a large rainfall would lead to unreasonably large rainfalls in that month in the future scenario years we ignored all gcms for which this problem occurred this resulted in a list of 11 gcms table a1 from this list of 11 gcms we selected five which were chosen to give contrasting changes in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in pakistan average change in rainfall with average change in potential evapotranspiration most negative or least positive change in rainfall with average change in potential evapotranspiration most positive change in rainfall with average change in potential evapotranspiration average change in rainfall with most negative or least positive change in potential evapotranspiration average change in rainfall with most positive change in potential evapotranspiration the projected potential evapotranspiration eto calculated with this procedure was combined with the estimates of actual evapotranspiration eta to calculate projected actual evapotranspiration according to a1 e t a m o n t h s c e n a r i o e t a m o n t h h i s t o r i c a l e t o m o n t h s c e n a r i o e t o m o n t h h i s t o r i c a l this scaling approach was used by ahmad et al 2019 to derive the extrapolated historical time series of actual evapotranspiration and is adapted here to derive projected climate change time series the average rainfall of the canal commands averaged for the punjab and sindh provinces is shown in fig a 1 for the historical period of 1981 82 to 2012 13 and for the five climate change scenarios note these figures were calculated from monthly totals the kharif rainfall was calculated as the total from april to september the rabi rainfall was calculated as the sum of the remaining months the annual rainfall is projected to increase in three of the five climate change scenarios in sindh and decrease in two but to increase in all five scenarios in the punjab fgoals s2 gives the greatest projected rainfall in both provinces and miroc esm the least in sindh and second least in the punjab miroc esm also gives the least rainfall in the rabi season in both provinces fig a 2 shows the projected actual evapotranspiration averaged for the punjab and sindh for the etlook estimation method and fig a 3 shows the projected actual evapotranspiration for the cmrset estimation method the two methods give similar projected annual totals however the cmrset method results in higher rabi evapotranspiration and lower late kharif evapotranspiration than does the etlook method the fgoals s2 projection gives the highest annual actual evapotranspiration in both provinces whereas the miroc esm projection gives the second highest in the punjab and third highest in sindh when combined with the rainfall results miroc esm gives the driest projected climate in the two provinces for the assessment reported here we further reduced the five climate change scenarios described above to a consideration only of the scenario which across all canal commands gave the greatest increase in rainfall using the fgoals s2 model to give a wet scenario and that which gave the driest climate miroc esm model dry scenario appendix b details of irrigation efficiency consideration sindh balochistan has little fresh groundwater available for irrigation and responds to changing water availability mainly by changing crop areas as shown in fig b 1 the slope of the regression line in fig b 1 is approximately 67 000 ha bcm the area weighted average crop water requirement calculated using a crop coefficient model was 1011 mm in 2013 14 including the effective rainfall 1bcm of canal water at an irrigation efficiency of 100 would meet the crop water requirement over approximately 117 000 ha the regression line in fig b 1 therefore implies an irrigation efficiency of 57 i e 67 000 117 000 expressed as a percentage the estimated efficiency is comparable to the average irrigation efficiency of 52 used by simons et al 2020 who computed the efficiency at the canal command level in the ibis with values between 38 and 66 ahmad and kutcher 1992 reported that irrigation efficiency within the ibis varied canal by canal ranging from 60 to 80 for this study we used an irrigation efficiency of 57 which is just outside the range and approximately midway between the figures suggested by bhutta and smedema 2007 hussain et al 2011 and yu et al 2013 this estimation method applies to the whole system and implicitly incorporates re use of water lost from the irrigation system re use includes use of groundwater into which water lost from fields and canals has infiltrated and use downstream of any water lost from fields and canals which returns to the river and or canal system 
4051,pakistan relies greatly on the water of the upper indus basin uib for its vast agriculture in the indus basin irrigation system ibis there are already concerns about the extent of unsustainable water use in the ibis particularly of groundwater and these concerns are likely to increase in the future due to population increase and associated increased demand for food in addition climate change continuing reservoir sedimentation in the major dams and other impacts on water supply and demand are likely to have an impact on the practical implementation of the landmark inter provincial water apportionment accord the accord which governs surface water allocation in the ibis there is therefore a need to assess the sustainability of irrigation in light of the potential variations of water availability in the basin under a series of plausible climate change and reservoir sedimentation scenarios in this paper we examine the impact of continuing reservoir sedimentation and climate change by 2050 on the water balance of canal commands in the ibis firstly we used a river system model the first to include water management rules as in the accord to propagate climate induced changes on flows in the uib and their impact on ibis flow regulation and canal deliveries icw with and without reservoir sedimentation secondly we used a selection of general circulation models gcms that showed skill at simulating the local climate of the ibis to assess the projected changes to rainfall pn and evapotranspiration eta the analysis revealed that water balances in ibis canal command areas are more significantly affected by changed inflows from the uib than by localised climate induced changes i e pn and eta continuing reservoir sedimentation in the dams to 2050 will diminish the capacity of the system to store flows during the wet summer kharif season for its later release in the dry winter rabi season this will decrease the supply of icw in the rabi season to the downstream ibis areas in sindh and balochistan provinces and potentially increase supplies in the kharif season the impact of reservoir sedimentation on the rabi water supply 33 mm 13 decrease in median i cw equivalent to 1 89 km3 is greater than the impact of projected localised climate change within the ibis 2 mm 12 decrease in median pn equivalent to 0 13 km3 sedimentation combined with climate change decreases the median icw by 51 mm 20 equivalent to 2 91 km3 in rabi in the low flow scenario and increases it by 48 mm 8 equivalent to 2 72 km3 in kharif in the high flow scenario in the upstream punjab province however reservoir sedimentation will have limited impact by 2050 due to lower eta in rabi and the availability of groundwater continued reservoir sedimentation beyond 2050 will also affect punjab again diminishing the supply of icw in rabi and increasing it in kharif concurrently declining icw could lead to a substantial reduction in crop areas in the rabi season to avoid this undesirable scenario pakistan needs to explore both demand and supply management options to achieve food and economic security as well as controlling sedimentation rates in reservoirs keywords water accounting climate change hydrological extremes water outlook irrigation food security 1 introduction many major food and fibre producing irrigation basins and regions around the world face multiple challenges including aging irrigation infrastructure ward 2010 unsustainable surface water diversion wada et al 2014 increasing and often unsustainable groundwater withdrawals aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 and competition from other water uses such as domestic and environmental uses gorelick and zheng 2015 at the same time demand for food and fibre and hence irrigation water is increasing with population growth ibarrola rivas et al 2017 and food consumption habits are changing as societies become more affluent and urbanised climate change is projected to exacerbate these challenges elliott et al 2014 our focus is the indus basin in pakistan which faces all of the challenges noted above immerzeel and bierkens 2012 assessed the basin as the most vulnerable in asia in terms of water availability we seek to understand the potential changes to water availability across the irrigation canal commands of the basin to build up a regional and national picture and thence to assess policy and management options for future water and food security in pakistan we anticipate that lessons from the indus basin will have application in many other basins pakistan s food and fibre depend heavily on irrigated agriculture in the indus basin irrigation system ibis irrigation in the ibis relies on surface inflows from the upper indus basin uib and their regulation and distribution according to the 1991 inter provincial water apportionment accord government of pakistan 1991 1992 in fresh groundwater quality areas generally in the upstream punjab province surface water supplies are supplemented with groundwater to meet the irrigation requirement and expand irrigated areas in the downstream province of sindh groundwater use is limited due to salinity there are concerns over unsustainable water use in some parts of the ibis and even on the adequacy of water supplies for current uses ahmad et al 2007 ahmad et al 2021 kirby et al 2017 these concerns which cover both the adequacy of surface water supplies and the sustainability of groundwater use are likely to grow as a growing population demands more food and hence more irrigation water kirby et al 2017 lytton et al 2021 qureshi 2011 2020 watto and mugera 2016 yang et al 2014 ahmad et al 2021 recently presented a unique study on the water balances in the main canal commands of the ibis and their annual hydrological year from 1 april to next 31 march trends from 1981 82 to 2012 13 one of the main conclusions was that many canal commands in punjab province showed increasingly unsustainable water use over that period resulting partly from a decline in surface water deliveries via the canal system and partly from increases in evapotranspiration due to the increase in area of irrigated crops given the high dependence of pakistan on the ibis for food it is important to understand the potential impact of climate change on future water availability and demand and how this may place further pressure on the sustainability of existing surface and groundwater resources there are many studies on climate change in the indus river basin and the potential impact on the flows of the indus river see the review by charles 2016 temperatures have increased over the indus basin over recent decades particularly at the higher altitudes in the uib whereas changes in rainfall show no consistent trend across the basin or with time charles 2016 climate change will likely result in increasing temperatures across the basin particularly at higher altitudes anjum et al 2021 charles 2016 shrestha et al 2019 this is projected to result in more glacier melting for the next few decades although the overall impacts of climate change on flows in the indus river are highly uncertain lutz et al 2016 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 the general expectation is for greater flows in the next few decades immerzeel and bierkens 2012 khan et al 2020 lutz et al 2016 nepal and shrestha 2015 yu et al 2013 and decreased flows in the longer term laghari et al 2012 lutz et al 2016 while rainfall projections are uncertain rajbhandari et al 2015 suggest that rainfall will increase over the uib but decrease over the ibis on the other hand archer et al 2010 suggest that rainfall may increase over the ibis particularly in the wet summer kharif season the volume and timing of the supply of water to the ibis both rely on water storage in the major tarbela and mangla reservoirs capacity 16 km3 however there is continuing sedimentation of these reservoirs fodp wstf 2012 wapda 2020 unpublished results which has already resulted in less water storage volume in the indus basin archer et al 2010 haqraratnain 1994 morris 2018 podger et al 2021 roca 2012 the objective of this paper is to examine the likely provincial scale impacts on water availability and demand in the canal commands of the ibis under scenarios of reservoir sedimentation and their interaction with and without climate change we further examine the potential changes to crop areas implied by the changing balance of water supply and demand we use the historical canal command water balances of ahmad et al 2021 as a baseline the drivers of change on irrigation supply considered here are i continuing reservoir sedimentation and operation under the accord principles ii projected climate change impacts on the inflows from the uib into the ibis iii projected climate change impacts on rainfall and evapotranspiration i e changes in local hydrology within the ibis and iv the implications of changes in the water balance for potential changes to areas of irrigated crops in the ibis we are not aware of any other study that presents such a comprehensive picture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is presented in fig 1 and shows the ibis canal commands of punjab and sindh and balochistan hereafter sindh balochistan in the ibis plains the climate of this region is semi arid and typically represents the low lying interior of the indo pakistan sub continent temperature and rainfall show large seasonal fluctuations within the basin the summer is long and hot lasting from april through to september with maximum air temperature ranging from 21 c to 49 c winter lasts from december through to february with maximum air temperature ranging from 25 c to 27 c during the day and sometimes falling below zero at night the mean annual rainfall in the ibis is about 250 mm year of which about 75 occurs between june and september which coincides with the peak inflows from the mountainous regions of the uib lutz et al 2016 stewart et al 2020 stewart et al 2018 yang et al 2014 due to the low and variable rainfall year round agriculture is only possible through irrigation which is allocated in accordance with the accord and supplied through a gravity fed upstream control irrigation system the key infrastructure of the ibis consists of two large surface supply storages tarbela capacity of 7 38 km3 in 2020 and mangla capacity of 9 08 km3 in 2018 and a network of regulating infrastructure including chashma barrage capacity of 0 34 km3 and 15 other headworks controlling flows to 12 inter river link canals and 48 irrigation canals fig 1 based on time series transboundary inflow data for the 1976 2019 hydrological years 1 april to 31 march the chenab jhelum indus and kabul rivers provide approximately 159 3 km3 per year to the ibis indus river system authority irsa unpublished data from 2020 whereas flows from the eastern sutlej beas and ravi rivers contribute approximately 7 8 km3 per year into the ibis the majority of upstream flows in these eastern rivers are diverted within india as per the indus water treaty united nations 1960 due to variations in flow regime in each tributary and limited storage capacity irsa apportions the available water between different provinces through a complex reservoir operation and allocation process while ensuring equity in the indus and jhelum chenab management zones within the ibis fig 1 and minimising temporal variations within a growing season indus river system authority 2020 podger et al 2021 approximately 71 of the mean annual flow of the river network is diverted for agricultural and domestic use purposes ahmad et al 2021 excess flows above surface storage and canal diversion capacity flow below kotri barrage the end of system to the arabian sea the indus river and its tributaries supply approximately 60 of the total water used for irrigation in the ibis and the remaining is sourced from groundwater to meet evapotranspiration demand ahmad et al 2021 kirby et al 2017 predominantly in the fresh groundwater quality regions of punjab and small isolated pockets of sindh province ahmad et al 2014 the prevailing temperature and rainfall patterns govern two distinct cropping seasons the wet summer kharif april to september and dry rabi october to march wheat and fodder are the dominant crops during the dry rabi winter season among other main crops cotton rice maize and fodder are produced during the wet kharif summer season whereas sugarcane is an annual crop 2 2 data in this study we have used the time series datasets describing water flow and climate from ahmad et al 2021 and podger et al 2021 to represent the historical baseline for 1990 91 to 2012 13 this includes daily observed precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures obtained from the pakistan meteorological department and the water and power development authority wapda daily inflow data at remote inflow measurement rim stations at tarbela mangla nowshera balloki and sulemanki as shown in fig 1 and end of system outflow at kotri from wapda 10 day flow volume datasets obtained from wapda and irsa were used for data gap filling daily canal diversion data for all ibis canals were obtained from provincial irrigation departments of punjab and sindh and 10 day datasets obtained from wapda and irsa were used for data gap filling groundwater depths unpublished data were obtained from wapda and interpolated and spatially averaged for each canal command area irrigated crop area for each canal was derived by disaggregating district crop statistics to canal command boundaries through geographic information system gis overlay analysis updated from kirby and ahmad 2016 time series level and volume data for tarbela chashma and mangla storages were obtained from wapda and irsa to assess time series historical sedimentation in the reservoirs system operations and water sharing rules data were obtained from irsa punjab irrigation department and sindh irrigation department 2 3 the indus river system model the indus river system model irsm was used in this study to model inflows to canal command areas for several sedimentation and climate change scenarios under the existing accord principles the irsm represents both the current infrastructure constraints and management characteristics of the river system in the ibis it simulates river and canal flows using either historical or simulated daily inflow time series at rim stations and follows the accord principles to store and distribute water to provinces and then to canal commands stewart et al 2020 stewart et al 2018 it is a daily time step model developed in the ewater source river system modelling framework welsh et al 2013 and considers management rules for the various dams and barrages hydraulic capacity of canals travel times and flow dependent unaccounted differences in major river reaches having this level of resolution in the model means that it can represent the current infrastructure constraints of the ibis better than longer time step 10 day or monthly models which do not adequately capture the variability in the system the irsm s performance in replicating provincial allocation ratios is within 0 1 on average and the modelling of water flow at barrages and water delivered to irrigation canal commands is in agreement with recorded data with average canal bias of 5 and most canals modelled within measurement error at 10 bias podger et al 2021 similarly the model daily nash sutcliffe efficiencies at major barrages are about 0 7 a detailed description of the conceptualisation structure calibration and evaluation of the model is provided in stewart et al 2018 stewart et al 2020 and podger et al 2021 2 4 scenarios we examined 10 scenarios current conditions base case scenario and nine potential future scenarios that represent reservoir sedimentation climate change and combined reservoir and climate change impacts on the canal command water balances of the ibis for each scenario two remote sensing methods that estimate actual evapotranspiration eta were applied to gauge the potential influence of method choice on the modelling outcomes cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration in peña arancibia and ahmad 2020 and etlook bastiaanssen et al 2012 2 4 1 base case scenario the base case scenario is used to assess the relative change to other scenarios it represents the current infrastructure under historical 1990 91 to 2012 13 climate it is described in detail in section 2 5 2 4 2 indus water storage dam sedimentation scenario this scenario is designed to depict the impact of reduced storage capacity in the dams sedimentation of the large reservoirs in the ibis is steadily reducing the volume of water that may be stored khan et al 2012 podger et al 2021 raza et al 2015 roca 2012 wapda 2020 unpublished results and may seriously disrupt the reliability and ability to supply irrigation water in the next few decades reduced storage capacity results in less capture of the high flows in the wet kharif season that exceed canal capacity less water in storage also results in reduced ability to distribute water in the dry rabi season as defined in stewart et al 2020 this scenario assumes that current sedimentation rates in tarbela and mangla continue to 2050 and then assesses the potential impact on water deliveries to the canal commands in punjab and sindh balochistan 2 4 3 climate change scenarios climate change scenarios under the current reservoir capacity see section 2 1 are designed to evaluate potential impacts from two changes i inflows to the ibis from the uib impacting canal deliveries and ii changes to rainfall and evapotranspiration over the canal commands four broad scenarios were investigated to provide an envelope for potential water balance changes associated with climate change these are described further in table 1 no general circulation model gcm is able to simulate all aspects of the precipitation dynamics across the indus basin hence different gcms were selected for the uib and the ibis to cover the entire spectrum of projected changes in the temperature and rainfall for the estimation of canal deliveries to the ibis we used the irsm with historical inflows scaled to match estimated changes to flow magnitudes and patterns from the two lutz et al 2016 gcms inmcm4 and miroc5 these gcms are associated with low and high future annual inflows consistently across all rim stations in 2050 from the uib which provide the envelope of possible future canal delivery outcomes under extreme climate change stewart et al 2020 for canal command rainfall and evapotranspiration changes in the ibis we developed projections of changed climates to 2050 based on an empirical downscaling or change factor approach zheng et al 2018 we applied the approach only to gcms with skill to reproduce historical ibis rainfall patterns and then to a subset of these that reflect the more extreme situations which provide an envelope of possible futures ranging from dry to wet we evaluated the range of cmip5 gcms and selected the miroc esm and fgoals s2 under the rcp8 5 scenario which gave the driest and wettest projected climates respectively the details of the approach to calculate the projected climates and select the dry and wet climates in the ibis as well as the procedure to scale both the rainfall and evapotranspiration using the change factor approach are given in appendix a 2 4 4 interaction of storage dam sedimentation with climate change scenarios the next four scenarios assess the interaction of the 2050 sedimentation with projected future climate as it affects inflows into the headwaters of the indus and associated canal supplies to the ibis and also the impact of climate change as it affects rainfall and crop water demand in the ibis canal commands of punjab and sindh balochistan these four scenarios thus extend the climate change scenarios with the current level of sedimentation in the reservoirs to climate change with estimated 2050 sedimentation levels as described above the reservoir sedimentation scenarios assume that current sedimentation rates in tarbela and mangla continue to 2050 the complete set of 10 scenarios is shown in table 1 2 4 5 groundwater use behaviour in the scenarios in assessing future water availability in all scenarios we assume that future groundwater use will be managed much as it is currently in sindh groundwater from fresh shallow aquifers is used in a few places ahmed et al 2020 however as noted by ahmed et al 2020 and discussed in young et al 2019 and ahmad et al 2021 groundwater use in sindh is relatively small because most groundwater is too saline year to year groundwater levels have generally varied little over the historical period thus we assume in the water balance scenarios that the change in the annual groundwater storage is insignificant over the long term in punjab groundwater level change represents a relatively small component of the overall water balance see ahmad et al 2021 measurements show that groundwater is declining at a rate of approximately 110 mm per year equivalent to 11 mm depth of water using an assumed specific yield of 0 1 averaged over the area of the canal commands across individual canal commands this rate of change varies with the maximum rate of decline equivalent to 52 mm per year depth of water canal deliveries have undergone a slight decline over recent decades whereas the area under crops has increased this has resulted in greater groundwater use and hence declining groundwater level we assume for the scenarios in this study that the current rate of groundwater decline in each canal command will continue and hence the current rate of groundwater use will continue reflecting current management practices 2 5 water balance assessment water balance assessment for canal commands is based on the approach of ahmad et al 2021 which modified the surface water balance of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 to derive the following one dimensional surface water balance equation 1 0 p n i cw i ngw e t a b where eta is the outflow of water due to evapotranspiration of crops and other vegetation within the canal command area pn is the water inflow from rainfall icw is the inflow due to diversion of water into the area via canals ingw is the net groundwater use and b is an unaccounted difference term equivalent to the depth of water required to set the right hand side of the equation to zero the signs of all terms in eq 1 are reversed from the convention used in ahmad et al 2021 the convention used here makes interpreting δb in eq 2 more intuitive all terms are given as equivalent depths of water ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 considered term pn as the net rainfall after runoff was accounted for here we note that runoff is small and also not measured or known with any precision therefore we take pn to be the rainfall as measured the small amount of runoff if any will be accounted for in the unaccounted difference term b ahmad et al 2021 assessed all terms in the water balance as monthly time series from 1981 82 to 2012 13 eta in eq 1 was estimated from two remote sensing methods as explained in section 2 4 pn was assessed from rainfall observations and icw was from measured canal flow records the net groundwater use ingw was assessed from observed changes in groundwater levels multiplied by a specific yield to obtain an equivalent depth of groundwater change thus a fall in the groundwater level represents a net supply to the surface if the groundwater recharge and extraction is strictly one dimensional this calculation is correct subject to measurement error most groundwater recharge occurs through rainfall in the north of the basin and seepage from the distributed canal network bonsor et al 2017 khan et al 2017 and so is largely one dimensional any subsurface lateral flows in the groundwater appear as an unaccounted inflow or outflow in the balance term b ahmad et al 2021 found that the observed water balance terms did not close the water balance i e did not sum to zero the lack of closure is the sum of measurement errors plus unaccounted flows as represented by b b generally was up to about 10 and not more than 20 of the sum of the observed terms in the water balance for the canal commands of pakistan a result that compares favourably with other large scale water balance assessments ahmad et al 2021 declining groundwater levels are often used to assess sustainable water use though the interpretation can be problematic zhou 2009 table 1 in ahmad et al 2021 showed that the time series behaviour of b allowed a better assessment of trends in the sustainability of water use than did changes to groundwater levels alone there is likely to be a change in seasonal groundwater storage between the rabi and kharif seasons however the changes over the long term will average approximately to equal and opposite the groundwater level will fall during the rabi dry season but rise again during the kharif wet season using eq 1 to evaluate seasonal water balances therefore introduces an error which will be seen in the difference i e balance term the balance term will be affected by an approximately equal and opposite amount in the two seasons however as we will show we are mainly concerned with how the balance term changes with scenarios of reservoir sedimentation and so on short term fluctuations in groundwater storage are not considered important relative to the difference in the balance term between scenarios in this study we use the historical monthly water balances of ahmad et al 2021 as a current baseline against which to assess the potential impacts under future climate scenarios however we make one modification to their method rather than use measured canal deliveries for the historical baseline we use modelled deliveries during the period 1990 91 to 2012 13 rather than 1981 82 to 2012 13 as assessed by ahmad et al 2021 because modelled canal deliveries described further below were available only for 1990 onwards we do this so that the comparison of scenario generated canal water deliveries which must be modelled with simulated historical deliveries reflects current management and infrastructure the icw term is calculated from a simulation of historical inflows to canal commands using the daily time step irsm canal deliveries as modelled by the irsm were divided by the canal command area to give the results in depth of water impacts may differ between canal commands however as provincial irrigation authorities may choose to redistribute canal deliveries to even out the impacts it was deemed appropriate to aggregate and report results at provincial level while maintaining model resolution at the canal command level in the scenario results that follow the monthly rainfall evapotranspiration and canal deliveries terms in eq 1 were re assessed using climate change projections as described below net groundwater use was assumed not to change as discussed in section 2 4 5 the time series of b was then recalculated from eq 1 we then focus on the change in the b term δb from the base historical case to the scenario 2 δ b b scen b hist p n i cw et a scen p n i cw et a hist where scen and hist indicate scenario and historical values respectively there is no net groundwater term in eq 2 as it was assumed not to change and so ingw scen ingw hist 0 δb in eq 2 is positive when bscen bhist i e when the supply pn icw of water in the scenario is greater relative to the demand eta than was the case historically similarly δb is negative when bscen bhist i e when the supply of water in the scenario is smaller relative to the demand than was the case historically to evaluate the impact of the projected local wet and dry climate change we modified eq 2 to 3 δ b b wet b dry p n i cw et a wet p n i cw et a dry where wet and dry indicate the wet and dry climate change scenarios values and are taken as the average of the two wet and two dry scenario values similarly for the impact of high and low flows due to climate change in the uib we modified eq 2 to 4 δ b b h i g h f l o w b l o w f l o w p n i cw et a h i g h f l o w p n i cw et a l o w f l o w where high flow and low flow indicate the high flow and low flow climate change scenarios values and are taken as the average of the two high flow and low flow scenario values 3 change in the balance term δb and isolating effects in the scenarios presented in this study δb is influenced by four effects i the projected change in climate within the canal commands ii inflows to the ibis and hence canal deliveries resulting from climate change in the uib iii inflows and hence canal deliveries resulting from sedimentation in the reservoirs and iv the method of estimating eta isolating these potential effects provides insight into their relative importance thus providing guidance for future studies to reduce the uncertainty in these terms to isolate the climate within canal command effect the average difference in δb between the two dry climate scenarios and two wet climate scenarios is evaluated eq 3 to isolate the canal deliveries effect the average difference in δb between the two high flow scenarios and two low flow scenarios is evaluated eq 4 to isolate the sedimentation effect the average difference in δb between the sedimentation scenario and base case scenario is evaluated eq 2 to isolate the potential effect due to actual evapotranspiration calculation method the average difference in δb between the etlook and cmrset eta estimates for all scenarios is evaluated all data presented in this paper represent spatial averages for each canal command aggregated to the province level punjab and sindh balochistan 3 1 responding to change in water availability implied change in crop areas changes to δb as calculated above may seem somewhat abstract and not convey the real impact on irrigation a practical way of interpreting δb that conveys the impact on cropping is to derive potential area changes for the key crops table 2 that may be required to return the balance term to the current levels i e set δb to zero the change in area of crops δa required to restore the balance to make δb equal to zero is calculated from the anticipated change in canal deliveries and the crop water requirement from the simulated scenarios eq 5 5 δ a a cc i cw s c e n i cw h i s t et o s c e n et o h i s t cwr crop p

the historical case cwrcrop is the current crop water requirement of the crop under consideration calculated as etww using a crop coefficient approach with the crop coefficients based on ullah et al

is then the crop water requirement after rainfall is accounted for for the crops listed in table 2 the change in crop area implied by δb was calculated for each of the 23 years modelled in the scenarios the selection of the value of ie has a significant impact on the value of δa in the present study ie is interpreted to include the losses in the canals and fields from the diversion point to the point of use of the crops i e the root zone and not the river losses for this study by comparing the change in cropped areas with the change in canal water deliveries for sindh we derived an ie of 57 which is in agreement with the figures suggested by bhutta and smedema 2007 hussain et al 2011 and yu et al 2013 details of the approach to calculate the ie are in appendix b we do not suggest that the crop areas will necessarily change as indicated by the calculation in sindh balochistan crop areas in the past few decades have increased and decreased more or less in line with water supply ahmad et al 2021 whereas in punjab the crop areas have increased continuously by using ever greater quantities of groundwater 4 results in this section after a brief description of the rainfall actual evapotranspiration and canal delivery results we focus on how the difference between the supply of water and evapotranspiration demand is changed in the different seasons under the various scenarios i e how the balance term changes with the scenarios we then examine the implied changes in areas of the crops in table 2 that could be undertaken to make δb 0 in what follows we shall for brevity show mainly the results derived using the cmrset method for assessing actual evapotranspiration the etlook method led to small differences in predicted actual evapotranspiration but as we will show the outcome on δb is very similar for the two methods for comparison of the two methods we show the results for the base case current conditions of the cmrset and etlook methods but we do not show the other scenario results for the etlook method 4 1 rainfall the kharif and rabi rainfall pn projections in the various scenarios are summarised in fig 2 in punjab the median of annual rainfall averaged across the canal commands from 1990 91 to 2012 13 was 342 mm 34 01 km3 whereas it was 125 mm 7 11 km3 in the canal commands of sindh balochistan during the same period the medians of kharif and rabi rainfall in punjab were 271 mm 26 99 km3 and 56 mm 5 54 km3 respectively whereas in sindh balochistan they were 84 mm 4 76 km3 and 19 mm 1 10 km3 with climate change in punjab the median rainfall is projected to increase by between 1 09 dry scenario and 1 66 times wet scenario during kharif and by between 0 77 i e a decrease and 1 17 times during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by between 0 94 and 1 56 times during kharif and by between 0 96 and 0 88 times during rabi 4 2 canal deliveries the modelled canal deliveries icw are summarised in fig 3 the median of annual canal deliveries averaged across the canal commands from 1990 91 to 2012 13 was 551 mm 54 85 km3 in punjab and 868 mm 49 31 km3 in sindh balochistan the corresponding medians of kharif and rabi canal deliveries for punjab were 382 mm 37 96 km3 and 166 mm 16 53 km3 respectively and sindh balochistan were 621 mm 35 27 km3 and 251 mm 14 27 km3 respectively with reservoir sedimentation by 2050 but without climate change in punjab the median canal delivery is projected to increase by 1 002 times during kharif and decrease by 0 996 times during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to increase by 1 03 during kharif and decrease by 0 87 times during rabi with climate change in punjab the median canal delivery is projected to scale between 0 98 low flow scenario i e a decrease and 1 03 times high flow scenario during kharif and by between 0 93 and 1 06 times during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by between 0 93 and 1 08 times during kharif and by between 0 90 and 1 04 times during rabi when 2050 sedimentation is combined with climate change in punjab the median canal delivery is projected to scale by between 0 98 sedimentation with low flow scenario and 1 04 times sedimentation with high flow scenario during kharif and by between 0 87 and 0 96 times i e a decrease during rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by between 0 95 and 1 08 times during kharif and by between 0 80 and 0 92 times during rabi 4 3 actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration eta projections in the various scenarios are summarised in fig 4 in punjab the median annual actual evapotranspiration averaged across the canal commands from 1990 91 to 2012 13 was 895 mm 89 03 km3 for the etlook estimation method and 887 mm 88 26 km3 for the cmrset method whereas in the canal commands of sindh balochistan it was 917 52 10 km3 and 918 mm 52 19 km3 in both punjab and sindh balochistan the etlook method gave slightly greater evapotranspiration in kharif and less in rabi than the cmrset method the corresponding medians of kharif and rabi cmrset eta for punjab were 543 mm 54 02 km3 and 349 mm 34 70 km3 respectively and sindh balochistan were 539 mm 30 63 km3 and 380 mm 21 60 km3 respectively with climate change all scenarios project an increase in median actual evapotranspiration in punjab the median actual evapotranspiration is projected to scale by between 1 07 dry scenario and 1 08 times wet scenario during kharif and by 1 13 dry scenario and 1 14 wet scenario in rabi in sindh balochistan it is projected to scale by 1 05 times during kharif both scenarios and by between 1 09 and 1 12 times in rabi 4 4 change in the balance between supply and demand the estimated change in the balance term δb from the various scenarios are summarised in fig 5 as described in section 2 5 if δb is negative it implies less supply of water in relation to demand if it is positive it implies more supply of water in relation to demand with climate change in the kharif season in punjab the median value of δb was 100 mm equivalent to 9 95 km3 or more in the future wet climate high flow scenario it decreased in the dry climate low flow scenario in sindh balochistan but was unchanged in the dry climate low flow scenario in punjab in the rabi season the median values of δb were negative in all scenarios in both provinces with the lowest values in the low flow scenarios in the kharif season the reservoir sedimentation resulted in a positive δb in the sindh whereas it changed little from the base value for punjab δb was also positive in most kharif scenarios of reservoir sedimentation combined with climate change by values of more than 100 mm equivalent to 5 68 km3 in the future wet climate high flow scenarios the only kharif scenario with a negative δb was the low flow in sindh balochistan in the rabi season the median value of δb was negative in all scenarios sedimentation only and sedimentation combined with climate change in both provinces though only marginally in the case of 2050 sedimentation only in punjab with the negative values being greater in the low flow scenarios 4 5 relative influence on δb of changes in canal deliveries the local climate and eta calculation method the four influencing drivers for the estimate of δb investigated in this study have been grouped as described in section 2 4 to indicate their relative impact and are shown in fig 6 the results show that the method of estimating actual evapotranspiration in isolation has the least impact on the overall mass balance this arises because while the two methods yield different absolute estimates of actual evapotranspiration their estimations of change in actual evapotranspiration in a given scenario are similar we will return to this point in the discussion below with regard to the influence of the remaining driving factors investigated in this study in the kharif season in punjab the local climate effect is the major effect median increase of 106 87 132 mm followed by the flow effect median increase of 25 16 35 mm and then the 2050 sedimentation effect nearly unchanged in the rabi season the factors are the same with local climate as the major effect median increase of 25 14 33 mm then the effect of flow median increase of 9 4 44 mm and then the effect of 2050 sedimentation nearly unchanged in the kharif season in sindh balochistan the flow effect is the major effect median increase of 75 56 116 mm followed by local climate median increase of 51 28 110 mm and 2050 sedimentation median increase of 17 3 28 mm in the rabi season the 2050 sedimentation is the major effect median decrease of 34 30 37 mm then the flow effect median increase of 24 7 57 mm and then local climate effect remain nearly unchanged in contrast to punjab the 2050 sedimentation effect is quite large in both seasons in sindh balochistan the reservoir sedimentation effects are opposite in the kharif and rabi seasons increasing the supply relative to demand in kharif and decreasing it in rabi 4 6 change in the area of crops implied by the changes to supply and demand the implied changes to the areas of three kharif and three rabi crops table 2 are shown in fig 7 the changed areas shown are for each crop individually not in combination in other words they show the implied changes in area as if they were all to be concentrated on a single crop to assist policy makers to explore sustainable cropping patterns and or areas for all crops in both provinces the 2050 sedimentation scenario leads to an increase in the area that may be cropped in the kharif season and a reduction in rabi in line with expectations for all crops in both provinces the low flow scenarios result in an implied reduction in crops whereas the high flow scenarios result in an implied increase the implied changes to the areas of crops in punjab are greater than those in sindh balochistan partly because the current areas of cropping are greater table 2 so a similar proportional change gives a larger absolute change it should also be noted that whereas the implied changes to crop areas are those required to restore the balance term to its current level there is a significant difference between the change in balance fig 6 and the implied change in crop areas fig 7 this is most clearly seen in the rabi season results where the median change in the balance term is negative for all four climate change scenarios implying less water in relation to demand in both provinces but the calculated change to the areas of the three rabi crops is positive i e an increase in area for the high flow scenarios in both provinces this arises because the changes in the water balance are lumped figures for whole canal commands aggregated to the province but the changes in canal deliveries are applied to the cropped areas only eq 3 thus the impact of a proportionate change in canal deliveries is greater in terms of a change to crop areas than it is in terms of the water balance to a whole canal command which includes areas of cropping and non cropped areas it also has a greater impact on a change to crop areas than does a similar proportionate change in rainfall for all crops in both provinces all reservoir sedimentation with climate change scenarios lead to a reduction in the area that may be cropped in the rabi season in the kharif season the reservoir sedimentation with low flow scenarios also result in an implied reduction in crops whereas the high flow scenarios result in an implied increase 5 discussion the results for the modelled scenarios show that there is considerable uncertainty in the impact of projected climate change within the irrigated areas of the indus basin in pakistan the canal commands water balance suggests that the areas of crops that could be grown at the current level of sustainable water use may increase or decrease depending on the scenario the prospects of increasing the areas of crops may be greater in the kharif season while decreasing the areas of crops may be more necessary in the rabi season sedimentation in the reservoirs affects the overall picture the results described in the previous section show that the impacts in the canal commands in punjab differ from those in sindh balochistan and differ between kharif and rabi seasons future water resources management may need to adjust to cope with these likely changes 5 1 difference in water balance drivers between the provinces reservoir sedimentation impacts differ significantly between the provinces overall punjab is barely affected by the 2050 sedimentation scenario whereas sindh balochistan is significantly affected this result is partly because of groundwater use and lower evaporative demand in punjab during the rabi season punjab also generally has higher rainfall than sindh balochistan particularly in the northern and north eastern parts of the province the canal commands of punjab therefore require and receive less additional irrigation water per unit area of canal command unsurprisingly as shown in fig 6 punjab is estimated to be impacted more by the projected climate change within the canal commands than it is by the potential climate change in the uib influencing canal deliveries during the kharif season the difference in water balance changes between dry and wet climate scenarios is larger than 100 mm 10 55 km3 in punjab compared to 25 mm 2 44 km3 between low and high flow scenarios overall the projected local climate change is the dominant effect in punjab followed by flow changes canal delivery and reservoir sedimentation in sindh balochistan rainfall is very low and in absolute terms is not much affected by climate change the canal commands of sindh balochistan therefore require and receive a higher proportional crop water supply from canals than do those of punjab sindh balochistan are therefore projected to be impacted more by the changes in canal deliveries and less by projected climate change within the canal commands the difference in water balance changes particularly in the rabi season is less than 10 mm 0 57 km3 between dry and wet climate scenarios but larger than 20 mm 1 14 km3 between low and high flow scenarios overall in sindh balochistan the flow canal delivery effect is dominant followed by sedimentation in rabi and projected local climate change in kharif the combined effect of 2050 sedimentation and climate change reported here is estimated to be greater than the effect of climate change alone however the difference is small in punjab because of the small effect of 2050 sedimentation whereas the difference is large in sindh balochistan as noted above the implied changes to crop areas are greater in the punjab than in sindh balochistan 5 2 differences between kharif and rabi projected impacts the impact of reservoir sedimentation differs in the kharif and rabi seasons the reduced storage capacity due to sedimentation means that in the kharif season less water is stored and therefore more water is subsequently allocated to irrigation areas augmenting supply conversely in rabi the lesser storage capacity reduces the supply available for irrigation as expected the kharif rainfall is projected to increase under both the wet and dry climates in punjab and in the wet climate in sindh balochistan and this is consistent with archer et al 2010 and yu et al 2013 this increase combined with the projected increases to canal deliveries in the high flow scenario is generally greater than the projected increase in actual evapotranspiration thereby showing a positive change ranging from 20 to 138 mm equivalent to 1 15 13 70 km3 to the balance term in most scenarios in the kharif season fig 5 the effect is stronger in punjab where rainfall totals are greater than in sindh balochistan and the projected absolute increases in rainfall totals under climate change is correspondingly greater in the rabi season the dry climate scenario rainfall is projected to decline in both provinces yu et al 2013 and the wet climate scenario rainfall represents a small increase in absolute terms this combined with reductions in canal deliveries low flow scenario or modest increases high flow scenario is insufficient to offset the projected increases in evapotranspiration leading to a negative change ranging from 19 to 77 mm equivalent to 1 07 7 65 km3 to the balance term in all scenarios in both provinces in the rabi season as noted above the combined effect of 2050 sedimentation and climate change as reported here is greater than the effect of climate change alone particularly in sindh balochistan in the kharif season the greater supply relative to demand is enhanced by reservoir sedimentation combined with climate change conversely in rabi the lesser supply relative to demand is exacerbated by the two effects combined 5 3 uncertainties in the estimation of actual evapotranspiration the estimates of actual evapotranspiration differed in the two methods etlook and cmrset however in contrast to the impact of the dry and wet climate scenarios and the low and high flow scenarios the evapotranspiration method had very little impact on the change in the water balance in the future scenarios this is because while the absolute magnitude of the estimated actual evapotranspiration varies with the method the change in evapotranspiration under the wet and dry climate scenarios is similar for the two estimates actual evapotranspiration is influenced by the potential evapotranspiration crop factors and soil water availability allen et al 1998 the impact of future climate is likely to be felt primarily through a change in potential evapotranspiration changes to crop factors may of course occur but the biggest influence on them is likely to be the area and type of crop sown to examine that we have looked at the potential impact of changed climate and sedimentation on the areas of crops that can be sown on the issue of soil water availability farming practices in sindh are often criticised for over watering and widespread waterlogging van steenbergen et al 2015 in the punjab lack of surface supply is generally made up from groundwater at the level of the individual canal it is widely accepted that the head end tends to be over watered and the tail end experiences a shortfall often made up with groundwater murray rust and vander velde 1994 the impact of soil water availability changes is therefore likely to be affected by improved practices to deliver just the right amount of water at the right time rather than through the influence of climate change ahmad et al 2009 peña arancibia and ahmad 2020 5 4 the impact of groundwater use behaviour and sustainability implications in sindh balochistan less groundwater is used than in the punjab and generally crop areas are adjusted in response to canal water availability see appendix b if this practice were to continue future water use would not necessarily be less sustainable than at present in these provinces however while annual net groundwater use in punjab might be a small component of the overall water balance groundwater declines over many years are cumulatively sufficient to cause concern over unsustainable groundwater use in several canal commands ahmad et al 2021 basharat et al 2014 in recent years crop areas have increased while canal deliveries remain static ahmad et al 2021 ever greater quantities of groundwater have been pumped to irrigate this greater area of crops kirby et al 2017 punjab has the option to respond to future changes in water availability by changing the amount of groundwater pumped and or changing the irrigated area since the water availability relative to demand is projected to decrease in all scenarios in the rabi season for punjab it appears likely that groundwater use will become increasingly unsustainable in rabi if cropping areas are to remain static the challenge then remains to moderate the potential cropping area increases in kharif so that sufficient groundwater recharge can offset the additional rabi groundwater requirement however in some scenarios the water use in the kharif season may also increase in punjab thus becoming less sustainable the unsustainable nature of the use is partly the mining of a finite resource and partly the consequent likelihood of mobilising migration of salty groundwater into previously fresh groundwater zones lytton et al 2021 the least sustainable option would be to continue historical groundwater extractions in kharif while expanding crop areas under scenarios indicating increased surface flows and then make up the shortfall in rabi from additional groundwater pumping we note however that as the groundwater levels continue to decline the cost of pumping will likely increase until extraction becomes economically unviable and groundwater use may be constrained to the natural recharge rate furthermore there will be increasing risk of secondary salinity by pumping saline groundwater from deep saline aquifers and or expansion of saline groundwater pockets punjab would then face the same options as sindh and resort to changing seasonal cropping areas as shown in fig 7 this would require alternative demand management strategies such as increasing productivity growing smaller areas of water intensive crops like cotton rice and sugar importing more food or exporting less see kirby et al 2017 to meet the demand for increased food in pakistan in the future the other key consideration from the analysis is that the reservoir sedimentation in the dams will by 2050 change considerably the areas of crops that can be grown in sindh balochistan in the kharif and rabi seasons more land could be cropped in kharif but more would stand idle in rabi due to reduced canal flows and the inability to use saline groundwater to supplement supply given that current farm management input supply and product marketing are geared to the present distribution of crops between the two seasons this would appear to be undesirable it would therefore seem important for sindh balochistan in particular that reservoir sedimentation be controlled in the longer term punjab will also be adversely affected by sedimentation and will then also gain benefit from sedimentation control for example controlling sedimentation will benefit the maintenance of hydropower production ahmed and sanchez 2011 for irrigation supply building a new storage dam would achieve the same outcome of mitigating sedimentation impacts on existing storages 6 conclusions we conclude that 1 projected climate change in the uib as it affects flows in the indus river and its tributaries is the major climate change impact on future water balance in the canal commands of sindh balochistan and is greater than local climate change impacts this outcome contrasts with that found for punjab where changes in rainfall within the areas of the canal commands are a more important climate change impact than estimated changes in canal deliveries 2 the range of plausible climate change scenarios indicate both projected increases and decreases in water availability relative to provincial irrigation demand the kharif season has an increase in water availability in high flow scenarios while the rabi season has a decrease in most scenarios 3 reservoir sedimentation to 2050 will diminish the supply of irrigation water in the rabi season to sindh balochistan and increase the kharif supply however punjab will not be greatly affected by 2050 by water balance changes arising from reservoir sedimentation 4 sedimentation combined with climate change in sindh balochistan exacerbates the decrease in supply in rabi and increases the supply in kharif more than either effect alone 5 sindh balochistan assuming current cropping behaviour persists will continue to adjust crops to match the water availability this implies that the sustainability of water use in sindh balochistan will remain similar to present levels under plausible climate change scenarios on this basis the change in crop areas in sindh balochistan is likely to be an increase in kharif and a decrease in rabi 6 in punjab if current cropping behaviour persists the groundwater resource will continue to be used to buffer changes in surface water availability as well as supporting increases in irrigated areas consequently the amount of water pumped for rabi crops will increase while that pumped in the kharif season will depend on the trade off between increases in surface water availability versus growth in area this implies that overall water use in the punjab will become less sustainable as groundwater resources are depleted further in rabi unless kharif canal deliveries are used the key learning arising from this research is that despite the challenges there are opportunities for pakistan to achieve water and food security it appears that no single strategy will suffice both supply side and demand side policies and management are needed supply management options include reservoir sedimentation management construction of new storages irrigation efficiency improvements desalinisation of saline sea and groundwater and improved conjunctive use whereas key demand strategies are improving land and water productivity and promoting resilient and sustainable cropping patterns according to water availability supply side options will take time to implement so the immediate focus could be to promote demand management and public awareness the increased understanding of how the system functions will enable better management decisions knowing what to do in what circumstance and how actions will affect the system s operation backed up by observations to enable adaptive management credit authorship contribution statement mobin ud din ahmad

review process appendix a details of the climate change scenarios we developed projections of changed climates for the period 2046 to 2075 for the canal commands based on an empirical downscaling or change factor approach zheng et al 2018 the changed climates were calculated as monthly totals we did not apply the approach to all gcms since some appear to simulate rainfall in sindh poorly li et al 2017 and downscaling the projections for future scenarios appeared to give unreasonable results this arose because in the scaling factor approach some months in some locations would be assigned large sometimes very large scaling factors the large scaling factors resulted from dividing a future projected rainfall by a near zero rainfall in the month and location in question the large scaling factors when applied to the historical data in months when there was a large rainfall would lead to unreasonably large rainfalls in that month in the future scenario years we ignored all gcms for which this problem occurred this resulted in a list of 11 gcms table a1 from this list of 11 gcms we selected five which were chosen to give contrasting changes in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in pakistan average change in rainfall with average change in potential evapotranspiration most negative or least positive change in rainfall with average change in potential evapotranspiration most positive change in rainfall with average change in potential evapotranspiration average change in rainfall with most negative or least positive change in potential evapotranspiration average change in rainfall with most positive change in potential evapotranspiration the projected potential evapotranspiration eto calculated with this procedure was combined with the estimates of actual evapotranspiration eta to calculate projected actual evapotranspiration according to a1 e t a m o n t h s c e n a r i o e t a m o n t h h i s t o r i c a l e t o m o n t h s c e n a r i o e t o m o n t h h i s t o r i c a l this scaling approach was used by ahmad et al 2019 to derive the extrapolated historical time series of actual evapotranspiration and is adapted here to derive projected climate change time series the average rainfall of the canal commands averaged for the punjab and sindh provinces is shown in fig a 1 for the historical period of 1981 82 to 2012 13 and for the five climate change scenarios note these figures were calculated from monthly totals the kharif rainfall was calculated as the total from april to september the rabi rainfall was calculated as the sum of the remaining months the annual rainfall is projected to increase in three of the five climate change scenarios in sindh and decrease in two but to increase in all five scenarios in the punjab fgoals s2 gives the greatest projected rainfall in both provinces and miroc esm the least in sindh and second least in the punjab miroc esm also gives the least rainfall in the rabi season in both provinces fig a 2 shows the projected actual evapotranspiration averaged for the punjab and sindh for the etlook estimation method and fig a 3 shows the projected actual evapotranspiration for the cmrset estimation method the two methods give similar projected annual totals however the cmrset method results in higher rabi evapotranspiration and lower late kharif evapotranspiration than does the etlook method the fgoals s2 projection gives the highest annual actual evapotranspiration in both provinces whereas the miroc esm projection gives the second highest in the punjab and third highest in sindh when combined with the rainfall results miroc esm gives the driest projected climate in the two provinces for the assessment reported here we further reduced the five climate change scenarios described above to a consideration only of the scenario which across all canal commands gave the greatest increase in rainfall using the fgoals s2 model to give a wet scenario and that which gave the driest climate miroc esm model dry scenario appendix b details of irrigation efficiency consideration sindh balochistan has little fresh groundwater available for irrigation and responds to changing water availability mainly by changing crop areas as shown in fig b 1 the slope of the regression line in fig b 1 is approximately 67 000 ha bcm the area weighted average crop water requirement calculated using a crop coefficient model was 1011 mm in 2013 14 including the effective rainfall 1bcm of canal water at an irrigation efficiency of 100 would meet the crop water requirement over approximately 117 000 ha the regression line in fig b 1 therefore implies an irrigation efficiency of 57 i e 67 000 117 000 expressed as a percentage the estimated efficiency is comparable to the average irrigation efficiency of 52 used by simons et al 2020 who computed the efficiency at the canal command level in the ibis with values between 38 and 66 ahmad and kutcher 1992 reported that irrigation efficiency within the ibis varied canal by canal ranging from 60 to 80 for this study we used an irrigation efficiency of 57 which is just outside the range and approximately midway between the figures suggested by bhutta and smedema 2007 hussain et al 2011 and yu et al 2013 this estimation method applies to the whole system and implicitly incorporates re use of water lost from the irrigation system re use includes use of groundwater into which water lost from fields and canals has infiltrated and use downstream of any water lost from fields and canals which returns to the river and or canal system 
4052,a two year hydrological characterisation programme of relatively intact blanket peat covered catchments underlain by geochemically distinct substrates investigated the influence of sub peat materials on the runoff regimes of the first order and second order streams draining them semi continuous monitoring of flow and water quality revealed a strong inverse relationship between stream flow rates and specific electrical conductance sec with runoff chemistries during storm flow proving comparable in all three catchments by contrast differences in water quality between catchments became more pronounced at lower flow where increased ion concentrations in stream water reflected reactions with peat substrate materials water table monitoring in peat at all three sites revealed groundwater levels to vary by less than 0 6 m over the investigation period findings suggest runoff consists of near constant inputs of higher specific electrical conductance peat substrate discharge mixing with variable proportions of less mineralised and more compositionally variable bog water although making up less than 5 to total runoff the contribution of more mineralised waters plays an important role in maintaining stream flow particularly during prolonged dry periods and may help explain the aquatic biodiversity encountered in blanket peat covered areas keywords blanket bog water quality base flow discharge 1 plain language summary blanket bogs are an unusual wetland type that occurs in areas that receive a lot of rainfall all year round although they are a rare habitat worldwide they form the commonest type of wetland in britain and ireland where they act as an important source of drinking water when they develop in mountainous areas although the water in blanket bogs has low levels of mineralisation and is acidic the streams draining blanket bogs display an unusual variety of organisms a detailed two year study of the flow and water quality in three of these streams showed them to contain highly mineralised water during prolonged dry periods that reflect water that has flowed underneath the bog before coming out in the stream the quality of this water depends on the type of minerals found underneath the peat this gives rise to variable dry weather water quality which helps explain the variety of organisms found in areas where the wetland water quality varies little 2 introduction although considered a globally rare habitat blanket bog locally covers extensive areas of europe the americas asia and oceania gallego sala colin 2013 the habitat proves unusual compared to other wetland types in that it consists of thick sequences 0 5 m of peat draping landscapes sometimes with slopes in excess of 20 degrees mitchell and ryan 1997 connolly and holden 2009 in britain and ireland blanket bog forms the dominant wetland type by coverage occurring in regions receiving high 1200 mm yr rodwell 1991 and frequent rainfall 160 rain days yr o connell 1990 this includes mountainous terrain where blanket peat has accumulated on substrates ranging from low permeability glacial clays to directly developing on top of limestone aquifers geological survey of ireland although more typically encountered across upland areas the habitat can extend down to at sea level where climatic conditions prove suitable traditionally areas containing blanket bog have often been viewed as having low economic value to be developed for other economic purposes that generate more tangible economic assets renou wilson et al 2018 however recent years have witnessed a growing appreciation of the ecosystem services provided by blanket bogs to water bonn et al 2016 this has proven to be particularly the case in north western europe where their capacity to provide large volumes of better quality water compared to more developed lower lying areas coupled with their close proximity to major population centres has meant that catchments containing blanket bog peat are favoured sources for drinking water supplies in britain and ireland these areas constitute the dominant source of potable water with this region consuming 85 of all drinking water derived from peatland worldwide xu et al 2018 for the uk this equates to 25 of all drinking water having an estimated annual value of 888 million in 2016 trenbirth and dutton 2019 although figures are more difficult to come by for ireland catchments containing blanket bogs make up a significant proportion of total drinking water sources this applies not only in less densely populated western parts of the country where coverage proves extensive fig 1 but also for the city of dublin where catchments containing blanket bog provide 154 megalitres day to a population of 1 26 million people xu et al 2018 blanket bogs also provide less tangible economic benefits in that they act as important refuges for biodiversity containing numerous specialised species cuckston 2017 however consideration of this aspect has focused largely on terrestrial habitats and the species they support bonn et al 2016 while bogs influence on the ecology of surface waters draining them has received less attention e g hannigan et al 2011 nonetheless this latter aspect has important legal implications for european union eu member states who are required to maintain the status of surface water bodies in accordance with water framework directive wfd legislation 2000 60 ec this requires member states to achieve a minimum of good water body status which is assessed through routine monitoring of biological and physicochemical parameters mcgarrigle 2020 moreover where degradation of status has occurred the wfd stipulates a requirement for member states to implement a programme of measures to restore ecosystem condition across ireland streams draining blanket peat covered areas constitute the majority of remaining wfd high status sites making them important refuges of aquatic biodiversity flynn et al 2021a however the hydrological processes operating in draining streams and the resulting water quality supporting aquatic ecosystems remain poorly defined recent published literature concerning blanket bog hydrology displays a strong bias toward degraded sites requiring restoration with many studies focusing on the fate and transport of dissolved organic carbon doc evans et al 2016 on the other hand published studies considering other substances remain rare particularly in relatively intact habitats despite their ecological importance e g vogt and muniz 1997 moreover investigations of these constituents in blanket bog runoff has rarely been accompanied by flow measurements despite the demonstrated value of combining physical hydrological data and water quality to better understand natural processes e g richards et al 1996 xiao et al 2019 fennessy et al 2004 an improved understanding of peatland hydrology underpins more effective management of blanket bogs and the ecosystem services associated with them this includes benefits that may arise through habitat restoration measures bonn et al 2016 current approaches to blanket bog restoration are hindered by the limited number of hydrological studies in less damaged near intact areas which constrain current capacity to understand natural background processes and thus establish realistic restoration targets moreover interactions between groundwater and streamflow have not been sufficiently characterised to allow pathways contributing to runoff to be quantified with confidence the research reported in this article aimed to characterise pathways contributing to stream discharge in catchments covered by blanket peat and relatively unaffected by human activity investigations employed physical hydrological and hydrogeological measurements in conjunction with water quality data to constrain flow paths and characterise their relative contributions to total flow particularly during direr periods when conditions may prove particularly stressful to aquatic ecosystems kelly quinn and reynolds 2020 furthermore relating water quality to geological conditions across three catchments with contrasting peat substrate geochemistries aimed to better quantify contributions from deeper subsurface flow paths and their potential influence on abiotic elements of stream aquatic ecology investigations were completed over a two year period in the headwaters of three irish blanket peat covered catchments which have experienced minimal disturbance from human activity findings have not only highlighted the need to incorporate hydrogeological measurements to better understand stream flow regimes but also the value of water quality and geochemistry to more confidently characterise the hydrological processes contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability 3 materials and methods 3 1 catchment descriptions a review of 1403 candidate irish headwater catchments across the island of ireland incorporating the republic of ireland and northern ireland covered by blanket bog peat failed to identify any catchments 1 km2 in area that did not exhibit visible evidence of human disturbance e g forestry artificial drainage flynn et al 2021b following the application of multiple criteria analysis a short list of the 341 sites displaying lower levels of impact three of the least disturbed catchments lying along the east west climatic gradient encountered across ireland met eireann 2021 were selected fig 1 table 1 summarises physical conditions at each site critically each area had contrasting peat substrate bedrock and inorganic overburden geochemistry overlain by relatively intact blanket peat displaying minimal impacts from human activity the contrast in peat substrate compositions including those of bedrock aimed to reflect the heterogeneous geological conditions encountered across ireland it is particularly notable that the calcareous lr carboniferous mississippian limestone aquifer underlying the letterunshin site forms part of the dominant aquifer type across ireland geological survey of ireland while predominantly siliceous namurian sandstones and shales underlying the cuilcagh site provide an indication of the influence of low productivity bedrock aquifers which underlie over 60 of the island of ireland moe et al 2010 the mafic basalt aquifer underlying the garron catchment falls between these two aquifer types and forms the dominant bedrock unit in the northeast of ireland robbins et al 2011 fig 2 summarises topographic conditions at each site reflecting the variation in elevation with the lowest point being occupied by the catchment outlet in each case 3 2 runoff monitoring hydraulic structures weirs flumes installed at the outlet of each catchment permitted generation of critical conditions necessary to confidently relate stream stage to discharge over the range of flow experienced during the monitoring period april 2018 april 2020 spot dilution gauging at each structure using saline tracer fully mixed by stream turbulence 5 m upstream of monitoring points permitted rating curve generation non vented level loggers solinst waterloo ont with a 1 m measurement range allowed for semi continuous stage monitoring and the generation of semi continuous plots of stream discharge measured at 20 min intervals 3 3 runoff water quality monitoring runoff monitoring also aimed to investigate variations in water quality under contrasting hydrological conditions and over the hydrological year sampling for laboratory analyses took place at approximately monthly intervals coupled with continuous monitoring of surrogate parameters to evaluate the representativeness of sample data hobo u24 001 temperature electrical conductivity data ec loggers onset corp ma placed at the outlet of each catchment permitted simultaneous semi continuous measurement of runoff electrical conductivity and temperature at 20 min intervals over the same period as flow monitoring spot measurements of specific electrical conductance using a calibrated ysi proplus hand held water quality meter yellow springs oh permitted conversion of hobo logger ec readings to generate a record of specific electrical conductance sec with flow associated water quality sampling for laboratory analyses involved evaluating variations in aqueous dissolve and total organic carbon along with silicon and major ions to better constrain hydrological processes sampling consisted of collecting each sample in two separate hdpe sample bottles with a 0 3 µm filtered sample acidified with 1 n nitric acid used for cation analysis samples were immediately chilled and stored in a dark space and analysed within one week of collection in the field a dionex aquion ion chromatography system permitted analysis of major cations na k ca mg tm152 0000 chloride and sulphate tm184 0000 where sample ph exceeded 6 5 alkalinity was determined by titration with 1 n hcl tm043 0000 doc and toc analysis were carried out in accordance with method tm090 tm090 0000 using a non dispersive infrared detector 3 4 groundwater monitoring adaptation of the distributed peatland hydrological model developed by mackin et al 2017 permitted identification of representative hydrological settings for monitoring groundwater levels in peat the approach assumes that bog hydrology is dominated by surface and near surface hydrological processes and uses topographic and climatic data to identify those areas which would be anticipated to experience contrasting hydrological processes e g zones of focused flow compared to zones of diffuse flow installation of piezometer nests at between five and eight locations across each catchment provided access to groundwater to allow water table monitoring and peat groundwater quality sampling to take place nests consisted of three 32mmid pvc water table piezometers with one metre screened intervals installed in the uppermost metre of peat and where depth permitted a deep piezometer made of the same materials but with a 50 cm long screen installed at the interface between the peat and underlying inorganic substrate infrastructural damage by livestock prevented water level monitoring in deeper peat at the cuilcagh site the tops of all piezometers were covered with vented caps to prevent ingress of rainfall and potential contamination of groundwater samples in addition to allowing access for water level monitoring piezometers permitted testing of peat hydraulic conductivity through slug testing using combined rising and falling head methods following the approach described by butler 1997 data analysis followed the approach for determining hydraulic conductivity of irish peats described by regan et al 2019 briefly this consisted of displacing groundwater levels by approximately 5 cm using a data logger as a slug for displacement and monitoring water level responses at 10 s intervals over the ensuing hour water level monitoring was carried out through a combination of manual measurements and semi continuous monitoring using solinst level loggers 5 m range solinst ont semi continuous monitoring of all water table piezometers over a two month period between the end of winter irish hydrological winter october through to end march and the start of summer irish hydrological summer april to end september revealed little variation between water levels at each cluster table 3 given these findings and due to limited resource availability a logger were then left in one piezometer in each cluster for the duration of the monitoring period groundwater sampling carried out on an approximately quarterly basis over the monitoring period consisted of purging piezometers of well water with a hand held suction pump this was immediately followed by sample collection for laboratory analysis using the same pump and storing samples following the approach described for runoff sampling following sample collection lowering a ysi water quality sonde into the screened interval of each piezometer was used to record groundwater temperature ph and sec 3 5 precipitation three rain gauges installed at each catchment over the first two to three months of the monitoring period permitted investigation of the effects of elevation on precipitation rates since the effects of orographic rainfall proved negligible a single gauge monitored rainfall in each catchment over the rest of the monitoring period gauges consisted of either davis vantage pro plus 2 tipping bucket rain gauges or onset automatic tipping rain gauges with hobo pendant event data loggers onset corp ma an additional manual rain gauge in each catchment permitted validation of precipitation rates while also facilitating the collection of samples to measure rain water quality this consisted of field based measures with a subset of rainwater samples submitted for laboratory analysis for the same parameters as groundwater and runoff 3 6 substrate analysis exposures of subsoils and rock where outcropping underlying blanket peat in all three catchments permitted substrate sampling a clean stainless steel trowel excavated the top five to ten centimetres of material in contact with the atmosphere before sample collection samples were stored in dedicated airtight plastic bags before being placed in a cool dark location soil samples underwent x ray fluorescence xrf and x ray diffraction xrd analysis to determine soil and rock composition xrd analysis employed a panalytical x pert pro mpd with x ray source cu kα1 radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma and a step size of 0 020 2 theta to identify minerals rietveld analysis permitted quantification of composition to 1 by volume ward et al 2001 ruan and ward 2002 xrf analysis was carried out using a panalytical axios advanced xrf spectrometer pw4400 the use of xrf for analysis of elemental content of soil and geological material has been well documented cave et al 2000 tani et al 2005 el taher 2012 and has a resolution of 0 01 by volume 4 results 4 1 substrate geochemistry table 2 summarises the results of substrate geochemical analyses for the three study catchments the data reveal relatively consistent compositions within catchments but that these contrast significantly between sites major elemental and mineralogical compositions of unconsolidated inorganic substrate samples from both cuilcagh and garron catchment reflect compositions typically anticipated from deposits derived from underlying bedrock by contrast conditions at letterunshin do not reflect the anticipated composition of deposits derived from the underlying limestone bedrock it is particularly noteworthy that xrf analyses failed to detect elevated calcium levels 1 cao this is consistent with outcrop observations which revealed diamictic deposits contain clasts up to boulder size of crystalline igneous and siliceous metamorphic material in a carbonate free matrix determined through testing with 1 n hcl 4 2 precipitation data a review of air temperature and precipitation records revealed that 98 percent of precipitation recorded over the monitoring period fell as rainfall with snow encountered predominantly in january and february of both years this is consistent with findings from nearby official weather stations which also revealed conditions encountered over the monitoring period to be broadly representative of the longer term climatic 30 year average measured at each station however the findings belie monthly data particularly for the period from mid march 2020 to mid june 2020 when conditions proved anomalously dry comparison of site specific rainfall patterns across each site failed to reveal significant differences in rainfall between gauges set at different elevations despite the relief present in all three catchments fig 2 similarly manual rainfall data agreed with the findings of automated measurements to within 3 water quality data suggested typical rainfall chemistries for those samples examined namely low ionic content dominated by na and cl along with low sec and acidic ph one the other hand dissolved organic carbon content proved negligible in all precipitation samples 4 3 groundwater monitoring table 3 summarises water table fluctuations for all three sites throughout the monitoring period water table levels in peat remained within 60 cm of the ground surface despite the high levels of relief encountered in other words groundwater heads closely reflected topography moreover in those catchments containing piezometers screened at the base of the peat the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient acted consistently downwards groundwater level monitoring for all catchments revealed significant sensitivity to rainfall with broadly consistent scalar responses fig 3 as observed in peatlands elsewhere cobb and harvey 2019 this includes responses following prolonged dry periods despite an apparent moisture deficit the results of piezometer testing in peat at all three sites reveals hydraulic conductivities in the uppermost 1 m of peat to range between 3 m day and 0 005 m day with geometric means of approximately 0 2 m day across all sites values for deeper peat occurring at the substrate interface at garron and letterunshin were estimated to be 4x 10 5 m day campbell 2017 sampling and analysis revealed that the quality of groundwater flowing through the peat in all three catchments varied little and had characteristics that compared favourably with published data for british blanket bogs lindsay 1995 sample analyses revealed they had high levels of colour but low sec and acidic ph similarly major ion analyses revealed water both at the water table and at depth to be dominated by low concentrations of sodium and chloride fig 4 presents the range of sec and doc observed in samples collected from all three sites 4 4 runoff flow regime table 4 summarises the flow characteristics of the streams draining each catchment high q90 to q10 ratios reflect flashy rainfall runoff responses this is further manifested by rapid rising limbs in stream hydrographs along with slightly less rapid recession yet leading to flow rates that can be an order of magnitude lower less than one day following peak discharge conventional assumptions of log linear recession would suggest that all the water courses investigated would dry up shortly after peak flow should no additional precipitation occur nonetheless streams continued to discharge water albeit at significantly lower rates during prolonged dry periods deviating from anticipated text book responses e g fetter 2003 integration of flow data has permitted determination of total volumes of water lost and the overall contribution of runoff to catchment flow balances subdividing hydrographs into summer and winter periods revealed that runoff dominates losses during the winter period whereas it accounts for between 20 and 78 of total precipitation received during the summer period groundwater levels in peat at the start and end of these periods were close to at the ground surface suggesting negligible net change in storage 4 5 runoff hydrochemistry gradual changes in runoff chemistry accompany stream hydrograph recession in all three study catchments with water becoming progressively more mineralised with declining flow critically sec levels and the concentrations of cations observed in base flow can exceed than those in observed in peat groundwater samples while doc colour levels in runoff generally fall at or slightly below the concentration range observed in peat pore water plotting sec with flow suggests a log linear relationship at lower flows which breaks down at higher discharges fig 5 relationships observed at cuilcagh have been complicated by localised subsidence at the gauging point with earlier data broadly corresponding to the trend observed in the other two catchments investigating relationships between sec and major ion content reveals significant correlations for calcium and magnesium at garron and letterrunshin a comparable association exists with sodium at cuilcagh the relationship with dissolved organic carbon content proves more difficult to define at all locations nonetheless the resulting plot of sec with doc defines the range of possible doc contents in runoff samples with the variability in concentration increasing with lower sec by contrast variability in doc concentration proves greater with high flow in all three catchments compiling major ion and sec data on an expanded durov plot fig 6 allows the evolution of water quality with flow to be better characterised and indicates contrasting inorganic ion content between catchments during low flow conditions as flow rates increase in response to rainfall sec declines reflecting a reduction in ionic strength and a change in the relative proportions of major ions with water from all catchments converging toward comparable low ionic strength sodium chloride waters in contrast doc concentrations tend to increase with flow although this is significantly more variable than conditions observed with major ions 5 discussion the results of the investigations carried out reveal that despite the persistence of relatively stable water tables and peat groundwater quality across test catchments both flow and water quality in receiving streams prove considerably more variable the observed flashy flow regimes arise in part from high groundwater levels in peat these limit available storage and its buffering capacity in response to precipitation events throughout much of the year this in conjunction with steep relief acts as the dominant driver for the flashy flow regimes observed the gradual increase in runoff mineralisation which accompanies recession following storm events reflects systematic changes in ionic content that are intimately linked to flow moreover water quality in each catchment becomes progressively more distinctive as flow rates decline comparison of cation levels notably with chloride which is frequently assumed to be a conservative tracer reflecting physical hydrological processes younger 2009 reveal relative concentrations of ca na and mg in base flow that are considerably higher than detected in peat groundwater the findings imply that these substances must be derived from reactions occurring along deeper the flow paths following infiltration through peat head data observed at both garron and letterunshin provide further evidence for this point and show that hydraulic gradients at peat peizometer nests have a consistent downward component with a portion of the groundwater in the peat percolating through its base into substrate materials acidic low ionic strength peat pore water is thus able to react with substrate materials to change its chemical signature the importance of this process is reflected by the comparable chemistry of peat groundwaters across all catchments compared to variable runoff quality observed at lower flows which depend on the composition of the substrate materials more generally this is reflected by the sec of base flow while the differences in ionic signature can be accounted for through the contrasting nature of substrate materials moreover elevated calcium concentrations detected in base flow samples from letterunshin suggest that flow paths contributing mineralised water to runoff are not restricted to the upper layers of the substrate given the low calcium concentrations and mineralogy detected the inorganic subsoil samples collected from across the catchment on the other hand concentrations observed during low flow conditions can be explained by groundwater discharging from the underlying limestone bedrock reflecting a significant contribution of water flowing along deeper flow paths to stream flow combining physical and hydrochemical data provides a means of quantifying runoff contributions from different flow paths notably using end member mixing analyses emma hooper et al 1990 in its simplest form the emma model assumes that the observed stream water chemistry cstream arises from variable contributions from two or more sources of water contributing to the total flow in the stream q streaml with sufficiently different water quality signatures additional hydrological flow paths may be defined to give total flow as follows 1 q stream q 1 q 2 q n combining concentration data thus allows further equations to be generated of the form 2 c stream q stream c 1 q 1 c 2 q 2 c n q n the equation proves valid provided mixing does not generate reactions resulting in processes other than dilution with n 1 distinctive end member signatures the contributions to runoff from diverse hydrological flow paths may be defined by combining forms of eq 2 for various parameters with eq 1 and solving for a simple two end member mixing calculation combining eq 1 and eq 2 with peat groundwater with concentration cpeat and substrate groundwater with concentration csubstrate yields the following 3 q substrate q runoff c runoff c peat c substrate c peat using eq 1 and eq 3 thus allows calculation of the proportions of each end member contributing to flow for greater numbers of end members calculations may be comparably determined using matrix methods critically emma assumes that the water types included in the equations have fixed chemistries however the compositional variability of peat groundwater in space and time calls this assumption into question fig 7 summarises the variability in peat groundwater quality at garron while sec and doc concentration observed in runoff proves comparably variable nonetheless application of the emma mixing model using the results of groundwater analyses of samples from the basalt aquifer in a comparable physical setting and peat groundwater reveals that almost all runoff samples apart from those encountered at very low sec fall within the limits defined by the model those falling outside the range occur were sampled at high flow fig 5 when peat groundwater contributions have been diluted with water resembling precipitation based on the emma model data collected from garron suggest that during prolonged dry periods when flows reduce to approximately 1 6 l sec roughly 75 of stream flow consists of water discharging from the substrate materials underlying the peat moreover application of this model implies that the low doc concentrations observed in runoff following prolonged dry spells approximately 8 mg l derive from peat groundwaters with concentrations at the upper end of the range detected in peat groundwater samples given the relatively invariant concentrations observed in basalt groundwater samples the mixing model may be further employed to better understand temporal variations in runoff quality while confidence in the model may be improved by incorporating physical hydrogeological data more specifically given the limited variation in groundwater head in the peat relative to the variation in total groundwater head across the catchment implies that the hydraulic gradient operating between groundwater and stream can be approximated as constant consequently the changes in sec and doc observed during higher flows may be attributed to end member mixing coupled with compositionally variable contributions of lower sec lower doc peat water as reflected in fig 7 furthermore considering the input of more mineralised water to occur at an approximately constant rate suggests that catchment wide recharge rates to the peat substrate to be approximately 16 mm yr following a comparable approach to that adopted at garron in the other two catchments proved more challenging given the absence of peat substrate groundwater quality however plotting the variation in peat and rainfall groundwater quality and on the same plot as runoff data allows estimation of substrate water quality by extrapolation of mixing model lines which enclose runoff chemistry this suggests that cuilcagh bedrock has an sec of 375µs cm while that of letterunshin is approximately 675 µs cm the extrapolated concentrations bear strong resemblance to the chemistries of groundwater sampled from analogous bedrock aquifers paul wilson gsni pers comm application of the emma model using individual ions yields comparable responses suggesting that dilution is the dominant processes accounting for the observed variation in runoff quality moreover combining the resulting water quality with physical hydrological data suggests that cuilcagh and letterunshin have catchment averaged recharge rates of 18 mm yr and 25 mm yr respectively despite contrasting nature of the underlying bedrock types and the persistently high water tables encountered at all locations the calculated recharge rates have proven remarkably uniform suggesting that the overburden materials peat and or underlying subsoil are the rate limiting element s in determining base flow contribution this is consistent with the comparable peat hydraulic conductivities observed in all test catchments and the lower values observed at the contact with the underling substrate at letterunshin and garron this points to significant bulk peat hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and preferential horizontal groundwater flow nonetheless further examination of substrate hydraulic conductivities is necessary to more confidently evaluate the influence of peat properties on base flow 6 conclusions the results of integrated hydrological studies completed at the three relatively intact blanket peat covered test catchments reveal broadly similar hydrological processes operate in all areas despite contrasting substrate conditions similarly groundwater monitoring reveals that comparable hydrogeological processes and water quality are encountered in the peat covering these areas paradoxically the significant differences in base flow water quality also reflect comparable contributions to runoff from deeper flow paths to stream flow the relatively constant water tables which give rise to consistent inputs of mineralised water have little influence on overall water quality during higher flow periods such as those occurring in response to rainfall this contrasts with prolonged dry spells particularly during the summer periods when peat storage may play more of a significant role in delivering groundwater discharging directly from peat flynn et al 2019 under these circumstances discharge of more mineralised substrate groundwater constitutes a more significant and in some cases dominant proportion of stream flow the makeup and rate of delivery of this deeper groundwater type has the capacity to significantly influence aquatic ecosystems particularly during low flow periods when organisms can be at their most stressed kelly quinn and reynolds 2020 the differences in water quality observed at low flow may help explain the wide variation in upland aquatic biodiversity encountered in streams draining blanket peat covered areas comparable to those in more varied geological settings elsewhere across ireland callanan et al 2012 despite comparable peat properties and groundwater quality this includes supporting slow growing species with calcium carbonate shells such as the freshwater pearl mussel margaritifera margaritifera moorkens 2020 which thrives in ostensibly acidic low ionic strength waters significantly under saturated with respect to both calcite and aragonite further work is necessary to assess the implications of these findings on upland aquatic ecosystems and how prolonged dry periods can influence their condition however recharge calculations from all three catchments studied suggest that the nature of the peat making up blanket bog plays a role in influencing the runoff regime in draining streams changes to peat condition due to anthropogenic processes which may damage remove peat coverage while also altering its hydrogeological properties coupled with possible longer dry spells can be anticipated to significantly influence runoff regimes conversely the findings of the study show for the first time how an integrated hydrogeological and water quality study may be used to better understand hydrological processes operating in relatively intact blanket peat covered catchments the resulting data provide a basis for the establishment of realistic targets for future measures aimed at restoring blanket bog ecosystems while also offering a rubric for characterising both other intact sites and areas that have been more significantly impacted by human activity credit authorship

4052,a two year hydrological characterisation programme of relatively intact blanket peat covered catchments underlain by geochemically distinct substrates investigated the influence of sub peat materials on the runoff regimes of the first order and second order streams draining them semi continuous monitoring of flow and water quality revealed a strong inverse relationship between stream flow rates and specific electrical conductance sec with runoff chemistries during storm flow proving comparable in all three catchments by contrast differences in water quality between catchments became more pronounced at lower flow where increased ion concentrations in stream water reflected reactions with peat substrate materials water table monitoring in peat at all three sites revealed groundwater levels to vary by less than 0 6 m over the investigation period findings suggest runoff consists of near constant inputs of higher specific electrical conductance peat substrate discharge mixing with variable proportions of less mineralised and more compositionally variable bog water although making up less than 5 to total runoff the contribution of more mineralised waters plays an important role in maintaining stream flow particularly during prolonged dry periods and may help explain the aquatic biodiversity encountered in blanket peat covered areas keywords blanket bog water quality base flow discharge 1 plain language summary blanket bogs are an unusual wetland type that occurs in areas that receive a lot of rainfall all year round although they are a rare habitat worldwide they form the commonest type of wetland in britain and ireland where they act as an important source of drinking water when they develop in mountainous areas although the water in blanket bogs has low levels of mineralisation and is acidic the streams draining blanket bogs display an unusual variety of organisms a detailed two year study of the flow and water quality in three of these streams showed them to contain highly mineralised water during prolonged dry periods that reflect water that has flowed underneath the bog before coming out in the stream the quality of this water depends on the type of minerals found underneath the peat this gives rise to variable dry weather water quality which helps explain the variety of organisms found in areas where the wetland water quality varies little 2 introduction although considered a globally rare habitat blanket bog locally covers extensive areas of europe the americas asia and oceania gallego sala colin 2013 the habitat proves unusual compared to other wetland types in that it consists of thick sequences 0 5 m of peat draping landscapes sometimes with slopes in excess of 20 degrees mitchell and ryan 1997 connolly and holden 2009 in britain and ireland blanket bog forms the dominant wetland type by coverage occurring in regions receiving high 1200 mm yr rodwell 1991 and frequent rainfall 160 rain days yr o connell 1990 this includes mountainous terrain where blanket peat has accumulated on substrates ranging from low permeability glacial clays to directly developing on top of limestone aquifers geological survey of ireland although more typically encountered across upland areas the habitat can extend down to at sea level where climatic conditions prove suitable traditionally areas containing blanket bog have often been viewed as having low economic value to be developed for other economic purposes that generate more tangible economic assets renou wilson et al 2018 however recent years have witnessed a growing appreciation of the ecosystem services provided by blanket bogs to water bonn et al 2016 this has proven to be particularly the case in north western europe where their capacity to provide large volumes of better quality water compared to more developed lower lying areas coupled with their close proximity to major population centres has meant that catchments containing blanket bog peat are favoured sources for drinking water supplies in britain and ireland these areas constitute the dominant source of potable water with this region consuming 85 of all drinking water derived from peatland worldwide xu et al 2018 for the uk this equates to 25 of all drinking water having an estimated annual value of 888 million in 2016 trenbirth and dutton 2019 although figures are more difficult to come by for ireland catchments containing blanket bogs make up a significant proportion of total drinking water sources this applies not only in less densely populated western parts of the country where coverage proves extensive fig 1 but also for the city of dublin where catchments containing blanket bog provide 154 megalitres day to a population of 1 26 million people xu et al 2018 blanket bogs also provide less tangible economic benefits in that they act as important refuges for biodiversity containing numerous specialised species cuckston 2017 however consideration of this aspect has focused largely on terrestrial habitats and the species they support bonn et al 2016 while bogs influence on the ecology of surface waters draining them has received less attention e g hannigan et al 2011 nonetheless this latter aspect has important legal implications for european union eu member states who are required to maintain the status of surface water bodies in accordance with water framework directive wfd legislation 2000 60 ec this requires member states to achieve a minimum of good water body status which is assessed through routine monitoring of biological and physicochemical parameters mcgarrigle 2020 moreover where degradation of status has occurred the wfd stipulates a requirement for member states to implement a programme of measures to restore ecosystem condition across ireland streams draining blanket peat covered areas constitute the majority of remaining wfd high status sites making them important refuges of aquatic biodiversity flynn et al 2021a however the hydrological processes operating in draining streams and the resulting water quality supporting aquatic ecosystems remain poorly defined recent published literature concerning blanket bog hydrology displays a strong bias toward degraded sites requiring restoration with many studies focusing on the fate and transport of dissolved organic carbon doc evans et al 2016 on the other hand published studies considering other substances remain rare particularly in relatively intact habitats despite their ecological importance e g vogt and muniz 1997 moreover investigations of these constituents in blanket bog runoff has rarely been accompanied by flow measurements despite the demonstrated value of combining physical hydrological data and water quality to better understand natural processes e g richards et al 1996 xiao et al 2019 fennessy et al 2004 an improved understanding of peatland hydrology underpins more effective management of blanket bogs and the ecosystem services associated with them this includes benefits that may arise through habitat restoration measures bonn et al 2016 current approaches to blanket bog restoration are hindered by the limited number of hydrological studies in less damaged near intact areas which constrain current capacity to understand natural background processes and thus establish realistic restoration targets moreover interactions between groundwater and streamflow have not been sufficiently characterised to allow pathways contributing to runoff to be quantified with confidence the research reported in this article aimed to characterise pathways contributing to stream discharge in catchments covered by blanket peat and relatively unaffected by human activity investigations employed physical hydrological and hydrogeological measurements in conjunction with water quality data to constrain flow paths and characterise their relative contributions to total flow particularly during direr periods when conditions may prove particularly stressful to aquatic ecosystems kelly quinn and reynolds 2020 furthermore relating water quality to geological conditions across three catchments with contrasting peat substrate geochemistries aimed to better quantify contributions from deeper subsurface flow paths and their potential influence on abiotic elements of stream aquatic ecology investigations were completed over a two year period in the headwaters of three irish blanket peat covered catchments which have experienced minimal disturbance from human activity findings have not only highlighted the need to incorporate hydrogeological measurements to better understand stream flow regimes but also the value of water quality and geochemistry to more confidently characterise the hydrological processes contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability 3 materials and methods 3 1 catchment descriptions a review of 1403 candidate irish headwater catchments across the island of ireland incorporating the republic of ireland and northern ireland covered by blanket bog peat failed to identify any catchments 1 km2 in area that did not exhibit visible evidence of human disturbance e g forestry artificial drainage flynn et al 2021b following the application of multiple criteria analysis a short list of the 341 sites displaying lower levels of impact three of the least disturbed catchments lying along the east west climatic gradient encountered across ireland met eireann 2021 were selected fig 1 table 1 summarises physical conditions at each site critically each area had contrasting peat substrate bedrock and inorganic overburden geochemistry overlain by relatively intact blanket peat displaying minimal impacts from human activity the contrast in peat substrate compositions including those of bedrock aimed to reflect the heterogeneous geological conditions encountered across ireland it is particularly notable that the calcareous lr carboniferous mississippian limestone aquifer underlying the letterunshin site forms part of the dominant aquifer type across ireland geological survey of ireland while predominantly siliceous namurian sandstones and shales underlying the cuilcagh site provide an indication of the influence of low productivity bedrock aquifers which underlie over 60 of the island of ireland moe et al 2010 the mafic basalt aquifer underlying the garron catchment falls between these two aquifer types and forms the dominant bedrock unit in the northeast of ireland robbins et al 2011 fig 2 summarises topographic conditions at each site reflecting the variation in elevation with the lowest point being occupied by the catchment outlet in each case 3 2 runoff monitoring hydraulic structures weirs flumes installed at the outlet of each catchment permitted generation of critical conditions necessary to confidently relate stream stage to discharge over the range of flow experienced during the monitoring period april 2018 april 2020 spot dilution gauging at each structure using saline tracer fully mixed by stream turbulence 5 m upstream of monitoring points permitted rating curve generation non vented level loggers solinst waterloo ont with a 1 m measurement range allowed for semi continuous stage monitoring and the generation of semi continuous plots of stream discharge measured at 20 min intervals 3 3 runoff water quality monitoring runoff monitoring also aimed to investigate variations in water quality under contrasting hydrological conditions and over the hydrological year sampling for laboratory analyses took place at approximately monthly intervals coupled with continuous monitoring of surrogate parameters to evaluate the representativeness of sample data hobo u24 001 temperature electrical conductivity data ec loggers onset corp ma placed at the outlet of each catchment permitted simultaneous semi continuous measurement of runoff electrical conductivity and temperature at 20 min intervals over the same period as flow monitoring spot measurements of specific electrical conductance using a calibrated ysi proplus hand held water quality meter yellow springs oh permitted conversion of hobo logger ec readings to generate a record of specific electrical conductance sec with flow associated water quality sampling for laboratory analyses involved evaluating variations in aqueous dissolve and total organic carbon along with silicon and major ions to better constrain hydrological processes sampling consisted of collecting each sample in two separate hdpe sample bottles with a 0 3 µm filtered sample acidified with 1 n nitric acid used for cation analysis samples were immediately chilled and stored in a dark space and analysed within one week of collection in the field a dionex aquion ion chromatography system permitted analysis of major cations na k ca mg tm152 0000 chloride and sulphate tm184 0000 where sample ph exceeded 6 5 alkalinity was determined by titration with 1 n hcl tm043 0000 doc and toc analysis were carried out in accordance with method tm090 tm090 0000 using a non dispersive infrared detector 3 4 groundwater monitoring adaptation of the distributed peatland hydrological model developed by mackin et al 2017 permitted identification of representative hydrological settings for monitoring groundwater levels in peat the approach assumes that bog hydrology is dominated by surface and near surface hydrological processes and uses topographic and climatic data to identify those areas which would be anticipated to experience contrasting hydrological processes e g zones of focused flow compared to zones of diffuse flow installation of piezometer nests at between five and eight locations across each catchment provided access to groundwater to allow water table monitoring and peat groundwater quality sampling to take place nests consisted of three 32mmid pvc water table piezometers with one metre screened intervals installed in the uppermost metre of peat and where depth permitted a deep piezometer made of the same materials but with a 50 cm long screen installed at the interface between the peat and underlying inorganic substrate infrastructural damage by livestock prevented water level monitoring in deeper peat at the cuilcagh site the tops of all piezometers were covered with vented caps to prevent ingress of rainfall and potential contamination of groundwater samples in addition to allowing access for water level monitoring piezometers permitted testing of peat hydraulic conductivity through slug testing using combined rising and falling head methods following the approach described by butler 1997 data analysis followed the approach for determining hydraulic conductivity of irish peats described by regan et al 2019 briefly this consisted of displacing groundwater levels by approximately 5 cm using a data logger as a slug for displacement and monitoring water level responses at 10 s intervals over the ensuing hour water level monitoring was carried out through a combination of manual measurements and semi continuous monitoring using solinst level loggers 5 m range solinst ont semi continuous monitoring of all water table piezometers over a two month period between the end of winter irish hydrological winter october through to end march and the start of summer irish hydrological summer april to end september revealed little variation between water levels at each cluster table 3 given these findings and due to limited resource availability a logger were then left in one piezometer in each cluster for the duration of the monitoring period groundwater sampling carried out on an approximately quarterly basis over the monitoring period consisted of purging piezometers of well water with a hand held suction pump this was immediately followed by sample collection for laboratory analysis using the same pump and storing samples following the approach described for runoff sampling following sample collection lowering a ysi water quality sonde into the screened interval of each piezometer was used to record groundwater temperature ph and sec 3 5 precipitation three rain gauges installed at each catchment over the first two to three months of the monitoring period permitted investigation of the effects of elevation on precipitation rates since the effects of orographic rainfall proved negligible a single gauge monitored rainfall in each catchment over the rest of the monitoring period gauges consisted of either davis vantage pro plus 2 tipping bucket rain gauges or onset automatic tipping rain gauges with hobo pendant event data loggers onset corp ma an additional manual rain gauge in each catchment permitted validation of precipitation rates while also facilitating the collection of samples to measure rain water quality this consisted of field based measures with a subset of rainwater samples submitted for laboratory analysis for the same parameters as groundwater and runoff 3 6 substrate analysis exposures of subsoils and rock where outcropping underlying blanket peat in all three catchments permitted substrate sampling a clean stainless steel trowel excavated the top five to ten centimetres of material in contact with the atmosphere before sample collection samples were stored in dedicated airtight plastic bags before being placed in a cool dark location soil samples underwent x ray fluorescence xrf and x ray diffraction xrd analysis to determine soil and rock composition xrd analysis employed a panalytical x pert pro mpd with x ray source cu kα1 radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma and a step size of 0 020 2 theta to identify minerals rietveld analysis permitted quantification of composition to 1 by volume ward et al 2001 ruan and ward 2002 xrf analysis was carried out using a panalytical axios advanced xrf spectrometer pw4400 the use of xrf for analysis of elemental content of soil and geological material has been well documented cave et al 2000 tani et al 2005 el taher 2012 and has a resolution of 0 01 by volume 4 results 4 1 substrate geochemistry table 2 summarises the results of substrate geochemical analyses for the three study catchments the data reveal relatively consistent compositions within catchments but that these contrast significantly between sites major elemental and mineralogical compositions of unconsolidated inorganic substrate samples from both cuilcagh and garron catchment reflect compositions typically anticipated from deposits derived from underlying bedrock by contrast conditions at letterunshin do not reflect the anticipated composition of deposits derived from the underlying limestone bedrock it is particularly noteworthy that xrf analyses failed to detect elevated calcium levels 1 cao this is consistent with outcrop observations which revealed diamictic deposits contain clasts up to boulder size of crystalline igneous and siliceous metamorphic material in a carbonate free matrix determined through testing with 1 n hcl 4 2 precipitation data a review of air temperature and precipitation records revealed that 98 percent of precipitation recorded over the monitoring period fell as rainfall with snow encountered predominantly in january and february of both years this is consistent with findings from nearby official weather stations which also revealed conditions encountered over the monitoring period to be broadly representative of the longer term climatic 30 year average measured at each station however the findings belie monthly data particularly for the period from mid march 2020 to mid june 2020 when conditions proved anomalously dry comparison of site specific rainfall patterns across each site failed to reveal significant differences in rainfall between gauges set at different elevations despite the relief present in all three catchments fig 2 similarly manual rainfall data agreed with the findings of automated measurements to within 3 water quality data suggested typical rainfall chemistries for those samples examined namely low ionic content dominated by na and cl along with low sec and acidic ph one the other hand dissolved organic carbon content proved negligible in all precipitation samples 4 3 groundwater monitoring table 3 summarises water table fluctuations for all three sites throughout the monitoring period water table levels in peat remained within 60 cm of the ground surface despite the high levels of relief encountered in other words groundwater heads closely reflected topography moreover in those catchments containing piezometers screened at the base of the peat the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient acted consistently downwards groundwater level monitoring for all catchments revealed significant sensitivity to rainfall with broadly consistent scalar responses fig 3 as observed in peatlands elsewhere cobb and harvey 2019 this includes responses following prolonged dry periods despite an apparent moisture deficit the results of piezometer testing in peat at all three sites reveals hydraulic conductivities in the uppermost 1 m of peat to range between 3 m day and 0 005 m day with geometric means of approximately 0 2 m day across all sites values for deeper peat occurring at the substrate interface at garron and letterunshin were estimated to be 4x 10 5 m day campbell 2017 sampling and analysis revealed that the quality of groundwater flowing through the peat in all three catchments varied little and had characteristics that compared favourably with published data for british blanket bogs lindsay 1995 sample analyses revealed they had high levels of colour but low sec and acidic ph similarly major ion analyses revealed water both at the water table and at depth to be dominated by low concentrations of sodium and chloride fig 4 presents the range of sec and doc observed in samples collected from all three sites 4 4 runoff flow regime table 4 summarises the flow characteristics of the streams draining each catchment high q90 to q10 ratios reflect flashy rainfall runoff responses this is further manifested by rapid rising limbs in stream hydrographs along with slightly less rapid recession yet leading to flow rates that can be an order of magnitude lower less than one day following peak discharge conventional assumptions of log linear recession would suggest that all the water courses investigated would dry up shortly after peak flow should no additional precipitation occur nonetheless streams continued to discharge water albeit at significantly lower rates during prolonged dry periods deviating from anticipated text book responses e g fetter 2003 integration of flow data has permitted determination of total volumes of water lost and the overall contribution of runoff to catchment flow balances subdividing hydrographs into summer and winter periods revealed that runoff dominates losses during the winter period whereas it accounts for between 20 and 78 of total precipitation received during the summer period groundwater levels in peat at the start and end of these periods were close to at the ground surface suggesting negligible net change in storage 4 5 runoff hydrochemistry gradual changes in runoff chemistry accompany stream hydrograph recession in all three study catchments with water becoming progressively more mineralised with declining flow critically sec levels and the concentrations of cations observed in base flow can exceed than those in observed in peat groundwater samples while doc colour levels in runoff generally fall at or slightly below the concentration range observed in peat pore water plotting sec with flow suggests a log linear relationship at lower flows which breaks down at higher discharges fig 5 relationships observed at cuilcagh have been complicated by localised subsidence at the gauging point with earlier data broadly corresponding to the trend observed in the other two catchments investigating relationships between sec and major ion content reveals significant correlations for calcium and magnesium at garron and letterrunshin a comparable association exists with sodium at cuilcagh the relationship with dissolved organic carbon content proves more difficult to define at all locations nonetheless the resulting plot of sec with doc defines the range of possible doc contents in runoff samples with the variability in concentration increasing with lower sec by contrast variability in doc concentration proves greater with high flow in all three catchments compiling major ion and sec data on an expanded durov plot fig 6 allows the evolution of water quality with flow to be better characterised and indicates contrasting inorganic ion content between catchments during low flow conditions as flow rates increase in response to rainfall sec declines reflecting a reduction in ionic strength and a change in the relative proportions of major ions with water from all catchments converging toward comparable low ionic strength sodium chloride waters in contrast doc concentrations tend to increase with flow although this is significantly more variable than conditions observed with major ions 5 discussion the results of the investigations carried out reveal that despite the persistence of relatively stable water tables and peat groundwater quality across test catchments both flow and water quality in receiving streams prove considerably more variable the observed flashy flow regimes arise in part from high groundwater levels in peat these limit available storage and its buffering capacity in response to precipitation events throughout much of the year this in conjunction with steep relief acts as the dominant driver for the flashy flow regimes observed the gradual increase in runoff mineralisation which accompanies recession following storm events reflects systematic changes in ionic content that are intimately linked to flow moreover water quality in each catchment becomes progressively more distinctive as flow rates decline comparison of cation levels notably with chloride which is frequently assumed to be a conservative tracer reflecting physical hydrological processes younger 2009 reveal relative concentrations of ca na and mg in base flow that are considerably higher than detected in peat groundwater the findings imply that these substances must be derived from reactions occurring along deeper the flow paths following infiltration through peat head data observed at both garron and letterunshin provide further evidence for this point and show that hydraulic gradients at peat peizometer nests have a consistent downward component with a portion of the groundwater in the peat percolating through its base into substrate materials acidic low ionic strength peat pore water is thus able to react with substrate materials to change its chemical signature the importance of this process is reflected by the comparable chemistry of peat groundwaters across all catchments compared to variable runoff quality observed at lower flows which depend on the composition of the substrate materials more generally this is reflected by the sec of base flow while the differences in ionic signature can be accounted for through the contrasting nature of substrate materials moreover elevated calcium concentrations detected in base flow samples from letterunshin suggest that flow paths contributing mineralised water to runoff are not restricted to the upper layers of the substrate given the low calcium concentrations and mineralogy detected the inorganic subsoil samples collected from across the catchment on the other hand concentrations observed during low flow conditions can be explained by groundwater discharging from the underlying limestone bedrock reflecting a significant contribution of water flowing along deeper flow paths to stream flow combining physical and hydrochemical data provides a means of quantifying runoff contributions from different flow paths notably using end member mixing analyses emma hooper et al 1990 in its simplest form the emma model assumes that the observed stream water chemistry cstream arises from variable contributions from two or more sources of water contributing to the total flow in the stream q streaml with sufficiently different water quality signatures additional hydrological flow paths may be defined to give total flow as follows 1 q stream q 1 q 2 q n combining concentration data thus allows further equations to be generated of the form 2 c stream q stream c 1 q 1 c 2 q 2 c n q n the equation proves valid provided mixing does not generate reactions resulting in processes other than dilution with n 1 distinctive end member signatures the contributions to runoff from diverse hydrological flow paths may be defined by combining forms of eq 2 for various parameters with eq 1 and solving for a simple two end member mixing calculation combining eq 1 and eq 2 with peat groundwater with concentration cpeat and substrate groundwater with concentration csubstrate yields the following 3 q substrate q runoff c runoff c peat c substrate c peat using eq 1 and eq 3 thus allows calculation of the proportions of each end member contributing to flow for greater numbers of end members calculations may be comparably determined using matrix methods critically emma assumes that the water types included in the equations have fixed chemistries however the compositional variability of peat groundwater in space and time calls this assumption into question fig 7 summarises the variability in peat groundwater quality at garron while sec and doc concentration observed in runoff proves comparably variable nonetheless application of the emma mixing model using the results of groundwater analyses of samples from the basalt aquifer in a comparable physical setting and peat groundwater reveals that almost all runoff samples apart from those encountered at very low sec fall within the limits defined by the model those falling outside the range occur were sampled at high flow fig 5 when peat groundwater contributions have been diluted with water resembling precipitation based on the emma model data collected from garron suggest that during prolonged dry periods when flows reduce to approximately 1 6 l sec roughly 75 of stream flow consists of water discharging from the substrate materials underlying the peat moreover application of this model implies that the low doc concentrations observed in runoff following prolonged dry spells approximately 8 mg l derive from peat groundwaters with concentrations at the upper end of the range detected in peat groundwater samples given the relatively invariant concentrations observed in basalt groundwater samples the mixing model may be further employed to better understand temporal variations in runoff quality while confidence in the model may be improved by incorporating physical hydrogeological data more specifically given the limited variation in groundwater head in the peat relative to the variation in total groundwater head across the catchment implies that the hydraulic gradient operating between groundwater and stream can be approximated as constant consequently the changes in sec and doc observed during higher flows may be attributed to end member mixing coupled with compositionally variable contributions of lower sec lower doc peat water as reflected in fig 7 furthermore considering the input of more mineralised water to occur at an approximately constant rate suggests that catchment wide recharge rates to the peat substrate to be approximately 16 mm yr following a comparable approach to that adopted at garron in the other two catchments proved more challenging given the absence of peat substrate groundwater quality however plotting the variation in peat and rainfall groundwater quality and on the same plot as runoff data allows estimation of substrate water quality by extrapolation of mixing model lines which enclose runoff chemistry this suggests that cuilcagh bedrock has an sec of 375µs cm while that of letterunshin is approximately 675 µs cm the extrapolated concentrations bear strong resemblance to the chemistries of groundwater sampled from analogous bedrock aquifers paul wilson gsni pers comm application of the emma model using individual ions yields comparable responses suggesting that dilution is the dominant processes accounting for the observed variation in runoff quality moreover combining the resulting water quality with physical hydrological data suggests that cuilcagh and letterunshin have catchment averaged recharge rates of 18 mm yr and 25 mm yr respectively despite contrasting nature of the underlying bedrock types and the persistently high water tables encountered at all locations the calculated recharge rates have proven remarkably uniform suggesting that the overburden materials peat and or underlying subsoil are the rate limiting element s in determining base flow contribution this is consistent with the comparable peat hydraulic conductivities observed in all test catchments and the lower values observed at the contact with the underling substrate at letterunshin and garron this points to significant bulk peat hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and preferential horizontal groundwater flow nonetheless further examination of substrate hydraulic conductivities is necessary to more confidently evaluate the influence of peat properties on base flow 6 conclusions the results of integrated hydrological studies completed at the three relatively intact blanket peat covered test catchments reveal broadly similar hydrological processes operate in all areas despite contrasting substrate conditions similarly groundwater monitoring reveals that comparable hydrogeological processes and water quality are encountered in the peat covering these areas paradoxically the significant differences in base flow water quality also reflect comparable contributions to runoff from deeper flow paths to stream flow the relatively constant water tables which give rise to consistent inputs of mineralised water have little influence on overall water quality during higher flow periods such as those occurring in response to rainfall this contrasts with prolonged dry spells particularly during the summer periods when peat storage may play more of a significant role in delivering groundwater discharging directly from peat flynn et al 2019 under these circumstances discharge of more mineralised substrate groundwater constitutes a more significant and in some cases dominant proportion of stream flow the makeup and rate of delivery of this deeper groundwater type has the capacity to significantly influence aquatic ecosystems particularly during low flow periods when organisms can be at their most stressed kelly quinn and reynolds 2020 the differences in water quality observed at low flow may help explain the wide variation in upland aquatic biodiversity encountered in streams draining blanket peat covered areas comparable to those in more varied geological settings elsewhere across ireland callanan et al 2012 despite comparable peat properties and groundwater quality this includes supporting slow growing species with calcium carbonate shells such as the freshwater pearl mussel margaritifera margaritifera moorkens 2020 which thrives in ostensibly acidic low ionic strength waters significantly under saturated with respect to both calcite and aragonite further work is necessary to assess the implications of these findings on upland aquatic ecosystems and how prolonged dry periods can influence their condition however recharge calculations from all three catchments studied suggest that the nature of the peat making up blanket bog plays a role in influencing the runoff regime in draining streams changes to peat condition due to anthropogenic processes which may damage remove peat coverage while also altering its hydrogeological properties coupled with possible longer dry spells can be anticipated to significantly influence runoff regimes conversely the findings of the study show for the first time how an integrated hydrogeological and water quality study may be used to better understand hydrological processes operating in relatively intact blanket peat covered catchments the resulting data provide a basis for the establishment of realistic targets for future measures aimed at restoring blanket bog ecosystems while also offering a rubric for characterising both other intact sites and areas that have been more significantly impacted by human activity credit authorship

4053,soil erosion is one of the major threats to the environment and agriculture in the world and rainfall erosivity is the most active factor to lead changes in soil erosion here we use statistically downscaled bias corrected community earth system model cesm low warming simulations to investigate the future changes in rainfall erosivity in mainland china under the paris agreement global warming targets the downscaled simulations evidently outperform the original cesm simulations in capturing the spatial distribution magnitudes and annual cycle of rainfall erosivity in china in the present day 1986 2005 the rainfall erosivity will be significantly increased in most regions of china under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets and the regional mean increases are approximately 33 and 40 respectively in addition the corresponding increases are even larger than 60 and 75 respectively in a quarter of mainland china the increase in rainfall erosivity is resulted from the joint contributions of increases in frequency and intensity of erosive rainfall however it is dominated by the increase in the frequency compared with annual rainfall amount the future warming will bring a four times greater impact on the soil erosion potentially caused by rainfall limiting global warming to 1 5 c instead of 2 c would reduce 17 of the increase in rainfall erosivity in china for grain producing areas like sichuan basin the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river and south china the values are approximately 20 the future warming will significantly increase the potential risk of

runoff and rainfall pimentel et al 1995 lal 2004 pimentel 2006 wang et al 2015 soil erosion is a global problem and countries in different continents are more or less affected by it bridges and oldeman 1999 li and fang 2016 during the second half of the 20th century nearly one third of the arable land worldwide was lost caused by erosion and the per capita food productivity has begun to decline pimentel et al 1995 previous studies suggest that the soil erosion rate higher than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 could lead to irreversible effects to soil over 50 to 100 years jones et al 2004 verheijen et al 2009 china severely suffers from soil erosion the xinjiang and inner mongolia are mainly affected by wind erosion the tibetan plateau is mainly affected freeze thaw erosion and the other regions are mainly affected by water erosion liao 1999 wang et al 2016 the average potential erosion rate in china is 1 44 t ha 1 yr 1 and value in some parts of southwestern china is even larger than 10 t ha 1 yr 1 teng et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the future changes of soil erosion in china many models are applied to quantify the effects of different factors on soil erosion such as the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeiner and smith 1978 the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 and the revised universal soil loss equation version 2 rusle2 usda agricultural research service 2013 these models have been widely applied to investigate soil erosion in different regions worldwide the soil erodibility topography land management soil conservation practice and rainfall erosivity are considered as the main factors of water erosion in these models swcs 2003 rainfall erosivity is a good index to characterize the ability of rainfall in

lead to changes in soil erosion and the change rate of the latter can be several times of the former a 4 to 18 increase in precipitation can cause a 31 to 167 increase in soil loss zhang 2007 in addition increases in the precipitation variability can also lead to the increase in soil erosion zhang and nearing 2005 therefore it is of great importance to investigate the changes in precipitation and rainfall erosivity under the future warming since the industrial revolution the global averaged temperature has been significantly increased due to the increasing content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and will continue to increase ipcc 2013 in recent decades global warming has had a great impact on climate system ecological environment and human production and life global warming increases the water vapor content in the atmosphere which can lead to the increases in mean and extreme precipitation allan and soden 2008 trenberth et al 2003 held and soden 2006 o gorman and schneider 2009 min et al 2011 zhang and zhou 2019 the global mean precipitation has been increased in the past century but the changing pattern of precipitation shows obvious spatial diversity in different regions wentz et al 2007 ipcc 2013 changes in rainfall erosivity also show spatiotemporal differences annual and seasonal rainfall erosivity generally decreased in elbro valley of spain during 1966 2006 angulo martínez and beguería 2012 switzerland evidenced a significant increase decrease in rainfall erosivity in may to october february during 1989 2010 meusburger et al 2012 rainfall erosivity in mainland china and its water erosion regions experienced an insignificant increase in the past several decades liu et al 2013 qin et al 2016 the future warming will lead to increases in both mean and extreme precipitation in most global land regions and the response of extreme precipitation in the east asian monsoon region to the future warming is among the greatest across all global monsoon regions kitoh et al 2013 ipcc 2013 chen et al 2020a zhang and zhou 2020 rainfall erosivity will increase across central part of india in 2080 s relative to 1961 2001 mondal et al 2016 the central asia will evidence an increase in rainfall erosivity by 26 6 in the 2070 s under the rcp8 5 scenario relative to 1950 2000 duulatov et al 2019 in order to mitigate the negative impacts of the future climate change the paris agreement has set a goal of holding global warming to well below 2 c and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels unfccc 2015 many efforts have been devoted to investigate the climate changes under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming and the avoided climate change impacts owing to the 0 5 c less warming e g schleussner et al 2016 donnelly et al 2017 dosio and fischer 2017 king et al 2017 li et al 2018a nangombe et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhao and zhou 2019 chen et al 2020b however barely any study has focused on the responses of rainfall erosivity to the warming targets especially in china under the stabilized 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets while global climate models gcms are useful tools to project the future change of precipitation and rainfall erosivity they generally show biases in regional scales due to their relatively low horizontal resolution to fill in the gap between the low resolution gcm simulations and the desire for finer spatial resolution as well as correction for biases contained in the gcms various statistical downscaling methods have been developed wilby wigley 1997 giorgi 2006 etc the statistical downscaling methods use the outputs of the gcms as predictors for local variables and have been widely used in impact assessments maurer hidalgo 2008 iizumi et al 2011 dosio et al 2012 gutmann et al 2014 li et al 2018b yang et al 2018 in this study we have developed a set of statistically downscaled bias corrected high resolution projection data based on the community earth system model cesm ensemble simulations and investigated the changes in rainfall erosivity in china under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels we have also quantitatively estimated the avoided impacts of the 0 5 c less warming in particular we aim to answer the following questions 1 whether the downscaled simulations can be used to investigate the rainfall erosivity in china 2 how will rainfall erosivity change in different regions of china under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming targets 3 to what extent the changes in rainfall erosivity in china can be avoided if the global warming is limited to 1 5 c rather than 2 c the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and methods used the main results are shown in section 3 and section 4 provides the conclusions of this paper 2 data and methods 2 1 cesm low warming simulation the cesm low warming simulations released by the national center for atmospheric research ncar are applied in this study to investigate the rainfall erosivity over mainland china kay et al 2015 sanderson et al 2017 this set of model simulations are specifically designed to investigate the climate changes and climate impacts under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming relative to the pre industrial levels a set of greenhouse gas emission pathways to obtain long term global warming that do not exceed 1 5 c 1 5 c ne and 2 c 2 c ne above pre industrial levels was first produced by a simple minimal complexity earth simulator mices model after that this set of emission pathways were applied to eleven ensemble members of cesm for the simulation period from 2006 to 2100 except for greenhouse gas emission pathways all the other anthropogenic forcings including land use aerosol emission and ozone follow the rcp8 5 scenario throughout the 21st century in the two emission scenarios in the 1 5 c ne 2 c ne scenario the global mean temperature reaches 1 5 c 2 c above the pre industrial levels in 2040 2090 and stabilizes at this temperature until 2100 the horizontal resolution of the cesm simulation is 1 1 for more detailed information of the cesm low warming simulations please refer to sanderson et al 2017 2 2 the statistical downscaling method the statistical downscaling model applied in this study is a regression model dettinger et al 2004 separate time periods are selected to calibrate and validate the model in this study the calibration period is from 1966 to 1985 and the validation period is from 1986 to 2005 the daily precipitation from the cesm simulations is downscaled the detailed downscaling procedure is as follows firstly for each grid in the observation dataset the values in the nearest grid in the cesm simulations are set to this certain grid that means the horizontal resolution of output of the statistical downscaling model is the same as the observation dataset then the daily precipitation in both the observation dataset and the cesm simulations is sort at each grid for each month of the multiyear during the calibration period in order to ensure the same numbers of wet events days with precipitation in the cesm simulations and the observation a threshold is set in the cesm simulations if there are more wet events in the simulations after that the regression relationship between the wet events in the observation and the simulation are fit by high order polynomials this statistical downscaling model has been applied to investigate the climate change in china in previous studies dai et al 2014 li et al 2018b the credibility of the model is also investigated following salvi et al 2016 the statistical downscaling model is firstly cross validated by using 1986 2005 as the calibration period and 1966 1985 as the validation period then the capability of the statistical downscaling model in capturing the changes in mean precipitation caused by ghg emissions is checked we use the 2 c warmer climate as high ghg emissions period and the pre industrial control run as no anthropogenic ghg emissions period and the results show that the statistical downscaling model is credible in a changing climate please refer to salvi et al 2016 for more detailed information of the credibility checking approach 2 3 observation data daily precipitation from the cn05 1 dataset xu et al 2009 wu et al 2013 with a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 is used to calibrate the statistical downscaling model and to validate the model results the time period is from 1966 to 2005 the cn05 1 dataset is interpolated from over 2400 observing stations in china and is quality controlled by the china meteorological administration cma 2 4 the bias correction method considering that absolute threshold is used to define erosive precipitation a simple bias correction method called multiple local scaling ls factor casanueva et al 2016 is applied to further correct the systematic deviation of downscaled precipitation for each season at each grid 1 rr ls rr ds rm obs rm ds where rr ds is the daily downscaled precipitation respectively rm obs and rm ds are the seasonal mean observed and downscaled precipitation respectively rm obs rm ds is the scaling factor and applied in both the present day simulation and future projections 2 5 rainfall erosivity factor r factor due to the lack of high time resolution precipitation data daily precipitation is widely used to calculate the r factor e g hoyos et al 2005 angulo martínez et al 2009 angulo martínez and beguería 2012 zhu and yu 2015 the method proposed by zhang et al 2002 is applied in this study this method has been widely used to calculate r factor in different regions of china men et al 2008 huang et al 2013 ma et al 2014 yang and lu 2015 qin et al 2016 the calculation formula is as follows 2 r i α j 1 k d j β where r i is the rainfall erosivity in the i t h half month of the year and its unit is m j m m ha 1 h 1 d j is the effective rainfall for day j in this certain half month that means d j is set to the actual rainfall if the rainfall in a day is larger than 12 mm the threshold of erosive precipitation in this study otherwise d j is set to zero k is the number of days in this half month α and β are parameters calculated based on continuous rainfall data series with a high time resolution and the empirical formulas are as follows 3 β 0 8363 18 144 p d 12 1 24 455 p y 12 1 4 α 21 586 β 7 1891 p d 12 and p y 12 represent the average daily and annual rainfall for erosive precipitation days respectively this daily rainfall erosivity model can well estimate the climatology of rainfall erosivity and its seasonal distribution especially in the regions with abundant precipitation however the model may underestimate the erosion caused by extreme storm zhang et al 2002 2 6 time periods and sub regions the period from 1986 to 2005 is referred as the present day and the period from 2081 to 2100 in the two low warming scenarios represent the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels above the pre industrial levels the study region is classified into nine sub regions according to the agricultural regions in mainland china fig 1 northeast china plain nep northern arid and semiarid region nas qinghai tibet plateau qtp loess plateau lp huang huai hai plain hhhp middle lower yangtze plain mlyp southern china sc yunnan guizhou plateau ygp and sichuan basin and surrounding regions sbs 2 7 definition of indices and avoided impact three indices are used in this study the erosive precipitation day defined in this study is a day when the daily precipitation is larger than 12 mm freq12 and int12 are the annual frequency and annual mean intensity of erosive precipitation besides re represents rainfall erosivity in the following parts the impact of rainfall erosivity that avoided at 1 5 c compared with the 2 c warming level is calculated using the formula below li et al 2018a 5 a i c 2 0 c 1 5 c 2 0 100 where ai is the avoided impact c 1 5 and c 2 0 represent the changes of rainfall erosivity at the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels relative to the present day 3 results 3 1 validation of the model simulations in the present day we first evaluate the model performance in the present day the annual rainfall erosivity decreases from the southeast to the northwest of china in the observation like that of the annual precipitation ranging from higher than 10 000 m j m m ha 1 h 1 a 1 to lower than 50 m j m m ha 1 h 1 a 1 fig 2 a for the regional mean of the sub regions it is highest in sc and lowest in nas figs 1 and 2a the freq12 also decreases from the southeast to the northwest of china from larger than 40 days per year to smaller than 2 days per year fig 2b generally the int12 also shows similar spatial distribution with the re fig 1c however the central value is located between the yangtze river and the yellow river in eastern china hence the spatial distribution of re over mainland china is the combined results of frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation the original cesm low warming simulations hereafter the cesm can roughly capture the spatial distribution and magnitudes of re in mainland china but overestimate re in most parts of western china and underestimate it in most parts of eastern china fig 2d therefore the gradient of re from southeast to northwest china is smaller in the cesm than in the observation this bias is reflected in both the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation especially the frequency fig 2e and f the statistical downscaling simulations hereafter the sd show evident improvement compared with the cesm in capturing the climatology characteristics of re in mainland china fig 2g both the spatial distribution and the magnitude are more close to the observation similar improvement is evident in the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation in the sd fig 2h and i we further quantitatively measure the model skill fig 3 taylor diagram is used to evaluate the performance of the sd and the cesm in terms of pattern correlations the root mean square differences and the ratios of spatial variations in the simulated and observed values of the re freq12 and int12 the observation is used as the reference in the cesm the pattern correlation of re is around 0 2 and the ratio of spatial standard deviation is more than 2 0 fig 3a the regional averaged biases of re in most sub regions are larger than 30 and even 60 fig 3b the biases of re in the cesm are mainly caused by the biases in the freq12 the pattern correlation is around 0 2 and the regional averaged biases are larger than 60 in most sub regions differently the biases of int12 are relatively small the pattern correlation is around 0 6 and the ratio of spatial standard deviations is approximately 0 75 fig 3a in addition the regional averaged biases are within 15 in most sub regions fig 3b the sd outperforms the cesm for all the three indices with pattern correlations larger than 0 9 and the ratios of spatial standard deviations close to 1 0 especially for freq12 fig 3a the regional averaged biases are also smaller in the sd with values within 15 for the three indices in most sub regions fig 3b the regional mean re over mainland china shows obvious annual cycle in the present day with peak values of about 360 m j m m ha 1 h 1 occurring in july fig 4 the annual cycle of re in mainland china can be roughly reproduced in the cesm but is overestimated throughout the year besides the peak values of re occurs in june compared with the cesm the sd exhibits obvious improvements in reproducing the annual cycle of regional mean re in mainland china with the overestimation evidently reduced and the peak value occurring in july fig 4 there are certain differences in the annual cycle of re in different sub regions but the peak values all occur in summer fig 5 consistent with the results shown above figs 2 and 3 the cesm underestimates the re in southern china and overestimates the re in northern china fig 5 in addition these biases exist throughout the year the sd performs well in most sub regions and only overestimates the re in mlyp and hhhp in summer in general compared with the original cesm simulations the sd performs better in reproducing the characteristics of rainfall erosivity and its important determinants the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation in the present day in mainland china however there are still some biases in the sd the reason is that the statistical downscaling method applied in this study can help to obtain more detailed spatial distribution of precipitation and reduce the biases of climatic state of precipitation in the global model after statistical downscaling the biases of precipitation with different intensity will be reduced but not fully eliminated in the following analysis the sd is applied to investigate the changes in rainfall erosivity and erosive precipitation in mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels 3 2 future projections of rainfall erosivity we first examine the changes in annual rainfall erosivity the changing patterns of re in the two warmer climates are similar compared with the present day the annual rainfall erosivity will increase significantly in most areas of mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels with the large values occurring in central china and the southern edge of the tibetan plateau fig 6 a and b compared with the 1 5 c warmer climate the extra 0 5 c warming in the 2 c warmer climate will significantly lead to larger re in most parts of china except some parts of north china fig 6c the most obvious increases larger than 16 lie in the sichuan basin and parts of southeast china two of the important grain producing areas in china the cumulative density function cdf is applied to quantitatively analyze the changes of re in china individual grid cells are weighted by their area the cdfs can apparently exhibit both the median change of re in china and the changes in small fractions compared with the present day about half landmass of mainland china will experience a re increase of 30 and 40 in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates respectively the corresponding increases will be even larger than 60 and 75 respectively in a quarter of mainland china fig 6d regional mean changes in re in mainland china are approximately 33 and 40 under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming respectively about four times larger than the corresponding increase in precipitation 5 5 and 7 3 under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming respectively li et al 2019 qtp and sbs will experience larger re increase than other sub regions fig 6d compared with the original cesm projection the increasing magnitudes of rainfall erosivity in the sd are larger in all the nine subregions in the two warmer climates and the differences between these two sets of simulations are largest in the tibetan plateau table 1 the possible reason for these differences is that the sd can better capture the spatial distributions and magnitudes of frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation seasonal features of changes in re over china are further investigated fig 7 we first examine the absolute changes of re in the two warmer climates the re will increase throughout the year with peak values occurring in summer months fig 7a the increases in re caused by extra 0 5 c warming in the 2 c warmer climate mainly appear in june to september fig 7a distinctly the magnitudes of relative changes in re among different months are comparable around 30 and 40 in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates respectively fig 7b therefore the future warming basically will not change the seasonal distributions of re in mainland china in terms of regional mean but lead to an overall re increase throughout the year freq12 will increase in most parts of mainland china in the warming future fig 8 a and b the changing patterns of freq12 in the two warmer climates are similar with those of re figs 6 and 8 int12 will also increase under the future warming but the magnitudes are obviously smaller than those of increase in freq12 fig 8d and e therefore increases in the frequency of erosive precipitation contribute more to the increases in re in the warming future than the intensity of erosive precipitation it is worth noting that the increasing magnitudes of re are evidently larger than both freq12 and int12 we use formula 5 to quantify the impacts of increased re avoided if the global warming is controlled well below 1 5 c rather than 2 c fig 9 in the sd compared with the 2 c warmer climate the half degree less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to reduce 17 of the increase in re over mainland china except nep and hhhp the increases of re will be avoided in most sub regions of mainland from 10 in lp to 28 in qtp for major grain producing areas like sbs mlyp and sc the avoided increase in re are approximately 20 the results in the original cesm are comparable with or a little larger than those in the sd in most subregions the half degree less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to reduce 23 of the increase in re over mainland china 4 conclusion and summary the cesm low warming simulations released by ncar are specifically designed to investigate climate change and climate impacts of 1 5 c and 2 c global warming above the pre industrial levels in this study statistically downscaled and bias corrected cesm low warming ensemble simulations are developed and applied to investigate the changes in rainfall erosivity and erosive precipitation in mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 compared with the original cesm low warming simulations the downscaled simulations show much better performance in reproducing the spatial distributions and annual cycle of re in mainland china the pattern correlations of re freq12 and int12 are larger than 0 9 and the regional mean biases of the three indices are within 15 in most sub regions 2 the re will evidence a robust increase in mainland china with larger increasing magnitudes under 2 c compared with 1 5 c warming target in most sub regions the increasing magnitudes are larger than 60 and 75 in a quarter of mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels respectively the absolute increases of regional mean re over china show obvious seasonality with peak values occurring in summer however the relative increases of re among different months are comparable around 30 and 40 in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates respectively the increasing magnitudes of rainfall erosivity in the original cesm are a little smaller than those in the sd 3 the increase in re is resulted from the joint contributions of increases in freq12 and int12 the spatial distribution of increases in re is dominated by that of the increase in freq12 differently the increases in the intensity of erosive precipitation are relatively uniform in mainland china in the two stabilized warming conditions in addition the changing magnitudes of re are much larger than those of annual precipitation or the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation the increasing magnitudes of regional mean re in mainland china are about four times larger than the corresponding increase in annual precipitation in the two warmer climates therefore compared with annual rainfall amount the future warming will bring a greater impact on the soil erosion potential caused by rainfall 4 compared with the 2 c warmer climate the 0 5 c less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to avoid 17 of the increase in rainfall erosivity in mainland china with greatest reduction of 28 occurring in qtp for grain producing areas like sbs mlyp and sc the values are approximately 20 the correspond values in the original cesm are comparable with or a little larger than those in the sd in most subregions the half degree less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to reduce 23 of the increase in re over mainland china our analysis suggests that the future warming will significantly increase the potential risk of soil erosion in mainland china and controlling the global warming to 1 5 c above the pre industrial levels rather than 2 c is beneficial to reduce this risk rainfall erosivity is directly associated with the intensity frequency and amount of precipitation different models and methods have been applied to investigate the changes of these different characteristics of precipitation over east asia under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming conditions including the regional climate models li et al 2018c the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models zhou et al 2019 and the stand alone agcm simulations of the happi half a degree additional warming prognosis and projected impacts project lee et al 2018 the results are qualitatively consistent but quantitatively different among these models and methods li et al 2019 the results of this study are only derived from one set of coupled low warming simulations and this may lead to uncertainties in the projection of rainfall erosivity further investigation should be done in the future work due to the model dependence of the results presented here moreover climate projections are scenario dependent a new set of future scenarios namely the combined scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps are designed and applied to the cmip6 models o neill et al 2016 the changes of rainfall erosivity under these new scenarios should be also investigated changes of rainfall erosivity is a good indicator of the changes of soil erosion potential in the warming future it is worth noting that in addition to the changes of rainfall changes of land use land cover lulc also have large impacts on the changes of soil erosion for example the conversion of naturally vegetated areas for agricultural uses may intensify soil erosion tarolli and sofia 2016 yang and lu 2018 and grain for green can effectively decrease the soil erosion deng et al 2012 there are large uncertainties in the future greenhouse gas emissions and land uses statistically explore their relative contributions to the changes of soil erosion is of great importance to the adaptation and mitigation policies borrelli et al 2020 saha and ghosh 2020 borrelli et al 2020 uses three alternative 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 shared socioeconomic pathway and representative concentration pathway ssp rcp scenarios to investigates the impacts of land use and climate change on the global erosion by water they indicate that the future changes of soil erosion are dominated by climate change and the contributions of socioeconomic developments impacting land use to changes in water erosion are relatively small similarly changes of surface hydrology of the ganga river basin are also dominated by the climate change mitigation pathways saha and ghosh 2020 the relative contributions of changes in rainfall and land use to the changes of soil erosion in china in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates are still not clear and should be further investigated in the future work author contributions youcun qi and donghuan li managed the research donghuan li and tianjun zhou collected and prepared the

4053,soil erosion is one of the major threats to the environment and agriculture in the world and rainfall erosivity is the most active factor to lead changes in soil erosion here we use statistically downscaled bias corrected community earth system model cesm low warming simulations to investigate the future changes in rainfall erosivity in mainland china under the paris agreement global warming targets the downscaled simulations evidently outperform the original cesm simulations in capturing the spatial distribution magnitudes and annual cycle of rainfall erosivity in china in the present day 1986 2005 the rainfall erosivity will be significantly increased in most regions of china under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets and the regional mean increases are approximately 33 and 40 respectively in addition the corresponding increases are even larger than 60 and 75 respectively in a quarter of mainland china the increase in rainfall erosivity is resulted from the joint contributions of increases in frequency and intensity of erosive rainfall however it is dominated by the increase in the frequency compared with annual rainfall amount the future warming will bring a four times greater impact on the soil erosion potentially caused by rainfall limiting global warming to 1 5 c instead of 2 c would reduce 17 of the increase in rainfall erosivity in china for grain producing areas like sichuan basin the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river and south china the values are approximately 20 the future warming will significantly increase the potential risk of soil loss in china and it is beneficial to relief this risk if the global warming is limited to 1 5 c rather than 2 c keywords rainfall erosivity 1 5 c and 2 c cesm low warming avoided impact simulation 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the major threats to the environment and agriculture in the world and is influenced by multiple factors such as soil properties ground slope vegetation runoff and rainfall pimentel et al 1995 lal 2004 pimentel 2006 wang et al 2015 soil erosion is a global problem and countries in different continents are more or less affected by it bridges and oldeman 1999 li and fang 2016 during the second half of the 20th century nearly one third of the arable land worldwide was lost caused by erosion and the per capita food productivity has begun to decline pimentel et al 1995 previous studies suggest that the soil erosion rate higher than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 could lead to irreversible effects to soil over 50 to 100 years jones et al 2004 verheijen et al 2009 china severely suffers from soil erosion the xinjiang and inner mongolia are mainly affected by wind erosion the tibetan plateau is mainly affected freeze thaw erosion and the other regions are mainly affected by water erosion liao 1999 wang et al 2016 the average potential erosion rate in china is 1 44 t ha 1 yr 1 and value in some parts of southwestern china is even larger than 10 t ha 1 yr 1 teng et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the future changes of soil erosion in china many models are applied to quantify the effects of different factors on soil erosion such as the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeiner and smith 1978 the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 and the revised universal soil loss equation version 2 rusle2 usda agricultural research service 2013 these models have been widely applied to investigate soil erosion in different regions worldwide the soil erodibility topography land management soil conservation practice and rainfall erosivity are considered as the main factors of water erosion in these models swcs 2003 rainfall erosivity is a good index to characterize the ability of rainfall in leading soil erosion and can be used to indicate the erosion potential nearing et al 2004 morgan 2005 as the most active factor in the process of soil erosion changes in precipitation can directly lead to changes in soil erosion and the change rate of the latter can be several times of the former a 4 to 18 increase in precipitation can cause a 31 to 167 increase in soil loss zhang 2007 in addition increases in the precipitation variability can also lead to the increase in soil erosion zhang and nearing 2005 therefore it is of great importance to investigate the changes in precipitation and rainfall erosivity under the future warming since the industrial revolution the global averaged temperature has been significantly increased due to the increasing content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and will continue to increase ipcc 2013 in recent decades global warming has had a great impact on climate system ecological environment and human production and life global warming increases the water vapor content in the atmosphere which can lead to the increases in mean and extreme precipitation allan and soden 2008 trenberth et al 2003 held and soden 2006 o gorman and schneider 2009 min et al 2011 zhang and zhou 2019 the global mean precipitation has been increased in the past century but the changing pattern of precipitation shows obvious spatial diversity in different regions wentz et al 2007 ipcc 2013 changes in rainfall erosivity also show spatiotemporal differences annual and seasonal rainfall erosivity generally decreased in elbro valley of spain during 1966 2006 angulo martínez and beguería 2012 switzerland evidenced a significant increase decrease in rainfall erosivity in may to october february during 1989 2010 meusburger et al 2012 rainfall erosivity in mainland china and its water erosion regions experienced an insignificant increase in the past several decades liu et al 2013 qin et al 2016 the future warming will lead to increases in both mean and extreme precipitation in most global land regions and the response of extreme precipitation in the east asian monsoon region to the future warming is among the greatest across all global monsoon regions kitoh et al 2013 ipcc 2013 chen et al 2020a zhang and zhou 2020 rainfall erosivity will increase across central part of india in 2080 s relative to 1961 2001 mondal et al 2016 the central asia will evidence an increase in rainfall erosivity by 26 6 in the 2070 s under the rcp8 5 scenario relative to 1950 2000 duulatov et al 2019 in order to mitigate the negative impacts of the future climate change the paris agreement has set a goal of holding global warming to well below 2 c and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels unfccc 2015 many efforts have been devoted to investigate the climate changes under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming and the avoided climate change impacts owing to the 0 5 c less warming e g schleussner et al 2016 donnelly et al 2017 dosio and fischer 2017 king et al 2017 li et al 2018a nangombe et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhao and zhou 2019 chen et al 2020b however barely any study has focused on the responses of rainfall erosivity to the warming targets especially in china under the stabilized 1 5 c and 2 c warming targets while global climate models gcms are useful tools to project the future change of precipitation and rainfall erosivity they generally show biases in regional scales due to their relatively low horizontal resolution to fill in the gap between the low resolution gcm simulations and the desire for finer spatial resolution as well as correction for biases contained in the gcms various statistical downscaling methods have been developed wilby wigley 1997 giorgi 2006 etc the statistical downscaling methods use the outputs of the gcms as predictors for local variables and have been widely used in impact assessments maurer hidalgo 2008 iizumi et al 2011 dosio et al 2012 gutmann et al 2014 li et al 2018b yang et al 2018 in this study we have developed a set of statistically downscaled bias corrected high resolution projection data based on the community earth system model cesm ensemble simulations and investigated the changes in rainfall erosivity in china under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels we have also quantitatively estimated the avoided impacts of the 0 5 c less warming in particular we aim to answer the following questions 1 whether the downscaled simulations can be used to investigate the rainfall erosivity in china 2 how will rainfall erosivity change in different regions of china under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming targets 3 to what extent the changes in rainfall erosivity in china can be avoided if the global warming is limited to 1 5 c rather than 2 c the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and methods used the main results are shown in section 3 and section 4 provides the conclusions of this paper 2 data and methods 2 1 cesm low warming simulation the cesm low warming simulations released by the national center for atmospheric research ncar are applied in this study to investigate the rainfall erosivity over mainland china kay et al 2015 sanderson et al 2017 this set of model simulations are specifically designed to investigate the climate changes and climate impacts under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming relative to the pre industrial levels a set of greenhouse gas emission pathways to obtain long term global warming that do not exceed 1 5 c 1 5 c ne and 2 c 2 c ne above pre industrial levels was first produced by a simple minimal complexity earth simulator mices model after that this set of emission pathways were applied to eleven ensemble members of cesm for the simulation period from 2006 to 2100 except for greenhouse gas emission pathways all the other anthropogenic forcings including land use aerosol emission and ozone follow the rcp8 5 scenario throughout the 21st century in the two emission scenarios in the 1 5 c ne 2 c ne scenario the global mean temperature reaches 1 5 c 2 c above the pre industrial levels in 2040 2090 and stabilizes at this temperature until 2100 the horizontal resolution of the cesm simulation is 1 1 for more detailed information of the cesm low warming simulations please refer to sanderson et al 2017 2 2 the statistical downscaling method the statistical downscaling model applied in this study is a regression model dettinger et al 2004 separate time periods are selected to calibrate and validate the model in this study the calibration period is from 1966 to 1985 and the validation period is from 1986 to 2005 the daily precipitation from the cesm simulations is downscaled the detailed downscaling procedure is as follows firstly for each grid in the observation dataset the values in the nearest grid in the cesm simulations are set to this certain grid that means the horizontal resolution of output of the statistical downscaling model is the same as the observation dataset then the daily precipitation in both the observation dataset and the cesm simulations is sort at each grid for each month of the multiyear during the calibration period in order to ensure the same numbers of wet events days with precipitation in the cesm simulations and the observation a threshold is set in the cesm simulations if there are more wet events in the simulations after that the regression relationship between the wet events in the observation and the simulation are fit by high order polynomials this statistical downscaling model has been applied to investigate the climate change in china in previous studies dai et al 2014 li et al 2018b the credibility of the model is also investigated following salvi et al 2016 the statistical downscaling model is firstly cross validated by using 1986 2005 as the calibration period and 1966 1985 as the validation period then the capability of the statistical downscaling model in capturing the changes in mean precipitation caused by ghg emissions is checked we use the 2 c warmer climate as high ghg emissions period and the pre industrial control run as no anthropogenic ghg emissions period and the results show that the statistical downscaling model is credible in a changing climate please refer to salvi et al 2016 for more detailed information of the credibility checking approach 2 3 observation data daily precipitation from the cn05 1 dataset xu et al 2009 wu et al 2013 with a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 is used to calibrate the statistical downscaling model and to validate the model results the time period is from 1966 to 2005 the cn05 1 dataset is interpolated from over 2400 observing stations in china and is quality controlled by the china meteorological administration cma 2 4 the bias correction method considering that absolute threshold is used to define erosive precipitation a simple bias correction method called multiple local scaling ls factor casanueva et al 2016 is applied to further correct the systematic deviation of downscaled precipitation for each season at each grid 1 rr ls rr ds rm obs rm ds where rr ds is the daily downscaled precipitation respectively rm obs and rm ds are the seasonal mean observed and downscaled precipitation respectively rm obs rm ds is the scaling factor and applied in both the present day simulation and future projections 2 5 rainfall erosivity factor r factor due to the lack of high time resolution precipitation data daily precipitation is widely used to calculate the r factor e g hoyos et al 2005 angulo martínez et al 2009 angulo martínez and beguería 2012 zhu and yu 2015 the method proposed by zhang et al 2002 is applied in this study this method has been widely used to calculate r factor in different regions of china men et al 2008 huang et al 2013 ma et al 2014 yang and lu 2015 qin et al 2016 the calculation formula is as follows 2 r i α j 1 k d j β where r i is the rainfall erosivity in the i t h half month of the year and its unit is m j m m ha 1 h 1 d j is the effective rainfall for day j in this certain half month that means d j is set to the actual rainfall if the rainfall in a day is larger than 12 mm the threshold of erosive precipitation in this study otherwise d j is set to zero k is the number of days in this half month α and β are parameters calculated based on continuous rainfall data series with a high time resolution and the empirical formulas are as follows 3 β 0 8363 18 144 p d 12 1 24 455 p y 12 1 4 α 21 586 β 7 1891 p d 12 and p y 12 represent the average daily and annual rainfall for erosive precipitation days respectively this daily rainfall erosivity model can well estimate the climatology of rainfall erosivity and its seasonal distribution especially in the regions with abundant precipitation however the model may underestimate the erosion caused by extreme storm zhang et al 2002 2 6 time periods and sub regions the period from 1986 to 2005 is referred as the present day and the period from 2081 to 2100 in the two low warming scenarios represent the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels above the pre industrial levels the study region is classified into nine sub regions according to the agricultural regions in mainland china fig 1 northeast china plain nep northern arid and semiarid region nas qinghai tibet plateau qtp loess plateau lp huang huai hai plain hhhp middle lower yangtze plain mlyp southern china sc yunnan guizhou plateau ygp and sichuan basin and surrounding regions sbs 2 7 definition of indices and avoided impact three indices are used in this study the erosive precipitation day defined in this study is a day when the daily precipitation is larger than 12 mm freq12 and int12 are the annual frequency and annual mean intensity of erosive precipitation besides re represents rainfall erosivity in the following parts the impact of rainfall erosivity that avoided at 1 5 c compared with the 2 c warming level is calculated using the formula below li et al 2018a 5 a i c 2 0 c 1 5 c 2 0 100 where ai is the avoided impact c 1 5 and c 2 0 represent the changes of rainfall erosivity at the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels relative to the present day 3 results 3 1 validation of the model simulations in the present day we first evaluate the model performance in the present day the annual rainfall erosivity decreases from the southeast to the northwest of china in the observation like that of the annual precipitation ranging from higher than 10 000 m j m m ha 1 h 1 a 1 to lower than 50 m j m m ha 1 h 1 a 1 fig 2 a for the regional mean of the sub regions it is highest in sc and lowest in nas figs 1 and 2a the freq12 also decreases from the southeast to the northwest of china from larger than 40 days per year to smaller than 2 days per year fig 2b generally the int12 also shows similar spatial distribution with the re fig 1c however the central value is located between the yangtze river and the yellow river in eastern china hence the spatial distribution of re over mainland china is the combined results of frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation the original cesm low warming simulations hereafter the cesm can roughly capture the spatial distribution and magnitudes of re in mainland china but overestimate re in most parts of western china and underestimate it in most parts of eastern china fig 2d therefore the gradient of re from southeast to northwest china is smaller in the cesm than in the observation this bias is reflected in both the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation especially the frequency fig 2e and f the statistical downscaling simulations hereafter the sd show evident improvement compared with the cesm in capturing the climatology characteristics of re in mainland china fig 2g both the spatial distribution and the magnitude are more close to the observation similar improvement is evident in the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation in the sd fig 2h and i we further quantitatively measure the model skill fig 3 taylor diagram is used to evaluate the performance of the sd and the cesm in terms of pattern correlations the root mean square differences and the ratios of spatial variations in the simulated and observed values of the re freq12 and int12 the observation is used as the reference in the cesm the pattern correlation of re is around 0 2 and the ratio of spatial standard deviation is more than 2 0 fig 3a the regional averaged biases of re in most sub regions are larger than 30 and even 60 fig 3b the biases of re in the cesm are mainly caused by the biases in the freq12 the pattern correlation is around 0 2 and the regional averaged biases are larger than 60 in most sub regions differently the biases of int12 are relatively small the pattern correlation is around 0 6 and the ratio of spatial standard deviations is approximately 0 75 fig 3a in addition the regional averaged biases are within 15 in most sub regions fig 3b the sd outperforms the cesm for all the three indices with pattern correlations larger than 0 9 and the ratios of spatial standard deviations close to 1 0 especially for freq12 fig 3a the regional averaged biases are also smaller in the sd with values within 15 for the three indices in most sub regions fig 3b the regional mean re over mainland china shows obvious annual cycle in the present day with peak values of about 360 m j m m ha 1 h 1 occurring in july fig 4 the annual cycle of re in mainland china can be roughly reproduced in the cesm but is overestimated throughout the year besides the peak values of re occurs in june compared with the cesm the sd exhibits obvious improvements in reproducing the annual cycle of regional mean re in mainland china with the overestimation evidently reduced and the peak value occurring in july fig 4 there are certain differences in the annual cycle of re in different sub regions but the peak values all occur in summer fig 5 consistent with the results shown above figs 2 and 3 the cesm underestimates the re in southern china and overestimates the re in northern china fig 5 in addition these biases exist throughout the year the sd performs well in most sub regions and only overestimates the re in mlyp and hhhp in summer in general compared with the original cesm simulations the sd performs better in reproducing the characteristics of rainfall erosivity and its important determinants the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation in the present day in mainland china however there are still some biases in the sd the reason is that the statistical downscaling method applied in this study can help to obtain more detailed spatial distribution of precipitation and reduce the biases of climatic state of precipitation in the global model after statistical downscaling the biases of precipitation with different intensity will be reduced but not fully eliminated in the following analysis the sd is applied to investigate the changes in rainfall erosivity and erosive precipitation in mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels 3 2 future projections of rainfall erosivity we first examine the changes in annual rainfall erosivity the changing patterns of re in the two warmer climates are similar compared with the present day the annual rainfall erosivity will increase significantly in most areas of mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels with the large values occurring in central china and the southern edge of the tibetan plateau fig 6 a and b compared with the 1 5 c warmer climate the extra 0 5 c warming in the 2 c warmer climate will significantly lead to larger re in most parts of china except some parts of north china fig 6c the most obvious increases larger than 16 lie in the sichuan basin and parts of southeast china two of the important grain producing areas in china the cumulative density function cdf is applied to quantitatively analyze the changes of re in china individual grid cells are weighted by their area the cdfs can apparently exhibit both the median change of re in china and the changes in small fractions compared with the present day about half landmass of mainland china will experience a re increase of 30 and 40 in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates respectively the corresponding increases will be even larger than 60 and 75 respectively in a quarter of mainland china fig 6d regional mean changes in re in mainland china are approximately 33 and 40 under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming respectively about four times larger than the corresponding increase in precipitation 5 5 and 7 3 under the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming respectively li et al 2019 qtp and sbs will experience larger re increase than other sub regions fig 6d compared with the original cesm projection the increasing magnitudes of rainfall erosivity in the sd are larger in all the nine subregions in the two warmer climates and the differences between these two sets of simulations are largest in the tibetan plateau table 1 the possible reason for these differences is that the sd can better capture the spatial distributions and magnitudes of frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation seasonal features of changes in re over china are further investigated fig 7 we first examine the absolute changes of re in the two warmer climates the re will increase throughout the year with peak values occurring in summer months fig 7a the increases in re caused by extra 0 5 c warming in the 2 c warmer climate mainly appear in june to september fig 7a distinctly the magnitudes of relative changes in re among different months are comparable around 30 and 40 in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates respectively fig 7b therefore the future warming basically will not change the seasonal distributions of re in mainland china in terms of regional mean but lead to an overall re increase throughout the year freq12 will increase in most parts of mainland china in the warming future fig 8 a and b the changing patterns of freq12 in the two warmer climates are similar with those of re figs 6 and 8 int12 will also increase under the future warming but the magnitudes are obviously smaller than those of increase in freq12 fig 8d and e therefore increases in the frequency of erosive precipitation contribute more to the increases in re in the warming future than the intensity of erosive precipitation it is worth noting that the increasing magnitudes of re are evidently larger than both freq12 and int12 we use formula 5 to quantify the impacts of increased re avoided if the global warming is controlled well below 1 5 c rather than 2 c fig 9 in the sd compared with the 2 c warmer climate the half degree less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to reduce 17 of the increase in re over mainland china except nep and hhhp the increases of re will be avoided in most sub regions of mainland from 10 in lp to 28 in qtp for major grain producing areas like sbs mlyp and sc the avoided increase in re are approximately 20 the results in the original cesm are comparable with or a little larger than those in the sd in most subregions the half degree less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to reduce 23 of the increase in re over mainland china 4 conclusion and summary the cesm low warming simulations released by ncar are specifically designed to investigate climate change and climate impacts of 1 5 c and 2 c global warming above the pre industrial levels in this study statistically downscaled and bias corrected cesm low warming ensemble simulations are developed and applied to investigate the changes in rainfall erosivity and erosive precipitation in mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 compared with the original cesm low warming simulations the downscaled simulations show much better performance in reproducing the spatial distributions and annual cycle of re in mainland china the pattern correlations of re freq12 and int12 are larger than 0 9 and the regional mean biases of the three indices are within 15 in most sub regions 2 the re will evidence a robust increase in mainland china with larger increasing magnitudes under 2 c compared with 1 5 c warming target in most sub regions the increasing magnitudes are larger than 60 and 75 in a quarter of mainland china at the 1 5 c and 2 c global warming levels respectively the absolute increases of regional mean re over china show obvious seasonality with peak values occurring in summer however the relative increases of re among different months are comparable around 30 and 40 in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates respectively the increasing magnitudes of rainfall erosivity in the original cesm are a little smaller than those in the sd 3 the increase in re is resulted from the joint contributions of increases in freq12 and int12 the spatial distribution of increases in re is dominated by that of the increase in freq12 differently the increases in the intensity of erosive precipitation are relatively uniform in mainland china in the two stabilized warming conditions in addition the changing magnitudes of re are much larger than those of annual precipitation or the frequency and intensity of erosive precipitation the increasing magnitudes of regional mean re in mainland china are about four times larger than the corresponding increase in annual precipitation in the two warmer climates therefore compared with annual rainfall amount the future warming will bring a greater impact on the soil erosion potential caused by rainfall 4 compared with the 2 c warmer climate the 0 5 c less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to avoid 17 of the increase in rainfall erosivity in mainland china with greatest reduction of 28 occurring in qtp for grain producing areas like sbs mlyp and sc the values are approximately 20 the correspond values in the original cesm are comparable with or a little larger than those in the sd in most subregions the half degree less warming in the 1 5 c warmer climate will help to reduce 23 of the increase in re over mainland china our analysis suggests that the future warming will significantly increase the potential risk of soil erosion in mainland china and controlling the global warming to 1 5 c above the pre industrial levels rather than 2 c is beneficial to reduce this risk rainfall erosivity is directly associated with the intensity frequency and amount of precipitation different models and methods have been applied to investigate the changes of these different characteristics of precipitation over east asia under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming conditions including the regional climate models li et al 2018c the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models zhou et al 2019 and the stand alone agcm simulations of the happi half a degree additional warming prognosis and projected impacts project lee et al 2018 the results are qualitatively consistent but quantitatively different among these models and methods li et al 2019 the results of this study are only derived from one set of coupled low warming simulations and this may lead to uncertainties in the projection of rainfall erosivity further investigation should be done in the future work due to the model dependence of the results presented here moreover climate projections are scenario dependent a new set of future scenarios namely the combined scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps are designed and applied to the cmip6 models o neill et al 2016 the changes of rainfall erosivity under these new scenarios should be also investigated changes of rainfall erosivity is a good indicator of the changes of soil erosion potential in the warming future it is worth noting that in addition to the changes of rainfall changes of land use land cover lulc also have large impacts on the changes of soil erosion for example the conversion of naturally vegetated areas for agricultural uses may intensify soil erosion tarolli and sofia 2016 yang and lu 2018 and grain for green can effectively decrease the soil erosion deng et al 2012 there are large uncertainties in the future greenhouse gas emissions and land uses statistically explore their relative contributions to the changes of soil erosion is of great importance to the adaptation and mitigation policies borrelli et al 2020 saha and ghosh 2020 borrelli et al 2020 uses three alternative 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 shared socioeconomic pathway and representative concentration pathway ssp rcp scenarios to investigates the impacts of land use and climate change on the global erosion by water they indicate that the future changes of soil erosion are dominated by climate change and the contributions of socioeconomic developments impacting land use to changes in water erosion are relatively small similarly changes of surface hydrology of the ganga river basin are also dominated by the climate change mitigation pathways saha and ghosh 2020 the relative contributions of changes in rainfall and land use to the changes of soil erosion in china in the 1 5 c and 2 c warmer climates are still not clear and should be further investigated in the future work author contributions youcun qi and donghuan li managed the research donghuan li and tianjun zhou collected and prepared the

4054,chloride exports from the widespread application of road salt serve as a primary contribution to water body salinity in cold climate regions road salt pollution is a concern in drinking water supplies due to the relationship between chloride concentration and water corrosivity in the northeastern u s researchers and water quality managers are interested in better understanding how management practices can mitigate the negative effects of road salt pollution this study uses regression based chloride load estimates from loadest to produce mass balances and analyze transport flow paths to the wachusett reservoir from a predominantly rural watershed a chloride mass balance for 2000 through 2019 revealed that reservoir and watershed export only recently reached a level similar to estimated inputs from road salt 11 200 ton yr results from hydrograph and load separation techniques show that average loading 4300 1300 ton yr and discharge from baseflow 3 2 0 9 m3 s contributed approximately 74 and 65 of the total loading 5800 1800 ton yr and discharge 4 93 1 50 m3 s respectively from water years 2001 through 2019 approximately 40 of the total annual tributary load 30 baseflow 10 runoff occurred in the spring march may and is attributed to elevated baseflow conditions from snowmelt as indicated by a baseflow chloride index baseflow concentrations are 14 greater than the total concentrations measured in the tributaries therefore the baseflow dominated tributary chloride loading is due to a combination of greater discharge and chloride concentration in baseflow as compared to direct surface runoff however a long term trend analysis suggests a slightly increased fraction of chloride loading via overland flow in several reservoir tributaries potentially indicative of late 20th century land development this study offers a unique monitoring approach for management authorities to better assess road salt pollution in water systems the decadal response of the reservoir system reflects the slow moving nature of the baseflow dominated chloride loading and suggests that measurable water quality improvements will only be realized with a sustained long term decrease in the amount of road salt applied keywords drinking water road salt chloride constituent loading mass balance baseflow 1 introduction road salt application for pavement deicing purposes is a standard practice in cold climate regions widespread use of roadway deicers in the u s originated during the 1940s kelly et al 2010 with rock salt nacl being the most common due to its low cost effective dispersion properties and ease of storage ramakrishna and viraraghavan 2005 road salt induced freshwater salinization was first recognized in the late 1960s and ear1y 1970s hutchinson and olson 1967 judd 1970 followed by observations of road salt contamination in rivers dailey et al 2014 godwin et al 2003 streams kelly et al 2007 moore et al 2019 trowbridge et al 2010 lakes likens and buso 2010 novotny et al 2008 and groundwaters howard and haynes 1993 huling and hollocher 1972 meriano et al 2009 perera et al 2013 other potential sources of chloride include the natural weathering of rocks atmospheric deposition agricultural fertilizers chemical and food production seawater intrusion water softening and wastewater and septic system effluent novotny et al 2009 panno et al 2006 however chloride inputs are often dominated by road salting in regions where they are applied moore et al 2019 concerns over surface and sub surface water quality impairment due to road salting practices are ever mounting in lakes and reservoirs elevated chloride concentrations the preferred environmental tracer due to its highly conservative nature from deicers have been shown to alter density gradients and mixing dynamics such that periods of complete mixing in lakes are either delayed or exhibit perennial meromixis i e permanent stratification bubeck and burton 1989 sibert et al 2015 wyman and koretsky 2018 as an indirect consequence of meromixis water bodies may exhibit severe states of hypolimnetic anoxia judd et al 2005 enhanced eutrophication koretsky et al 2012 novotny and stefan 2012 and trophic structure disruption hintz et al 2017 at smaller scales vernal pool breeding amphibians have exhibited a heightened sensitivity to dissolved chloride collins and russell 2009 karraker et al 2008 whereas native plant communities may become displaced by invasive salt tolerant vegetation richburg et al 2001 wilcox 1986 these water quality concerns were reported for chloride concentrations typically exceeding the u s environmental protection agency epa chronic four day average once every three years aquatic toxicity criteria of 230 mg l or near the acute one hour average once every three years toxicity of 860 mg l the u s epa secondary standard for chloride in drinking water is 250 mg l based on taste studies have shown that increasing concentrations of lead and copper in drinking water systems a result of corroded distribution infrastructure are positively correlated with increases in the chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr and larson ratio edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 lytle et al 2005 ng and lin 2016 stets et al 2018 while sulfate lead interactions have been shown to form beneficial precipitates chloride lead reactions may introduce harmful soluble complexes into drinking water systems nguyen et al 2011 in particular the drastic change in csmr observed during the flint michigan water crisis has been cited as a possible contributor along with the elimination of phosphate based corrosion control to subsequent corrosion masten et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 pieper et al 2018 large surface water bodies often benefit from diluted pollutant levels and are more likely to have low chloride concentrations 100 mg l however an elevated csmr may still occur due to perennially low sulfate levels potentially driving higher water corrosivity given the inability of most conventional water treatment practices to remove dissolved chloride alternative chloride control measures are important for mitigating the effects of road salt pollution chloride from rock salts is conservatively transported to receiving waters via quick hours to days overland flow as runoff or via slow months to decades sub surface groundwater as baseflow ostendorf and kilbridge 2011 sanford and pope 2013 starn and belitz 2018 interflow or subsurface stormflow through the vadose zone also occurs with times of concentration between those of runoff and baseflow dunne and black 1970 whipkey 1965 however interflow was not explicitly analyzed in this study rates of catchment chloride export can be estimated using comprehensive mass balance approaches and compared to road salt application rates to determine site specific changes in groundwater storage of chloride howard and haynes 1993 huling and hollocher 1972 perera et al 2013 riverine chloride loads are calculated as the product of volumetric discharge and chloride concentration integrated over a specified time period tributary loading disaggregated into components of baseflow and runoff is more difficult to calculate and requires timeseries of discharge and concentration representative of baseflow and or runoff conditions baseflow loading may be derived from dry period assumptions howard and haynes 1993 directly measured with groundwater sampling meriano et al 2009 or estimated with regression based modeling approaches cohn et al 1989 cohn et al 1992 the latter is a suitable option when conditional baseflow assumptions are not appropriate year round and reliable groundwater data are not available the united states geologic survey usgs program load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 is a commonly employed statistically based water constituent load estimation method and relates log transformed load to functions of streamflow and decimal time given that raw water quality constituents are rarely measured with high frequency typically occurring weekly twice a month or at longer intervals regression models may offer an accurate approach to estimate constituent loading between known measurements pellerin et al 2014 constituents assessed using loadest models include nitrogen jha et al 2007 schilling and zhang 2004 phosphorus chen et al 2015 suspended solids duan et al 2013 and total dissolved solids tds shope and angeroth 2015 moreover separate baseflow loading regression models are considered in schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 and he et al 2020 the goal of this study is to quantify the impacts of road salting practices on chloride loading in a predominantly rural watershed for a drinking water supply reservoir the wachusett reservoir in massachusetts u s the study site benefits from a rich history of research ahlfeld et al 2003 hagemann and park 2014 jeznach et al 2016 and long term data availability the primary objectives of this study are 1 perform a reservoir system chloride mass balance over a decadal period of study 2000 through 2019 and 2 determine the primary chloride transport pathways from source to surface water additionally loading model output sensitivies to several baseflow separation techniques and one alternate hydrologic model are addressed this study introduces a baseflow chloride index akin to the baseflow enrichment ratio in schilling and zhang 2004 in a novel application to road salt analysis the index quantifies baseflow chloride concentration relative to in stream measurements and is used to infer chloride transport pathways in the watershed the use of chloride loading regressions circumvent the need for daily water quality monitoring a major obstacle in long term road salt analysis furthermore the study site serves as the drinking water supply for a large metropolitan area boston few studies have assessed the impacts of road salting practices on drinking water reservoir systems nimiroski and waldron 2002 ostendorf 2013 and none that we are aware of have done so over a long term study period finally this study offers a simple and reproducible approach for water resource management authorities to identify and monitor watershed chloride trends first a discussion of the models and data processing techniques used in this study is provided then the mass balance and load separation results are presented followed by a discussion on implications for the reservoir watershed 2 methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 water supply system the wachusett reservoir located in worcester county is the major source of potable water for the greater boston metropolitan area the two primary agencies that monitor and manage the reservoir are the massachusetts department of conservation and recreation dcr division of water supply protection and the massachusetts water resources authority mwra the wachusett reservoir remains an unfiltered surface water supply reflecting its high quality however issues pertaining to water corrosivity are a concern in 1996 a treatment process change from the addition of sodium hydroxide to the addition of sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide for improved corrosion control helped decrease lead concentrations typically to below the u s epa action level of 15 ppb karalekas jr et al 1983 management authorities continue to monitor water corrosivity and over the past two decades have noted rising chloride concentrations in cosgrove intake withdrawals from the wachusett reservoir fig 1 2 1 2 study site the wachusett reservoir is a dimictic surface water located approximately 10 km northeast of worcester ma the 16 3 km2 water body receives an average annual precipitation and snowfall of 1 260 mm and 1 960 mm respectively over a predominantly rural 87 287 km2 watershed area the wachusett reservoir is fed by periodic transfers from the much larger quabbin reservoir located approximately 50 km to the west and ten tributaries monitored by the dcr located to the north west and south of the reservoir fig 2 a chloride concentration trends converted from measured specific conductivity as discussed in section 2 2 2 for each of the ten monitored tributaries are shown in fig 2b the watershed delineation was performed and provided by the dcr additionally a 26 km2 area borders the reservoir shoreline referred to as direct entry providing direct inflow without entering a monitored tributary water withdrawn from the wachusett is conveyed to the carroll water treatment plant in marlborough massachusetts approximately 13 km southeast of the cosgrove intake selected watershed characteristics by tributary are summarized in table 1 with timeseries averaged tributary chloride concentrations showing a direct correlation to impervious surface and paved surface density fig 3 land cover within the watershed derived from the land cover land use 2016 dataset in table 2 is primarily forest forested wetland 74 developed open space 6 4 and impervious surface 5 3 40 of the impervious surface coverage is attributed to right of way two thirds of residential land use is located in forests or forested wetlands and are dominated by single family units 85 of all residential land use land development has continued to increase since the 1970s statistics provided in table s4 of the supporting information or si and are marked by increases in residential density and the completion of u s interstate route 190 i 190 during the same period the mwra and dcr have continued to purchase land within the watershed the watershed primarily consists of thin till that typically dominates the surficial geologic composition at higher elevations glacial meltwater deposits occupy the lower elevations and are overlain by swamp deposits near the streambeds fig 4 the bedrock of the region consists mainly of calcpelite granite and metamorphic formations a comprehensive review of the geology in the wachusett reservoir region is provided in chapter h of hatch jr 1991 geographical information systems gis software coupled with publicly available massgis data table 2 were used for all spatial analysis in this study unless noted otherwise 2 2 loadest model development loadest regression models were used to estimate daily tributary chloride loading which relate log transformed load l to functions of centered streamflow q and or centered decimal time t the explanatory variables are centered to avoid multicollinearity during regression cohn et al 1992 loadest model coefficients were calibrated to observed loads computed with measurements of discharge and concentration using adjusted maximum likelihood estimation an approach that accounts for censored data subject to a normality of residuals assumption runkel et al 2004 while ai based water quality modeling is growing in popularity alizadeh et al 2018 ha et al 2020 tiyasha et al 2020 zhou 2020 loadest was an attractive option for its simplicity and ease of use from a practical standpoint this ease of use is key for management agencies interested in adapting the methods stated herein loadest regression models for total streamflow and baseflow were developed for each of the ten tributaries using the full 20 year period of study the r package rloadest https github com usgs r rloadest was used as a substitute for the original loadest program the following sections detail the methods used for both total and baseflow model construction 2 2 1 hydrologic modeling and hydrograph separation total tributary discharge timeseries were either obtained from usgs gaging stations or estimated using a simple rainfall runoff model the quinapoxet river and stillwater river daily discharge observations were provided by usgs gages for the entire period of study gaged discharge for the gates brook was available starting in october of 2011 daily discharge estimates for the remaining seven minor tributaries and for the gates brook prior to the stream gage installation were calculated using the simple gr4j rainfall runoff hydrologic model perrin et al 2003 coupled with the cemaneige snow accounting routine valéry et al 2014 using the airgr package in r coron et al 2017 the models were calibrated to sets of available weekly and or daily discharge data collected intermittently over the full period of study for each tributary a rainfall runoff modeling approach was primarily chosen for this study given its simplicity the gr4j model using only four parameters provides a simpler approach compared to more complex rainfall runoff models such as the soil and water assessment tool hillslope hoang et al 2017 while developed and widely used in europe gr4j has had numerous applications in u s based studies as well oudin et al 2018 papacharalampous et al 2019 salavati et al 2015 an alternative approach to discharge estimation tobiason et al 2002 was incorporated into the loading models for a sensitivity analysis in this approach which will be referred to as the basin area partitioning method bapm discharge is calculated based on the daily watershed yield of the stillwater river and sub basin area of interest as shown in eq 1 1 q t r i b i q s t i l l w a t e r i a r e a t r i b a r e a s t i l l w a t e r where q is discharge m3 s and i is a daily timestep performance metrics for hydrologic models using both methods are included in table s3 of the si the bapm has served as the primary method of ungaged discharge estimation in the watershed jeznach et al 2016 while an effective approach to approximating ungaged flow it has an obvious limitation in that it assumes an equal time of concentration between the stillwater river and the modeled tributary of interest therefore bapm was not employed as the primary hydrologic model for this study further analysis of the differences between the two approaches is provided in the discussion several analytical methods for separating tributary hydrographs into components of baseflow and runoff were considered and include the usgs hydrograph separation hysep program from sloto and crouse 1996 the streamflow partitioning part program from rutledge 1998 and digital separation filters from lyne and hollick 1979 and eckhardt 2005 alternatively mass balance approaches offer a more physically based approach to separate baseflow from runoff stewart et al 2007 but rely on concurrent discharge and concentration measurements that were not available for this study the mass balance methods also operate under the assumption of a constant tracer concentration e g chloride which is violated in nearly all reservoir tributaries fig 2b the lyne and hollick l h one parameter digital recursive filter is derived from signal processing theory and attributes the low frequency component of streamflow to baseflow the l h filter was employed in this study using the r package ecohydrology fuka et al 2014 with a filter parameter of 0 925 as proposed by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and several filter passes one two and three that govern the degree of smoothing the two parameter eckhardt filter assumes that aquifer discharge is linearly proportional to its storage and introduces the concept of a maximum achievable baseflow index bfi where bfi is the ratio of baseflow volume to total discharge volume for a specified long term time period the inclusion of a maximum bfi assumed equal to 0 8 for this study as per eckhardt 2005 allows for the attribution of a non negligible low frequency component of streamflow to runoff as noted by spongberg 2000 the eckhardt baseflow separation was calculated using the r package flowscreen dierauer and whitfield 2017 the hysep and part programs using the usgs r package dvstats https github com usgs r dvstats rely upon linear interpolations between a subset of discharge measurements that are assumed equal to baseflow the hysep program includes three separation algorithms fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum to systematically differentiate between baseflow and runoff details of each method are provided in sloto and crouse 1996 as originally developed by pettyjohn and henning 1979 the part program uses an antecedent recession requirement to develop the initial subset of discharge data attributed to baseflow streamflow separation is a function of catchment area in both the hysep and part programs the bfi calculated for the period 10 2011 12 2019 for each of the eight different methods table 3 reveal the range of potential baseflow timeseries for load estimation the 2011 2019 timeframe represents the period of record for which all three usgs gages were in simultaneous operation the numbers following the l h designation refer to the number of filter passes the letters following the hysep designation refer to the program s baseflow separation method local minimum l fixed interval f and sliding interval s ultimately the hysep l local minimum method was chosen for this analysis given its application in new england based studies hodgkins and dudley 2011 and that the resultant mean bfi 0 68 most closely represents an average of the available methods 0 685 the local minimum method utilizes a linear interpolation between the lowest flows of a hydrograph within a set of calculated intervals that depend on catchment area the uncertainty in baseflow quantification for various techniques is noted zhu et al 2019 table 3 shows that for any method baseflow comprises a significant portion of total streamflow in the watershed therefore loadest regression sensitivities calculated as the change in result relative to output derived from the gr4j and hysep l approaches to the various hydrologic modeling and baseflow separation methods are evaluated in this study 2 2 2 concentration separation grab sample based measurements conducted by the dcr two to four times per month of specific conductivity µs cm were used to develop separate timeseries for total and baseflow chloride concentrations chloride measurements for all ten monitored tributaries were available for a brief period between january 2018 and january 2019 the regular measurements of specific conductivity sc were converted to chloride cl in mg l using a linear regression eq 2 r2 0 996 the linear regression was based on 23 data points from all tributaries on days when both sc and chloride were measured chloride samples collected by the dcr were sent to mwra central lab at deer island boston ma and analyzed using epa method 300 0 pfaff 1996 it was assumed that baseflow chloride concentration equaled total chloride the chloride level calculated from measured sc for days when baseflow exceeded 90 or more of the total streamflow schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 a threshold deemed appropriate for returning a large enough baseflow chloride sample size the relationship between chloride and sc is shown in fig s1 of the si 2 c l m g l 1 11 16 0 267 s c μ s c m 1 2 2 3 model selection the optimum loadest regression equation from a suite of nine pre defined formulas was automatically selected for each tributary based on the minimum calculated akaike information criterion aic statistic as per runkel et al 2004 schwarz posterior probability criterion sppc statistics were also calculated during the model selection process but were not factored into the optimum model selection the performance of each model presented in tables s1 and s2 of the si section was assessed by its coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 load bias percentage bp and an analysis of model residuals as recommended in runkel et al 2004 the optimum regression formulas as determined by loadest are summarized in table 4 all tributary chloride loads were estimated using model number 9 with the exception of the total model 8 and baseflow model 7 stillwater river loadest regressions a general nomenclature defining the various variables metrics and models used throughout the study is provided in table 5 2 3 mass balance sub basin scale chloride mass budgets were developed by balancing inputs from road salts with exports from tributary loading nacl inputs for each sub basin were estimated by multiplying specific application rates expressed as ton lane mi per year for the massachusetts department of transportation massdot local cities towns and private maintenance e g parking lots by their respective lane mile coverage the massdot roads layer table 2 was used to estimate lane mile coverage per sub basin and roadway jurisdiction massdot or city town estimates of privately maintained paved surfaces were developed by removing all rooftop surface areas building structures dataset from the intersection of impervious surface area with commercial or multi family residential land use area the resultant area was converted to lane miles assuming a uniform 3 7 meter lane width an average road salt application rate of 42 3 ton lane mi for dot maintained roads was used drawn from the 2017 environmental status planning report for district 3 massdot 2017 estimated average annual mass inputs of road salt into the watershed by town were provided by the dcr and equally allocated into each intersecting sub basin on a percentage lane mile basis roadway coverage outside cities towns that reported data received an application rate of 28 6 ton lane mi equal to the average city town rate weighted by total years of available data from the dcr privately maintained paved surfaces also received an application rate equal to the city town rate of 28 6 ton lane mi chloride load leaving the reservoir was calculated as the product of measured raw water chloride concentration at the carroll water treatment plant and gaged reservoir withdrawals releases for the mass balance total tributary chloride export for the quinapoxet river qr stillwater river sr and gates brook gb were estimated from usgs gages when data were available instead of relying on loadest derived output estimates for the direct entry de catchment were derived from a flow weighted average of chloride concentration in the adjacent minor tributaries multiplied by discharge estimated from the bapm approach gr4j was not chosen to simulate direct entry due to the absence of observed data to calibrate to the remaining tributary fb mgb mab mub tb wb and wbb contributions reflect loadest output and are combined into the mt minor tributaries designation with the exception of the waushacum brook wb which represents itself the final quinapoxet river load was multiplied by the ratio of the total quinapoxet river sub basin area to its gaged area equivalent to an increase of 8 7 to account for additional mass input downstream of the monitoring station other sources of chloride considered in this study include septic system effluent and wet deposition chloride inputs from human excretion and domestic waste products are estimated as 12 4 kg per person per year and four people per septic parcel kelly et al 2007 historic septic system data temporal and spatial by parcel were provided by the dcr wet deposition loads were calculated as the product of daily precipitation reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa at worcester regional airport and atmospheric chloride concentration measured at the quabbin reservoir and reported by the national atmospheric deposition program nadp there is no wastewater discharged from treatment facilities within the reservoir watershed chloride contributions from the underlying geology primarily metamorphic and igneous rock were considered negligible for this study as per granato et al 2015 3 results 3 1 mass balance the estimated mean annual chloride input from road salting practices was approximately 11 200 ton yr disaggregation by sub basin shown in fig 5 from 2000 through 2019 total lane mi coverage by the massdot cities towns and private practices were 82 498 and 182 respectively the quinapoxet river and gates brook catchments account for 132 of the 182 lane miles estimated to receive road salt application from private practices these higher rates are attributed to the more densely populated town centers of holden and west boylston 52 of the 82 lane miles in the watershed under massdot jurisdiction are within the quinapoxet river i 190 route 122a waushacum brook i 190 route 12 and the direct entry routes 12 110 and 70 basins reservoir input chloride loads varied between 4 100 ton yr and 11 000 ton yr for water years 2001 to 2018 fig 6 a reaching 14 500 ton yr in 2019 the average input from road salts and annual reservoir chloride export via the cosgrove intake withdrawal and downstream releases to the nashua river reflect the chloride inputs and outputs to the entire reservoir system control volume outflowing reservoir chloride load was largely in equilibrium with inflowing load from water years 2013 through 2019 but exceeded inflow loads by approximately 2 000 ton yr on average from 2001 through 2012 water years defined as the period from october 1 through september 30 are used to ensure that the winter salting season is not split into two calendar years the winter severity index wsi presented in fig 6b is intended to highlight the potential for variation in year to year road salt usage in the absence of road salt application timeseries data the wsi is useful for identifying periods where usage may have been high or low the metric ranges from 50 least severe to 50 most severe and is based solely on daily temperature and snowfall analyzed over a period from november through march of any given water year the wsi has shown to correlate strongly with road salt usage at a state wide scale massdot 2017 there were not enough yearly data published to determine if a correlation exists between road salt application and wsi in this study region district 3 central massachusetts of the seven years of available data no clear correlation was observed a formula and more detailed description of the wsi is provided on page two of the si chloride loads entering the reservoir did not always scale with inflow as shown in fig 7 imported chloride loads via the quabbin transfer qt contribute on average 20 of the total reservoir chloride input the qt provides 46 of the annual average inflow at very low chloride concentrations 7 mg l direct precipitation onto the reservoir surface p delivered 5 of the average annual inflow but 1 of the average annual chloride load together the quinapoxet river stillwater river gates brook and waushacum brook constitute 65 of the total chloride load entering the reservoir and 80 of the load originating from the watershed the long term trends in tributary discharge load and concentration are compared in fig 8 a juxtaposed with annual precipitation at worcester regional airport fig 8b the 20 year mean for watershed discharge expressed as a yearly volume and load are 155 106 m3 and 5 800 ton yr respectively each data point depicts the discharge and load normalized by these averages the concentration data represent a watershed scale normalized metric of chloride i e concentration aggregated for all sampled tributaries average annual chloride levels were normalized to the 20 year mean chloride concentration for each tributary the concentration data shown represent the mean and standard deviation for normalized concentration for all tributaries these data were then scaled by average annual tributary loading rates with the quinapoxet river receiving the highest weight given that it contributes the largest proportion of watershed born chloride load to the reservoir fig 7 a partial mann kendall pmk trend test libiseller and grimvall 2002 performed on the averaged concentration data from fig 8a yielded a statistically significant increasing trend despite the inclusion of average discharge as a covariate discharge and loading contributions from the quabbin transfer are not representative of the wachusett watershed and therefore ignored in fig 8a other sources of chloride within the watershed were considered but not shown given their low contributions when compared to tributary chloride loads chloride inputs from septic effluent prior to 1997 were 600 ton yr yet decreased to 240 ton yr in 1998 and further declined to 50 ton yr in 2019 as the surrounding towns gradually introduced sanitary sewers chloride loads from wet deposition were 0 373 tons per km2 per year or approximately 100 ton yr for the entire watershed 3 2 chloride load separation an annual baseflow load index bli defined as the yearly fraction of total load attributed to baseflow by tributary for water years 2001 through 2019 is shown in fig 9 a mean 0 66 and median 0 70 annual blis were computed for the ten modeled tributaries over the full period of study however on average 74 of the total annual chloride load from the watershed was delivered through baseflow due to increased loading from the quinapoxet river stillwater river gates brook and waushacum brook the average annual bli per tributary ranged from 0 43 muddy brook to 0 79 stillwater river and malden brook a baseflow chloride index bci in the manner of schilling and zhang s 2004 baseflow enrichment ratio ber is introduced in this study the bci formula eq 3 represents the ratio of the bli to the bfi for any given year it is effectively the ratio of baseflow concentration to total tributary concentration and is useful in quantifying the allocation of chloride concentration between baseflow and runoff bci values equal to 1 indicate uniform concentrations for all flow paths bci values greater than 1 indicate that baseflow concentration exceeds runoff concentration furthermore baseflow concentration may be calculated by multiplying the bci by total tributary concentration the average annual bci distributions by tributary fig 9b ranged from 1 05 french brook to 1 32 malagasco brook with a mean value of 1 14 considering a weighted average based on total chloride loading per tributary the mean bci was 1 12 3 b c i b l i b f i pmk trend tests were conducted for all tributary bcis with bfi as the covariate for water years 2001 through 2019 and yielded statistically significant p 0 001 decreasing trends pmk test statistic z 0 in the quinapoxet river muddy brook and trout brook fig 10 a uniform increase in bci occurred during water year 2010 the removal of water year 2001 bcis did not affect the statistical significance of trend tests for the quinapoxet river muddy brook and trout brook trend tests for the remaining tributaries all yielded statistically insignificant p 0 05 results the monthly variability of tributary chloride loading discharge and concentration separated by flow path is shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively baseflow and runoff monthly chloride loading peaked in the spring march may contributing 30 and 10 of the total mean annual load respectively lower chloride loading rates occurred during july september when baseflow and runoff loading accounted for 4 and 1 of the mean annual load respectively per month monthly discharge followed a similar pattern to chloride loading fig 11 but exhibited more pronounced peaks and valleys for runoff and baseflow respectively the trends in normalized tributary chloride concentration are reversed from those of loading and discharge with minimum concentrations occurring during late winter early spring and peak concentrations occurring during the july through september period the c cmean ratio also exhibits greater variability amongst the tributaries in runoff in comparison to the baseflow flow paths fig 12 the mean annual bli bfi and bci results show moderate sensitivity to the use of alternative baseflow separation and hydrologic modeling methods fig 13 the average annual bli 0 67 bfi 0 60 and bci 1 13 calculated for all baseflow separation methods and tributaries are remarkably similar to the average annual bli 0 66 bfi 0 65 and bci 1 14 using the hysep l approach minimum bfi and bli average annual values for all tributaries of 0 4 and 0 5 respectively were found using the l h 3 method additionally the low contributions of discharge and loading under the l h 3 scenario induced peak baseflow chloride concentrations resulting in an average annual tributary bci of 1 26 the highest average annual bfi and bli values for all tributaries were between 0 69 and 0 71 and 0 74 0 75 respectively for the eckhardt hysep f and hysep s separation methods the average annual watershed bfi bli and bci under the bapm method were 0 65 0 74 and 1 14 respectively however the standard deviation in tributary bfi and bli increased from 0 01 to 0 10 and 0 05 to 0 12 respectively when compared to the bapm approach 4 discussion 4 1 reservoir loading the long term increases in watershed and reservoir loading over the 20 year period of study generally reflect in stream chloride concentration trends observed in all tributaries table 1 the 2019 water year was the first studied year in which total watershed born chloride export 14 500 ton yr exceeded the estimated average input from road salting practices 11 200 ton yr fig 6a while any positive trend in long term normalized chloride concentration fig 8a may visually appear weak it is important to consider the dilution impacts from total watershed discharge the comparison between several pairs of temporally distant water years that are near equivalent in total watershed discharge e g water years 2006 2019 2001 2015 and 2008 2018 revealed significant increases in normalized chloride concentration these comparisons are made for a time lag greater than or equal to ten years suggesting that any noticeable tributary chloride accumulation in response to road salt application occurs at a decadal time scale the pmk trend test performed on normalized concentration offers a unique statistical approach to rule out the inherent effect of discharge on concentration fig 8a mann kendall tests are also useful in the study because of the small sample size n 19 years the conditions contributing to any concentration trend in the watershed from 2000 to 2020 are not expected to hold constant for future years therefore trend quantification via a parametric trend test e g linear regression multiple linear regression cannot be extrapolated into the future and were not pursued the reservoir and watershed did not seem to exhibit an immediate response 1 year to road salting practices there is no obvious correlation between tributary chloride loading and winter severity index fig 6b suggesting that the year to year tributary chloride loading is not immediately affected by recently applied road salts normalized chloride concentration fig 8a does not seem to be indicative of watershed chloride export either instead the year to year fluctuation in loading rates are likely governed by interannual hydrologic variability as demonstrated by the strong positive correlation between loading and discharge in fig 8a at a first glance the relatively stagnant watershed born chloride loading fig 6a from 2003 to 2016 reveals no clear trend at all however chloride loading during this period may have been exaggerated by above average discharge conditions from 2005 to 2012 and minimized by below average discharge from 2014 to 2016 if annual watershed discharge was more consistent it is plausible that the loading timeseries could potentially follow a more explicit yet gradual linear trend the decadal response time of the reservoir is in agreement with kelly et al 2007 and shaw et al 2012 whose studies were also based in rural watersheds furthermore the long term average annual chloride mass input via road salts 11 200 ton yr and watershed export 6300 ton yr establishes an annual average chloride retention of 56 as sub surface storage in agreement with howard and haynes 1993 meriano et al 2009 and perera et al 2013 catchment export rates are ultimately governed by the time period for which the mass balance was performed however results from the mass balance alone clearly imply an appreciable amount of applied chloride is entering the underlying groundwater system and foregoing overland drainage processes considering conservation of mass principles and ignoring potential chloride sinks that act to remove chloride from the conceptualized control volume e g bedrock fractures watershed and ultimately reservoir chloride export is expected to approach and sustain steady state equilibrium with road salt inputs unfortunately it is difficult to forecast the future of road salt application in the watershed urban expansion and increased paved surface coverage may lead to elevated road salt application while the demand for road salt usage in response to climate change gutchess et al 2018 and use of alternate deicers may contribute to limiting future anthropogenic chloride pollution known shifts in road salting practices are highlighted by concerted efforts by the massdot to limit salt application this resulted in a reduction from 2001 to 2010 averages of 47 ton lane mi to 2011 2017 averages of 35 7 ton lane mi at the district scale massdot 2017 ultimately continued monitoring of the reservoir and watershed chloride mass balance will be imperative to verifying any claims of steady state conditions however given the slow response of the reservoir system further reduction in road salt application is not likely to be detected in reservoir outflow for at least several more years to decades and is certainly not expected to decrease the withdrawal csmr below the proposed threshold of 0 5 while the dot and towns maintained some form of road salt usage records private maintenance application rates were estimated and are extremely difficult to assess as noted in howard and haynes 1993 private contractors operating on commercial properties hold tremendous liability and are not restricted to any state local road salt regulations therefore it is likely that contributions from private maintenance are underestimated in this study continued increases in watershed chloride export beyond the average chloride contributions from road salt fig 6a could be an indicator of underestimated road salt application in this study with private applications being the most likely source of error the imbalance in reservoir chloride flux prior to water year 2013 fig 6a suggests that a significant inflow load is unaccounted for potential explanations for the discrepancy include unaccounted for chloride inputs from direct groundwater discharge and general hydrologic loading model error another missing source could be current and legacy prior to 1998 septic export 600 ton yr and 50 ton yr respectively but these loads are likely reflected in the tributary contributions moreover none of these sources are expected to account for the 2 000 ton yr discrepancy in load instead a more likely explanation could be poorly calibrated sampling equipment prior to 2013 this would explain why reservoir and tributary loading begin to align in 2013 as opposed to a missing loading source which would present a discrepancy for the entire period of study chloride transport within the reservoir is quick relative to the period of study with a mean hydraulic retention time of approximately 8 months however transport of constituent inputs from the west end of the reservoir to the cosgrove intake can occur in 2 to 15 days jeznach et al 2016 depending on reservoir stratification and other factors 4 2 chloride transport and contribution from baseflow the high fractions of chloride loading attributed to baseflow fig 9a and minor contributions from runoff were present in the majority of reservoir tributaries more importantly average annual bli exceeded 0 7 in the four most heavily loaded tributaries qr sr gb and wb results from previous studies in urban watersheds are significantly lower with baseflow loading contributions ranging from 40 to 48 meriano et al 2009 perera et al 2013 to 61 ostendorf 2013 it is important to note that ostendorf accounts for interflow chloride loading 17 of the total which is the mass flux attributed to the transition time between high discharge stormflow and low discharge baseflow conversely studies in more rural watersheds have assumed a baseflow load index of 0 9 kelly et al 2007 shaw et al 2012 ultimately blis are governed by baseflow hydrology and are not enough to properly evaluate road salt transport tendencies the annual bci per tributary fig 9b offers a unique means for evaluating the road salt transport pathways to surface waters the mean tributary bci of 1 14 and weighted mean of 1 12 suggests that applied road salts infiltrate into the sub surface at a higher rate than they enter overland flow paths in other words the chloride loading attributed to baseflow is not simply proportional to baseflow discharge on average baseflow concentrations are 14 greater than the total concentrations measured in the tributaries this phenomenon likely reflects the rural nature of the watershed the immediate transport to receiving waters via overland flow and drainage infrastructure becoming less likely as the ratio of open pervious land to impervious surface area increases furthermore the watershed is dominated by low traffic roads that may lack drainage infrastructure instead of travelling through culverts and stormwater collection systems the road salts applied are suspected to drain directly into the adjacent pervious predominantly forested surfaces since most chloride mass is gradually delivered through slow moving baseflow bci values largely reflect the impact of road salting practices from prior years and decades therefore apparent decreasing bci trends in the muddy brook quinapoxet river and trout brook fig 10 for the study period may be attributed to increases in land development table s4 of the si and decreased infiltration however it is important to note that the apparent decreasing trends in select tributary bci is not to say that baseflow chloride concentration is decreasing instead the decreasing bci trends approaching a value of 1 suggest that the difference between baseflow and runoff concentration is approaching zero tributary chloride concentration and loading in the watershed continue to increase fig 2b however in the case of the muddy brook quinapoxet river and trout brook baseflow chloride loading is seemingly approaching a one to one proportionality with baseflow discharge the year to year variation in bci however is largely a function of groundwater hydrologic dynamics and somewhat counterintuitively shares a positive correlation with precipitation and streamflow discharge a spike in water year 2010 bci for all tributaries fig 10 may be explained by a preceding series of heavy precipitation years fig 8b that culminated in groundwater saturation these saturated conditions likely prevented additional precipitation from infiltrating to the sub surface thus resulting in additional overland flow decreased bfi resulting from more runoff drive relative sub surface chloride concentrations up similarly a relatively dry 2016 water year fig 8b marked by baseflow dominant streamflow discharge diluted relative sub surface chloride concentrations resulting in a lower bci for water year 2017 there was no correlation between sub basin bci intended to reflect a catchment s general drainage tendencies and impervious surface density ranging from 2 to 20 this is not to say that impervious surface density and tributary bci share no relationship but rather that the few sub basins studied in this analysis are not sufficient to confirm or deny a trend since the watershed is largely rural a sub basin scale assessment of drainage infrastructure would likely be needed to identify any patterns between bci and impervious surface density baseflow chloride signatures may also not represent the total amount of infiltrated road salts as portions of chloride in sub surface storage may seep into fractured bedrock vitale et al 2017 a detailed analysis of underlying bedrock characteristics was not performed in this study but are expected to vary by sub basin 4 3 seasonal variability the seasonal variation in tributary chloride loading fig 11 is again dominated by inter annual hydrologic variability the high chloride loads during the spring march may can be attributed to increased tributary discharge from snowmelt and subsequent elevated baseflow conditions relatively lower loading in january and february compared to december and march is attributed to snow mass that has yet to melt during the summer to early fall months july september monthly chloride loading from runoff 1 of the total annual watershed chloride load was approximately equal to the average chloride load attributed to wet deposition 1 5 of the total annual watershed load this is well within model error but suggests that the chloride loading attributed to runoff during the summer is dominated by wet deposition the concentration trends in fig 12 are inversely proportional to the discharge trends in fig 11 with the exception of a small spike in runoff concentration in february chloride levels are lowest during the late winter and early spring season and highest during the dry summer and early fall months this trend differs from those observed in meriano et al 2009 and perera et al 2013 in which winter road salt applications induced immediate streamflow chloride concentration responses average monthly baseflow chloride concentrations fig 12 also demonstrated less year to year variation than the runoff concentrations which is expected given the exponential range in discharge rates attributed to overland flow the seasonal concentrations shown are only intended to illustrate general trends given that loadest estimates of concentration are subject to a higher degree of error more frequent chloride monitoring would be necessary to produce accurate flow path separated estimates of concentration 4 4 study sensitivity baseflow dominated chloride loading and transport within the reservoir watershed held true under the various baseflow separation and hydrologic modeling methods fig 13 a range of bfis resulted from the eight different hydrograph separation techniques as observed in eckhardt 2008 and partington et al 2012 and were positively and negatively correlated with bli and bci respectively of all baseflow separation methods l h 3 induced the most severe reduction in baseflow discharge and loading this is a result of the technique s filtering method that attributes the greatest proportion of high frequency hydrograph signals to direct overland flow therefore bci levels are likely exaggerated under l h 3 given that only the highest chloride concentration data remain for baseflow assignment as was the case with bfi tributary bli and bci results under the hysep l scenario remain a compromise between loading extremes from the alternate baseflow approaches tested there is no reason to assume that baseflow discharge in the watershed is best represented by the study sensitivity extremes e g results from the l h 3 or eckhardt methods therefore hysep l is considered the most appropriate choice for this study the baseflow discharge and loading rates estimated using the bapm approach did not exhibit the variance expected for the range of sub basin areas studied all tributary hydrographs excluding the quinapoxet river and portions of the gates brook under bapm are proportionally identical to the stillwater river and therefore share equivalents times of concentration to the 80 km2 tributary this resulted in far less variability in baseflow index and the ensuing bli and bci metrics discharge estimation under the gr4j method generally produced flashier hydrographs as noted by drastic decreases in bfi for smaller tributaries such as the west boylston brook and muddy brook given that results for the four major contributing tributaries are largely unaffected the bapm technique remains an appropriate method as employed in previous reservoir water quality and hydrodynamic modeling studies ahlfeld et al 2003 jeznach et al 2016 however since chloride loading rates are analyzed by sub basin and separated by flow path the gr4j is the preferred method for this study 5 conclusions chloride loading into the wachusett reservoir is dominated by inputs from road salting practices since 2000 chloride mass balances reveal that the 2019 water year marked the first instance when watershed export reached a level similar to the long term average road salt input statistically based load estimation methods reveal that road salts are preferentially transported into the sub surface with approximately 74 of the watershed chloride export delivered via baseflow the rural nature of the watershed and predominantly low impervious surface coverage act to delay chloride mass transport from initial application to reservoir inflow it is likely that it will take several years to decades for reservoir water quality to respond to reductions in road salt application however future reservoir chloride concentrations are difficult to predict urban expansion may lead to a greater demand for road salt while application control use of alternative deicers and the potential for a warming climate may decrease its usage greater boston water supply management authorities concerned with chloride pollution should continue to monitor the chloride trends in the reservoir and watershed while daily sampling is not required for this analysis the loading regressions presented do rely on consistent measurements that capture chloride concentrations representative of both runoff and baseflow the study is also limited to chloride load estimation more advanced techniques would be required to accurately estimate chloride concentration in the reservoir s surrounding tributaries future road salt studies are planned for the watershed and a number of enhancements to water quality monitoring in the region are in place further study could seek to improve

4054,chloride exports from the widespread application of road salt serve as a primary contribution to water body salinity in cold climate regions road salt pollution is a concern in drinking water supplies due to the relationship between chloride concentration and water corrosivity in the northeastern u s researchers and water quality managers are interested in better understanding how management practices can mitigate the negative effects of road salt pollution this study uses regression based chloride load estimates from loadest to produce mass balances and analyze transport flow paths to the wachusett reservoir from a predominantly rural watershed a chloride mass balance for 2000 through 2019 revealed that reservoir and watershed export only recently reached a level similar to estimated inputs from road salt 11 200 ton yr results from hydrograph and load separation techniques show that average loading 4300 1300 ton yr and discharge from baseflow 3 2 0 9 m3 s contributed approximately 74 and 65 of the total loading 5800 1800 ton yr and discharge 4 93 1 50 m3 s respectively from water years 2001 through 2019 approximately 40 of the total annual tributary load 30 baseflow 10 runoff occurred in the spring march may and is attributed to elevated baseflow conditions from snowmelt as indicated by a baseflow chloride index baseflow concentrations are 14 greater than the total concentrations measured in the tributaries therefore the baseflow dominated tributary chloride loading is due to a combination of greater discharge and chloride concentration in baseflow as compared to direct surface runoff however a long term trend analysis suggests a slightly increased fraction of chloride loading via overland flow in several reservoir tributaries potentially indicative of late 20th century land development this study offers a unique monitoring approach for management authorities to better assess road salt pollution in water systems the decadal response of the reservoir system reflects the slow moving nature of the baseflow dominated chloride loading and suggests that measurable water quality improvements will only be realized with a sustained long term decrease in the amount of road salt applied keywords drinking water road salt chloride constituent loading mass balance baseflow 1 introduction road salt application for pavement deicing purposes is a standard practice in cold climate regions widespread use of roadway deicers in the u s originated during the 1940s kelly et al 2010 with rock salt nacl being the most common due to its low cost effective dispersion properties and ease of storage ramakrishna and viraraghavan 2005 road salt induced freshwater salinization was first recognized in the late 1960s and ear1y 1970s hutchinson and olson 1967 judd 1970 followed by observations of road salt contamination in rivers dailey et al 2014 godwin et al 2003 streams kelly et al 2007 moore et al 2019 trowbridge et al 2010 lakes likens and buso 2010 novotny et al 2008 and groundwaters howard and haynes 1993 huling and hollocher 1972 meriano et al 2009 perera et al 2013 other potential sources of chloride include the natural weathering of rocks atmospheric deposition agricultural fertilizers chemical and food production seawater intrusion water softening and wastewater and septic system effluent novotny et al 2009 panno et al 2006 however chloride inputs are often dominated by road salting in regions where they are applied moore et al 2019 concerns over surface and sub surface water quality impairment due to road salting practices are ever mounting in lakes and reservoirs elevated chloride concentrations the preferred environmental tracer due to its highly conservative nature from deicers have been shown to alter density gradients and mixing dynamics such that periods of complete mixing in lakes are either delayed or exhibit perennial meromixis i e permanent stratification bubeck and burton 1989 sibert et al 2015 wyman and koretsky 2018 as an indirect consequence of meromixis water bodies may exhibit severe states of hypolimnetic anoxia judd et al 2005 enhanced eutrophication koretsky et al 2012 novotny and stefan 2012 and trophic structure disruption hintz et al 2017 at smaller scales vernal pool breeding amphibians have exhibited a heightened sensitivity to dissolved chloride collins and russell 2009 karraker et al 2008 whereas native plant communities may become displaced by invasive salt tolerant vegetation richburg et al 2001 wilcox 1986 these water quality concerns were reported for chloride concentrations typically exceeding the u s environmental protection agency epa chronic four day average once every three years aquatic toxicity criteria of 230 mg l or near the acute one hour average once every three years toxicity of 860 mg l the u s epa secondary standard for chloride in drinking water is 250 mg l based on taste studies have shown that increasing concentrations of lead and copper in drinking water systems a result of corroded distribution infrastructure are positively correlated with increases in the chloride to sulfate mass ratio csmr and larson ratio edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 lytle et al 2005 ng and lin 2016 stets et al 2018 while sulfate lead interactions have been shown to form beneficial precipitates chloride lead reactions may introduce harmful soluble complexes into drinking water systems nguyen et al 2011 in particular the drastic change in csmr observed during the flint michigan water crisis has been cited as a possible contributor along with the elimination of phosphate based corrosion control to subsequent corrosion masten et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 pieper et al 2018 large surface water bodies often benefit from diluted pollutant levels and are more likely to have low chloride concentrations 100 mg l however an elevated csmr may still occur due to perennially low sulfate levels potentially driving higher water corrosivity given the inability of most conventional water treatment practices to remove dissolved chloride alternative chloride control measures are important for mitigating the effects of road salt pollution chloride from rock salts is conservatively transported to receiving waters via quick hours to days overland flow as runoff or via slow months to decades sub surface groundwater as baseflow ostendorf and kilbridge 2011 sanford and pope 2013 starn and belitz 2018 interflow or subsurface stormflow through the vadose zone also occurs with times of concentration between those of runoff and baseflow dunne and black 1970 whipkey 1965 however interflow was not explicitly analyzed in this study rates of catchment chloride export can be estimated using comprehensive mass balance approaches and compared to road salt application rates to determine site specific changes in groundwater storage of chloride howard and haynes 1993 huling and hollocher 1972 perera et al 2013 riverine chloride loads are calculated as the product of volumetric discharge and chloride concentration integrated over a specified time period tributary loading disaggregated into components of baseflow and runoff is more difficult to calculate and requires timeseries of discharge and concentration representative of baseflow and or runoff conditions baseflow loading may be derived from dry period assumptions howard and haynes 1993 directly measured with groundwater sampling meriano et al 2009 or estimated with regression based modeling approaches cohn et al 1989 cohn et al 1992 the latter is a suitable option when conditional baseflow assumptions are not appropriate year round and reliable groundwater data are not available the united states geologic survey usgs program load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 is a commonly employed statistically based water constituent load estimation method and relates log transformed load to functions of streamflow and decimal time given that raw water quality constituents are rarely measured with high frequency typically occurring weekly twice a month or at longer intervals regression models may offer an accurate approach to estimate constituent loading between known measurements pellerin et al 2014 constituents assessed using loadest models include nitrogen jha et al 2007 schilling and zhang 2004 phosphorus chen et al 2015 suspended solids duan et al 2013 and total dissolved solids tds shope and angeroth 2015 moreover separate baseflow loading regression models are considered in schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 and he et al 2020 the goal of this study is to quantify the impacts of road salting practices on chloride loading in a predominantly rural watershed for a drinking water supply reservoir the wachusett reservoir in massachusetts u s the study site benefits from a rich history of research ahlfeld et al 2003 hagemann and park 2014 jeznach et al 2016 and long term data availability the primary objectives of this study are 1 perform a reservoir system chloride mass balance over a decadal period of study 2000 through 2019 and 2 determine the primary chloride transport pathways from source to surface water additionally loading model output sensitivies to several baseflow separation techniques and one alternate hydrologic model are addressed this study introduces a baseflow chloride index akin to the baseflow enrichment ratio in schilling and zhang 2004 in a novel application to road salt analysis the index quantifies baseflow chloride concentration relative to in stream measurements and is used to infer chloride transport pathways in the watershed the use of chloride loading regressions circumvent the need for daily water quality monitoring a major obstacle in long term road salt analysis furthermore the study site serves as the drinking water supply for a large metropolitan area boston few studies have assessed the impacts of road salting practices on drinking water reservoir systems nimiroski and waldron 2002 ostendorf 2013 and none that we are aware of have done so over a long term study period finally this study offers a simple and reproducible approach for water resource management authorities to identify and monitor watershed chloride trends first a discussion of the models and data processing techniques used in this study is provided then the mass balance and load separation results are presented followed by a discussion on implications for the reservoir watershed 2 methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 water supply system the wachusett reservoir located in worcester county is the major source of potable water for the greater boston metropolitan area the two primary agencies that monitor and manage the reservoir are the massachusetts department of conservation and recreation dcr division of water supply protection and the massachusetts water resources authority mwra the wachusett reservoir remains an unfiltered surface water supply reflecting its high quality however issues pertaining to water corrosivity are a concern in 1996 a treatment process change from the addition of sodium hydroxide to the addition of sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide for improved corrosion control helped decrease lead concentrations typically to below the u s epa action level of 15 ppb karalekas jr et al 1983 management authorities continue to monitor water corrosivity and over the past two decades have noted rising chloride concentrations in cosgrove intake withdrawals from the wachusett reservoir fig 1 2 1 2 study site the wachusett reservoir is a dimictic surface water located approximately 10 km northeast of worcester ma the 16 3 km2 water body receives an average annual precipitation and snowfall of 1 260 mm and 1 960 mm respectively over a predominantly rural 87 287 km2 watershed area the wachusett reservoir is fed by periodic transfers from the much larger quabbin reservoir located approximately 50 km to the west and ten tributaries monitored by the dcr located to the north west and south of the reservoir fig 2 a chloride concentration trends converted from measured specific conductivity as discussed in section 2 2 2 for each of the ten monitored tributaries are shown in fig 2b the watershed delineation was performed and provided by the dcr additionally a 26 km2 area borders the reservoir shoreline referred to as direct entry providing direct inflow without entering a monitored tributary water withdrawn from the wachusett is conveyed to the carroll water treatment plant in marlborough massachusetts approximately 13 km southeast of the cosgrove intake selected watershed characteristics by tributary are summarized in table 1 with timeseries averaged tributary chloride concentrations showing a direct correlation to impervious surface and paved surface density fig 3 land cover within the watershed derived from the land cover land use 2016 dataset in table 2 is primarily forest forested wetland 74 developed open space 6 4 and impervious surface 5 3 40 of the impervious surface coverage is attributed to right of way two thirds of residential land use is located in forests or forested wetlands and are dominated by single family units 85 of all residential land use land development has continued to increase since the 1970s statistics provided in table s4 of the supporting information or si and are marked by increases in residential density and the completion of u s interstate route 190 i 190 during the same period the mwra and dcr have continued to purchase land within the watershed the watershed primarily consists of thin till that typically dominates the surficial geologic composition at higher elevations glacial meltwater deposits occupy the lower elevations and are overlain by swamp deposits near the streambeds fig 4 the bedrock of the region consists mainly of calcpelite granite and metamorphic formations a comprehensive review of the geology in the wachusett reservoir region is provided in chapter h of hatch jr 1991 geographical information systems gis software coupled with publicly available massgis data table 2 were used for all spatial analysis in this study unless noted otherwise 2 2 loadest model development loadest regression models were used to estimate daily tributary chloride loading which relate log transformed load l to functions of centered streamflow q and or centered decimal time t the explanatory variables are centered to avoid multicollinearity during regression cohn et al 1992 loadest model coefficients were calibrated to observed loads computed with measurements of discharge and concentration using adjusted maximum likelihood estimation an approach that accounts for censored data subject to a normality of residuals assumption runkel et al 2004 while ai based water quality modeling is growing in popularity alizadeh et al 2018 ha et al 2020 tiyasha et al 2020 zhou 2020 loadest was an attractive option for its simplicity and ease of use from a practical standpoint this ease of use is key for management agencies interested in adapting the methods stated herein loadest regression models for total streamflow and baseflow were developed for each of the ten tributaries using the full 20 year period of study the r package rloadest https github com usgs r rloadest was used as a substitute for the original loadest program the following sections detail the methods used for both total and baseflow model construction 2 2 1 hydrologic modeling and hydrograph separation total tributary discharge timeseries were either obtained from usgs gaging stations or estimated using a simple rainfall runoff model the quinapoxet river and stillwater river daily discharge observations were provided by usgs gages for the entire period of study gaged discharge for the gates brook was available starting in october of 2011 daily discharge estimates for the remaining seven minor tributaries and for the gates brook prior to the stream gage installation were calculated using the simple gr4j rainfall runoff hydrologic model perrin et al 2003 coupled with the cemaneige snow accounting routine valéry et al 2014 using the airgr package in r coron et al 2017 the models were calibrated to sets of available weekly and or daily discharge data collected intermittently over the full period of study for each tributary a rainfall runoff modeling approach was primarily chosen for this study given its simplicity the gr4j model using only four parameters provides a simpler approach compared to more complex rainfall runoff models such as the soil and water assessment tool hillslope hoang et al 2017 while developed and widely used in europe gr4j has had numerous applications in u s based studies as well oudin et al 2018 papacharalampous et al 2019 salavati et al 2015 an alternative approach to discharge estimation tobiason et al 2002 was incorporated into the loading models for a sensitivity analysis in this approach which will be referred to as the basin area partitioning method bapm discharge is calculated based on the daily watershed yield of the stillwater river and sub basin area of interest as shown in eq 1 1 q t r i b i q s t i l l w a t e r i a r e a t r i b a r e a s t i l l w a t e r where q is discharge m3 s and i is a daily timestep performance metrics for hydrologic models using both methods are included in table s3 of the si the bapm has served as the primary method of ungaged discharge estimation in the watershed jeznach et al 2016 while an effective approach to approximating ungaged flow it has an obvious limitation in that it assumes an equal time of concentration between the stillwater river and the modeled tributary of interest therefore bapm was not employed as the primary hydrologic model for this study further analysis of the differences between the two approaches is provided in the discussion several analytical methods for separating tributary hydrographs into components of baseflow and runoff were considered and include the usgs hydrograph separation hysep program from sloto and crouse 1996 the streamflow partitioning part program from rutledge 1998 and digital separation filters from lyne and hollick 1979 and eckhardt 2005 alternatively mass balance approaches offer a more physically based approach to separate baseflow from runoff stewart et al 2007 but rely on concurrent discharge and concentration measurements that were not available for this study the mass balance methods also operate under the assumption of a constant tracer concentration e g chloride which is violated in nearly all reservoir tributaries fig 2b the lyne and hollick l h one parameter digital recursive filter is derived from signal processing theory and attributes the low frequency component of streamflow to baseflow the l h filter was employed in this study using the r package ecohydrology fuka et al 2014 with a filter parameter of 0 925 as proposed by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and several filter passes one two and three that govern the degree of smoothing the two parameter eckhardt filter assumes that aquifer discharge is linearly proportional to its storage and introduces the concept of a maximum achievable baseflow index bfi where bfi is the ratio of baseflow volume to total discharge volume for a specified long term time period the inclusion of a maximum bfi assumed equal to 0 8 for this study as per eckhardt 2005 allows for the attribution of a non negligible low frequency component of streamflow to runoff as noted by spongberg 2000 the eckhardt baseflow separation was calculated using the r package flowscreen dierauer and whitfield 2017 the hysep and part programs using the usgs r package dvstats https github com usgs r dvstats rely upon linear interpolations between a subset of discharge measurements that are assumed equal to baseflow the hysep program includes three separation algorithms fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum to systematically differentiate between baseflow and runoff details of each method are provided in sloto and crouse 1996 as originally developed by pettyjohn and henning 1979 the part program uses an antecedent recession requirement to develop the initial subset of discharge data attributed to baseflow streamflow separation is a function of catchment area in both the hysep and part programs the bfi calculated for the period 10 2011 12 2019 for each of the eight different methods table 3 reveal the range of potential baseflow timeseries for load estimation the 2011 2019 timeframe represents the period of record for which all three usgs gages were in simultaneous operation the numbers following the l h designation refer to the number of filter passes the letters following the hysep designation refer to the program s baseflow separation method local minimum l fixed interval f and sliding interval s ultimately the hysep l local minimum method was chosen for this analysis given its application in new england based studies hodgkins and dudley 2011 and that the resultant mean bfi 0 68 most closely represents an average of the available methods 0 685 the local minimum method utilizes a linear interpolation between the lowest flows of a hydrograph within a set of calculated intervals that depend on catchment area the uncertainty in baseflow quantification for various techniques is noted zhu et al 2019 table 3 shows that for any method baseflow comprises a significant portion of total streamflow in the watershed therefore loadest regression sensitivities calculated as the change in result relative to output derived from the gr4j and hysep l approaches to the various hydrologic modeling and baseflow separation methods are evaluated in this study 2 2 2 concentration separation grab sample based measurements conducted by the dcr two to four times per month of specific conductivity µs cm were used to develop separate timeseries for total and baseflow chloride concentrations chloride measurements for all ten monitored tributaries were available for a brief period between january 2018 and january 2019 the regular measurements of specific conductivity sc were converted to chloride cl in mg l using a linear regression eq 2 r2 0 996 the linear regression was based on 23 data points from all tributaries on days when both sc and chloride were measured chloride samples collected by the dcr were sent to mwra central lab at deer island boston ma and analyzed using epa method 300 0 pfaff 1996 it was assumed that baseflow chloride concentration equaled total chloride the chloride level calculated from measured sc for days when baseflow exceeded 90 or more of the total streamflow schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 a threshold deemed appropriate for returning a large enough baseflow chloride sample size the relationship between chloride and sc is shown in fig s1 of the si 2 c l m g l 1 11 16 0 267 s c μ s c m 1 2 2 3 model selection the optimum loadest regression equation from a suite of nine pre defined formulas was automatically selected for each tributary based on the minimum calculated akaike information criterion aic statistic as per runkel et al 2004 schwarz posterior probability criterion sppc statistics were also calculated during the model selection process but were not factored into the optimum model selection the performance of each model presented in tables s1 and s2 of the si section was assessed by its coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 load bias percentage bp and an analysis of model residuals as recommended in runkel et al 2004 the optimum regression formulas as determined by loadest are summarized in table 4 all tributary chloride loads were estimated using model number 9 with the exception of the total model 8 and baseflow model 7 stillwater river loadest regressions a general nomenclature defining the various variables metrics and models used throughout the study is provided in table 5 2 3 mass balance sub basin scale chloride mass budgets were developed by balancing inputs from road salts with exports from tributary loading nacl inputs for each sub basin were estimated by multiplying specific application rates expressed as ton lane mi per year for the massachusetts department of transportation massdot local cities towns and private maintenance e g parking lots by their respective lane mile coverage the massdot roads layer table 2 was used to estimate lane mile coverage per sub basin and roadway jurisdiction massdot or city town estimates of privately maintained paved surfaces were developed by removing all rooftop surface areas building structures dataset from the intersection of impervious surface area with commercial or multi family residential land use area the resultant area was converted to lane miles assuming a uniform 3 7 meter lane width an average road salt application rate of 42 3 ton lane mi for dot maintained roads was used drawn from the 2017 environmental status planning report for district 3 massdot 2017 estimated average annual mass inputs of road salt into the watershed by town were provided by the dcr and equally allocated into each intersecting sub basin on a percentage lane mile basis roadway coverage outside cities towns that reported data received an application rate of 28 6 ton lane mi equal to the average city town rate weighted by total years of available data from the dcr privately maintained paved surfaces also received an application rate equal to the city town rate of 28 6 ton lane mi chloride load leaving the reservoir was calculated as the product of measured raw water chloride concentration at the carroll water treatment plant and gaged reservoir withdrawals releases for the mass balance total tributary chloride export for the quinapoxet river qr stillwater river sr and gates brook gb were estimated from usgs gages when data were available instead of relying on loadest derived output estimates for the direct entry de catchment were derived from a flow weighted average of chloride concentration in the adjacent minor tributaries multiplied by discharge estimated from the bapm approach gr4j was not chosen to simulate direct entry due to the absence of observed data to calibrate to the remaining tributary fb mgb mab mub tb wb and wbb contributions reflect loadest output and are combined into the mt minor tributaries designation with the exception of the waushacum brook wb which represents itself the final quinapoxet river load was multiplied by the ratio of the total quinapoxet river sub basin area to its gaged area equivalent to an increase of 8 7 to account for additional mass input downstream of the monitoring station other sources of chloride considered in this study include septic system effluent and wet deposition chloride inputs from human excretion and domestic waste products are estimated as 12 4 kg per person per year and four people per septic parcel kelly et al 2007 historic septic system data temporal and spatial by parcel were provided by the dcr wet deposition loads were calculated as the product of daily precipitation reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa at worcester regional airport and atmospheric chloride concentration measured at the quabbin reservoir and reported by the national atmospheric deposition program nadp there is no wastewater discharged from treatment facilities within the reservoir watershed chloride contributions from the underlying geology primarily metamorphic and igneous rock were considered negligible for this study as per granato et al 2015 3 results 3 1 mass balance the estimated mean annual chloride input from road salting practices was approximately 11 200 ton yr disaggregation by sub basin shown in fig 5 from 2000 through 2019 total lane mi coverage by the massdot cities towns and private practices were 82 498 and 182 respectively the quinapoxet river and gates brook catchments account for 132 of the 182 lane miles estimated to receive road salt application from private practices these higher rates are attributed to the more densely populated town centers of holden and west boylston 52 of the 82 lane miles in the watershed under massdot jurisdiction are within the quinapoxet river i 190 route 122a waushacum brook i 190 route 12 and the direct entry routes 12 110 and 70 basins reservoir input chloride loads varied between 4 100 ton yr and 11 000 ton yr for water years 2001 to 2018 fig 6 a reaching 14 500 ton yr in 2019 the average input from road salts and annual reservoir chloride export via the cosgrove intake withdrawal and downstream releases to the nashua river reflect the chloride inputs and outputs to the entire reservoir system control volume outflowing reservoir chloride load was largely in equilibrium with inflowing load from water years 2013 through 2019 but exceeded inflow loads by approximately 2 000 ton yr on average from 2001 through 2012 water years defined as the period from october 1 through september 30 are used to ensure that the winter salting season is not split into two calendar years the winter severity index wsi presented in fig 6b is intended to highlight the potential for variation in year to year road salt usage in the absence of road salt application timeseries data the wsi is useful for identifying periods where usage may have been high or low the metric ranges from 50 least severe to 50 most severe and is based solely on daily temperature and snowfall analyzed over a period from november through march of any given water year the wsi has shown to correlate strongly with road salt usage at a state wide scale massdot 2017 there were not enough yearly data published to determine if a correlation exists between road salt application and wsi in this study region district 3 central massachusetts of the seven years of available data no clear correlation was observed a formula and more detailed description of the wsi is provided on page two of the si chloride loads entering the reservoir did not always scale with inflow as shown in fig 7 imported chloride loads via the quabbin transfer qt contribute on average 20 of the total reservoir chloride input the qt provides 46 of the annual average inflow at very low chloride concentrations 7 mg l direct precipitation onto the reservoir surface p delivered 5 of the average annual inflow but 1 of the average annual chloride load together the quinapoxet river stillwater river gates brook and waushacum brook constitute 65 of the total chloride load entering the reservoir and 80 of the load originating from the watershed the long term trends in tributary discharge load and concentration are compared in fig 8 a juxtaposed with annual precipitation at worcester regional airport fig 8b the 20 year mean for watershed discharge expressed as a yearly volume and load are 155 106 m3 and 5 800 ton yr respectively each data point depicts the discharge and load normalized by these averages the concentration data represent a watershed scale normalized metric of chloride i e concentration aggregated for all sampled tributaries average annual chloride levels were normalized to the 20 year mean chloride concentration for each tributary the concentration data shown represent the mean and standard deviation for normalized concentration for all tributaries these data were then scaled by average annual tributary loading rates with the quinapoxet river receiving the highest weight given that it contributes the largest proportion of watershed born chloride load to the reservoir fig 7 a partial mann kendall pmk trend test libiseller and grimvall 2002 performed on the averaged concentration data from fig 8a yielded a statistically significant increasing trend despite the inclusion of average discharge as a covariate discharge and loading contributions from the quabbin transfer are not representative of the wachusett watershed and therefore ignored in fig 8a other sources of chloride within the watershed were considered but not shown given their low contributions when compared to tributary chloride loads chloride inputs from septic effluent prior to 1997 were 600 ton yr yet decreased to 240 ton yr in 1998 and further declined to 50 ton yr in 2019 as the surrounding towns gradually introduced sanitary sewers chloride loads from wet deposition were 0 373 tons per km2 per year or approximately 100 ton yr for the entire watershed 3 2 chloride load separation an annual baseflow load index bli defined as the yearly fraction of total load attributed to baseflow by tributary for water years 2001 through 2019 is shown in fig 9 a mean 0 66 and median 0 70 annual blis were computed for the ten modeled tributaries over the full period of study however on average 74 of the total annual chloride load from the watershed was delivered through baseflow due to increased loading from the quinapoxet river stillwater river gates brook and waushacum brook the average annual bli per tributary ranged from 0 43 muddy brook to 0 79 stillwater river and malden brook a baseflow chloride index bci in the manner of schilling and zhang s 2004 baseflow enrichment ratio ber is introduced in this study the bci formula eq 3 represents the ratio of the bli to the bfi for any given year it is effectively the ratio of baseflow concentration to total tributary concentration and is useful in quantifying the allocation of chloride concentration between baseflow and runoff bci values equal to 1 indicate uniform concentrations for all flow paths bci values greater than 1 indicate that baseflow concentration exceeds runoff concentration furthermore baseflow concentration may be calculated by multiplying the bci by total tributary concentration the average annual bci distributions by tributary fig 9b ranged from 1 05 french brook to 1 32 malagasco brook with a mean value of 1 14 considering a weighted average based on total chloride loading per tributary the mean bci was 1 12 3 b c i b l i b f i pmk trend tests were conducted for all tributary bcis with bfi as the covariate for water years 2001 through 2019 and yielded statistically significant p 0 001 decreasing trends pmk test statistic z 0 in the quinapoxet river muddy brook and trout brook fig 10 a uniform increase in bci occurred during water year 2010 the removal of water year 2001 bcis did not affect the statistical significance of trend tests for the quinapoxet river muddy brook and trout brook trend tests for the remaining tributaries all yielded statistically insignificant p 0 05 results the monthly variability of tributary chloride loading discharge and concentration separated by flow path is shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively baseflow and runoff monthly chloride loading peaked in the spring march may contributing 30 and 10 of the total mean annual load respectively lower chloride loading rates occurred during july september when baseflow and runoff loading accounted for 4 and 1 of the mean annual load respectively per month monthly discharge followed a similar pattern to chloride loading fig 11 but exhibited more pronounced peaks and valleys for runoff and baseflow respectively the trends in normalized tributary chloride concentration are reversed from those of loading and discharge with minimum concentrations occurring during late winter early spring and peak concentrations occurring during the july through september period the c cmean ratio also exhibits greater variability amongst the tributaries in runoff in comparison to the baseflow flow paths fig 12 the mean annual bli bfi and bci results show moderate sensitivity to the use of alternative baseflow separation and hydrologic modeling methods fig 13 the average annual bli 0 67 bfi 0 60 and bci 1 13 calculated for all baseflow separation methods and tributaries are remarkably similar to the average annual bli 0 66 bfi 0 65 and bci 1 14 using the hysep l approach minimum bfi and bli average annual values for all tributaries of 0 4 and 0 5 respectively were found using the l h 3 method additionally the low contributions of discharge and loading under the l h 3 scenario induced peak baseflow chloride concentrations resulting in an average annual tributary bci of 1 26 the highest average annual bfi and bli values for all tributaries were between 0 69 and 0 71 and 0 74 0 75 respectively for the eckhardt hysep f and hysep s separation methods the average annual watershed bfi bli and bci under the bapm method were 0 65 0 74 and 1 14 respectively however the standard deviation in tributary bfi and bli increased from 0 01 to 0 10 and 0 05 to 0 12 respectively when compared to the bapm approach 4 discussion 4 1 reservoir loading the long term increases in watershed and reservoir loading over the 20 year period of study generally reflect in stream chloride concentration trends observed in all tributaries table 1 the 2019 water year was the first studied year in which total watershed born chloride export 14 500 ton yr exceeded the estimated average input from road salting practices 11 200 ton yr fig 6a while any positive trend in long term normalized chloride concentration fig 8a may visually appear weak it is important to consider the dilution impacts from total watershed discharge the comparison between several pairs of temporally distant water years that are near equivalent in total watershed discharge e g water years 2006 2019 2001 2015 and 2008 2018 revealed significant increases in normalized chloride concentration these comparisons are made for a time lag greater than or equal to ten years suggesting that any noticeable tributary chloride accumulation in response to road salt application occurs at a decadal time scale the pmk trend test performed on normalized concentration offers a unique statistical approach to rule out the inherent effect of discharge on concentration fig 8a mann kendall tests are also useful in the study because of the small sample size n 19 years the conditions contributing to any concentration trend in the watershed from 2000 to 2020 are not expected to hold constant for future years therefore trend quantification via a parametric trend test e g linear regression multiple linear regression cannot be extrapolated into the future and were not pursued the reservoir and watershed did not seem to exhibit an immediate response 1 year to road salting practices there is no obvious correlation between tributary chloride loading and winter severity index fig 6b suggesting that the year to year tributary chloride loading is not immediately affected by recently applied road salts normalized chloride concentration fig 8a does not seem to be indicative of watershed chloride export either instead the year to year fluctuation in loading rates are likely governed by interannual hydrologic variability as demonstrated by the strong positive correlation between loading and discharge in fig 8a at a first glance the relatively stagnant watershed born chloride loading fig 6a from 2003 to 2016 reveals no clear trend at all however chloride loading during this period may have been exaggerated by above average discharge conditions from 2005 to 2012 and minimized by below average discharge from 2014 to 2016 if annual watershed discharge was more consistent it is plausible that the loading timeseries could potentially follow a more explicit yet gradual linear trend the decadal response time of the reservoir is in agreement with kelly et al 2007 and shaw et al 2012 whose studies were also based in rural watersheds furthermore the long term average annual chloride mass input via road salts 11 200 ton yr and watershed export 6300 ton yr establishes an annual average chloride retention of 56 as sub surface storage in agreement with howard and haynes 1993 meriano et al 2009 and perera et al 2013 catchment export rates are ultimately governed by the time period for which the mass balance was performed however results from the mass balance alone clearly imply an appreciable amount of applied chloride is entering the underlying groundwater system and foregoing overland drainage processes considering conservation of mass principles and ignoring potential chloride sinks that act to remove chloride from the conceptualized control volume e g bedrock fractures watershed and ultimately reservoir chloride export is expected to approach and sustain steady state equilibrium with road salt inputs unfortunately it is difficult to forecast the future of road salt application in the watershed urban expansion and increased paved surface coverage may lead to elevated road salt application while the demand for road salt usage in response to climate change gutchess et al 2018 and use of alternate deicers may contribute to limiting future anthropogenic chloride pollution known shifts in road salting practices are highlighted by concerted efforts by the massdot to limit salt application this resulted in a reduction from 2001 to 2010 averages of 47 ton lane mi to 2011 2017 averages of 35 7 ton lane mi at the district scale massdot 2017 ultimately continued monitoring of the reservoir and watershed chloride mass balance will be imperative to verifying any claims of steady state conditions however given the slow response of the reservoir system further reduction in road salt application is not likely to be detected in reservoir outflow for at least several more years to decades and is certainly not expected to decrease the withdrawal csmr below the proposed threshold of 0 5 while the dot and towns maintained some form of road salt usage records private maintenance application rates were estimated and are extremely difficult to assess as noted in howard and haynes 1993 private contractors operating on commercial properties hold tremendous liability and are not restricted to any state local road salt regulations therefore it is likely that contributions from private maintenance are underestimated in this study continued increases in watershed chloride export beyond the average chloride contributions from road salt fig 6a could be an indicator of underestimated road salt application in this study with private applications being the most likely source of error the imbalance in reservoir chloride flux prior to water year 2013 fig 6a suggests that a significant inflow load is unaccounted for potential explanations for the discrepancy include unaccounted for chloride inputs from direct groundwater discharge and general hydrologic loading model error another missing source could be current and legacy prior to 1998 septic export 600 ton yr and 50 ton yr respectively but these loads are likely reflected in the tributary contributions moreover none of these sources are expected to account for the 2 000 ton yr discrepancy in load instead a more likely explanation could be poorly calibrated sampling equipment prior to 2013 this would explain why reservoir and tributary loading begin to align in 2013 as opposed to a missing loading source which would present a discrepancy for the entire period of study chloride transport within the reservoir is quick relative to the period of study with a mean hydraulic retention time of approximately 8 months however transport of constituent inputs from the west end of the reservoir to the cosgrove intake can occur in 2 to 15 days jeznach et al 2016 depending on reservoir stratification and other factors 4 2 chloride transport and contribution from baseflow the high fractions of chloride loading attributed to baseflow fig 9a and minor contributions from runoff were present in the majority of reservoir tributaries more importantly average annual bli exceeded 0 7 in the four most heavily loaded tributaries qr sr gb and wb results from previous studies in urban watersheds are significantly lower with baseflow loading contributions ranging from 40 to 48 meriano et al 2009 perera et al 2013 to 61 ostendorf 2013 it is important to note that ostendorf accounts for interflow chloride loading 17 of the total which is the mass flux attributed to the transition time between high discharge stormflow and low discharge baseflow conversely studies in more rural watersheds have assumed a baseflow load index of 0 9 kelly et al 2007 shaw et al 2012 ultimately blis are governed by baseflow hydrology and are not enough to properly evaluate road salt transport tendencies the annual bci per tributary fig 9b offers a unique means for evaluating the road salt transport pathways to surface waters the mean tributary bci of 1 14 and weighted mean of 1 12 suggests that applied road salts infiltrate into the sub surface at a higher rate than they enter overland flow paths in other words the chloride loading attributed to baseflow is not simply proportional to baseflow discharge on average baseflow concentrations are 14 greater than the total concentrations measured in the tributaries this phenomenon likely reflects the rural nature of the watershed the immediate transport to receiving waters via overland flow and drainage infrastructure becoming less likely as the ratio of open pervious land to impervious surface area increases furthermore the watershed is dominated by low traffic roads that may lack drainage infrastructure instead of travelling through culverts and stormwater collection systems the road salts applied are suspected to drain directly into the adjacent pervious predominantly forested surfaces since most chloride mass is gradually delivered through slow moving baseflow bci values largely reflect the impact of road salting practices from prior years and decades therefore apparent decreasing bci trends in the muddy brook quinapoxet river and trout brook fig 10 for the study period may be attributed to increases in land development table s4 of the si and decreased infiltration however it is important to note that the apparent decreasing trends in select tributary bci is not to say that baseflow chloride concentration is decreasing instead the decreasing bci trends approaching a value of 1 suggest that the difference between baseflow and runoff concentration is approaching zero tributary chloride concentration and loading in the watershed continue to increase fig 2b however in the case of the muddy brook quinapoxet river and trout brook baseflow chloride loading is seemingly approaching a one to one proportionality with baseflow discharge the year to year variation in bci however is largely a function of groundwater hydrologic dynamics and somewhat counterintuitively shares a positive correlation with precipitation and streamflow discharge a spike in water year 2010 bci for all tributaries fig 10 may be explained by a preceding series of heavy precipitation years fig 8b that culminated in groundwater saturation these saturated conditions likely prevented additional precipitation from infiltrating to the sub surface thus resulting in additional overland flow decreased bfi resulting from more runoff drive relative sub surface chloride concentrations up similarly a relatively dry 2016 water year fig 8b marked by baseflow dominant streamflow discharge diluted relative sub surface chloride concentrations resulting in a lower bci for water year 2017 there was no correlation between sub basin bci intended to reflect a catchment s general drainage tendencies and impervious surface density ranging from 2 to 20 this is not to say that impervious surface density and tributary bci share no relationship but rather that the few sub basins studied in this analysis are not sufficient to confirm or deny a trend since the watershed is largely rural a sub basin scale assessment of drainage infrastructure would likely be needed to identify any patterns between bci and impervious surface density baseflow chloride signatures may also not represent the total amount of infiltrated road salts as portions of chloride in sub surface storage may seep into fractured bedrock vitale et al 2017 a detailed analysis of underlying bedrock characteristics was not performed in this study but are expected to vary by sub basin 4 3 seasonal variability the seasonal variation in tributary chloride loading fig 11 is again dominated by inter annual hydrologic variability the high chloride loads during the spring march may can be attributed to increased tributary discharge from snowmelt and subsequent elevated baseflow conditions relatively lower loading in january and february compared to december and march is attributed to snow mass that has yet to melt during the summer to early fall months july september monthly chloride loading from runoff 1 of the total annual watershed chloride load was approximately equal to the average chloride load attributed to wet deposition 1 5 of the total annual watershed load this is well within model error but suggests that the chloride loading attributed to runoff during the summer is dominated by wet deposition the concentration trends in fig 12 are inversely proportional to the discharge trends in fig 11 with the exception of a small spike in runoff concentration in february chloride levels are lowest during the late winter and early spring season and highest during the dry summer and early fall months this trend differs from those observed in meriano et al 2009 and perera et al 2013 in which winter road salt applications induced immediate streamflow chloride concentration responses average monthly baseflow chloride concentrations fig 12 also demonstrated less year to year variation than the runoff concentrations which is expected given the exponential range in discharge rates attributed to overland flow the seasonal concentrations shown are only intended to illustrate general trends given that loadest estimates of concentration are subject to a higher degree of error more frequent chloride monitoring would be necessary to produce accurate flow path separated estimates of concentration 4 4 study sensitivity baseflow dominated chloride loading and transport within the reservoir watershed held true under the various baseflow separation and hydrologic modeling methods fig 13 a range of bfis resulted from the eight different hydrograph separation techniques as observed in eckhardt 2008 and partington et al 2012 and were positively and negatively correlated with bli and bci respectively of all baseflow separation methods l h 3 induced the most severe reduction in baseflow discharge and loading this is a result of the technique s filtering method that attributes the greatest proportion of high frequency hydrograph signals to direct overland flow therefore bci levels are likely exaggerated under l h 3 given that only the highest chloride concentration data remain for baseflow assignment as was the case with bfi tributary bli and bci results under the hysep l scenario remain a compromise between loading extremes from the alternate baseflow approaches tested there is no reason to assume that baseflow discharge in the watershed is best represented by the study sensitivity extremes e g results from the l h 3 or eckhardt methods therefore hysep l is considered the most appropriate choice for this study the baseflow discharge and loading rates estimated using the bapm approach did not exhibit the variance expected for the range of sub basin areas studied all tributary hydrographs excluding the quinapoxet river and portions of the gates brook under bapm are proportionally identical to the stillwater river and therefore share equivalents times of concentration to the 80 km2 tributary this resulted in far less variability in baseflow index and the ensuing bli and bci metrics discharge estimation under the gr4j method generally produced flashier hydrographs as noted by drastic decreases in bfi for smaller tributaries such as the west boylston brook and muddy brook given that results for the four major contributing tributaries are largely unaffected the bapm technique remains an appropriate method as employed in previous reservoir water quality and hydrodynamic modeling studies ahlfeld et al 2003 jeznach et al 2016 however since chloride loading rates are analyzed by sub basin and separated by flow path the gr4j is the preferred method for this study 5 conclusions chloride loading into the wachusett reservoir is dominated by inputs from road salting practices since 2000 chloride mass balances reveal that the 2019 water year marked the first instance when watershed export reached a level similar to the long term average road salt input statistically based load estimation methods reveal that road salts are preferentially transported into the sub surface with approximately 74 of the watershed chloride export delivered via baseflow the rural nature of the watershed and predominantly low impervious surface coverage act to delay chloride mass transport from initial application to reservoir inflow it is likely that it will take several years to decades for reservoir water quality to respond to reductions in road salt application however future reservoir chloride concentrations are difficult to predict urban expansion may lead to a greater demand for road salt while application control use of alternative deicers and the potential for a warming climate may decrease its usage greater boston water supply management authorities concerned with chloride pollution should continue to monitor the chloride trends in the reservoir and watershed while daily sampling is not required for this analysis the loading regressions presented do rely on consistent measurements that capture chloride concentrations representative of both runoff and baseflow the study is also limited to chloride load estimation more advanced techniques would be required to accurately estimate chloride concentration in the reservoir s surrounding tributaries future road salt studies are planned for the watershed and a number of enhancements to water quality monitoring in the region are in place further study could seek to improve
