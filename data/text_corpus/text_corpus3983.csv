19915,microplastic particles mp are efficiently retained in wastewater treatment plants and enriched in sewage sludge for monitoring mp contents in wastewater systems sewage sludge is thus well suited but also requires an isolation of mp from the sludge matrix as other sewage sludge components may interfere with the mp identification and quantification although organic matter in sludge samples can be removed through acid and enzymatic digestion procedures cellulose mainly from toilet paper remains in the digests due to its high chemical resistivity and similar density to mp we apply the separation concept of magnetic seeded filtration to isolate mp through selective hetero agglomeration with magnetic seed particles mp and cellulose differ in their hydrophobic properties and we investigate to what extent these differences can be exploited to selectively form mp magnetite hetero agglomerates in the presence of cellulose these hetero agglomerates are subsequently separated using a magnet five mp types polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene ps and cellulose particles were mixed in different combinations with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic silanized magnetite particles pet pp ldpe and ps only poorly agglomerated with pristine hydrophilic magnetite but efficiently formed hetero agglomerates with hydrophobic magnetite and were successfully removed from suspensions 80 100 pvc agglomerated more efficiently with pristine than with hydrophobic magnetite and cellulose only agglomerated to a limited extent with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic magnetite resulting in a high process selectivity results from experiments conducted at different ionic strengths and with hydrophilic and hydrophobic magnetite suggests that the agglomeration process was dominated by hydrophobic interactions enzymatic and oxidative treatment of the mp only marginally affected the

enormous increase in the annual production of plastics since the start of the mass production in the late 60 ties and to its accumulation in the environment andrady 2017 birch et al 2020 geyer et al 2017 jambeck et al 2015 macleod et al 2021 ostle et al 2019 the ongoing fragmentation of larger plastic items due to mechanical and photochemical weathering results in the formation of microplastic particles mp referring to particulate synthetic polymers with diameters of less than 5 mm e g hartmann et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 which have been reported from regions all over the globe the identification and quantification of mp in various matrices is currently achieved either on an individual particle level or based on total mp quantities in a sample in the fist case vibrational spectroscopic measurements e g fourier transform infrared ft ir or raman are conducted at spatial resolutions of 1 10 μ m anger et al 2018 ivleva 2021 pico et al 2019 primpke et al 2020 and in the second case mass spectroscopic methods such as pyrolysis gas chromatography gc mass spectrometry ms dierkes et al 2019 funck et al 2020 okoffo et al 2020 or thermal extraction desorption ted gc ms duemichen et al 2019 eisentraut et al 2018 yakovenko et al 2020 are used in both cases however interference with matrix compounds challenge the analytical techniques and several sample preparation techniques have been developed and tailored for specific matrices blaesing and amelung 2018 han et al 2019 he et al 2018 junhao et al 2021 müller et al 2021 stock et al 2019 wastewater treatment plants wwtp play a pivotal role in removing mp from municipal and industrial wastewater reported removal efficiencies are mostly above 80 90 reviewed for example by ali et al 2021 and gatidou et al 2019 and most recent studies report that state of the art wwtp even exceed these percentages considerably rasmussen et al 2021 this leads to an accumulation of mp in the sewage sludge mp contents in sewage sludge matrices therefore received considerable attention and several extraction procedures tailored for such matrices have been suggested hurley et al 2018 sujathan et al 2017 philipp et al 2022 showed that easily degradable organic materials can be mineralized using a combination of oxidative and enzymatic digestions and inorganic sand particles can be separated from the mp based on density differences however cellulose materials remain in the digests due to similar size density and chemical resistance of cellulose particles and mp as density separation and selective enzymatic digestions both failed to separate cellulose from mp alternative separation methods have to be considered thereby magnetic seeded filtration msf seems very promising which is also supported by initial results published by grbic et al 2019 magnetic seeded filtration msf also referred to as magnetic flocculation tsouris et al 1995 and magnetic adsorption franzreb 2020 is a solid liquid separation process which has been used in various applications franzreb 2020 the approach is based on the selective hetero agglomeration between magnetic seed particles and the nonmagnetic target particles the agglomerates containing the magnetic seed particles are separated by magnetic separation whereas permanent magnets can be used msf can also be applied to non particulate products in which case the target analytes are adsorbed to the surface of the magnetic seed particles this separation process has for example been applied for harvesting microalgae wang et al 2015 removing oil leaks mirshahghassemi et al 2017 and purifying proteins ebeler et al 2019 franzreb et al 2006 furthermore msf was applied to remove phosphates du et al 2019 and fine particle matter chin et al 2006 gray et al 1994 wan et al 2011 from wastewater and natural organic matter nom during pre treatment of drinking water production on an industrial scale drikas et al 2011 employing msf for the separation of micro and nanoplastics is currently extensively researched by multiple groups with ever increasing possibilities regarding the magnetic seed material groppe et al 2022 misra et al 2020 shi et al 2022a recent studies show that msf is capable of achieving high separation efficiencies for microplastics rhein et al 2019b under laboratory conditions and identified benefits included the high material specific selectivity and the applicability in dilute suspensions franzreb 2020 rhein et al 2019b however as msf has not yet been widely applied in large scale applications no general estimations on cost effectiveness exists yet thus msf is currently a promising approach for separating mp from complex environmental samples in the laboratory i e on small scales grbic et al 2019 shi et al 2022b zhang et al 2021 in this work we investigated the potential of msf to separate mp from cellulose in sewage sludge extracts we first determined the separation efficiencies in two component systems consisting of magnetic seed particles and different mp types or cellulose particles both hydrophilic and hydrophobic magnetic seed particles were used to assess the impact of hydrophobic interactions building on these experiments each individual mp type was mixed with cellulose and then separated using magnetic particles 3 component system to determine the selectivity of the msf process and to investigate whether possible interactions between cellulose particles and mp affected the selectivity as a proof of principle different types mp were added to and separated from a sewage sludge extract containing large amounts of cellulose particles this work therefore aims at the possible application of msf for analytical purposes rather than on an assessment of its suitability for large scale applications in e g potable water treatment 2 materials methods 2 1 magnetic seeded filtration theory the key process defining the efficiency of msf is the hetero agglomeration between magnetic and non magnetic target particles the agglomeration kinetic between two particles i and j resulting in agglomerate i j can be expressed according to relation 1 elimelech 1998 1 d n ij d t n i n j β i j α i j n i and n j describe the number concentrations of agglomerating particles to form an agglomerate two particles must collide which is quantified by the collision frequency β in this study agglomeration is governed by fluid flow rather than diffusion due to large particle diameters and β can therefore be approximated according to eq 2 chin et al 1998 elimelech 1998 han and lawler 1992 the collision frequency is determined by the particle radii r and mean shear rate in the system g 2 β i j 4 3 r i r j 3 g upon collision two particles must stick together the probability of which is expressed through the collision efficiency α in relation 1 the calculation of α is non trivial especially in the shear controlled regime as it requires calculation of particle trajectories under consideration of the flow conditions elimelech 1998 han and lawler 1992 the relation between α and other relevant parameters is given by reerink and overbeek 1954 and selomulya et al 2003 3 α i j exp c 1 1 r i r j r i r j c 2 a exp e σ max k b ϑ a b factor a describes the size dependency of α according to selomulya et al 2003 and soos et al 2007 with empirical constants c 1 and c 2 for increasing particle size as well as decreasing particle size ratio r i r j 1 the collision efficiency and therefore the probability of an agglomeration is reduced due to increasing inertia of the particles factor b is an approximation for the maximum collision efficiency of the diffusion controlled regime reerink and overbeek 1954 and is governed by the particle particle interaction energy e in the traditional dlvo approach derjaguin 1954 the attractive van der waals interactions and mostly repulsive electrostatic interactions are considered whereas this work further requires the inclusion of attractive hydrophobic interactions for a more detailed description the reader is referred to christenson and claesson 2001 elimelech 1998 israelachvili 2011 and to si 1 after the hetero agglomerates are formed they are separated on the basis of their newly gained magnetic properties the magnetic force given in eq 4 needs to overcome the drag of the hetero agglomerates it is primarily dependent on the gradient of the magnetic field strength h the magnetization m and partial volume v m of the magnetic component it is referred to svoboda 2004 for a more profound description of magnetic separation and the relevant material properties 4 f m a g μ 0 v m m h after separation the agglomerates can be further processed to recycle the magnetic seed material and also recover the separated non magnetic fraction agglomerates are either broken up through mechanical stress or exposed to high temperatures or solvents to extract the non magnetic component a previous study rhein et al 2021 showed high recovery rates and low performance losses over the course of multiple separation cycles for three different recycling approaches 2 2 preparation of mp fragments polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe and polystyrene ps beads were purchased from goodfellow gmbh germany with 5 mm diameter to generate mp fragments of smaller sizes x 100 μ m 5 g of the respective beads were ground in a ball mill m400 retsch gmbh germany largely following the protocol of seghers et al 2021 to cool the 35 ml stainless steel buckets containing both the milling ball with a diameter of 20 mm as well as the mp beads to cryogenic temperatures they were put in liquid nitrogen for 10 min the materials were ground several times pet 5 pp 16 ldpe 15 ps 5 until the desired size was reached one grinding cycle consisted of 1 min of milling at f 30 s 1 and 1 5 min of cooling in liquid nitrogen 2 3 silanization of magnetite hydrophobic magnetite was obtained through silanization of magnetite powder kremer pigments germany with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane hdtms 85 technical grade sigma aldrich mainly following the procedures described by frickel et al 2010 grbic et al 2019 and ji et al 2017 which vary in solvent the amount of added water if any and the amount of added hdtms per surface area of particles a particle surface specific hdtms concentration of 4 10 4 mol m 2 ensures sufficient excess to guarantee complete silanization of the magnetite particles assuming perfect spheres and neglecting particle porosity the required amount of hdtms can be calculated for different magnetite particle sizes see si 2 for more information four g of magnetite particles were added to a 50 ml plastic tube together with 36 ml of analytical grade ethanol 99 9 emsure merck germany 4 ml of nanopure water and 0 85 ml of hdtms the suspension was mixed in an overhead shaker reax 2 heidolph instruments germany for 24 h the silanized magnetite particles were separated with a permanent magnet and the remaining liquid was discarded following this the magnetite particles were washed three times with 30 ml of ethanol technical grade with magnetic separation of the magnetite particles between each washing step the washed and silanized particles were dried at 40 c for 17 h and particles from the same batch were used for all of the experiments throughout this work hydrophobic magnetite is abbreviated with mag c16 indicating the alkyl chain length of hdtms 2 4 treatment of mp to extract mp particles from complex matrices including sewage sludge different protocols haven been suggested most of them including combinations of enzymatic and oxidative digestion steps see section 1 this treatment however may induce changes of the surface properties of the mp which may affect their agglomeration behavior during msf to assess these impacts mp were exposed to enzymatic and oxidative treatment following the sample preparation protocol for sewage sludge described in philipp et al 2022 in brief mp were first exposed to fenton reagents by adding the mp to a mixture of 10 ml h 2 o 2 35 5 ml deionized di water 1 ml fe ii so 4 7 h 2 o 2 mm and 1 ml protocatechuic acid 2 mm after a reaction time of 1 h on a horizontal shaker at room temperature and an additional 12 h at 40 c mp were recovered by filtration and incubated with 50 ml phosphate citrate buffer 50 mm p h 5 0 5 g cellulase extracted from aspergillus niger sigma aldrich no 22178 and 10 mg sodium azide at 40 c for 72 h mp were recovered again by filtration and rinsed with di water mp following these treatments are referred to as processed mp in the remainder of the manuscript attenuated total reflectance atr fourier transform ft infrared ir spectra recorded on the mp before and after the digestion steps were identical see fig si 3 demonstrating that the structure of the mp was not affected by the digestion procedure 2 5 analytical particle solvent extraction the analytical particle solvent extraction apse was performed following sygusch and rudolph 2021 to quantify the wettability of particulate systems twenty five mg of dry particle powder was added to 5 ml of ultrapure water in a 15 ml plastic tube and dispersed in an ultrasound bath for 2 min subsequently 5 ml of 1 octanol analytical grade 99 9 sigma aldrich was added and the mixture was again dispersed for 2 min in an ultrasound bath then the suspension was mixed in an overhead shaker reax 2 heidolph instruments germany for 20 min after mixing the suspension was allowed to rest until a clear phase separation between octanol and water was apparent then 5 ml of the top octanol phase were collected with a pipette and the remaining aqueous fraction was decanted and the tube rinsed with ultrapure water both fractions were dried at 40 c and weighted to determine the particle masses in the octanol and in the aqueous phase the mass fraction in the octanol phase x o c t a n o l was calculated according to eq 5 and serves as measure for hydrophobicity higher values of x o c t a n o l indicate more hydrophobic particles as they tend to accumulate in the non polar phase all extraction experiments were performed in triplicate 5 x o c t a n o l m o c t a n o l m o c t a n o l m h 2 o the challenge of this procedure is the accumulation of particles at the liquid liquid interface this may either happen directly or due to sedimentation of particles in the octanol phase the latter was remedied by decreasing resting time however the apse did not yield reliable results for mp as most of the material was found at the liquid liquid interface the results of the apse were used to both validate the silanization of the magnetite particles discussed in section 2 3 and to characterize the behavior of the cellulose particles 2 6 particle properties pet pp ldpe and ps particles were prepared through cryo milling as explained in section 2 2 and polyvinyl chloride pvc particles were purchased in powder form pulp fibers j rettenmaier söhne gmbh germany commonly used as filter aids were used as surrogate for cellulose bächle et al 2021 magnetite particles kremer pigmente germany were used as magnetic seed material and have been described in rhein et al 2019b all particle types were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem and the resulting images along with the operational conditions of the sem are shown in fig si 2 besides revealing the fibrous shape of cellulose particles distinct differences between the cryo milled particles pet pp ldpe ps and pvc are apparent pvc particles exhibit smooth surfaces and spherical shapes whereas the cryo milling process led to diverse and often flattened shapes with rugged particle surfaces the cumulative size distributions of all particle types mp magnetite cellulose derived from static laser light scattering measurements ls13 320 xr beckman coulter are shown in fig si 5 the x 50 of all types of mp were within one log10 unit and ranged from 150 μ m pvc to 450 μ m ldpe pp the cumulative size distribution of the cellulose particles was very similar to the cumulative size distributions of the mp however this needs to be interpreted carefully due to the fibrous shape of the cellulose particles the x 50 of the magnetite particles was roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than both the mp and cellulose particles resulting in a higher collision probability due to higher number concentrations and a higher volume specific surface area compared to the mp which enhances the hetero agglomeration process the pristine magnetite particles were hydrophilic but were made hydrophobic through the silanization process table 1 cellulose fibres were hydrophilic strong accumulation of mp at the the liquid liquid interface during the apse process hampered an assessment of the hydrophobic properties of the mp and contact angle measurements on polymer films of the same material from the same manufacturer were performed in triplicate to assess the hydrophobicity of the mp contact angles were measured on films as determining the contact angle of powders often yields unreliable results sygusch and rudolph 2021 all polymer films exhibit contact angles above 64 with slight differences between the individual film types table 1 the properties of the pristine and the processed mp the cellulose and the magnetite particles along with the properties of the plastic films are summarized in table 1 the zeta potential of the particles reflects their surface charge and is thus an important parameter for assessing the aggregation behavior of particulate materials however measuring the zeta potential for the investigated materials is challenging the commonly applied electrophoretic technique which is based on the diffusion induced motion of the particles in the liquid is only suitable for small particles 1 μ m as the diffusive motion becomes negligible for larger particles alternatively the streaming potential method is applicable to smooth surfaces such as foils or films but inappropriate for particulate materials therefore data available in the literature are used to derive general trends for the zeta potentials of the materials used in this study at p h 7 negative zeta potentials ranging from 10 mv to 40 mv are reported for magnetite particles rhein et al 2019b sun et al 1998 cellulose cadena et al 2009 uetani and yano 2012 pet güney et al 2015 kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 pp slepička et al 2010 ldpe kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 pvc güney et al 2015 kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 rhein et al 2019b and ps kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 there is little information about the influence of silanization on the zeta potential of magnetite particles however only slightly altered zeta potentials were reported for silanized sio 2 surfaces guo et al 2008 ji et al 2017 similarly data on the effect of enzymatic and oxidative treatments of mp and cellulose on their zeta potentials are currently lacking however as a change in contact angle as shown in table 1 generally results in more ionizable groups on the particle surface it can be assumed that the absolute value of the zeta potential increases through extraction 2 7 gravimetric analysis gravimetric analyses were performed on an ax205 deltarange balance from mettler toledo usa with an accuracy of 0 01 mg prior to the separation experiments the accuracy of the gravimetric analysis was assessed by spiking different masses ranging from 5 mg to 40 mg of pet to a 50 ml glass bottle these suspensions were then filtered onto membranes whatman 25 mm diameter 0 2 μ m pore size sigma aldrich and dried at 40 c the relative error of the gravimetric analysis was determined by comparing the mass of the membranes before and after filtration the experiments were performed in triplicate the relative error was almost constant over the various concentrations with an average value over all measurements of δ r e l 6 2 6 2 see si 7 2 8 image analysis the separated fraction in 3 component experiments were dispersed in octanol in an ultrasound bath for 5 min to break agglomerates between hydrophobic particles subsequently filtered onto membrane filters whatman 47 mm diameter 0 2 μ m pore size sigma aldrich and dried at 40 c visible light microscopy images of these filters were recorded on a nikon eclipse ni with an automated stage and using a nikon planfluor 4x0 13 wd17 2 objective an area of 4500 4500 px 2 corresponding to 32 32 mm 2 the largest square that can be fitted into the 47 mm filter was selected for image analysis the cellulose fibers in the images of the separated fraction were manually colored and then segmented to quantify the cellulose fibres based on binarized images cellulose was clearly distinguishable from the mp due to their characteristic fibrous shape and the slightly different color the binary images were processed using the open source software fiji schindelin et al 2012 to determine the total 2d area of the cellulose fibers as reference the same initial amount of cellulose fibers as was used in the 3 component experiments see table 2 was filtered and processed as described above as these samples contained cellulose fibers only the identification of the cellulose fibers on the recorded images was automated using specific thresholds for segmenting the images the separation efficiency of cellulose fibers was estimated by comparing the total area of cellulose on the filters resulting from separated samples to the respective area from the cellulose reference filters the workflow of the image analysis pipleline is schematically shown in fig si 7 2 9 experimental design the experimental design is depicted in fig 1 with the experimental parameters listed in table 2 additional information about the absolute masses is given in table si 2 desired amounts of mp and or cellulose particles were weighted into a 50 ml glass bottle schott ag germany and magnetic particles into a separate weighting bowl then ultrapure water atrium pro sartorius france and a 4 m nacl solution analytical grade emsure merck germany were added to reach the liquid volume of 40 ml and the ionic strength i of the given experiment the p h was 7 05 i 0 01 m t 21 2 c the magnetic particles were added to the mp suspension and the weighting bowl was rinsed with 5 ml of ultrapure water agglomeration between magnetic and non magnetic particles was induced by putting the glass bottle for 10 min on a horizontal shaker ks260 basic ika germany at 250 rpm subsequently the bottle was removed and placed next to a permanent magnet for 2 min to separate the magnetic agglomerates from the non magnetic particles the supernatant was carefully decanted while holding the permanent magnet in place 40 ml of an nacl solution with the same ionic strength as the respective experimental sample was added to rinse the glass bottle a second magnetic separation was performed analogously but with a reduced magnetic separation time of 1 min the collected supernatants were filtered onto a previously weighted membrane filter whatman 25 mm diameter 0 2 μ m pore size sigma aldrich and dried at 40 c until constant weight but at least for 12 h in the 3 component experiments mp cellulose and magnetic particles the separated fraction was resuspended filtered and also weighted this allowed the quantification of particle losses required for the calculation of the separation efficiencies as this study was focused on the agglomeration behavior of the mp in the context of mp analysis the possibilities to recycle the magnetic seed particles and ultimately the economy of the process were less relevant and thus not addressed in this work the separation efficiency for non magnetic particles in the 2 component system t n m 2 c o m p was calculated according to eq 6 the assumption was that all magnetic particles added to the system m m 0 were separated and therefore particles in the supernatant m s n corresponded to not separated non magnetic material at the end of the experiment m n m e m s n which was ensured by initial experiments the initial mass of non magnetic particles added to the system is denoted by m n m 0 6 t n m 2 c o m p 100 1 m n m e m n m 0 100 1 m s n m n m 0 during 3 component experiments the separated fraction was recovered and weighted to estimate particle losses during the procedure the mass loss δ m over the individual 3 component experiments was calculated as the difference between the total mass of the particles recovered mass of the supernatant m s n and of the separated fraction m s e p and the total mass of the added particles at the beginning of the experiment mp m m p 0 cellulose m c e l l u l o s e 0 magnetite m m a g n e t i t e 0 assuming that the particle losses can be equally distributed between the supernatant sn and separated sep fraction and that cellulose is separated to the same degree as observed in the 2 component system t c e l l u l o s e 3 c o m p t c e l l u l o s e 2 c o m p the separation efficiency of the mp in the 3 component system t m p 3 c o m p was calculated according to eq 7 the validity of this assumption was assessed through microscopic image analysis of the separated fractions and is covered in section 3 2 7 t m p 3 c o m p 100 1 m s n δ m 2 m c e l l u l o s e 0 1 t c e l l u l o s e 2 c o m p 100 m m p 0 3 results discussion 3 1 2 component system the separation efficiencies when using untreated hydrophilic magnetite mag were around 10 for pet pp ldpe and ps fig 2 and cellulose was separated to 20 however separation efficiencies exceeding 80 were obtained for pvc the separation behavior drastically changed when using hydrophobic magnetic particles mag c16 pp ldpe and ps were almost completely separated and separation efficiencies of 80 were obtained for pet in contrast the separation efficiencies of pvc and also for cellulose significantly decreased and were around 30 40 for pvc and 10 for cellulose these trends correlated with the hydrophobic properties of the respective polymer films listed in table 1 except for pvc which is discussed separately pp ldpe and ps exhibit contact angles 90 and can be considered as hydrophobic israelachvili 2011 the hydrophobic behavior of these polymers and mag c16 results in a strong attractive interaction between these particle types enabling their agglomeration and subsequent magnetic separation the origin of the hydrophobic force on a molecular level can be retraced to the rearrangement of water molecules between two hydrophobic surfaces israelachvili and pashley 1982 but hydrophobic particle particle interactions are acting on a much larger length scale and are currently intensively debated there seems to be a consensus that the origin of the long ranged attractive force is due to the bridging of nanobubbles attached on hydrophobic surfaces kékicheff 2019 but ishida et al ishida et al 2018 demonstrated that even in the absence of such bubbles strong attractive forces can be measured when hydrophilic magnetic particles are used instead the formation of hetero aggregates is suppressed which is reflected by the low separation efficiencies of the polymers the separation efficiency for pet in combination with mag c16 was around 80 and thus lower than the corresponding efficiencies for the pp ldpe and ps the slightly lower separation efficiency for pet may be explained by the lower contact angle of around 77 resulting in a less efficient formation of hetero aggregates the apse results in table 1 show that cellulose accumulates in the aqueous phase and can thus be considered as hydrophilic the lower separation efficiencies when using mag c16 instead of hydrophilic magnetite can be explained by the formation of mag c16 homo agglomerates this reduces the total number of magnetic particles available to form hetero agglomerates and reduces the aggregations kinetics eq 1 this effect applies to all mp types however is offset for pet pp ldpe and ps by the additional attractive hydrophobic interaction leading to an increased collision efficiency α increasing the ionic strength by a factor of 100 from 0 01 m to 1 m did not significantly change the separation efficiency fig 2 which is in contrast to previous studies on msf rhein et al 2019a 2020 2019b at p h 7 all investigated particle systems are expected to be negatively charged see section 2 6 resulting in an electrostatic repulsion according to si 1 an increase in ionic strength reduces the range of the repulsive electrostatic interactions κ 1 lowers the energy barrier e σ m a x and leads to an increased collision efficiency α in eq 1 this facilitates the formation of aggregates and ultimately leads to an increase in the separation efficiency the independence of the separation efficiencies from the ionic strength therefore suggests that the compression of the electric double layer did not change the aggregation behavior and that therefore electrostatic forces were not controlling the hetero aggregation process based on the results from previous studies rhein et al 2019a 2020 2019b only a negligible repulsion is expected at i 1 m the fact that this did not lead to an increase in the separation efficiency in the experiments conducted with pristine magnetite therefore indicates that the van der waals attraction between particles is too weak to induce an agglomeration the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is found in the particle diameters which are orders of magnitude larger than in rhein et al 2019a 2020 2019b whereas the van der waals interaction increases proportionally to the particle radius r inertial forces or flow effects increase proportionally to the volume of the particle i e r 3 a factor of 10 in diameter consequently increases the ratio of inertial to van der waals forces by a factor of 100 this effect is accounted for by the factor a in eq 3 and drastically reduces the collision efficiency for increasing particle diameter furthermore the cryo milling process likely increased the surface roughness of the polymers see fig si 2 which may lower their effective hamaker constants by several orders of magnitude valmacco et al 2016 the reduced van der waals interactions thus explain the low separation efficiencies observed for pet pp ldpe and ps in combination with pristine magnetite similarly cellulose exhibits diverse fibrous shapes with rough surfaces explaining the low van der waals attraction and separation efficiency although hydrophobic interactions also increase proportionally to the particle radius christenson and claesson 2001 they nevertheless are able to induce an agglomeration despite the greatly increased inertial effects multiple studies christenson and claesson 2001 rabinovich and derjaguin 1988 have shown that depending on the material system the hydrophobic behavior can outperform van der waals interactions by several orders of magnitudes and are therefore in agreement with the increased separation efficiencies of pet pp ldpe and ps when agglomerated with mag c16 as shown in fig 2 the separation behavior of pvc was different to the other mp and substantially decreased from 80 for pristine hydrophilic magnetite to 35 for mag c16 this behavior is similar to the behavior observed for cellulose and generally indicates hydrophilic surface properties mag c16 particles most likely homo agglomerated during the experiment with pvc which reduced the agglomeration kinetic eq 1 the hydrophilic behavior of the pvc particles however is in apparent discrepancy to the results from the contact angle measurements of 86 conducted on pvc films table 1 suggesting hydrophobic surfaces energy dispersive x ray analyses conducted in the sem sem edx of a pvc film and of selected pvc particles revealed significantly different chlorine cl contents see si 5 which indicate different surface properties of the particles compared to the films thus the contact angle determined for the pvc films may not be transferable to the pvc particles based on the agglomeration and separation behavior of the pvc particleswe predict a lower contact angle of the pvc particles compared to the pvc films consistent with the hydrophilic behavior of the pvc particles due the the experimental challenges outlined in section 2 5 however we were not able to experimentally assess the contact angle of the pvc particles in addition to the surface properties also the surface roughness of the pvc particles may have contributed to their hydrophilic behavior during hetero agglomeration in contrast to other mp which were ground in a ball mill under cryogenic conditions pvc was directly obtained in powder form and with a smaller particle size compared to the other mp see table 1 or fig si 5 the high separation efficiencies for pvc of 80 when pristine hydrophilic magnetic particles were used suggest that van der waals interactions exceeded inertial forces and were inducing the formation of agglomerates this can be attributed to both the smaller particle size reducing inertial forces and larger effective hamaker constants resulting from a smoother particle surface due to the manufacturing process of the pvc particles see fig si 2 additionally the experiments with pvc showed larger standard deviations which may indicate weaker van der waals contact forces in the agglomerates small variations in the experimental procedure may therefore result in agglomerate breakage and explain the variance in separation efficiency although it is difficult to quantify differences in particle shape see fig si 2 may also influence the particle particle collision and therefore the separation efficiency all processed mp types with the exception of pet behaved very similar to the pristine ones during msf fig 3 processed pp ldpe and ps were almost quantitatively separated and processed cellulose was hardly separated at all the average separation efficiency of pvc slightly increased to 40 50 but due to the large standard deviations the effect is not considered significant table 1 further supports this as the contact angle of pvc films remained unchanged through processing the separation efficiency for processed pet however was reduced to 20 30 this reduction in separation efficiency can be explained by chemical changes modifying the surface properties of the pet which was reflected in a decreased contact angle of the processed pet of around 65 table 1 the exposure of pet to strong oxidation agents fenton reagents and to specific enzymes likely caused the formation of carboxylic acid end groups gewert et al 2015 rendering the surfaces more hydrophilic and explaining the change in the contact angle the oxidation of pet surfaces is known to reduce the hydrophobicity i e increase the wettability and is a desired effect in designing membrane materials fávaro et al 2007 gotoh et al 2018 korolkov et al 2015 although the contact angles of processed pp and ps were also reduced compared to the pristine materials the separation efficiency for these polymers remained constant at close to 100 thus with the exception of pet the separation efficiency of the pristine and the processed mp were similar making the msf a promising approach to isolate mp from digests of complex matrices e g sewage sludge even for processed pet the difference in the separation efficiency compared to cellulose is significant indicating a selective separation by increasing e g agglomeration time or performing a multistage separation the degree of separation for pet might be increased whereas cellulose is expected to remain in the suspension in summary the results in figs 2 and 3 show that the separation efficiency is dominated by hydrophobic and van der waals interactions the ionic strength did not influence the separation efficiency indicating that the electrostatic interactions were negligible for the investigated systems separation of hydrophobic nonmagnetic particles can be realized by using hydrophobic magnetic particles without increasing the separation efficiency of hydrophilic cellulose whereas the separation efficiencies for pp ldpe and ps were mostly below 10 for hydrophilic magnetic particles an almost complete separation was achieved with hydrophobic magnetite independent of a previous processing steps the different behavior of pvc suggests that the surface roughness plays a key role in msf rough surfaces either created during the cryo milling process in the case of pet pp ldpe and ps or inherently present in the case of fibrous cellulose particles reduce the effective hamaker constants which may help to explain the different separation behavior of these particles compared to pvc 3 2 3 component system the results from the 2 component system suggested that a separation between hydrophobic mp and hydrophilic cellulose is possible however potential interactions between cellulose and mp may lead to an increase in the separation of cellulose and thus a reduced selectivity a detailed discussion about selectivity in multi component agglomerating systems is given in rhein et al 2020 in the 3 component system cellulose and mp can be present in the separated fractions therefore more detailed information about the composition of these fractions in addition to gravimetic analyses were required to assess the separation efficiencies of the mp in this study the separated fractions of cellulose in each of the 3 component experiments were quantified by image analysis techniques as described in section 2 8 and the obtained separation efficiencies of cellulose are shown in table 3 original and processed images are given in fig si 8 the separation efficiencies for cellulose in all 3 component systems derived using image analysis tools were in the range of 0 37 2 3 indicating only a limited interaction between cellulose and the mp resulting in cellulose separation efficiencies similar to the 2 component system overlapping cellulose fibers more prominent in the reference sample due to the higher cellulose concentration and manual identification of cellulose fibers in separated fractions both contributed to the uncertainty associated with the determination of separation efficiency in the 3 component system we accounted for these effects by varying the image processing parameters brightness contrast settings for cellulose identification as the separation efficiencies for cellulose obtained through image analysis were in good agreement with separation efficiencies of cellulose obtained from the 2 component systems the separation efficiencies for cellulose in the 3 component system were set equal to the respective separation efficiencies determined in the 2 component system t c e l l u l o s e 3 c o m p t c e l l u l o s e 2 c o m p the separation efficiencies of the mp were thus calculated according to eq 7 and are shown alongside the 2 component results in fig 4 for pristine and fig 5 for processed mp the experiments were performed in suspensions with an ionic strength of 0 01 m and mag c16 particles the cellulose separation efficiency is displayed with corresponding standard deviation as a horizontal line within the standard deviations derived from three replicates the pristine and processed mp showed an almost identical separation behavior in the 2 and in the 3 component system which is consistent with the negligible interactions between cellulose fibers and mp the results demonstrate that a selective separation between mp and cellulose with msf is possible and can reach high levels of selectivity pp ldpe and ps were quantitatively separated from the liquids whereas cellulose was only separated to a limited extent it is remarkable that the results from experiments conducted with pvc consistently show larger standard deviations compared to the results obtained from experiments conducted with the other mp this may point towards the formation of weak hetero agglomerates in the the secondary minimum which may be ruptured to various extends during the magnetic separation process the separation efficiencies for pet and pvc were around 70 and 40 however the selectivity of the process was still high this means that pet and pvc will still be present in the supernatants but the separated fraction will be almost cellulose free the overall separation might therefore be increased by extended agglomeration times or a multi stage separation resulting in higher recoveries in real world samples should this be necessary 3 3 separation of polymers from sewage sludge extracts to assess the potential of the msf approach to separate mp from digested sewage sludge extracts additional separation experiments were performed digested sewage sludge samples were collected from a full scale wastewater treatment plant ara neugut duebendorf switzerland and processed following the extraction protocol published by philipp et al 2022 and described in section 2 4 the sludge extracts exs essentially consisting of cellulose and polymers already present in the digested sewage sludge are considered as a separate type of nonmagnetic particle system an initial separation experiment was performed with exs yielding a separation efficiency of t e x s 16 65 meaning that about 17 wt of the particulate material present in the exs was found in the separated fraction following the msf approach and 83 wt remained in the supernatant subsequently processed pet 3 43 mg 0 19 mg pp 2 34 mg 0 16 mg and pvc 3 30 mg 0 03 mg were spiked to exs 6 99 mg 0 04 mg resulting in identical volume concentrations of all mp and in similar volume concentrations of the sum of all mp and exs after the msf of these experimental suspensions both the absolute mass of particles in the supernatant m s n e x p and in the separated fraction m s e p e x p were determined gravimetrically assuming that the separation efficiencies determined for the 2 and the 3 component systems are also valid for multicomponent systems the predicted mass of the supernatant m s n p r e d can be calculated according to eq 8 8 m s n p r e d n 1 n m n 0 1 t n 100 with m n 0 referring to the initial masses of the individual spiked mp and solids already present in the sludge extracts exs and t n representing the separation efficiencies of the respective non magnetic components mp exs the mass of the particulate material in the supernatant most likely dominated by the sum of spiked mp and mp cellulose that were already in the sludge extracts calculated by 8 was in good agreement with the experimental data shown in table 4 thus the results suggest that msf can be applied possibly as a final polishing step as part of a sample preparation protocol for the selective separation of mp from complex environmental samples 4 conclusions cellulose fibers originating for example from disintegrating toilet papers are abundant in digested sewage sludge recently published mp extraction protocols can efficiently isolate mp from most of the sludge components but cannot separate mp from cellulose as mp and cellulose have similar densities and are both resistant against chemical and enzymatic digestions for analytical purposes e g pyrolysis gcms measurements the separation of cellulose materials from mp however would be highly welcome to avoid possible interference between pyrolysis products from mp and cellulose this study demonstrated the potential of msf using hydrophobic magnetic particles as seeding agents to separate mp from cellulose materials for pp ldpe and ps an almost complete separation of the mp from the liquids was achieved whereas cellulose was only found in negligible amounts in the separated fractions although pet and pvc were separated less efficiently from the liquids 75 and 40 see fig 4 the msf was very specific as cellulose mostly remained in the supernatants therefore the respective mp may be enriched in the separated fractions by repeated msf or alternatively the obtained mp fractions may be corrected according to the respective separation efficiencies the presented msf approach using hydrophobic seed particles represents a straight forward and promising purification step likely facilitating the quantification of mp extracted from complex matrices the contrasting results obtained for pvc compared to other mp types emphasize the complexity of real world mp systems and challenge the use of

19915,microplastic particles mp are efficiently retained in wastewater treatment plants and enriched in sewage sludge for monitoring mp contents in wastewater systems sewage sludge is thus well suited but also requires an isolation of mp from the sludge matrix as other sewage sludge components may interfere with the mp identification and quantification although organic matter in sludge samples can be removed through acid and enzymatic digestion procedures cellulose mainly from toilet paper remains in the digests due to its high chemical resistivity and similar density to mp we apply the separation concept of magnetic seeded filtration to isolate mp through selective hetero agglomeration with magnetic seed particles mp and cellulose differ in their hydrophobic properties and we investigate to what extent these differences can be exploited to selectively form mp magnetite hetero agglomerates in the presence of cellulose these hetero agglomerates are subsequently separated using a magnet five mp types polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene ps and cellulose particles were mixed in different combinations with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic silanized magnetite particles pet pp ldpe and ps only poorly agglomerated with pristine hydrophilic magnetite but efficiently formed hetero agglomerates with hydrophobic magnetite and were successfully removed from suspensions 80 100 pvc agglomerated more efficiently with pristine than with hydrophobic magnetite and cellulose only agglomerated to a limited extent with either hydrophilic or hydrophobic magnetite resulting in a high process selectivity results from experiments conducted at different ionic strengths and with hydrophilic and hydrophobic magnetite suggests that the agglomeration process was dominated by hydrophobic interactions enzymatic and oxidative treatment of the mp only marginally affected the

enormous increase in the annual production of plastics since the start of the mass production in the late 60 ties and to its accumulation in the environment andrady 2017 birch et al 2020 geyer et al 2017 jambeck et al 2015 macleod et al 2021 ostle et al 2019 the ongoing fragmentation of larger plastic items due to mechanical and photochemical weathering results in the formation of microplastic particles mp referring to particulate synthetic polymers with diameters of less than 5 mm e g hartmann et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 which have been reported from regions all over the globe the identification and quantification of mp in various matrices is currently achieved either on an individual particle level or based on total mp quantities in a sample in the fist case vibrational spectroscopic measurements e g fourier transform infrared ft ir or raman are conducted at spatial resolutions of 1 10 μ m anger et al 2018 ivleva 2021 pico et al 2019 primpke et al 2020 and in the second case mass spectroscopic methods such as pyrolysis gas chromatography gc mass spectrometry ms dierkes et al 2019 funck et al 2020 okoffo et al 2020 or thermal extraction desorption ted gc ms duemichen et al 2019 eisentraut et al 2018 yakovenko et al 2020 are used in both cases however interference with matrix compounds challenge the analytical techniques and several sample preparation techniques have been developed and tailored for specific matrices blaesing and amelung 2018 han et al 2019 he et al 2018 junhao et al 2021 müller et al 2021 stock et al 2019 wastewater treatment plants wwtp play a pivotal role in removing mp from municipal and industrial wastewater reported removal efficiencies are mostly above 80 90 reviewed for example by ali et al 2021 and gatidou et al 2019 and most recent studies report that state of the art wwtp even exceed these percentages considerably rasmussen et al 2021 this leads to an accumulation of mp in the sewage sludge mp contents in sewage sludge matrices therefore received considerable attention and several extraction procedures tailored for such matrices have been suggested hurley et al 2018 sujathan et al 2017 philipp et al 2022 showed that easily degradable organic materials can be mineralized using a combination of oxidative and enzymatic digestions and inorganic sand particles can be separated from the mp based on density differences however cellulose materials remain in the digests due to similar size density and chemical resistance of cellulose particles and mp as density separation and selective enzymatic digestions both failed to separate cellulose from mp alternative separation methods have to be considered thereby magnetic seeded filtration msf seems very promising which is also supported by initial results published by grbic et al 2019 magnetic seeded filtration msf also referred to as magnetic flocculation tsouris et al 1995 and magnetic adsorption franzreb 2020 is a solid liquid separation process which has been used in various applications franzreb 2020 the approach is based on the selective hetero agglomeration between magnetic seed particles and the nonmagnetic target particles the agglomerates containing the magnetic seed particles are separated by magnetic separation whereas permanent magnets can be used msf can also be applied to non particulate products in which case the target analytes are adsorbed to the surface of the magnetic seed particles this separation process has for example been applied for harvesting microalgae wang et al 2015 removing oil leaks mirshahghassemi et al 2017 and purifying proteins ebeler et al 2019 franzreb et al 2006 furthermore msf was applied to remove phosphates du et al 2019 and fine particle matter chin et al 2006 gray et al 1994 wan et al 2011 from wastewater and natural organic matter nom during pre treatment of drinking water production on an industrial scale drikas et al 2011 employing msf for the separation of micro and nanoplastics is currently extensively researched by multiple groups with ever increasing possibilities regarding the magnetic seed material groppe et al 2022 misra et al 2020 shi et al 2022a recent studies show that msf is capable of achieving high separation efficiencies for microplastics rhein et al 2019b under laboratory conditions and identified benefits included the high material specific selectivity and the applicability in dilute suspensions franzreb 2020 rhein et al 2019b however as msf has not yet been widely applied in large scale applications no general estimations on cost effectiveness exists yet thus msf is currently a promising approach for separating mp from complex environmental samples in the laboratory i e on small scales grbic et al 2019 shi et al 2022b zhang et al 2021 in this work we investigated the potential of msf to separate mp from cellulose in sewage sludge extracts we first determined the separation efficiencies in two component systems consisting of magnetic seed particles and different mp types or cellulose particles both hydrophilic and hydrophobic magnetic seed particles were used to assess the impact of hydrophobic interactions building on these experiments each individual mp type was mixed with cellulose and then separated using magnetic particles 3 component system to determine the selectivity of the msf process and to investigate whether possible interactions between cellulose particles and mp affected the selectivity as a proof of principle different types mp were added to and separated from a sewage sludge extract containing large amounts of cellulose particles this work therefore aims at the possible application of msf for analytical purposes rather than on an assessment of its suitability for large scale applications in e g potable water treatment 2 materials methods 2 1 magnetic seeded filtration theory the key process defining the efficiency of msf is the hetero agglomeration between magnetic and non magnetic target particles the agglomeration kinetic between two particles i and j resulting in agglomerate i j can be expressed according to relation 1 elimelech 1998 1 d n ij d t n i n j β i j α i j n i and n j describe the number concentrations of agglomerating particles to form an agglomerate two particles must collide which is quantified by the collision frequency β in this study agglomeration is governed by fluid flow rather than diffusion due to large particle diameters and β can therefore be approximated according to eq 2 chin et al 1998 elimelech 1998 han and lawler 1992 the collision frequency is determined by the particle radii r and mean shear rate in the system g 2 β i j 4 3 r i r j 3 g upon collision two particles must stick together the probability of which is expressed through the collision efficiency α in relation 1 the calculation of α is non trivial especially in the shear controlled regime as it requires calculation of particle trajectories under consideration of the flow conditions elimelech 1998 han and lawler 1992 the relation between α and other relevant parameters is given by reerink and overbeek 1954 and selomulya et al 2003 3 α i j exp c 1 1 r i r j r i r j c 2 a exp e σ max k b ϑ a b factor a describes the size dependency of α according to selomulya et al 2003 and soos et al 2007 with empirical constants c 1 and c 2 for increasing particle size as well as decreasing particle size ratio r i r j 1 the collision efficiency and therefore the probability of an agglomeration is reduced due to increasing inertia of the particles factor b is an approximation for the maximum collision efficiency of the diffusion controlled regime reerink and overbeek 1954 and is governed by the particle particle interaction energy e in the traditional dlvo approach derjaguin 1954 the attractive van der waals interactions and mostly repulsive electrostatic interactions are considered whereas this work further requires the inclusion of attractive hydrophobic interactions for a more detailed description the reader is referred to christenson and claesson 2001 elimelech 1998 israelachvili 2011 and to si 1 after the hetero agglomerates are formed they are separated on the basis of their newly gained magnetic properties the magnetic force given in eq 4 needs to overcome the drag of the hetero agglomerates it is primarily dependent on the gradient of the magnetic field strength h the magnetization m and partial volume v m of the magnetic component it is referred to svoboda 2004 for a more profound description of magnetic separation and the relevant material properties 4 f m a g μ 0 v m m h after separation the agglomerates can be further processed to recycle the magnetic seed material and also recover the separated non magnetic fraction agglomerates are either broken up through mechanical stress or exposed to high temperatures or solvents to extract the non magnetic component a previous study rhein et al 2021 showed high recovery rates and low performance losses over the course of multiple separation cycles for three different recycling approaches 2 2 preparation of mp fragments polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe and polystyrene ps beads were purchased from goodfellow gmbh germany with 5 mm diameter to generate mp fragments of smaller sizes x 100 μ m 5 g of the respective beads were ground in a ball mill m400 retsch gmbh germany largely following the protocol of seghers et al 2021 to cool the 35 ml stainless steel buckets containing both the milling ball with a diameter of 20 mm as well as the mp beads to cryogenic temperatures they were put in liquid nitrogen for 10 min the materials were ground several times pet 5 pp 16 ldpe 15 ps 5 until the desired size was reached one grinding cycle consisted of 1 min of milling at f 30 s 1 and 1 5 min of cooling in liquid nitrogen 2 3 silanization of magnetite hydrophobic magnetite was obtained through silanization of magnetite powder kremer pigments germany with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane hdtms 85 technical grade sigma aldrich mainly following the procedures described by frickel et al 2010 grbic et al 2019 and ji et al 2017 which vary in solvent the amount of added water if any and the amount of added hdtms per surface area of particles a particle surface specific hdtms concentration of 4 10 4 mol m 2 ensures sufficient excess to guarantee complete silanization of the magnetite particles assuming perfect spheres and neglecting particle porosity the required amount of hdtms can be calculated for different magnetite particle sizes see si 2 for more information four g of magnetite particles were added to a 50 ml plastic tube together with 36 ml of analytical grade ethanol 99 9 emsure merck germany 4 ml of nanopure water and 0 85 ml of hdtms the suspension was mixed in an overhead shaker reax 2 heidolph instruments germany for 24 h the silanized magnetite particles were separated with a permanent magnet and the remaining liquid was discarded following this the magnetite particles were washed three times with 30 ml of ethanol technical grade with magnetic separation of the magnetite particles between each washing step the washed and silanized particles were dried at 40 c for 17 h and particles from the same batch were used for all of the experiments throughout this work hydrophobic magnetite is abbreviated with mag c16 indicating the alkyl chain length of hdtms 2 4 treatment of mp to extract mp particles from complex matrices including sewage sludge different protocols haven been suggested most of them including combinations of enzymatic and oxidative digestion steps see section 1 this treatment however may induce changes of the surface properties of the mp which may affect their agglomeration behavior during msf to assess these impacts mp were exposed to enzymatic and oxidative treatment following the sample preparation protocol for sewage sludge described in philipp et al 2022 in brief mp were first exposed to fenton reagents by adding the mp to a mixture of 10 ml h 2 o 2 35 5 ml deionized di water 1 ml fe ii so 4 7 h 2 o 2 mm and 1 ml protocatechuic acid 2 mm after a reaction time of 1 h on a horizontal shaker at room temperature and an additional 12 h at 40 c mp were recovered by filtration and incubated with 50 ml phosphate citrate buffer 50 mm p h 5 0 5 g cellulase extracted from aspergillus niger sigma aldrich no 22178 and 10 mg sodium azide at 40 c for 72 h mp were recovered again by filtration and rinsed with di water mp following these treatments are referred to as processed mp in the remainder of the manuscript attenuated total reflectance atr fourier transform ft infrared ir spectra recorded on the mp before and after the digestion steps were identical see fig si 3 demonstrating that the structure of the mp was not affected by the digestion procedure 2 5 analytical particle solvent extraction the analytical particle solvent extraction apse was performed following sygusch and rudolph 2021 to quantify the wettability of particulate systems twenty five mg of dry particle powder was added to 5 ml of ultrapure water in a 15 ml plastic tube and dispersed in an ultrasound bath for 2 min subsequently 5 ml of 1 octanol analytical grade 99 9 sigma aldrich was added and the mixture was again dispersed for 2 min in an ultrasound bath then the suspension was mixed in an overhead shaker reax 2 heidolph instruments germany for 20 min after mixing the suspension was allowed to rest until a clear phase separation between octanol and water was apparent then 5 ml of the top octanol phase were collected with a pipette and the remaining aqueous fraction was decanted and the tube rinsed with ultrapure water both fractions were dried at 40 c and weighted to determine the particle masses in the octanol and in the aqueous phase the mass fraction in the octanol phase x o c t a n o l was calculated according to eq 5 and serves as measure for hydrophobicity higher values of x o c t a n o l indicate more hydrophobic particles as they tend to accumulate in the non polar phase all extraction experiments were performed in triplicate 5 x o c t a n o l m o c t a n o l m o c t a n o l m h 2 o the challenge of this procedure is the accumulation of particles at the liquid liquid interface this may either happen directly or due to sedimentation of particles in the octanol phase the latter was remedied by decreasing resting time however the apse did not yield reliable results for mp as most of the material was found at the liquid liquid interface the results of the apse were used to both validate the silanization of the magnetite particles discussed in section 2 3 and to characterize the behavior of the cellulose particles 2 6 particle properties pet pp ldpe and ps particles were prepared through cryo milling as explained in section 2 2 and polyvinyl chloride pvc particles were purchased in powder form pulp fibers j rettenmaier söhne gmbh germany commonly used as filter aids were used as surrogate for cellulose bächle et al 2021 magnetite particles kremer pigmente germany were used as magnetic seed material and have been described in rhein et al 2019b all particle types were investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem and the resulting images along with the operational conditions of the sem are shown in fig si 2 besides revealing the fibrous shape of cellulose particles distinct differences between the cryo milled particles pet pp ldpe ps and pvc are apparent pvc particles exhibit smooth surfaces and spherical shapes whereas the cryo milling process led to diverse and often flattened shapes with rugged particle surfaces the cumulative size distributions of all particle types mp magnetite cellulose derived from static laser light scattering measurements ls13 320 xr beckman coulter are shown in fig si 5 the x 50 of all types of mp were within one log10 unit and ranged from 150 μ m pvc to 450 μ m ldpe pp the cumulative size distribution of the cellulose particles was very similar to the cumulative size distributions of the mp however this needs to be interpreted carefully due to the fibrous shape of the cellulose particles the x 50 of the magnetite particles was roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than both the mp and cellulose particles resulting in a higher collision probability due to higher number concentrations and a higher volume specific surface area compared to the mp which enhances the hetero agglomeration process the pristine magnetite particles were hydrophilic but were made hydrophobic through the silanization process table 1 cellulose fibres were hydrophilic strong accumulation of mp at the the liquid liquid interface during the apse process hampered an assessment of the hydrophobic properties of the mp and contact angle measurements on polymer films of the same material from the same manufacturer were performed in triplicate to assess the hydrophobicity of the mp contact angles were measured on films as determining the contact angle of powders often yields unreliable results sygusch and rudolph 2021 all polymer films exhibit contact angles above 64 with slight differences between the individual film types table 1 the properties of the pristine and the processed mp the cellulose and the magnetite particles along with the properties of the plastic films are summarized in table 1 the zeta potential of the particles reflects their surface charge and is thus an important parameter for assessing the aggregation behavior of particulate materials however measuring the zeta potential for the investigated materials is challenging the commonly applied electrophoretic technique which is based on the diffusion induced motion of the particles in the liquid is only suitable for small particles 1 μ m as the diffusive motion becomes negligible for larger particles alternatively the streaming potential method is applicable to smooth surfaces such as foils or films but inappropriate for particulate materials therefore data available in the literature are used to derive general trends for the zeta potentials of the materials used in this study at p h 7 negative zeta potentials ranging from 10 mv to 40 mv are reported for magnetite particles rhein et al 2019b sun et al 1998 cellulose cadena et al 2009 uetani and yano 2012 pet güney et al 2015 kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 pp slepička et al 2010 ldpe kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 pvc güney et al 2015 kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 rhein et al 2019b and ps kirby and hasselbrink jr 2004 there is little information about the influence of silanization on the zeta potential of magnetite particles however only slightly altered zeta potentials were reported for silanized sio 2 surfaces guo et al 2008 ji et al 2017 similarly data on the effect of enzymatic and oxidative treatments of mp and cellulose on their zeta potentials are currently lacking however as a change in contact angle as shown in table 1 generally results in more ionizable groups on the particle surface it can be assumed that the absolute value of the zeta potential increases through extraction 2 7 gravimetric analysis gravimetric analyses were performed on an ax205 deltarange balance from mettler toledo usa with an accuracy of 0 01 mg prior to the separation experiments the accuracy of the gravimetric analysis was assessed by spiking different masses ranging from 5 mg to 40 mg of pet to a 50 ml glass bottle these suspensions were then filtered onto membranes whatman 25 mm diameter 0 2 μ m pore size sigma aldrich and dried at 40 c the relative error of the gravimetric analysis was determined by comparing the mass of the membranes before and after filtration the experiments were performed in triplicate the relative error was almost constant over the various concentrations with an average value over all measurements of δ r e l 6 2 6 2 see si 7 2 8 image analysis the separated fraction in 3 component experiments were dispersed in octanol in an ultrasound bath for 5 min to break agglomerates between hydrophobic particles subsequently filtered onto membrane filters whatman 47 mm diameter 0 2 μ m pore size sigma aldrich and dried at 40 c visible light microscopy images of these filters were recorded on a nikon eclipse ni with an automated stage and using a nikon planfluor 4x0 13 wd17 2 objective an area of 4500 4500 px 2 corresponding to 32 32 mm 2 the largest square that can be fitted into the 47 mm filter was selected for image analysis the cellulose fibers in the images of the separated fraction were manually colored and then segmented to quantify the cellulose fibres based on binarized images cellulose was clearly distinguishable from the mp due to their characteristic fibrous shape and the slightly different color the binary images were processed using the open source software fiji schindelin et al 2012 to determine the total 2d area of the cellulose fibers as reference the same initial amount of cellulose fibers as was used in the 3 component experiments see table 2 was filtered and processed as described above as these samples contained cellulose fibers only the identification of the cellulose fibers on the recorded images was automated using specific thresholds for segmenting the images the separation efficiency of cellulose fibers was estimated by comparing the total area of cellulose on the filters resulting from separated samples to the respective area from the cellulose reference filters the workflow of the image analysis pipleline is schematically shown in fig si 7 2 9 experimental design the experimental design is depicted in fig 1 with the experimental parameters listed in table 2 additional information about the absolute masses is given in table si 2 desired amounts of mp and or cellulose particles were weighted into a 50 ml glass bottle schott ag germany and magnetic particles into a separate weighting bowl then ultrapure water atrium pro sartorius france and a 4 m nacl solution analytical grade emsure merck germany were added to reach the liquid volume of 40 ml and the ionic strength i of the given experiment the p h was 7 05 i 0 01 m t 21 2 c the magnetic particles were added to the mp suspension and the weighting bowl was rinsed with 5 ml of ultrapure water agglomeration between magnetic and non magnetic particles was induced by putting the glass bottle for 10 min on a horizontal shaker ks260 basic ika germany at 250 rpm subsequently the bottle was removed and placed next to a permanent magnet for 2 min to separate the magnetic agglomerates from the non magnetic particles the supernatant was carefully decanted while holding the permanent magnet in place 40 ml of an nacl solution with the same ionic strength as the respective experimental sample was added to rinse the glass bottle a second magnetic separation was performed analogously but with a reduced magnetic separation time of 1 min the collected supernatants were filtered onto a previously weighted membrane filter whatman 25 mm diameter 0 2 μ m pore size sigma aldrich and dried at 40 c until constant weight but at least for 12 h in the 3 component experiments mp cellulose and magnetic particles the separated fraction was resuspended filtered and also weighted this allowed the quantification of particle losses required for the calculation of the separation efficiencies as this study was focused on the agglomeration behavior of the mp in the context of mp analysis the possibilities to recycle the magnetic seed particles and ultimately the economy of the process were less relevant and thus not addressed in this work the separation efficiency for non magnetic particles in the 2 component system t n m 2 c o m p was calculated according to eq 6 the assumption was that all magnetic particles added to the system m m 0 were separated and therefore particles in the supernatant m s n corresponded to not separated non magnetic material at the end of the experiment m n m e m s n which was ensured by initial experiments the initial mass of non magnetic particles added to the system is denoted by m n m 0 6 t n m 2 c o m p 100 1 m n m e m n m 0 100 1 m s n m n m 0 during 3 component experiments the separated fraction was recovered and weighted to estimate particle losses during the procedure the mass loss δ m over the individual 3 component experiments was calculated as the difference between the total mass of the particles recovered mass of the supernatant m s n and of the separated fraction m s e p and the total mass of the added particles at the beginning of the experiment mp m m p 0 cellulose m c e l l u l

ldpe and ps fig 2 and cellulose was separated to 20 however separation efficiencies exceeding 80 were obtained for pvc the separation behavior drastically changed when using hydrophobic magnetic particles mag c16 pp ldpe and ps were almost completely separated and separation efficiencies of 80 were obtained for pet in contrast the separation efficiencies of pvc and also for cellulose significantly decreased and were around 30 40 for pvc and 10 for cellulose these trends correlated with the hydrophobic properties of the respective polymer films listed in table 1 except for pvc which is discussed separately pp ldpe and ps exhibit contact angles 90 and can be considered as hydrophobic israelachvili 2011 the hydrophobic behavior of these polymers and mag c16 results in a strong attractive interaction between these particle types enabling their agglomeration and subsequent magnetic separation the origin of the hydrophobic force on a molecular level can be retraced to the rearrangement of water molecules between two hydrophobic surfaces israelachvili and pashley 1982 but hydrophobic particle particle interactions are acting on a much larger length scale and are currently intensively debated there seems to be a consensus that the origin of the long ranged attractive force is due to the bridging of nanobubbles attached on hydrophobic surfaces kékicheff 2019 but ishida et al ishida et al 2018 demonstrated that even in the absence of such bubbles strong attractive forces can be measured when hydrophilic magnetic particles are used instead the formation of hetero aggregates is suppressed which is reflected by the low separation efficiencies of the polymers the separation efficiency for pet in combination with mag c16 was around 80 and thus lower than the corresponding efficiencies for the pp ldpe and ps the slightly lower separation efficiency for pet may be explained by the lower contact angle of around 77 resulting in a less efficient formation of hetero aggregates the apse results in table 1 show that cellulose accumulates in the aqueous phase and can thus be considered as hydrophilic the lower separation efficiencies when using mag c16 instead of hydrophilic magnetite can be explained by the formation of mag c16 homo agglomerates this reduces the total number of magnetic particles available to form hetero agglomerates and reduces the aggregations kinetics eq 1 this effect applies to all mp types however is offset for pet pp ldpe and ps by the additional attractive hydrophobic interaction leading to an increased collision efficiency α increasing the ionic strength by a factor of 100 from 0 01 m to 1 m did not significantly change the separation efficiency fig 2 which is in contrast to previous studies on msf rhein et al 2019a 2020 2019b at p h 7 all investigated particle systems are expected to be negatively charged see section 2 6 resulting in an electrostatic repulsion according to si 1 an increase in ionic strength reduces the range of the repulsive electrostatic interactions κ 1 lowers the energy barrier e σ m a x and leads to an increased collision efficiency α in eq 1 this facilitates the formation of aggregates and ultimately leads to an increase in the separation efficiency the independence of the separation efficiencies from the ionic strength therefore suggests that the compression of the electric double layer did not change the aggregation behavior and that therefore electrostatic forces were not controlling the hetero aggregation process based on the results from previous studies rhein et al 2019a 2020 2019b only a negligible repulsion is expected at i 1 m the fact that this did not lead to an increase in the separation efficiency in the experiments conducted with pristine magnetite therefore indicates that the van der waals attraction between particles is too weak to induce an agglomeration the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is found in the particle diameters which are orders of magnitude larger than in rhein et al 2019a 2020 2019b whereas the van der waals interaction increases proportionally to the particle radius r inertial forces or flow effects increase proportionally to the volume of the particle i e r 3 a factor of 10 in diameter consequently increases the ratio of inertial to van der waals forces by a factor of 100 this effect is accounted for by the factor a in eq 3 and drastically reduces the collision efficiency for increasing particle diameter furthermore the cryo milling process likely increased the surface roughness of the polymers see fig si 2 which may lower their effective hamaker constants by several orders of magnitude valmacco et al 2016 the reduced van der waals interactions thus explain the low separation efficiencies observed for pet pp ldpe and ps in combination with pristine magnetite similarly cellulose exhibits diverse fibrous shapes with rough surfaces explaining the low van der waals attraction and separation efficiency although hydrophobic interactions also increase proportionally to the particle radius christenson and claesson 2001 they nevertheless are able to induce an agglomeration despite the greatly increased inertial effects multiple studies christenson and claesson 2001 rabinovich and derjaguin 1988 have shown that depending on the material system the hydrophobic behavior can outperform van der waals interactions by several orders of magnitudes and are therefore in agreement with the increased separation efficiencies of pet pp ldpe and ps when agglomerated with mag c16 as shown in fig 2 the separation behavior of pvc was different to the other mp and substantially decreased from 80 for pristine hydrophilic magnetite to 35 for mag c16 this behavior is similar to the behavior observed for cellulose and generally indicates hydrophilic surface properties mag c16 particles most likely homo agglomerated during the experiment with pvc which reduced the agglomeration kinetic eq 1 the hydrophilic behavior of the pvc particles however is in apparent discrepancy to the results from the contact angle measurements of 86 conducted on pvc films table 1 suggesting hydrophobic surfaces energy dispersive x ray analyses conducted in the sem sem edx of a pvc film and of selected pvc particles revealed significantly different chlorine cl contents see si 5 which indicate different surface properties of the particles compared to the films thus the contact angle determined for the pvc films may not be transferable to the pvc particles based on the agglomeration and separation behavior of the pvc particleswe predict a lower contact angle of the pvc particles compared to the pvc films consistent with the hydrophilic behavior of the pvc particles due the the experimental challenges outlined in section 2 5 however we were not able to experimentally assess the contact angle of the pvc particles in addition to the surface properties also the surface roughness of the pvc particles may have contributed to their hydrophilic behavior during hetero agglomeration in contrast to other mp which were ground in a ball mill under cryogenic conditions pvc was directly obtained in powder form and with a smaller particle size compared to the other mp see table 1 or fig si 5 the high separation efficiencies for pvc of 80 when pristine hydrophilic magnetic particles were used suggest that van der waals interactions exceeded inertial forces and were inducing the formation of agglomerates this can be attributed to both the smaller particle size reducing inertial forces and larger effective hamaker constants resulting from a smoother particle surface due to the manufacturing process of the pvc particles see fig si 2 additionally the experiments with pvc showed larger standard deviations which may indicate weaker van der waals contact forces in the agglomerates small variations in the experimental procedure may therefore result in agglomerate breakage and explain the variance in separation efficiency although it is difficult to quantify differences in particle shape see fig si 2 may also influence the particle particle collision and therefore the separation efficiency all processed mp types with the exception of pet behaved very similar to the pristine ones during msf fig 3 processed pp ldpe and ps were almost quantitatively separated and processed cellulose was hardly separated at all the average separation efficiency of pvc slightly increased to 40 50 but due to the large standard deviations the effect is not considered significant table 1 further supports this as the contact angle of pvc films remained unchanged through processing the separation efficiency for processed pet however was reduced to 20 30 this reduction in separation efficiency can be explained by chemical changes modifying the surface properties of the pet which was reflected in a decreased contact angle of the processed pet of around 65 table 1 the exposure of pet to strong oxidation agents fenton reagents and to specific enzymes likely caused the formation of carboxylic acid end groups gewert et al 2015 rendering the surfaces more hydrophilic and explaining the change in the contact angle the oxidation of pet surfaces is known to reduce the hydrophobicity i e increase the wettability and is a desired effect in designing membrane materials fávaro et al 2007 gotoh et al 2018 korolkov et al 2015 although the contact angles of processed pp and ps were also reduced compared to the pristine materials the separation efficiency for these polymers remained constant at close to 100 thus with the exception of pet the separation efficiency of the pristine and the processed mp were similar making the msf a promising approach to isolate mp from digests of complex matrices e g sewage sludge even for processed pet the difference in the separation efficiency compared to cellulose is significant indicating a selective separation by increasing e g agglomeration time or performing a multistage separation the degree of separation for pet might be increased whereas cellulose is expected to remain in the suspension in summary the results in figs 2 and 3 show that the separation efficiency is dominated by hydrophobic and van der waals interactions the ionic strength did not influence the separation efficiency indicating that the electrostatic interactions were negligible for the investigated systems separation of hydrophobic nonmagnetic particles can be realized by using hydrophobic magnetic particles without increasing the separation efficiency of hydrophilic cellulose whereas the separation efficiencies for pp ldpe and ps were mostly below 10 for hydrophilic magnetic particles an almost complete separation was achieved with hydrophobic magnetite independent of a previous processing steps the different behavior of pvc suggests that the surface roughness plays a key role in msf rough surfaces either created during the cryo milling process in the case of pet pp ldpe and ps or inherently present in the case of fibrous cellulose particles reduce the effective hamaker constants which may help to explain the different separation behavior of these particles compared to pvc 3 2 3 component system the results from the 2 component system suggested that a separation between hydrophobic mp and hydrophilic cellulose is possible however potential interactions between cellulose and mp may lead to an increase in the separation of cellulose and thus a reduced selectivity a detailed discussion about selectivity in multi component agglomerating systems is given in rhein et al 2020 in the 3 component system cellulose and mp can be present in the separated fractions therefore more detailed information about the composition of these fractions in addition to gravimetic analyses were required to assess the separation efficiencies of the mp in this study the separated fractions of cellulose in each of the 3 component experiments were quantified by image analysis techniques as described in section 2 8 and the obtained separation efficiencies of cellulose are shown in table 3 original and processed images are given in fig si 8 the separation efficiencies for cellulose in all 3 component systems derived using image analysis tools were in the range of 0 37 2 3 indicating only a limited interaction between cellulose and the mp resulting in cellulose separation efficiencies similar to the 2 component system overlapping cellulose fibers more prominent in the reference sample due to the higher cellulose concentration and manual identification of cellulose fibers in separated fractions both contributed to the uncertainty associated with the determination of separation efficiency in the 3 component system we accounted for these effects by varying the image processing parameters brightness contrast settings for cellulose identification as the separation efficiencies for cellulose obtained through image analysis were in good agreement with separation efficiencies of cellulose obtained from the 2 component systems the separation efficiencies for cellulose in the 3 component system were set equal to the respective separation efficiencies determined in the 2 component system t c e l l u l o s e 3 c o m p t c e l l u l o s e 2 c o m p the separation efficiencies of the mp were thus calculated according to eq 7 and are shown alongside the 2 component results in fig 4 for pristine and fig 5 for processed mp the experiments were performed in suspensions with an ionic strength of 0 01 m and mag c16 particles the cellulose separation efficiency is displayed with corresponding standard deviation as a horizontal line within the standard deviations derived from three replicates the pristine and processed mp showed an almost identical separation behavior in the 2 and in the 3 component system which is consistent with the negligible interactions between cellulose fibers and mp the results demonstrate that a selective separation between mp and cellulose with msf is possible and can reach high levels of selectivity pp ldpe and ps were quantitatively separated from the liquids whereas cellulose was only separated to a limited extent it is remarkable that the results from experiments conducted with pvc consistently show larger standard deviations compared to the results obtained from experiments conducted with the other mp this may point towards the formation of weak hetero agglomerates in the the secondary minimum which may be ruptured to various extends during the magnetic separation process the separation efficiencies for pet and pvc were around 70 and 40 however the selectivity of the process was still high this means that pet and pvc will still be present in the supernatants but the separated fraction will be almost cellulose free the overall separation might therefore be increased by extended agglomeration times or a multi stage separation resulting in higher recoveries in real world samples should this be necessary 3 3 separation of polymers from sewage sludge extracts to assess the potential of the msf approach to separate mp from digested sewage sludge extracts additional separation experiments were performed digested sewage sludge samples were collected from a full scale wastewater treatment plant ara neugut duebendorf switzerland and processed following the extraction protocol published by philipp et al 2022 and described in section 2 4 the sludge extracts exs essentially consisting of cellulose and polymers already present in the digested sewage sludge are considered as a separate type of nonmagnetic particle system an initial separation experiment was performed with exs yielding a separation efficiency of t e x s 16 65 meaning that about 17 wt of the particulate material present in the exs was found in the separated fraction following the msf approach and 83 wt remained in the supernatant subsequently processed pet 3 43 mg 0 19 mg pp 2 34 mg 0 16 mg and pvc 3 30 mg 0 03 mg were spiked to exs 6 99 mg 0 04 mg resulting in identical volume concentrations of all mp and in similar volume concentrations of the sum of all mp and exs after the msf of these experimental suspensions both the absolute mass of particles in the supernatant m s n e x p and in the separated fraction m s e p e x p were determined gravimetrically assuming that the separation efficiencies determined for the 2 and the 3 component systems are also valid for multicomponent systems the predicted mass of the supernatant m s n p r e d can be calculated according to eq 8 8 m s n p r e d n 1 n m n 0 1 t n 100 with m n 0 referring to the initial masses of the individual spiked mp and solids already present in the sludge extracts exs and t n representing the separation efficiencies of the respective non magnetic components mp exs the mass of the particulate material in the supernatant most likely dominated by the sum of spiked mp and mp cellulose that were already in the sludge extracts calculated by 8 was in good agreement with the experimental data shown in table 4 thus the results suggest that msf can be applied possibly as a final polishing step as part of a sample preparation protocol for the selective separation of mp from complex environmental samples 4 conclusions cellulose fibers originating for example from disintegrating toilet papers are abundant in digested sewage sludge recently published mp extraction protocols can efficiently isolate mp from most of the sludge components but cannot separate mp from cellulose as mp and cellulose have similar densities and are both resistant against chemical and enzymatic digestions for analytical purposes e g pyrolysis gcms measurements the separation of cellulose materials from mp however would be highly welcome to avoid possible interference between pyrolysis products from mp and cellulose this study demonstrated the potential of msf using hydrophobic magnetic particles as seeding agents to separate mp from cellulose materials for pp ldpe and ps an almost complete separation of the mp from the liquids was achieved whereas cellulose was only found in negligible amounts in the separated fractions although pet and pvc were separated less efficiently from the liquids 75 and 40 see fig 4 the msf was very specific as cellulose mostly remained in the supernatants therefore the respective mp may be enriched in the separated fractions by repeated msf or alternatively the obtained mp fractions may be corrected according to the respective separation efficiencies the presented msf approach using hydrophobic seed particles represents a straight forward and promising purification step likely facilitating the quantification of mp extracted from complex matrices the contrasting results obtained for pvc compared to other mp types emphasize the complexity of real world mp systems and challenge the use of

19916,acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob can open the door to new applications such as partial nitritation at low ph however they can also be problematic because chemical nitrite oxidation occurs at low ph leading to the release of harmful nitrogen oxide gases in this publication the role of acid tolerant aob in urine treatment was explored on the one hand the technical feasibility of ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions for source separated urine with total nitrogen concentrations up to 3 5 g n l 1 was investigated on the other hand the abundance and growth of acid tolerant aob at more neutral ph was explored under acidic conditions ph of 5 ammonia oxidation rates of 500 mg n l 1 d 1 and 10 g n g vss 1 d 1 were observed despite high concentrations of 15 mg n l 1 of the aob inhibiting compound nitrous acid and low concentration of 0 04 mg n l 1 of the substrate ammonia however ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions was very sensitive to process disturbances even short periods of less than 12 h without oxygen or without influent resulted in a complete cessation of ammonia oxidation with a recovery time of up to two months which is a problem for low maintenance applications such as decentralized treatment furthermore undesirable nitrogen losses of about 10 were observed under acidic conditions a novel aob strain was enriched with a relative abundance of up to 80 for which the name candidatus ca nitrosacidococcus urinae is proposed while nitrosacidococcus members were present only to a small extent 0 004 in urine nitrification reactors operated at ph values between 5 8 and 7 acid tolerant aob were always enriched during long periods without influent resulting in an uncontrolled drop in ph to as low as 2 5 long term experiments at different ph values showed that the activity of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae decreased strongly at a ph of 7 where they were also outcompeted by the acid sensitive aob nitrosomonas halophila the experiment results showed that the decreased activity of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae correlated with the limited availability of dissolved iron at neutral ph graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification acidophilic aob source separation chemical nitrite oxidation human urine life support system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrification is an essential process in wastewater treatment in which ammonia nh3 is biologically oxidized first to nitrite and then to nitrate tchobanoglous et al 2014 ammonia oxidation can be carried out by either ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa or bacteria performing complete ammonia oxidation comammox but aob are dominant in wastewater treatment stein 2019 in conventional wastewater treatment aob such as nitrosomonas eutropha are acid sensitive and their activity declines with decreasing ph due to limited availability of their substrate nh3 which protonates to ammonium nh4 and ceases completely at a ph around 5 4 due to a direct ph effect related to the energy available from the proton motive force fumasoli et al 2015 nevertheless aob activity has been observed at ph substantially below 5 4 demonstrating the existence of acid tolerant aob fumasoli et al 2017 low ph values may occur when the alkalinity is insufficient to neutralize the protons released during ammonia oxidation examples of alkalinity limited wastewaters include source separated urine fumasoli et al 2016 digester supernatant udert et al 2008 and the effluent of chemically enhanced primary treatment with iron dosing taboada santos et al 2020 acid tolerant aob have been shown not only to survive at low ph values and have a high affinity for nh3 below 1 μg n l 1 wang et al 2021a but also to withstand high free nitrous acid hno2 concentrations of more than 3 mg n l 1 wang et al 2021b in contrast to aob no lower ph limit for nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is reported however at low ph nob are often inhibited by hno2 and chemical nitrite oxidation may become the dominant process for nitrite conversion udert et al 2005 ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions has been tested for various applications acid tolerant aob were used by li et al 2020 as the first step of partial nitritation anammox in which partial nitritation was successfully achieved at ph values around 5 by suppressing nob with hno2 for highly diluted urine with total nitrogen tn concentrations of about 200 mg n l 1 since anammox bacteria are acid sensitive li et al 2020 suggested mixing the effluent with untreated urine to achieve a neutral ph in a similar approach wang et al 2021b maintained partial nitritation at ph 4 5 to 5 using acid tolerant aob for a mixture of sewage with sidestream anaerobic digestion liquor with a tn concentration of about 100 mg n l 1 verhave et al 2009 filed a patent concerning a process combining ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions and controlled chemical nitrite oxidation for the conversion of liquid manure into an ammonium nitrate fertilizer the patent application however was abandoned acid tolerant aob were also used to achieve self sustaining hno2 accumulation at low ph to enhance volatile solid destruction and nitrogen removal during aerobic digestion of waste activated sludge duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021c last but not least acid tolerant aob have been used for the bioconversion of methane to methanol at low ph zhang et al 2021 even though ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions could open the door to new applications the process can be problematic because during the chemical oxidation of nitrite harmful gases such as nitric oxide no nitrogen dioxide no2 hno2 and potentially n2o are released udert et al 2005 one example from practice is an air biofilter from a pig stable in which ammonia was found to be converted to nitrate at ph 2 5 by acid tolerant aob and chemical nitrite oxidation but at the same time no and no2 gases were emitted picone et al 2021 in urine nitrification acid tolerant aob were a potential problem during long periods of low or no influent as the ph dropped to values as low as 2 2 without alkalinity increase due to urine dosage such low ph resulted in nitrite instead of nitrate in the effluent and the release of harmful nitrogen oxide gases fumasoli et al 2017 this is particularly dangerous for decentralized in building settings or space applications such as the european space agency s micro ecological life support system alternative melissa program where urine is supposed to be nitrified without the formation of harmful by products clauwaert et al 2017 in addition the release of volatile nitrogen oxides results in nitrogen losses diminishing the potential for nutrient recovery in the above listed research projects about acid tolerant aob different strains were found while li et al 2020 and fumasoli et al 2016 observed the growth of nitrosospira sp wang et al 2021b found a nitrosoglobus sp closely related to the non halophilic candidatus ca nitrosoglobus terrae enriched from acidic tea soils hayatsu et al 2017 in contrast picone et al 2021 characterized a novel aob with high identity to sequences found in reactors treating synthetic urine by fumasoli et al 2017 and proposed the name ca nitrosacidococcus tergens this bacterium was able to grow not only on ammonia but also on urea at ph values as low as 2 5 at neutral ph acid tolerant aobs are usually not abundant and acid sensitive aob dominate the nitrifying community wang et al 2021a argued that the acid tolerant aob nitrosoglobus sp are less competitive than acid sensitive aob such as nitrosomonas sp in ph neutral wastewater treatment processes mainly due to their low maximum growth rate of 0 3 d 1 compared for example to 1 4 d 1 for nitrosomonas europaea nevertheless the effect of a more neutral ph e g ph 7 on the activity of acid tolerant aob is unclear and results from short term experiments are contradictory in wang et al 2021a the activity was similar at ph 5 and 7 in li et al 2020 the activity increased with increasing ph value and in picone et al 2021 the activity decreased at ph 7 compared to ph 5 these observations cannot be explained by substrate nh3 limitation and product hno2 inhibition which are common approaches used in activate sludge models sin et al 2008 so far the ph dependency of acid tolerant aob has only been determined with short term experiments no long term experiments have been performed to investigate the activity of acid tolerant aob at neutral ph this publication addresses the role of acid tolerant aob in urine treatment and had two main objectives 1 to investigate the technical suitability of ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions ph 5 for source separated urine with tn concentrations up to 3500 mg n l 1 2 to investigate the abundance and growth of acid tolerant aob at neutral ph values a better understanding of the behavior of acid tolerant aob at neutral ph also helps to develop strategies to avoid the growth of acid tolerant aob specifically the following four research questions were addressed what are the most important aob selected under acidic conditions and high tn concentrations how well is acidic ammonia oxidation of source separated urine suited for technical applications especially with regard to process stability how abundant are acid tolerant aob in urine nitrification reactors operated at ph values between 5 8 and 7 what is the long term effect of neutral ph values on the activity of acid tolerant aob and what is the underlying mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch incubation the transition from acid sensitive to acid tolerant aob was investigated in several batch incubation experiments for this purpose activated sludge from the urine nitrification reactors at eawag dübendorf switzerland which were operated at ph values between 5 8 and 7 faust et al 2022b was added to an aerobic batch reactor without influent and ph control due to ammonia oxidation the ph dropped and a ph decrease well below 5 4 indicated the growth of acid tolerant aob the oxygen concentration was controlled between 4 and 6 mg l 1 with an on off controller 2 2 setup and operation of the enrichment reactor an ammonia oxidation reactor was operated under acidic conditions ph of 5 for 700 days to enrich acid tolerant aob an aerobic 12 l continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr without sludge retention was used to have a dynamic but simple system more details are included in the supplementary information si 1 the reactor was operated with suspended activated sludge with an inlet at the bottom and an overflow at the top through which effluent and activated sludge were discharged to start up the reactor activated sludge was added from an urine nitrification reactor at eawag as described before section 2 1 but once the ph decreased to 4 9 due to ammonia oxidation the influent was used to control the ph between 4 9 and 5 with an on off controller stored source separated urine from waterless urinals and nomix toilets gundlach et al 2021 with low chemical oxidation demand cod was used as influent ph 8 5 during storage urea was fully hydrolyzed to ammoniacal nitrogen udert et al 2006 to produce low cod influent a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr was used in which approximately 80 of the cod was degraded without nitrification separating cod degradation from nitrification allowed an enriched culture of aob by avoiding high concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria the temperature in the reactor was controlled at 25 c except for a period in summer when the temperature rose above 30 c for two weeks due to very high outdoor temperatures dissolved oxygen do was controlled between 4 and 6 mg l 1 using humidified air via an on off controller 2 3 short term respirometric activity tests the effect of hno2 ph nh3 salinity and do including anoxic conditions on the activity of acid tolerant aob was evaluated with short term activity experiments in a 3 l respirometer set up and experimental procedure in si 2 the respirometer was operated either as two chamber lss respirometer lss static gas static liquid or two chamber lsf respirometer lsf static gas flowing liquid van loosdrecht et al 2016 activated sludge from the enrichment reactor was used for the activity tests the ph in the respirometer was controlled with 0 4 m naoh and 0 4 m hcl and the temperature was set at 25 c 2 4 long term ph and iron experiments the effects of ph and iron on acid tolerant aob were further investigated in two long term experiments lasting 400 days and 70 days respectively in the first experiment a 12 l reactor was operated as previously described section 2 2 and after 100 days the ph set points were stepwise increased from 4 9 5 to 5 9 6 6 4 6 5 and 6 9 7 with at least four weeks between changes in the second experiment a 12 l reactor was incubated with activated sludge from another acidic ammonia oxidation reactor and after three weeks of operation the ph set points were increased from 4 9 5 to 6 9 7 concomitant with the ph increase fecl3 3 mg fe l 1 and the chelating agent nitrilotriacetic acid nta were added to the reactor and the influent at a ratio of 1 mol nta mol fe 1 after another five weeks the reactor was again fed with influent without iron addition to test whether acid tolerant aob were still abundant 2 l of activated sludge were removed from the 12 l reactor washed with nitrified urine and added to an aerobic batch reactor without influent or ph control as described previously section 2 1 again a ph decrease well below 5 4 indicated the presence of acid tolerant aob 2 5 chemical nitrite oxidation model a model was used to investigate whether the observed nitrate production could be explained by chemical nitrite oxidation processes kinetic and stoichiometric data of chemical nitrite oxidation were taken from udert et al 2005 and integrated in a sumo2 model using the sumo19 wastewater treatment software dynamita france the chemical nitrite oxidation consisted of the three nitrogen compounds equilibria and the chemical nitrite oxidation as shown in eqs 1 to 4 for completeness the chemical oxidation of ammonia was also added eqs 5 and 6 all biological processes were turned off and only chemical and physical processes were considered the measured flow rates the tan total ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n nh4 n in the influent the observed amount of ammonia oxidized to nitrite in the reactor about 50 due to the limited alkalinity and the

enrichment reactor were additionally used for metagenome sequencing using the illumina miseq and oxford nanopore platforms as described in picone et al 2021 genome assembly was performed using necat chen et al 2021 and quality of the assembly was checked using checkm parks et al 2015 annotation was performed using prokka seemann 2014 the complete genome sequence has been deposited in the ncbi bioproject database with accession number prjeb52462 3 results and discussion 3 1 reproducible growth of acid tolerant aob during long phases without ph control in the 13 batch incubations without influent or base addition the ph of activated sludge from urine nitrification reactors always dropped below 5 within 10 to 47 days indicating reproducible growth of acid tolerant aob as an example of a typical incubation experiment fig 1 a shows the ph timeline of the enrichment reactor the ph decreased to about 5 5 within hours where ammonia oxidation ceased and the ph remained or increased slightly a similar ph limit of 5 4 was reported in fumasoli et al 2015 for partial nitrification of synthetic urine the slight increase in ph during the idle phase could be related to co2 volatilization after 20 days a second ph decrease was observed which can be explained by microbial ammonia oxidation udert et al 2005 indicating the growth of acid tolerant aob when the ph had reached a value of 5 after 28 days the enrichment reactor was controlled with the influent at ph 4 9 to 5 the start up procedure was repeated using twelve sludge inocula from different urine nitrification reactors while the ph values always decreased below 5 the time required varied strongly fig 1b no correlation was found between the time required for the ph to drop below 5 and different variables such as the operating ph before stopping the influent the temperature or the vss concentration see si 6 for scatterplot therefore the different duration of growth cannot be explained with the available data the long idle phase of at least 10 days between the first drop in ph to about 5 4 and the second drop in ph strongly suggests that the dominant aob in all inocula were acid sensitive and that the number of acid tolerant aob was low when the ph was not controlled at around 5 the ph continued to decrease to values as low as 2 5 see ph timeline of all inocula in si 7 which has also been observed by fumasoli et al 2017 3 2 ammonia oxidation at low ph is fast but unstable in the enrichment reactor ammonia oxidation rates with a maximum of about 500 mg n l 1 d 1 and specific rates of 10 g n g vss 1 d 1 were observed at 25 c despite high hno2 concentrations of 15 mg n l 1 and low nh3 concentrations of 0 04 mg n l 1 fig 2 at such high hno2 and low nh3 concentrations the activity of the most common aob in wastewater treatment is severely reduced sin et al 2008 the maximum rates are of the same order of magnitude as those previously found for nitrification at ph 5 8 to 6 fumasoli et al 2016 where rates between 120 to 640 mg n l 1 d 1 were reported for a moving bed biofilm reactor four different types of operational disturbances occurred fig 2b resulting in sharp drops in the ammonia oxidation rates see si 9 for details about the operational disturbances i influent stop and thus no ph control resulted in a ph drop to values as low as 4 and increased hno2 concentrations ii interruption of aeration led to anoxic conditions in the reactor during 3 to 15 h iii uncontrolled continuous pumping of around 12 l equivalent to one reactor volume for 12 h resulted in a ph increase to as high as 8 5 and biomass washout iv insufficient temperature control resulted in temperatures as high as 33 c the system always recovered but it took up to two months to reach the ammonia oxidation rate the system had before the operational disturbances this is not a system artifact as the acidic reactor in which the ca nitrosacidococcus tergens dominated was also very sensitive to short periods without oxygen or substrate supply h j m op den camp personal communication 15 01 2022 around day 60 and day 700 the ammonia oxidation rate also decreased although no obvious process control error occurred however the failure after 700 days might be linked to an increase in the influent concentration due to a change of the influent tank in other acidic ammonia oxidation systems where the solid retention time srt was controlled with a membrane bioreactor such large fluctuations in ammonia oxidation rates were not observed picone et al 2021 wang et al 2021b therefore controlling the srt could lead to a more stable ammonia oxidation rate nevertheless process disturbances such as lack of aeration or influent would still result in high activity losses with long recovery times overcoming such obstacles would require detailed planning e g to avoid running out of urine frequent maintenance e g to avoid pump failure and very careful operation 3 3 chemical nitrite oxidation caused high gaseous nitrogen losses nitrate in the enrichment reactor was mainly produced by chemical nitrite oxidation except for a first peak observed after 40 days nitrite oxidation rates were below 80 mg n l 1 d 1 throughout the 700 day experiment fig 2 most likely the first peak was caused by biological nitrite oxidation but once the hno2 concentration exceeded 0 5 mg n l 1 around day 42 the biological rate decreased and chemical nitrite oxidation became dominant as common nob are strongly inhibited already at hno2 concentrations of 0 1 mg n l 1 sin et al 2008 the nitrite accumulation ratio nar which is the amount of nitrite not converted to nitrate was on average 77 excluding the start up phase timeline of nar in si 10 during periods with hydraulic retention times hrt of less than 2 days nar increased to 94 tan and the sum of tnn and nitrate n were in a ratio of about 1 1 which was expected due to the limited alkalinity of urine fumasoli et al 2016 dissolved nitrogen losses were 11 of the nitrogen in the influent see si 11 for timeline for comparison in urine nitrification at ph values between 5 8 and 6 and low hno2 concentrations fumasoli et al 2016 reported that nitrogen losses were negligible li et al 2020 also reported lower nitrogen losses of up to 4 for partial nitritation under acidic conditions since nitrogen was most likely lost as gaseous no and no2 fumasoli et al 2017 the higher chemical nitrite oxidation rate due to higher hno2 concentrations see next paragraph in this research project may explain the observed difference fumasoli et al 2017 on the other hand reported higher nitrogen losses of about 50 at ph 2 5 which most likely was related to the high hrt of 88 days the chemical nitrite oxidation model predicted the tnn and nitrate concentrations well with model efficiencies of 0 88 and 0 94 respectively fig 3 only the first peak of nitrite oxidation around day 40 was not well captured by chemical nitrite oxidation see si 12 this confirms that biological nitrite oxidation was initially observed but with increasing hno2 concentrations and decreasing hrt nob are washed out and chemical nitrite oxidation became dominant an operational failure that resulted in a drop in ph to 4 and increased chemical nitrite oxidation on day 226 was also well captured by the model according to the model the chemical nitrite oxidation rate increases with increasing hno2 and do concentrations in the reactor see simulations in si 13 zuo et al 2022 used the chemical nitrite oxidation model with the same rate constants and also obtained a good fit but this is the first time the model has been used for continuous operation 3 4 high abundance of novel candidatus nitrosacidococcus urinae at low ph an acid tolerant aob of the genus ca nitrosacidococcus was enriched with a relative read abundance of up to 80 fig 4 the dominant aob in the inoculum otu 38 nitrosomonas sp was closely related to the n europaea lineage and had a relative read abundance of approximately 1 see si 14 for abundance of aob n europaea was also previously found to be the dominant aob lineage in partial urine nitrification fumasoli et al 2016 between days 35 and 42 the abundance of nitrosomonas sp decreased rapidly and otu 01 emerged that had 99 3 gene identity with the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosacidococcus tergens rj19 see si 15 for phylogenetic tree ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was not detectable in the inoculum but a closely related ca nitrosacidococcus sp 99 5 gene identity was found at a low abundance of 0 004 fluctuations in the relative abundance of ca nitrosacidococcus sp appeared to be related to the variations in ammonia oxidation rates as can be seen when comparing fig 4a and b no aoa were found in the analyzed samples the last two samples 259 days and 273 days were used for metagenome sequencing due to the high enrichment level a complete circular genome of a novel ca nitrosacidococcus sp was obtained with an average nucleotide identity ani of 87 15 compared to ca nitrosacidococcus tergens picone et al 2021 and only 75 04 compared to ca nitrosoglobus terrae hayatsu et al 2017 the ani identity value was below the cut off of 95 for species delimitation and therefore the name candidatus nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 is proposed for this novel acid tolerant ammonia oxidizer named after the urine medium it was enriched on the circular genome of strain i8 consisted of 1 848 551 bp and contained 1739 protein coding sequences two full rrna operons 44 trna s 1 tmrna and 2 repeat regions genes encoding the major enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation urea utilization energy conservation carbon fixation cbb cycle glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were present and overall the genome was highly comparable to that of ca nitrosacidococcus tergens picone et al 2021 which also lacked a soluble cytochrome c554 cyca a no producing nitrite reductase nirk and the canonical amtb type transporters for ammonia uptake further they both lack a siderophore system no nitrite oxidoreductase nxr genes were found in the metagenome sequence thus no nob or comammox species were present although the inoculum had high biological nitrite oxidation rates the amplicon data are not conclusive for nob while otu 06 xanthobacteraceae unclassified had a high identity with nitrobacter sp 219 none of the nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus clustered with known nob see si 16 for phylogenetic tree it should be taken into account that the v3 v4 sequences of this bacterial group do not allow firm conclusions considering the high dominance of otu 06 and otu 09 together 11 nxr genes or metagenome sequence sequencing of the dna extracted from the inoculum could be interesting regardless the relative abundance of all nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus that were considered potential nob decreased below 0 1 after 42 days see si 16 for the relative abundance of nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus the shift in the microbial community in general around day 42 was also reflected in the decrease in microbial diversity see si 17 for boxplot which may be related to selective conditions at ph 5 and the use of cod pretreated influent the cod pretreatment step resulted in an 80 lower cod concentration in the influent compared to the influent of the original nitrification reactor and thus less heterotrophic biomass the vss concentration in the reactor decreased from 1000 mg vss l 1 to 200 mg vss l 1 within the first 50 days timeline in si 8 the particle size distribution showed that no large aggregates diameter 100 µm were formed particle size distribution in si 18 therefore a ph adaption mechanism using ph neutral microenvironments such as granules or biofilm de boer and kowalchuk 2001 can be excluded in the present system 3 5 kinetic aspects of candidatus nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 3 5 1 net growth rate at ph 5 since no sludge retention was applied the hrt was equal to the solid retention time srt from the minimum observed srt of 1 6 d a maximum net growth rate of 0 6 d 1 was estimated at ph 5 and 25 c si 19 this is higher than the maximum net growth rates of 0 18 d 1 and 0 2 d 1 reported for ca nitrosoglobus sp at ph 5 and 22 c wang et al 2021a and ca nitrosacidococcus tergens at ph 3 5 and 22 c picone et al 2021 respectively 3 5 2 short term activity tests confirm high sensitivity of acidic ammonia oxidation while a non aerated phase of 2 5 hours at neutral ph had no lasting effect on the activity of the sludge dominated by acid tolerant aob interrupting aeration at low ph caused a sharp drop of the activity by 90 fig 5 a this implies that the non aerated phase is only a problem at low ph and that the cause of the inhibitory effect must be related to the acidic conditions for instance a product of a biological or chemical reaction that only occurs at low ph such as chemical nitrite oxidation due to chemical nitrite oxidation the no concentration increases during non aerated phases see the simulation in si 20 because no is a known biocide shank et al 1962 it was suspected that the decrease in activity after anoxic conditions was related to the accumulation of no however the stripping of gaseous products including no with n2 gas for one hour resulted in a complete cessation of ammonia oxidation which means that negative effects by no are at least not the only reason for the activity decrease at low ph values fig 5b and simulation in si 21 instead the harsh conditions at low ph e g acid ph and high hno2 concentration may require continuous energy production to sustain the ph homeostasis mechanism krulwich et al 2011 which cannot be maintained during phases with low oxygen concentrations this effect might be further aggravated by the presence of no which is known to react with the respiratory chain and inhibit oxygen respiration zhou et al 2011 besides oxygen deficiency increasing the ph above 8 also resulted in an activity drop fig 6 a nh3 concentrations during the ph experiments indicated that the activity decrease was not due to inhibition by nh3 fig 6b for example in the experiment with tan of 450 mg n l 1 the activity dropped to 10 when the nh3 concentration was 20 mg n l 1 and in the experiment with tan of 1235 mg n l 1 no activity was lost despite nh3 concentrations of 40 mg n l 1 the strong ph effect above 8 could explain why an operational failure leading to continuous pumping on day 348 causing a ph increase to around 8 5 had a long lasting effect on the ammonia oxidation rate the acid tolerant aob could withstand very high hno2 concentrations of up to 30 mg n l 1 but at a concentration above 40 mg n l 1 the activity dropped sharply fig 6c for common aob in wastewater treatment hno2 half inhibition constants of 0 07 to 2 8 mg n l 1 are reported sin et al 2008 which means that they are inhibited by 91 to 99 at hno2 concentrations of 30 mg n l 1 the drop in activity at concentrations above 40 mg n l 1 could explain the cessation of ammonia oxidation following a reactor operational failure without influent such as on day 225 at a nitrite concentration of 500 mg n l 1 a ph drop below 4 2 would already lead to a hno2 concentration above 40 mg n l 1 batch experiments without ph control were performed with activated sludge from the main enrichment reactor to which either nitrite or ammonium was added the different tan concentrations did not affect the ph at which the ammonia oxidation ceased however different tnn concentrations of 350 mg n l 1 700 mg n l 1 and 1200 mg n l 1 did affect the minimum ph values reached this observation suggests that the cessation of ammonia oxidation at low ph is most likely not related to nh3 or a direct ph effect but rather to the hno2 concentration see batch experiments in si 22 it is reported that hno2 not only inhibits bacteria but is irreversibly toxic zhou et al 2011 explaining why the activity in the reactor was not immediately recovered once the ph was increased and therefore the hno2 concentration decreased again another possibility is that due to enhanced chemical nitrite oxidation at higher hno2 concentrations the acid tolerant aob are killed by the increased no concentration simulation in si 23 and not by the hno2 directly direct no measurements would be required to further investigate the role of no at values above 20 ms cm 1 salinity had an inhibitory effect on the activity of acid tolerant aob fig 6d which is consistent with what was found for acid sensitive aob in urine treatment own data faust et al 2022a and si 24 since the acid tolerant aob nitrosoglobus sp is more sensitive to salinity wang et al 2021a salinity may be the reason why ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was selected instead of nitrosoglobus sp the do affinity constant for the acid tolerant aob was estimated to be approximately ks do 0 8 mg l 1 si 25 the value is similar to the affinity constant of 1 mg l 1 reported for ca nitrosoglobus sp wang et al 2021a and within the range of 0 1 to 1 45 mg l 1 used for wastewater treatment models sin et al 2008 3 5 3 acid sensitive aob related to nitrosomonas halophila outcompeted acid tolerant aob at ph 7 potentially due to iron limitation in the long term ph experiment high ammonia oxidation rates of up to 840 mg n l 1 d 1 1060 mg n l 1 d 1 and 880 mg n l 1 d 1 were observed for ph 5 ph 6 and ph 6 5 respectively fig 7 a and b the maximum ammonia oxidation rate at ph 7 was 570 mg n l 1 d 1 disturbances in reactor operation were less problematic at higher ph than at ph 5 the ammonia oxidation rate recovered rapidly after a brief influent stop and a 16 hour interruption of aeration on day 148 and 248 respectively fig 7b as already shown in fig 5 anoxic phases are less of a problem at ph values higher than ph 5 ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was the dominant aob in a ph range from 5 to 6 5 but at ph 7 acid sensitive aob otu 16 related to the nitrosomonas halophila lineage see si 26 for phylogenetic tree took over fig 7c otu 16 was the second most abundant aob species in the inoculum after otu 51 which was closely related to nitrosomonas europaea the switch from acid tolerant to acid sensitive aob was also evident in the ph batch experiment as the batches with activated sludge from day 360 onwards did not decrease below a ph of 5 4 batch experiments in si 27 no potential nob were found from the activated sludge operated at ph values 6 6 5 and 7 see the relative abundance of nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus in si 28 the maximum observed net growth rates at ph 5 6 and 6 5 were around 0 6 d 1 see si 29 which corresponds to the value of the enrichment reactor section 3 2 nevertheless higher nitrification rates were obtained compared to the nitrification reactor due to higher influent concentrations since the srt is equal to the hrt and the flow rate depends on the ammonia oxidation rate given the same growth rate a lower maximum ammonia oxidation rate will be achieved with a lower tan concentration in the feed at ph 7 the maximum observed net growth rate decreased to 0 1 d 1 within less than a week and most likely only increased once acid sensitive aob took over nitrite oxidation rates almost completely stopped at ph 6 nar 98 and above biological nitrite oxidation was most likely inhibited initially by the hno2 concentration and at ph 7 possibly by the combined inhibitory effect of hno2 and nh3 preventing the regrowth of nob the chemical nitrite oxidation rate decreased with increasing ph due to the lower hno2 concentrations at ph 6 3 mg n l 1 ph 6 5 1 mg n l 1 compared to ph 5 15 mg n l 1 see simulations in si 13 hno2 inhibition is also most likely the reason why the dominant aob at ph values 6 and 6 5 is the acid tolerant ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 instead of acid sensitive aob linked to nitrosomonas sp which were found in partial urine nitrification at ph values between 5 8 and 7 fumasoli et al 2016 at hno2 concentrations of about 1 mg n l 1 acid sensitive aob of the n europaea cluster showed inhibition of 90 faust et al 2022a zuo et al 2022 successfully operated a partial urine nitritation system at ph 5 9 to 8 converting approximately 50 of tan to nitrite but they did not analyze the microbial community it is possible that for at least part of the experimental period the main aob was also an acid tolerant aob while partial nitritation of high strength nitrogenous influent is usually operated at alkaline ph to ensure fast growth of aob without nh3 substrate limitation jubany et al 2009 acid tolerant aob such as ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 allow high growth rates even at ph around 6 due to their high affinity for nh3 and their tolerance for hno2 the results suggest that systems for partial nitritation of high strength nitrogenous influents should be operated at ph 6 or above where chemical and biological nitrite oxidation are low and process disturbances are less critical the net growth rate of the acid tolerant aob decreased strongly at ph 7 which was not observed in the short term experiments looking at the ph dependent processes iron stands out as it is less abundant at high ph due to the iron complexation equilibrium see fe2 and fe3 speciation in si 30 as high ph increases chemical iron oxidation and decreases the solubility of iron ferguson and ingledew 2008 iron it is an important element for nitrifiers because hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao contains iron containing cytochromes liu et al 2014 another important element for nitrifiers is coppers as it is a component of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo musiani et al 2020 but the speciation of copper only shows little ph dependence see cu and cu2 speciation in si 30 therefore it was hypothesized that the decrease in activity might be related to iron limitation when additional iron was dosed into the reactor and influent a change in ph from 5 to 7 did not lead to a decrease of the ammonia oxidation rate or ca nitrosacidococcus urinae abundance fig 8 despite a reactor disturbance without airflow ammonia oxidation rates of up to 1500 mg n l 1 d 1 were achieved which was higher than at any other ph values shortly after changing the influent to urine without iron addition the activity decreased again down to a growth rate of about 0 1 d 1 see si 31 and ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was washed out the enzymes found in ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 associated with iron transport could be a possible explanation for the observed correlation between the growth of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae and the iron availability in general there are two transport mechanism based on either siderophore system or direct iron transport vajrala et al 2010 siderophore systems allow microorganisms to scavenge iron from precipitates under iron limited conditions by synthesizing iron chelating compounds krewulak and vogel 2008 while nitrosomonas europaea species possess a siderophore system and direct iron transporters chain et al 2003 the genome of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 just like that of ca nitrosacidococcus tergens rj19 lacks a siderophore system instead the ca nitrosacidococcus species contain only a high affinity iron ion uptake system that also contains a cytochrome motif cxxch the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus terrae also does not contain a siderophore system hayatsu et al 2017 but in general the iron transport mechanism of nitrifiers are not very well studied thus even though there was a strong correlation between the availability of dissolved iron and ca nitrosacidococcus urinae at neutral ph further experiment e g using transcriptomic are needed to better understand the iron uptake mechanism and the related iron limitation of acid tolerant aob 4 conclusions a novel acid tolerant aob ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 enables fast ammonia oxidation at low ph of high strength nitrogenous influents such as source separated urine ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions and high nitrogen levels is highly sensitive to process disturbances such as uncontrolled ph changes or interruption of aeration so careful operation and process control are required in addition chemical nitrite oxidation causes high nitrogen losses mostly in the form of harmful nitrogen oxide gases acid tolerant aob are scarcely present in urine nitrification reactors operated at ph values above 5 8 but they enrich in phases without ph control and are thus relevant for the process at increasing ph the activity of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae decreases which strongly correlates with the limited availability of iron at higher ph and is possibly related to the absence of a siderophore system credit authorship contribution statement valentin faust conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing original draft writing review editing

19916,acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob can open the door to new applications such as partial nitritation at low ph however they can also be problematic because chemical nitrite oxidation occurs at low ph leading to the release of harmful nitrogen oxide gases in this publication the role of acid tolerant aob in urine treatment was explored on the one hand the technical feasibility of ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions for source separated urine with total nitrogen concentrations up to 3 5 g n l 1 was investigated on the other hand the abundance and growth of acid tolerant aob at more neutral ph was explored under acidic conditions ph of 5 ammonia oxidation rates of 500 mg n l 1 d 1 and 10 g n g vss 1 d 1 were observed despite high concentrations of 15 mg n l 1 of the aob inhibiting compound nitrous acid and low concentration of 0 04 mg n l 1 of the substrate ammonia however ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions was very sensitive to process disturbances even short periods of less than 12 h without oxygen or without influent resulted in a complete cessation of ammonia oxidation with a recovery time of up to two months which is a problem for low maintenance applications such as decentralized treatment furthermore undesirable nitrogen losses of about 10 were observed under acidic conditions a novel aob strain was enriched with a relative abundance of up to 80 for which the name candidatus ca nitrosacidococcus urinae is proposed while nitrosacidococcus members were present only to a small extent 0 004 in urine nitrification reactors operated at ph values between 5 8 and 7 acid tolerant aob were always enriched during long periods without influent resulting in an uncontrolled drop in ph to as low as 2 5 long term experiments at different ph values showed that the activity of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae decreased strongly at a ph of 7 where they were also outcompeted by the acid sensitive aob nitrosomonas halophila the experiment results showed that the decreased activity of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae correlated with the limited availability of dissolved iron at neutral ph graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification acidophilic aob source separation chemical nitrite oxidation human urine life support system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrification is an essential process in wastewater treatment in which ammonia nh3 is biologically oxidized first to nitrite and then to nitrate tchobanoglous et al 2014 ammonia oxidation can be carried out by either ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa or bacteria performing complete ammonia oxidation comammox but aob are dominant in wastewater treatment stein 2019 in conventional wastewater treatment aob such as nitrosomonas eutropha are acid sensitive and their activity declines with decreasing ph due to limited availability of their substrate nh3 which protonates to ammonium nh4 and ceases completely at a ph around 5 4 due to a direct ph effect related to the energy available from the proton motive force fumasoli et al 2015 nevertheless aob activity has been observed at ph substantially below 5 4 demonstrating the existence of acid tolerant aob fumasoli et al 2017 low ph values may occur when the alkalinity is insufficient to neutralize the protons released during ammonia oxidation examples of alkalinity limited wastewaters include source separated urine fumasoli et al 2016 digester supernatant udert et al 2008 and the effluent of chemically enhanced primary treatment with iron dosing taboada santos et al 2020 acid tolerant aob have been shown not only to survive at low ph values and have a high affinity for nh3 below 1 μg n l 1 wang et al 2021a but also to withstand high free nitrous acid hno2 concentrations of more than 3 mg n l 1 wang et al 2021b in contrast to aob no lower ph limit for nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is reported however at low ph nob are often inhibited by hno2 and chemical nitrite oxidation may become the dominant process for nitrite conversion udert et al 2005 ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions has been tested for various applications acid tolerant aob were used by li et al 2020 as the first step of partial nitritation anammox in which partial nitritation was successfully achieved at ph values around 5 by suppressing nob with hno2 for highly diluted urine with total nitrogen tn concentrations of about 200 mg n l 1 since anammox bacteria are acid sensitive li et al 2020 suggested mixing the effluent with untreated urine to achieve a neutral ph in a similar approach wang et al 2021b maintained partial nitritation at ph 4 5 to 5 using acid tolerant aob for a mixture of sewage with sidestream anaerobic digestion liquor with a tn concentration of about 100 mg n l 1 verhave et al 2009 filed a patent concerning a process combining ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions and controlled chemical nitrite oxidation for the conversion of liquid manure into an ammonium nitrate fertilizer the patent application however was abandoned acid tolerant aob were also used to achieve self sustaining hno2 accumulation at low ph to enhance volatile solid destruction and nitrogen removal during aerobic digestion of waste activated sludge duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021c last but not least acid tolerant aob have been used for the bioconversion of methane to methanol at low ph zhang et al 2021 even though ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions could open the door to new applications the process can be problematic because during the chemical oxidation of nitrite harmful gases such as nitric oxide no nitrogen dioxide no2 hno2 and potentially n2o are released udert et al 2005 one example from practice is an air biofilter from a pig stable in which ammonia was found to be converted to nitrate at ph 2 5 by acid tolerant aob and chemical nitrite oxidation but at the same time no and no2 gases were emitted picone et al 2021 in urine nitrification acid tolerant aob were a potential problem during long periods of low or no influent as the ph dropped to values as low as 2 2 without alkalinity increase due to urine dosage such low ph resulted in nitrite instead of nitrate in the effluent and the release of harmful nitrogen oxide gases fumasoli et al 2017 this is particularly dangerous for decentralized in building settings or space applications such as the european space agency s micro ecological life support system alternative melissa program where urine is supposed to be nitrified without the formation of harmful by products clauwaert et al 2017 in addition the release of volatile nitrogen oxides results in nitrogen losses diminishing the potential for nutrient recovery in the above listed research projects about acid tolerant aob different strains were found while li et al 2020 and fumasoli et al 2016 observed the growth of nitrosospira sp wang et al 2021b found a nitrosoglobus sp closely related to the non halophilic candidatus ca nitrosoglobus terrae enriched from acidic tea soils hayatsu et al 2017 in contrast picone et al 2021 characterized a novel aob with high identity to sequences found in reactors treating synthetic urine by fumasoli et al 2017 and proposed the name ca nitrosacidococcus tergens this bacterium was able to grow not only on ammonia but also on urea at ph values as low as 2 5 at neutral ph acid tolerant aobs are usually not abundant and acid sensitive aob dominate the nitrifying community wang et al 2021a argued that the acid tolerant aob nitrosoglobus sp are less competitive than acid sensitive aob such as nitrosomonas sp in ph neutral wastewater treatment processes mainly due to their low maximum growth rate of 0 3 d 1 compared for example to 1 4 d 1 for nitrosomonas europaea nevertheless the effect of a more neutral ph e g ph 7 on the activity of acid tolerant aob is unclear and results from short term experiments are contradictory in wang et al 2021a the activity was similar at ph 5 and 7 in li et al 2020 the activity increased with increasing ph value and in picone et al 2021 the activity decreased at ph 7 compared to ph 5 these observations cannot be explained by substrate nh3 limitation and product hno2 inhibition which are common approaches used in activate sludge models sin et al 2008 so far the ph dependency of acid tolerant aob has only been determined with short term experiments no long term experiments have been performed to investigate the activity of acid tolerant aob at neutral ph this publication addresses the role of acid tolerant aob in urine treatment and had two main objectives 1 to investigate the technical suitability of ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions ph 5 for source separated urine with tn concentrations up to 3500 mg n l 1 2 to investigate the abundance and growth of acid tolerant aob at neutral ph values a better understanding of the behavior of acid tolerant aob at neutral ph also helps to develop strategies to avoid the growth of acid tolerant aob specifically the following four research questions were addressed what are the most important aob selected under acidic conditions and high tn concentrations how well is acidic ammonia oxidation of source separated urine suited for technical applications especially with regard to process stability how abundant are acid tolerant aob in urine nitrification reactors operated at ph values between 5 8 and 7 what is the long term effect of neutral ph values on the activity of acid tolerant aob and what is the underlying mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch incubation the transition from acid sensitive to acid tolerant aob was investigated in several batch incubation experiments for this purpose activated sludge from the urine nitrification reactors at eawag dübendorf switzerland which were operated at ph values between 5 8 and 7 faust et al 2022b was added to an aerobic batch reactor without influent and ph control due to ammonia oxidation the ph dropped and a ph decrease well below 5 4 indicated the growth of acid tolerant aob the oxygen concentration was controlled between 4 and 6 mg l 1 with an on off controller 2 2 setup and operation of the enrichment reactor an ammonia oxidation reactor was operated under acidic conditions ph of 5 for 700 days to enrich acid tolerant aob an aerobic 12 l continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr without sludge retention was used to have a dynamic but simple system more details are included in the supplementary information si 1 the reactor was operated with suspended activated sludge with an inlet at the bottom and an overflow at the top through which effluent and activated sludge were discharged to start up the reactor activated sludge was added from an urine nitrification reactor at eawag as described before section 2 1 but once the ph decreased to 4 9 due to ammonia oxidation the influent was used to control the ph between 4 9 and 5 with an on off controller stored source separated urine from waterless urinals and nomix toilets gundlach et al 2021 with low chemical oxidation demand cod was used as influent ph 8 5 during storage urea was fully hydrolyzed to ammoniacal nitrogen udert et al 2006 to produce low cod influent a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr was used in which approximately 80 of the cod was degraded without nitrification separating cod degradation from nitrification allowed an enriched culture of aob by avoiding high concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria the temperature in the reactor was controlled at 25 c except for a period in summer when the temperature rose above 30 c for two weeks due to very high outdoor temperatures dissolved oxygen do was controlled between 4 and 6 mg l 1 using humidified air via an on off controller 2 3 short term respirometric activity tests the effect of hno2 ph nh3 salinity and do including anoxic conditions on the activity of acid tolerant aob was evaluated with short term activity experiments in a 3 l respirometer set up and experimental procedure in si 2 the respirometer was operated either as two chamber lss respirometer lss static gas static liquid or two chamber lsf respirometer lsf static gas flowing liquid van loosdrecht et al 2016 activated sludge from the enrichment reactor was used for the activity tests the ph in the respirometer was controlled with 0 4 m naoh and 0 4 m hcl and the temperature was set at 25 c 2 4 long term ph and iron experiments the effects of ph and iron on acid tolerant aob were further investigated in two long term experiments lasting 400 days and 70 days respectively in the first experiment a 12 l reactor was operated as previously described section 2 2 and after 100 days the ph set points were stepwise increased from 4 9 5 to 5 9 6 6 4 6 5 and 6 9 7 with at least four weeks between changes in the second experiment a 12 l reactor was incubated with activated sludge from another acidic ammonia oxidation reactor and after three weeks of operation the ph set points were increased from 4 9 5 to 6 9 7 concomitant with the ph increase fecl3 3 mg fe l 1 and the chelating agent nitrilotriacetic acid nta were added to the reactor and the influent at a ratio of 1 mol nta mol fe 1 after another five weeks the reactor was again fed with influent without iron addition to test whether acid tolerant aob were still abundant 2 l of activated sludge were removed from the 12 l reactor washed with nitrified urine and added to an aerobic batch reactor without influent or ph control as described previously section 2 1 again a ph decrease well below 5 4 indicated the presence of acid tolerant aob 2 5 chemical nitrite oxidation model a model was used to investigate whether the observed nitrate production could be explained by chemical nitrite oxidation processes kinetic and stoichiometric data of chemical nitrite oxidation were taken from udert et al 2005 and integrated in a sumo2 model using the sumo19 wastewater treatment software dynamita france the chemical nitrite oxidation consisted of the three nitrogen compounds equilibria and the chemical nitrite oxidation as shown in eqs 1 to 4 for completeness the chemical oxidation of ammonia was also added eqs 5 and 6 all biological processes were turned off and only chemical and physical processes were considered the measured flow rates the tan total ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n nh4 n in the influent the observed amount of ammonia oxidized to nitrite in the reactor about 50 due to the limited alkalinity and the measured ph in the reactor were used as model inputs based on these input variables the model calculated how much nitrite can be chemically converted to nitrate more information as well as all

bioproject database with accession number prjeb52462 3 results and discussion 3 1 reproducible growth of acid tolerant aob during long phases without ph control in the 13 batch incubations without influent or base addition the ph of activated sludge from urine nitrification reactors always dropped below 5 within 10 to 47 days indicating reproducible growth of acid tolerant aob as an example of a typical incubation experiment fig 1 a shows the ph timeline of the enrichment reactor the ph decreased to about 5 5 within hours where ammonia oxidation ceased and the ph remained or increased slightly a similar ph limit of 5 4 was reported in fumasoli et al 2015 for partial nitrification of synthetic urine the slight increase in ph during the idle phase could be related to co2 volatilization after 20 days a second ph decrease was observed which can be explained by microbial ammonia oxidation udert et al 2005 indicating the growth of acid tolerant aob when the ph had reached a value of 5 after 28 days the enrichment reactor was controlled with the influent at ph 4 9 to 5 the start up procedure was repeated using twelve sludge inocula from different urine nitrification reactors while the ph values always decreased below 5 the time required varied strongly fig 1b no correlation was found between the time required for the ph to drop below 5 and different variables such as the operating ph before stopping the influent the temperature or the vss concentration see si 6 for scatterplot therefore the different duration of growth cannot be explained with the available data the long idle phase of at least 10 days between the first drop in ph to about 5 4 and the second drop in ph strongly suggests that the dominant aob in all inocula were acid sensitive and that the number of acid tolerant aob was low when the ph was not controlled at around 5 the ph continued to decrease to values as low as 2 5 see ph timeline of all inocula in si 7 which has also been observed by fumasoli et al 2017 3 2 ammonia oxidation at low ph is fast but unstable in the enrichment reactor ammonia oxidation rates with a maximum of about 500 mg n l 1 d 1 and specific rates of 10 g n g vss 1 d 1 were observed at 25 c despite high hno2 concentrations of 15 mg n l 1 and low nh3 concentrations of 0 04 mg n l 1 fig 2 at such high hno2 and low nh3 concentrations the activity of the most common aob in wastewater treatment is severely reduced sin et al 2008 the maximum rates are of the same order of magnitude as those previously found for nitrification at ph 5 8 to 6 fumasoli et al 2016 where rates between 120 to 640 mg n l 1 d 1 were reported for a moving bed biofilm reactor four different types of operational disturbances occurred fig 2b resulting in sharp drops in the ammonia oxidation rates see si 9 for details about the operational disturbances i influent stop and thus no ph control resulted in a ph drop to values as low as 4 and increased hno2 concentrations ii interruption of aeration led to anoxic conditions in the reactor during 3 to 15 h iii uncontrolled continuous pumping of around 12 l equivalent to one reactor volume for 12 h resulted in a ph increase to as high as 8 5 and biomass washout iv insufficient temperature control resulted in temperatures as high as 33 c the system always recovered but it took up to two months to reach the ammonia oxidation rate the system had before the operational disturbances this is not a system artifact as the acidic reactor in which the ca nitrosacidococcus tergens dominated was also very sensitive to short periods without oxygen or substrate supply h j m op den camp personal communication 15 01 2022 around day 60 and day 700 the ammonia oxidation rate also decreased although no obvious process control error occurred however the failure after 700 days might be linked to an increase in the influent concentration due to a change of the influent tank in other acidic ammonia oxidation systems where the solid retention time srt was controlled with a membrane bioreactor such large fluctuations in ammonia oxidation rates were not observed picone et al 2021 wang et al 2021b therefore controlling the srt could lead to a more stable ammonia oxidation rate nevertheless process disturbances such as lack of aeration or influent would still result in high activity losses with long recovery times overcoming such obstacles would require detailed planning e g to avoid running out of urine frequent maintenance e g to avoid pump failure and very careful operation 3 3 chemical nitrite oxidation caused high gaseous nitrogen losses nitrate in the enrichment reactor was mainly produced by chemical nitrite oxidation except for a first peak observed after 40 days nitrite oxidation rates were below 80 mg n l 1 d 1 throughout the 700 day experiment fig 2 most likely the first peak was caused by biological nitrite oxidation but once the hno2 concentration exceeded 0 5 mg n l 1 around day 42 the biological rate decreased and chemical nitrite oxidation became dominant as common nob are strongly inhibited already at hno2 concentrations of 0 1 mg n l 1 sin et al 2008 the nitrite accumulation ratio nar which is the amount of nitrite not converted to nitrate was on average 77 excluding the start up phase timeline of nar in si 10 during periods with hydraulic retention times hrt of less than 2 days nar increased to 94 tan and the sum of tnn and nitrate n were in a ratio of about 1 1 which was expected due to the limited alkalinity of urine fumasoli et al 2016 dissolved nitrogen losses were 11 of the nitrogen in the influent see si 11 for timeline for comparison in urine nitrification at ph values between 5 8 and 6 and low hno2 concentrations fumasoli et al 2016 reported that nitrogen losses were negligible li et al 2020 also reported lower nitrogen losses of up to 4 for partial nitritation under acidic conditions since nitrogen was most likely lost as gaseous no and no2 fumasoli et al 2017 the higher chemical nitrite oxidation rate due to higher hno2 concentrations see next paragraph in this research project may explain the observed difference fumasoli et al 2017 on the other hand reported higher nitrogen losses of about 50 at ph 2 5 which most likely was related to the high hrt of 88 days the chemical nitrite oxidation model predicted the tnn and nitrate concentrations well with model efficiencies of 0 88 and 0 94 respectively fig 3 only the first peak of nitrite oxidation around day 40 was not well captured by chemical nitrite oxidation see si 12 this confirms that biological nitrite oxidation was initially observed but with increasing hno2 concentrations and decreasing hrt nob are washed out and chemical nitrite oxidation became dominant an operational failure that resulted in a drop in ph to 4 and increased chemical nitrite oxidation on day 226 was also well captured by the model according to the model the chemical nitrite oxidation rate increases with increasing hno2 and do concentrations in the reactor see simulations in si 13 zuo et al 2022 used the chemical nitrite oxidation model with the same rate constants and also obtained a good fit but this is the first time the model has been used for continuous operation 3 4 high abundance of novel candidatus nitrosacidococcus urinae at low ph an acid tolerant aob of the genus ca nitrosacidococcus was enriched with a relative read abundance of up to 80 fig 4 the dominant aob in the inoculum otu 38 nitrosomonas sp was closely related to the n europaea lineage and had a relative read abundance of approximately 1 see si 14 for abundance of aob n europaea was also previously found to be the dominant aob lineage in partial urine nitrification fumasoli et al 2016 between days 35 and 42 the abundance of nitrosomonas sp decreased rapidly and otu 01 emerged that had 99 3 gene identity with the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosacidococcus tergens rj19 see si 15 for phylogenetic tree ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was not detectable in the inoculum but a closely related ca nitrosacidococcus sp 99 5 gene identity was found at a low abundance of 0 004 fluctuations in the relative abundance of ca nitrosacidococcus sp appeared to be related to the variations in ammonia oxidation rates as can be seen when comparing fig 4a and b no aoa were found in the analyzed samples the last two samples 259 days and 273 days were used for metagenome sequencing due to the high enrichment level a complete circular genome of a novel ca nitrosacidococcus sp was obtained with an average nucleotide identity ani of 87 15 compared to ca nitrosacidococcus tergens picone et al 2021 and only 75 04 compared to ca nitrosoglobus terrae hayatsu et al 2017 the ani identity value was below the cut off of 95 for species delimitation and therefore the name candidatus nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 is proposed for this novel acid tolerant ammonia oxidizer named after the urine medium it was enriched on the circular genome of strain i8 consisted of 1 848 551 bp and contained 1739 protein coding sequences two full rrna operons 44 trna s 1 tmrna and 2 repeat regions genes encoding the major enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation urea utilization energy conservation carbon fixation cbb cycle glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were present and overall the genome was highly comparable to that of ca nitrosacidococcus tergens picone et al 2021 which also lacked a soluble cytochrome c554 cyca a no producing nitrite reductase nirk and the canonical amtb type transporters for ammonia uptake further they both lack a siderophore system no nitrite oxidoreductase nxr genes were found in the metagenome sequence thus no nob or comammox species were present although the inoculum had high biological nitrite oxidation rates the amplicon data are not conclusive for nob while otu 06 xanthobacteraceae unclassified had a high identity with nitrobacter sp 219 none of the nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus clustered with known nob see si 16 for phylogenetic tree it should be taken into account that the v3 v4 sequences of this bacterial group do not allow firm conclusions considering the high dominance of otu 06 and otu 09 together 11 nxr genes or metagenome sequence sequencing of the dna extracted from the inoculum could be interesting regardless the relative abundance of all nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus that were considered potential nob decreased below 0 1 after 42 days see si 16 for the relative abundance of nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus the shift in the microbial community in general around day 42 was also reflected in the decrease in microbial diversity see si 17 for boxplot which may be related to selective conditions at ph 5 and the use of cod pretreated influent the cod pretreatment step resulted in an 80 lower cod concentration in the influent compared to the influent of the original nitrification reactor and thus less heterotrophic biomass the vss concentration in the reactor decreased from 1000 mg vss l 1 to 200 mg vss l 1 within the first 50 days timeline in si 8 the particle size distribution showed that no large aggregates diameter 100 µm were formed particle size distribution in si 18 therefore a ph adaption mechanism using ph neutral microenvironments such as granules or biofilm de boer and kowalchuk 2001 can be excluded in the present system 3 5 kinetic aspects of candidatus nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 3 5 1 net growth rate at ph 5 since no sludge retention was applied the hrt was equal to the solid retention time srt from the minimum observed srt of 1 6 d a maximum net growth rate of 0 6 d 1 was estimated at ph 5 and 25 c si 19 this is higher than the maximum net growth rates of 0 18 d 1 and 0 2 d 1 reported for ca nitrosoglobus sp at ph 5 and 22 c wang et al 2021a and ca nitrosacidococcus tergens at ph 3 5 and 22 c picone et al 2021 respectively 3 5 2 short term activity tests confirm high sensitivity of acidic ammonia oxidation while a non aerated phase of 2 5 hours at neutral ph had no lasting effect on the activity of the sludge dominated by acid tolerant aob interrupting aeration at low ph caused a sharp drop of the activity by 90 fig 5 a this implies that the non aerated phase is only a problem at low ph and that the cause of the inhibitory effect must be related to the acidic conditions for instance a product of a biological or chemical reaction that only occurs at low ph such as chemical nitrite oxidation due to chemical nitrite oxidation the no concentration increases during non aerated phases see the simulation in si 20 because no is a known biocide shank et al 1962 it was suspected that the decrease in activity after anoxic conditions was related to the accumulation of no however the stripping of gaseous products including no with n2 gas for one hour resulted in a complete cessation of ammonia oxidation which means that negative effects by no are at least not the only reason for the activity decrease at low ph values fig 5b and simulation in si 21 instead the harsh conditions at low ph e g acid ph and high hno2 concentration may require continuous energy production to sustain the ph homeostasis mechanism krulwich et al 2011 which cannot be maintained during phases with low oxygen concentrations this effect might be further aggravated by the presence of no which is known to react with the respiratory chain and inhibit oxygen respiration zhou et al 2011 besides oxygen deficiency increasing the ph above 8 also resulted in an activity drop fig 6 a nh3 concentrations during the ph experiments indicated that the activity decrease was not due to inhibition by nh3 fig 6b for example in the experiment with tan of 450 mg n l 1 the activity dropped to 10 when the nh3 concentration was 20 mg n l 1 and in the experiment with tan of 1235 mg n l 1 no activity was lost despite nh3 concentrations of 40 mg n l 1 the strong ph effect above 8 could explain why an operational failure leading to continuous pumping on day 348 causing a ph increase to around 8 5 had a long lasting effect on the ammonia oxidation rate the acid tolerant aob could withstand very high hno2 concentrations of up to 30 mg n l 1 but at a concentration above 40 mg n l 1 the activity dropped sharply fig 6c for common aob in wastewater treatment hno2 half inhibition constants of 0 07 to 2 8 mg n l 1 are reported sin et al 2008 which means that they are inhibited by 91 to 99 at hno2 concentrations of 30 mg n l 1 the drop in activity at concentrations above 40 mg n l 1 could explain the cessation of ammonia oxidation following a reactor operational failure without influent such as on day 225 at a nitrite concentration of 500 mg n l 1 a ph drop below 4 2 would already lead to a hno2 concentration above 40 mg n l 1 batch experiments without ph control were performed with activated sludge from the main enrichment reactor to which either nitrite or ammonium was added the different tan concentrations did not affect the ph at which the ammonia oxidation ceased however different tnn concentrations of 350 mg n l 1 700 mg n l 1 and 1200 mg n l 1 did affect the minimum ph values reached this observation suggests that the cessation of ammonia oxidation at low ph is most likely not related to nh3 or a direct ph effect but rather to the hno2 concentration see batch experiments in si 22 it is reported that hno2 not only inhibits bacteria but is irreversibly toxic zhou et al 2011 explaining why the activity in the reactor was not immediately recovered once the ph was increased and therefore the hno2 concentration decreased again another possibility is that due to enhanced chemical nitrite oxidation at higher hno2 concentrations the acid tolerant aob are killed by the increased no concentration simulation in si 23 and not by the hno2 directly direct no measurements would be required to further investigate the role of no at values above 20 ms cm 1 salinity had an inhibitory effect on the activity of acid tolerant aob fig 6d which is consistent with what was found for acid sensitive aob in urine treatment own data faust et al 2022a and si 24 since the acid tolerant aob nitrosoglobus sp is more sensitive to salinity wang et al 2021a salinity may be the reason why ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was selected instead of nitrosoglobus sp the do affinity constant for the acid tolerant aob was estimated to be approximately ks do 0 8 mg l 1 si 25 the value is similar to the affinity constant of 1 mg l 1 reported for ca nitrosoglobus sp wang et al 2021a and within the range of 0 1 to 1 45 mg l 1 used for wastewater treatment models sin et al 2008 3 5 3 acid sensitive aob related to nitrosomonas halophila outcompeted acid tolerant aob at ph 7 potentially due to iron limitation in the long term ph experiment high ammonia oxidation rates of up to 840 mg n l 1 d 1 1060 mg n l 1 d 1 and 880 mg n l 1 d 1 were observed for ph 5 ph 6 and ph 6 5 respectively fig 7 a and b the maximum ammonia oxidation rate at ph 7 was 570 mg n l 1 d 1 disturbances in reactor operation were less problematic at higher ph than at ph 5 the ammonia oxidation rate recovered rapidly after a brief influent stop and a 16 hour interruption of aeration on day 148 and 248 respectively fig 7b as already shown in fig 5 anoxic phases are less of a problem at ph values higher than ph 5 ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was the dominant aob in a ph range from 5 to 6 5 but at ph 7 acid sensitive aob otu 16 related to the nitrosomonas halophila lineage see si 26 for phylogenetic tree took over fig 7c otu 16 was the second most abundant aob species in the inoculum after otu 51 which was closely related to nitrosomonas europaea the switch from acid tolerant to acid sensitive aob was also evident in the ph batch experiment as the batches with activated sludge from day 360 onwards did not decrease below a ph of 5 4 batch experiments in si 27 no potential nob were found from the activated sludge operated at ph values 6 6 5 and 7 see the relative abundance of nitrobacter and xanthobacteraceae linked otus in si 28 the maximum observed net growth rates at ph 5 6 and 6 5 were around 0 6 d 1 see si 29 which corresponds to the value of the enrichment reactor section 3 2 nevertheless higher nitrification rates were obtained compared to the nitrification reactor due to higher influent concentrations since the srt is equal to the hrt and the flow rate depends on the ammonia oxidation rate given the same growth rate a lower maximum ammonia oxidation rate will be achieved with a lower tan concentration in the feed at ph 7 the maximum observed net growth rate decreased to 0 1 d 1 within less than a week and most likely only increased once acid sensitive aob took over nitrite oxidation rates almost completely stopped at ph 6 nar 98 and above biological nitrite oxidation was most likely inhibited initially by the hno2 concentration and at ph 7 possibly by the combined inhibitory effect of hno2 and nh3 preventing the regrowth of nob the chemical nitrite oxidation rate decreased with increasing ph due to the lower hno2 concentrations at ph 6 3 mg n l 1 ph 6 5 1 mg n l 1 compared to ph 5 15 mg n l 1 see simulations in si 13 hno2 inhibition is also most likely the reason why the dominant aob at ph values 6 and 6 5 is the acid tolerant ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 instead of acid sensitive aob linked to nitrosomonas sp which were found in partial urine nitrification at ph values between 5 8 and 7 fumasoli et al 2016 at hno2 concentrations of about 1 mg n l 1 acid sensitive aob of the n europaea cluster showed inhibition of 90 faust et al 2022a zuo et al 2022 successfully operated a partial urine nitritation system at ph 5 9 to 8 converting approximately 50 of tan to nitrite but they did not analyze the microbial community it is possible that for at least part of the experimental period the main aob was also an acid tolerant aob while partial nitritation of high strength nitrogenous influent is usually operated at alkaline ph to ensure fast growth of aob without nh3 substrate limitation jubany et al 2009 acid tolerant aob such as ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 allow high growth rates even at ph around 6 due to their high affinity for nh3 and their tolerance for hno2 the results suggest that systems for partial nitritation of high strength nitrogenous influents should be operated at ph 6 or above where chemical and biological nitrite oxidation are low and process disturbances are less critical the net growth rate of the acid tolerant aob decreased strongly at ph 7 which was not observed in the short term experiments looking at the ph dependent processes iron stands out as it is less abundant at high ph due to the iron complexation equilibrium see fe2 and fe3 speciation in si 30 as high ph increases chemical iron oxidation and decreases the solubility of iron ferguson and ingledew 2008 iron it is an important element for nitrifiers because hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao contains iron containing cytochromes liu et al 2014 another important element for nitrifiers is coppers as it is a component of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo musiani et al 2020 but the speciation of copper only shows little ph dependence see cu and cu2 speciation in si 30 therefore it was hypothesized that the decrease in activity might be related to iron limitation when additional iron was dosed into the reactor and influent a change in ph from 5 to 7 did not lead to a decrease of the ammonia oxidation rate or ca nitrosacidococcus urinae abundance fig 8 despite a reactor disturbance without airflow ammonia oxidation rates of up to 1500 mg n l 1 d 1 were achieved which was higher than at any other ph values shortly after changing the influent to urine without iron addition the activity decreased again down to a growth rate of about 0 1 d 1 see si 31 and ca nitrosacidococcus urinae was washed out the enzymes found in ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 associated with iron transport could be a possible explanation for the observed correlation between the growth of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae and the iron availability in general there are two transport mechanism based on either siderophore system or direct iron transport vajrala et al 2010 siderophore systems allow microorganisms to scavenge iron from precipitates under iron limited conditions by synthesizing iron chelating compounds krewulak and vogel 2008 while nitrosomonas europaea species possess a siderophore system and direct iron transporters chain et al 2003 the genome of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 just like that of ca nitrosacidococcus tergens rj19 lacks a siderophore system instead the ca nitrosacidococcus species contain only a high affinity iron ion uptake system that also contains a cytochrome motif cxxch the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus terrae also does not contain a siderophore system hayatsu et al 2017 but in general the iron transport mechanism of nitrifiers are not very well studied thus even though there was a strong correlation between the availability of dissolved iron and ca nitrosacidococcus urinae at neutral ph further experiment e g using transcriptomic are needed to better understand the iron uptake mechanism and the related iron limitation of acid tolerant aob 4 conclusions a novel acid tolerant aob ca nitrosacidococcus urinae i8 enables fast ammonia oxidation at low ph of high strength nitrogenous influents such as source separated urine ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions and high nitrogen levels is highly sensitive to process disturbances such as uncontrolled ph changes or interruption of aeration so careful operation and process control are required in addition chemical nitrite oxidation causes high nitrogen losses mostly in the form of harmful nitrogen oxide gases acid tolerant aob are scarcely present in urine nitrification reactors operated at ph values above 5 8 but they enrich in phases without ph control and are thus relevant for the process at increasing ph the activity of ca nitrosacidococcus urinae decreases which strongly correlates with the limited availability of iron at higher ph and is possibly related to the absence of a siderophore system credit authorship contribution statement valentin faust conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing original draft writing review editing

19917,uv c at 254 nm and vacuum uv vuv at 185 nm are the two major emission lines of a low pressure mercury lamp upon absorption of vuv photons water molecules and selected inorganic anions generate hydroxyl ho and other redox radicals both capable of degrading organic micropollutants omps thereby offering the opportunity to reduce h2o2 and energy consumption in uv based advanced oxidation process aop to be successfully scaled up the dual wavelength vuv uv h2o2 aop requires laboratory scale experiments to establish design criteria the figures of merit typically used for reporting and interpreting quasi collimated beam results for uv based aops time dose absorbed energy and eeo are insufficient and inaccurate when employed for dual wavelength aop such as the vuv uv h2o2 aop and do not support system scale up in this study we introduce a novel figure of merit useful absorbed energy uae defined as fraction of absorbed energy that results in the generation of oxidative radicals here results of quasi collimated beam vuv uv h2o2 aop experiments on four different water matrices are used to introduce 2d plots that employ both uaeuv and uaevuv as a novel method to represent laboratory scale experiments of vuv uv h2o2 aop and demonstrate how the 2d plots sufficiently support scale up of the aop graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes organic micropollutants quasi collimated beam uv h2o2 vacuum ultraviolet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing use of pharmaceuticals detergents personal care products fire fighting agents dyes and other anthropogenic chemicals to support modern life have resulted the introduction of these chemicals and their transformation products into the environment as micropollutants conventional biological treatment processes at waste water treatment plants are inadequate to remove many of these micropollutants capodaglio 2020 cuerda correa et al 2020 toor and mohseni 2007 advanced oxidation processes aops however have been proven to degrade the vast majority of organic micropollutants omps deng and zhao 2015 and are increasingly being incorporated as polishing steps in water treatment particularly for applications of potable reuse cao et al 2022 p sun et al 2019 uv based aops employ uv radiation that generates radicals via photochemical reactions with oxidants the oxidative radicals attack the omps either generating transformation products or completely mineralizing them into co2 and h2o the efficacy of an aop in degrading omps depends on the photon and oxidative radical scavenging capacity of the water sample rosenfeldt and linden 2007 along with the design of the reactor uv h2o2 aop is one of the most extensively applied uv based aops zhan et al 2021 uv photons at 254 nm hereafter referred to as uv from a low pressure mercury lp hg lamp generates ho via the homolysis of h2o2 molecule eq 1 quantum yield φ in a photochemical reaction is defined as the amount of reactant consumed or product formed per photon absorbed for the photolysis of h2o2 by uv φ 0 5 in terms of h2o2 consumed and φ 1 in terms of ho produced because there are two ho produced per homolysis of h2o2 molecule 1 h 2 o 2 h ν 254 nm 2 h o φ 0 5 h2o2 is an inefficient absorber of uv because of its low molar absorption coefficient 20 m 1 cm 1 weeks et al 1963 therefore only 5 10 of h2o2 that is dosed is utilized in most drinking water practices rosenfeldt et al 2013 consequently quenching of h2o2 is needed rendering uv h2o2 aop both energy and chemical intensive keen et al 2013 and improvement of uv h2o2 aop is necessary for its broader use in the water industry the second major emission line of a lp hg lamp is at 185 nm hereafter referred to as vuv vuv is transmitted from the lamp when an appropriate lamp sleeve is used claus 2021 and no additional electrical energy is required for its generation vuv generates ho among other redox radicals via photolysis eq 2 and homolysis eq 3 of water molecules therefore combining vuv and conventional uv aop could reduce the h2o2 required and thereby the chemical cost to achieve degradation of omps contrary to the poor absorbance of uv by h2o2 in vuv aop all incident vuv photons are absorbed by water or other major absorbers to generate radicals thus the inherent efficiency of vuv aop is substantially higher than uv h2o2 aop the ho degrades the omps to form transformation products 2 h 2 o h ν 200 nm h o h φ 0 33 3 h 2 o h ν 200 nm h o h e aq φ 0 045 due to the high absorption by pure water at 25 c 1 76cm 1 weeks et al 1963 at 55 55 m water concentration more than 90 of emitted vuv photons are absorbed within 6 mm of the water surface the absorbance in real water matrices in this study are even higher table 1 on the contrary the penetration distance at which 90 of uv at 254 nm is absorbed can vary from 5 20 cm at uv transmittance uvt of 56 and 89 per cm respectively optimizing a reactor for both the short penetrating vuv and relatively longer penetrating uv is challenging most of the laboratory scale configurations like quasi collimated beam apparatus qcb baeza and knappe 2011 duca et al 2017 fang et al 2014 feng et al 2007 annular reactors ngouyap mouamfon et al 2011 zhan et al 2021 zoschke et al 2012 and micro fluidic vacuum uv reactors yang et al 2018 employed in vuv research have small mean reactor pathlengths that favorably uses vuv over uv despite extensive research published using laboratory scale vuv reactors there are scarce applications of vuv reported at pilot scale krakko et al 2021 absence of a standard methodology to accurately represent the experimental qcb data and inform scale up of vuv aop stalls practical applications of this potentially chemical free aop the performance of vuv uv h2o2 aop depends on the design of the reactor fluid hydrodynamics water matrix and even the specific omps targeted for degradation such complexities are not accounted for in the simple figure of merits currently used time s dose mj cm 2 absorbed energy kwh m 3 electrical energy per order eeo kwh m 3 etc and consequently analysis based on these figures of merit risk under or over estimating the efficacy of vuv aop for example time based analysis of experiments performed in the aforementioned literature might lead to erroneous conclusion of a higher efficacy of vuv aop than uv h2o2 aop because of the reactor design that favors the utilization of vuv therefore development of a new methodology to represent and analyze laboratory scale experimental results of vuv uv h2o2 aop is warranted in this paper the merits and limitations of existing methodologies for interpreting laboratory scale results are discussed a novel figure of merit useful absorbed energy uae is introduced as an improvement to these limitations using experiments on various real water matrices 2d plots employing uaeuv and uaevuv is demonstrated as a new methodology for interpreting results of qcb experiments for vuv uv h2o2 aop these 2d plots can be used to predict the maximum degradation of targeted omps and predict the energy requirements in a vuv aop uv h2o2 aop and vuv uv h2o2 aop thereby allowing qcb data to be used for scale up of these aops additionally the 2d plots inform the advantage of varying the uv to vuv output ratio of a lamp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental reactor configurations the qcb apparatus see fig s1 consisted of a lamp housing and a collimator both purged with nitrogen n 2 gas to prevent the formation of ozone o 3 which would otherwise be formed when vuv is absorbed by atmospheric oxygen o 2 oppenlaender 2003 a 22 5 w low pressure mercury lamp with major emission lines at uv and vuv was used the distance between the center of the lamp and the surface of the sample was 33 cm the distance was fixed based on a petri factor of 0 97 bolton and linden 2003 the diameter of the collimator was 5 0 5 cm the outlet of the collimator was equipped with a shutter which was closed after each irradiation experiment with an accuracy of 5 s a closed cylindrical quartz cell type 35 q starna scientific germany was filled with sample and placed directly under the collimator a stir plate placed under the cell ensured the sample is well mixed il1700 radiometer employing the sed254 ns254 and sed185 ns185 detectors international light technologies inc massachusetts were used to measure the uv and vuv irradiations respectively three different advanced oxidation processes aop were evaluated using the qcb setup 1 vuv uv h2o2 aop 2 uv h2o2 aop and 3 vuv uv aop in case of vuv uv h2o2 aop and vuv uv aop the sample with and without h2o2 respectively was placed under the qcb setup and irradiated to block vuv from reaching the sample in uv h2o2 aop experiments a closed cylindrical quartz cell 1 cm filled with 4 m nacl was placed on top of the sample cell this arrangement also resulted in a reduction of 23 of incident uv irradiation which was accounted for in analyses of results 2 2 chemical analyses anions and cations were measured using ion chromatography using a thermo scientific dionex aquion with a dionex ionpac as22 rfic column and dionex ionpac ag22 rfic pre column total in organic carbon was measured using a shimadzu toc

with a uhplc guard zorbax eclipse plus c18 1 8 μm 2 1 5 mm pre column the flow rate was set at 0 25 ml min 1 and the column temperature was maintained at 40 c for the ms an agilent 6420 triple quadrupole qqq mass analyzer with electrospray ion source was used table 1 indicates the quality of various water matrices experimented in this study 2 3 determination of uv and vuv transmittance of samples a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer at 254 nm was used to measure uvt of the samples see uv absorbance in table 1 vuv transmittance was measured using the qcb setup first an empty 1 mm closed cylindrical quartz cell was placed on top of the detector the shutter of the qcb setup was opened and the radiometer value noted the procedure was repeated with the 1 mm closed cylindrical quartz cell filled with sample and the difference in intensities measured at the two conditions were used to calculate the absorbed intensity from which absorbance was calculated see table 1 beer lambert s law was used to calculate the transmittance from the absorbance 2 4 determination of irradiance at uv and vuv chemical actinometry methods were used to validate the output measured using the il1700 radiometer employing the sed254 ns254 and sed185 ns185 detectors potassium iodide potassium iodate ki kio3 actinometry qiang et al 2015 was used to measure the incident irradiance at uv probe scavenger actinometry furatian 2017 was used to determine the vuv output in this method degradation kinetics of a probe in the presence of a defined amount of scavenging capacity under vuv irradiation is used to calculate the incident fluence rate at vuv the quantum yield for water photolysis second order rate constants for the probe compound and a scavenger with h o must be known a priori both the probe and scavenger must only have a negligible direct photolysis rate and absorption at uv with no other significant degradation pathway other than oxidation via with h o 2 5 experimental design to accentuate that the inaccuracy of the various figures of merit currently used is valid across various water matrices and omps water matrices and omps of principally varying characteristics were chosen table 1 the four water matrices chosen had varying degrees of uvt reverse osmosis permeate and secondary waste water effluent are respectively the best and worst case scenario water matrices for application of uv based treatments given their respective high and low uvt anion contents two drinking water samples especially vary in their chloride content organic ho scavenging capacity etc likewise the five omps were chosen based on their varying degrees of direct photolysis at uv and second order reaction rate constants with ho k h o table 2 classifies the omps based on the degree of direct photolysis and k h o into high average and negligible 2 6 definitions of terminologies the definitions of the major terminologies used in the results and discussion section are described in this section 2 6 1 dose dλ j m 2 dose or fluence is defined as the time integrated average irradiance note that irradiance and fluence rate are the same in a collimated beam setup received by the sample over a specific time eq 4 4 d λ i a v g λ t 5 i a v g λ i 0 λ r f p f d f 1 10 a λ l ln 10 a λ l i a b s λ ln 10 a λ l where d λ is the dose at a given wavelength λ in j m 2 i a v g λ i 0 λ and i a b s λ are the average irradiation delivered to the sample irradiation incident on the sample surface and irradiation absorbed by the sample in w m 2 at a given wavelength respectively t is the time for which the sample was irradiated in s r f p f and d f are the reflection factor petri factor and divergence factor respectively and the term 1 10 a λ l ln 10 a λ l represents the water factor bolton and linden 2003 a λ is the absorbance of the sample at a given wavelength in m 1 l is the pathlength of the sample in m the values of r f p f and d f are calculated separately for each water type and wavelength note that in a qcb system mj cm 2 mw cm 2 cm 1 and cm are the commonly used units for dose irradiation absorbance and path length 2 6 2 absorbed energy aeλ wh m 3 not all incident irradiation entering the fluid domain is absorbed by the sample the fraction of irradiation at a given wavelength that a sample can absorb depends on the absorbance of the sample at that wavelength the absorbed energy ae of a sample is defined as the fraction of irradiation absorbed by the sample eq 6 6 a e λ i a b s λ 3600 s v t where s is the surface area of the sample irradiated in m2 v is the volume of the sample irradiated in m3 note that s v is equal to the pathlength l of the sample in case of the cylindrical cell used in this study the factor 1 3600 converts j m 2 to wh m 2 incorporating eq 4 and eq 5 in eq 6 results in eq 7 7 a e λ d λ ln 10 a λ 3600 2 6 3 useful absorbed energy uaeλ wh m 3 useful absorbed energy uae is the fraction of ae that enters the fluid and is absorbed by constituents in the water sample to generate radicals that contribute towards degradation of omps for example in this study uv photons absorbed by the organic matter of the sample is assumed to be a wasted energy as compared to that absorbed by h2o2 because uv absorption by the former does not result in the formation of radicals that are capable of degrading omps the uaeλ of a sample is obtained using eq 8 by combining eqs 5 eq 6 and eq 8 uaeλ in terms of incident irradiation is obtained 8 u a e λ a e λ f λ 9 u a e λ i a b s λ 3600 s v t f λ i 0 λ r f p f d f 1 10 a λ l

molar absorbance of constituent i in sample at a given wavelength in m 1 m 1 and c is its respective concentration in m the term ε x λ c x i n ε i λ c i includes the fraction absorbed by any other constituent x that can generate oxidative radicals at a given λ n is the number of constituents in the sample note that in a uv h2o2 aop h2o2 will in most cases be the only constituent that contributes to generation of radicals on absorption of uv with respect to vuv besides h2o and h2o2 some anions like chloride cl nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 could also absorb vuv photons to produce oxidative radicals for the sake of simplicity aevuv is considered equal to uaevuv in this study in other words all the absorbed energy at vuv results in the generation of useful radicals the validity of the assumption is further elaborated in section 3 4 2 6 4 electrical energy per order eeo wh m 3 eeo is defined as the energy required to reduce the concentration of an omp by 1 log in 1 m3 of contaminated water 12 e e o p q l o g 10 c i c 0 where p is the total electrical power of the lamps employed in w and q is the flow rate of the fluid in m3 h 1 l o g 10 c i c 0 is the log degradation of the contaminant where c i and c 0 are the final and initial concentrations of the contaminants it is important to note that e e o is not a valid figure of merit for qcb setup rather it is a quantity that is used to compare the efficiency of different aops and reactors that are optimized for specific applications 13 e e o u a e λ log deg o f o m p f λ η λ 14 e e o a e λ log deg o f o m p η λ where η λ is the efficiency of a lamp to convert the input electrical energy to uv or vuv output note that eq 13 and eq 14 are valid only when all the input energy at uv and vuv is absorbed by the sample 3 results and discussion the results of the degradation studies on metformin mtf n butyl paraben n pbn atrazine atz and carbamazepine cbz in ro swwe dw high cl and dw low cl water matrices in three different aops are discussed in this section various pathways of omp degradation involved in each of these aops are described in table 3 general conclusions on the efficacy of aops vary depending on the k chosen data in table 4 indicates the dependence of the ratios of k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 for atz cbz mtf and n pbn in various water matrices on the choice of k for absolute values of k time k total dose k total ae and k total uae see table s2 note that k total dose k time t total dose k total ae k time t total ae k total uae k time t total uae also note that the units of the apparent reaction rate constants are given in table 4 however the ratios of k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 are dimensionless the merits and limitations associated with reporting qcb results on the basis of the time dλ and aeλ are discussed below subsequently uaeλ is introduced as a suitable figure of merit which when implemented on a 2d plot supports the scale up of aops 3 1 merits and limitations of using time as the figure of merit in reporting qcb results the time based apparent reaction rate constant k time s 1 and time s are frequently used for reporting of qcb experimental results of uv based aops for example guo et al 2018 compared uv chlorine and uv h2o2 aops using k time several experimental investigations also use on k time analysis of laboratory scale experiments to compare vuv and uv aops in most cases concluding vuv aops to have higher degradation efficacy than their uv counterparts fu et al 2020 he et al 2021 y sun et al 2019 however such conclusions are only valid for specific laboratory scale reactors employed and should not be generalized because k time do not account for effects of reactor design on utilization of uv and vuv in a reactor in the case of uv and vuv aops the extreme difference in their penetration depths affects their relative contributions towards omp degradation for example relative efficacies of vuv uv h2o2 aop and uv h2o2 aop were compared based on k time using the experimental results of cbz degradation in a sample of milliq water with tert butanol as a scavenger after 10 min of irradiation in a 1 cm and 2 cm cell fig 1 the ratio k time vuv uv h2o2 k time uv h2o2 obtained from these experiments was 5 1 and 3 7 in a 1 cm cell and 2 cm cell respectively thus depending on pathlength conclusions regarding the effect of combining vuv and uv h2o2 aop changes drastically when using k time in case of real water matrices table 1 indicates that in a 2 cm cell barely 20 of the incident uv with the exception of swwe as compared to 100 of the incident vuv is absorbed in 1 cm cell the percent of the incident uv absorbed is further lower than in a 2 cm cell however the percent of the incident vuv absorbed remains 100 for all the water matrices these results prove that reactor design pathlength favors the utilization of vuv therefore when the results of omp degradation in qcb experiments performed in this study using 1 cm or 2 cm cell are analysed based on k time both vuv uv h2o2 and chemical free vuv aop appears to have higher efficacy than the conventional uv h2o2 aop k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 1 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 1 for all water types and omps table 4 on the contrary the conclusion drawn when the same qcb results are reported based on k total uae is that both vuv uv h2o2 and chemical free vuv aop appears to have lower efficacy than the conventional uv h2o2 aop k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 1 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 1 for all water types and omps except cbz in swwe additional to the disregard to effects of reactor design k time based results has two disadvantages 1 k time based results cannot be reproduced or compared among different laboratories because it gives no indication of the total energy used by the system and 2 k time is inappropriate to represent results of both qcb and flow through reactors zhan et al 2021 because it does not indicate the total degradation time spent achieved in a reactor 3 2 merits and limitations of using dose dλ as the figure of merit in reporting qcb results because dose is calculated using the average irradiance a sample receives it accounts for the pathlength of the sample eq 4 thereby overcoming the first drawback that time based assessment poses see section 3 1 nonetheless it must be noted that both duv and dvuv are impacted by pathlength and absorptivity of the sample see fig s2 in si 1d graphs representing dtotal or photon fluence versus log degradation of the omp are currently employed to represent laboratory scale results of aops li et al 2019 dubowski et al 2020 and moradi and moussavi 2018 used plots of duv vs omp degradation to represent degradation in a vuv uv aop however there are two major drawbacks in analyzing or comparing vuv and uv based aops using this approach first vuv and uv based aops differ considerably in their inherent efficiency to generate ho proportional to photon dose and their contributions towards the omp degradation are mostly non additive li et al 2016 sakai et al 2021 second duv is the major contributor to dtotal in the system see fig 2 rendering dtotal for a given sample in vuv uv vuv uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 aops as approximately the same duv is the major contributor because of the substantially higher uv output of lp hg lamps η uv 25 40 and η vuv 6 11 an et al 2015 schalk et al 2005 and the extremely low penetration depth of vuv compared to uv for example in the ro sample vuv uv aop in the absence of h2o2 duv does not contribute to degradation of cbz see table 5 due to negligible direct photolysis at uv cbz degrades solely due to ho reactions generated via vuv aop comparing the observed log degradations of cbz in the various aops in ro water matrix see table 5 it is evident that vuv uv aop is highly efficient in degrading cbz however the efficiency of vuv uv aop is underestimated k vuv uv k uv h2o2 4 04 see k vuv uv k uv h2o2 using k total dose for cbz degradation in ro water matrix in table 4 when k total dose is used where k total dose is 60 times smaller than k vuv dose see table 5 using both k uv dose and k vuv dose or duv and dvuv is a better approach than using k total dose or dtotal gilboa et al 2021 uses both duv and dvuv to represent h2s degradation using vuv uv aop however from a scientific perspective k uv dose and k vuv dose or duv and dvuv are difficult to compare because they differ by one or two orders of magnitude see fig 3 from a practical perspective the units of k uv dose and k vuv dose cm2 mj 1 or duv and dvuv do not intuitively support scale up because there is no direct indication of the energy applied the efficiency of an aop to convert the applied dose to oxidative radicals is obscured from dose based figures of merits note also that the efficiency of both vuv uv aop and uv h2o2 aop can significantly be affected by the amount of h2o2 dosed in to the sample li et al 2019 sakai et al 2021 for example k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 5 46 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 3 52 for cbz in dw low cl water matrix see table 4 when compared based on k total dose it is apparent that vuv uv h2o2 aop has higher cbz degradation efficiency than vuv uv aop at a given applied dose however the fact that the higher efficiency of the vuv uv h2o2 aop is because of h2o2 dosing and thereby comes with additional operational cost is not included in the dose based apparent reaction rate constants in summary 1 use of k total dose or dtotal is not accurate 2 use of both duv and dvuv obscures the inherent efficiencies of the various aops and 3 use of both k uv dose and k vuv dose does not inform scale up of the aop this demands a much more reliable figure of merit for novel aops to be more widely implemented in the water industry 3 3 merits and limitations of using absorbed energy aeλ as the figure of merit in reporting qcb results aeλ is based on the absorbance of a specific sample at a specific wavelength see section 2 6 2 aeλ has complex relationships with the uvtλ of the sample and the pathlength of the reactor see figure s3 in si therefore depending on the water matrix either aeuv or aevuv is the major contributor to aetotal see fig 2 due to the difference in the inherent efficiency of vuv aop and uv h2o2 aop the contributions of aeuv and aevuv to omp degradation are non additive see section 3 1 therefore a plot of k ae total or aetotal versus log degradation of the omp would not be sufficiently informative because it is critical to define the relative contributions of k ae uv and k ae vuv or aeuv and aevuv employing a 2d plot with both k ae uv and k ae vuv still does not contribute to the scaling up of the vuv uv h2o2 aop this is because the inherent efficiency of the vuv aop and uv h2o2 aop in generating oxidative radicals is not deducible from aeλ for example in the case of the dw highcl sample where both aeuv and aevuv contribute roughly equally to aetotal fig 2 only about 8 3 of the aeuv is absorbed by h2o2 contributing to generation of oxidative radicals note that although the percent of uv absorbed by h2o2 can be increased with increasing h2o2 concentration in the ranges that are relevant to industrial applications 7 20 mg l 1 the percent uv absorbed by h2o2 is not more than 25 aevuv on the other hand is completely absorbed in any practical reactor with a real water matrix note that 90 of vuv photons are absorbed with 6 mm in double distilled water and in most cases all the aevuv contributes towards generating oxidative radicals it is thus warranted to introduce an appropriate figure of merit indicative of the inherent efficiency of various aops involved and assist in the scale up of aops 3 4 useful absorbed energy uaeλ as an appropriate figure of merit in reporting qcb results in a well mixed reactor the efficiency of an aop in generating radicals is proportional to its capacity to degrade omps oxidative radical concentration is the product of aeλ fraction of aeλ absorbed by constituents that can generate oxidative radicals and the quantum yield of oxidative radicals various aops generate diverse oxidant radicals with compound specific second order reaction rate constants based on their reactivity toward a specific omp the diverse oxidant radical concentration can be translated in to an equivalent ho concentration note that such an estimated ho density is omp specific the ho density generated via various aops can be used to compare their inherent efficiencies however such calculations require prior knowledge of quantum yield of oxidative radicals which are not widely available uaeλ the product of aeλ and the fraction of aeλ absorbed by the constituents that can generate oxidative radicals can be a simple surrogate of oxidant concentration without jeopardizing its functionality in the calculation of uaeuv h2o2 can be assumed to be the only constituent that generates radicals upon uv absorption this is a valid assumption in the water matrices tested in this study because of the negligible direct uv photolysis of other major constituents in water samples see table 6 vuv on the other hand is strongly absorbed by anions commonly present in ground and surface water for example in the sample dw highcl 90 of the vuv photons are absorbed by chloride cl in generating chlorine radicals cl owing to the high molar absorption coefficient of chloride ε v u v c l 3800 m c m 1 furatian 2017 cl undergoes many reactions eventually to be scavenged or contributed to omp degradation feng et al 2007 cl radicals are selective but roughly equally reactive to electron rich moieties compared to ho lei et al 2019 here all vuv absorption by cl is assumed to generate oxidative radicals equivalent to ho rendering aevuv equal to uaevuv using the two aforementioned assumptions uaeuv and uaevuv are estimated note that a 1d graph representing log degradation of an omp with respect to k total uae instead of both k uae uv and k uae vuv has similar drawbacks as the use of k total ae see section 3 3 for example the absolute log degradation of cbz in dw low cl water matrix was 0 64 1 cm cell and 0 09 2 cm cell in vuv uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 aop respectively however from table 4 the ratio k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 aop using k total uae of cbz in dw low cl water matrix is less than 1 implying that the degradation efficiency per kwh m 3 addition in a uv h2o2 aop is better than in a vuv uv h2o2 aop however it should be noted that in reality no extra amount of energy is required for the addition of vuv that is the pitfall of using k total uae therefore a 2d plot that illustrates the dependence of log degradation on both uaeuv and uaevuv is warranted 3 4 1 development of 2d plots as reporting methodology for experimental data from the qcb uaeuv and uaevuv are calculated using the equations presented in section 2 6 3 the effective use of the plot depends on the accuracy of the uaeuv and uaevuv calculated in this study regression analysis was performed on experimental data from qcb system using the statistical software r see si on the generation of regression equations regression equations with log degradation as the output variable and uaevuv and uaeuv as independent variables are further used to generate the 2d plots fig 4 fig s4 and fig s5 in si the extreme points on the isolog lines dotted lines in fig 4 on the x axis and y axis indicate the amount of uaeuv and uaevuv required in a uv h2o2 aop and a standalone vuv uv aop respectively to achieve a given log degradation at a given h2o2 dosing the points between the extremes on the isolog line indicate combinations of uaevuv and uaeuv in vuv uv h2o2 aop that will achieve a given log degradation note that uaevuv and uaeuv are sufficient information for the replication of the experiment in a given water matrix for a specific omp by a different laboratory independent on the design of the reactor used it is crucial to consider that any conclusion that is derived from 2d plots is only valid for the specific h2o2 dosing used in the experiments whose experimental data were used to generate the regression equations 3 4 2 2d plots as a tool for predicting maximum possible degradation in pilot designs isolog lines indicates the maximum achievable log degradations of the specific omp at the uaeλ combination for the given water type and h2o2 concentration this assertion is based on the assumption that the qcb system is a perfectly mixed system thereby is a system in which the highest degradation of omps at the given operational settings can be achieved in contrast in pilot or full scale reactors imperfect mixing is inevitable by providing the maximum possible degradation the 2d plot helps determine the window of hydrodynamic optimization that may be achieved through improving reactor design in pilot systems 3 4 3 2d plots in designing of pilot reactors the design lines solid lines that run through the origin in fig 4 indicate the effect of changing residence times and path length of the reactor on log degradation of an omp there are several implications of these design lines the first is that various combinations of uaevuv and uaeuv at a specific h2o2 concentration achievable in a reactor path length is deducible from the design lines without having to perform individual experiments subsequently uaeλ can be converted to the energy requirement see section 2 6 3 in individual cases to make an informed choice on the most energy efficient aop the optimal design line indicates the situation where all the energy at uv and vuv generated from the lamp are absorbed by the sample the optimal line in black corresponds to the output ratio of uv vuv 4 9 lamp employed in the experiments presented in this paper and the optimal line in blue corresponds to a hypothetical lamp with uv vuv 1 5 thus the effect of varying uv and vuv electrical efficiencies on the energy requirements of an aop is deducible from the 2d plot this is an extremely important outcome of the 2d plot and offers high degree of energy savings potential for the water industry the second implication is that these design lines help determine the maximum possible log degradation in a reactor configuration at a specific h2o2 concentration see section 3 4 2 the third implication is that because each point on the design line corresponds to various residence times i e flow in a reactor the effect of varying flow on log degradations of omps at a specific h2o2 concentration can be deduced it must be emphasized that when flow is varied in a reactor the fluid hydrodynamics and not only the residence time of the fluid change as well this could lead to enhanced mixing and better omp degradations however the effect of change in flow on hydrodynamic and thereby on omp degradations are not deducible from the 2d plot 3 4 4 predicting energy requirements from the 2d plots energy requirement is a major factor in the selection of an aop it is a common practice that treatment plants mostly aim for a specified degradation rate e g log removal for a specific target omp to assess the effectiveness of an aop 2d plots can be used to predict the energy required to degrade a specific omp in a specific water matrix at a specific h2o2 concentration in various reactor configurations for example from fig 4 to achieve 1 log degradation of cbz in the dw high cl sample dosed with 10 mg l 1 h2o2 wherever applicable a u v 0 056cm 1 and a v u v 12 6cm 1 u a e v u v 14 5 wh m 3 and u a e u v 6 2 wh m 3 are required in a vuv uv aop and uv h2o2 aop respectively however in vuv uv h2o2 aop the u a e u v required to achieve 1 log degradation is 2 wh m 3 in a 5 cm cell assuming a lamp of η uv 33 and η vuv 6 7 using eq 13 these uae values are converted to eeo values of 0 215 kwh m 3 0 31 kwh m 3 and 0 1 kwh m 3 in vuv uv aop uv h2o2 aop and vuv uv h2o2 aop respectively fig s4 and fig s5 in si demonstrates the applicability of 2d plot for cbz and atz in dw low cl water matrix respectively 4 conclusion qcb systems have been widely used for laboratory scale experimentation of aops however there is a need for standard approaches in the reporting and interpretation of qcb results for novel dual wavelength aops also currently there are scarce insights on using qcb data for design and development of pilot systems the conventional approaches to report and compare qcb data such as the apparent reaction rate constants based on time dose and absorbed energy are either inadequate or inaccurate for the purpose of informing engineering feasibility and design here 2d plots based on useful absorbed energy is a new methodology introduced to serve as a standard methodology in reporting qcb data for dual wavelength aops the isolog lines on the plot indicates the uaeuv and or uaevuv required to achieve a specified log degradation of a targeted omp in a particular water matrix at a specific h2o2 dosing the extremes of the 2d plot correspond to the standalone vuv and uv h2o2 aops it is thus possible to estimate the difference in energy investments required for the vuv uv uv h2o2 and vuv uv h2o2 aops these plots can also be used to predict the maximum possible degradation of an omp in a specific water matrix and h2o2 concentration consequently the optimization opportunity for design of a reactor with respect to mixing can be estimated the design lines indicate the effect of varying path length and irradiation times which can be translated to flow in a flow through reactor based on the relative and absolute contributions of uaeuv and uaevuv the optimal design lines in the 2d plots opens the discussion of tailor made lamps further data from such plots can be used to approximate the eeo required in pilot system achieve a desired omp treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

19917,uv c at 254 nm and vacuum uv vuv at 185 nm are the two major emission lines of a low pressure mercury lamp upon absorption of vuv photons water molecules and selected inorganic anions generate hydroxyl ho and other redox radicals both capable of degrading organic micropollutants omps thereby offering the opportunity to reduce h2o2 and energy consumption in uv based advanced oxidation process aop to be successfully scaled up the dual wavelength vuv uv h2o2 aop requires laboratory scale experiments to establish design criteria the figures of merit typically used for reporting and interpreting quasi collimated beam results for uv based aops time dose absorbed energy and eeo are insufficient and inaccurate when employed for dual wavelength aop such as the vuv uv h2o2 aop and do not support system scale up in this study we introduce a novel figure of merit useful absorbed energy uae defined as fraction of absorbed energy that results in the generation of oxidative radicals here results of quasi collimated beam vuv uv h2o2 aop experiments on four different water matrices are used to introduce 2d plots that employ both uaeuv and uaevuv as a novel method to represent laboratory scale experiments of vuv uv h2o2 aop and demonstrate how the 2d plots sufficiently support scale up of the aop graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes organic micropollutants quasi collimated beam uv h2o2 vacuum ultraviolet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing use of pharmaceuticals detergents personal care products fire fighting agents dyes and other anthropogenic chemicals to support modern life have resulted the introduction of these chemicals and their transformation products into the environment as micropollutants conventional biological treatment processes at waste water treatment plants are inadequate to remove many of these micropollutants capodaglio 2020 cuerda correa et al 2020 toor and mohseni 2007 advanced oxidation processes aops however have been proven to degrade the vast majority of organic micropollutants omps deng and zhao 2015 and are increasingly being incorporated as polishing steps in water treatment particularly for applications of potable reuse cao et al 2022 p sun et al 2019 uv based aops employ uv radiation that generates radicals via photochemical reactions with oxidants the oxidative radicals attack the omps either generating transformation products or completely mineralizing them into co2 and h2o the efficacy of an aop in degrading omps depends on the photon and oxidative radical scavenging capacity of the water sample rosenfeldt and linden 2007 along with the design of the reactor uv h2o2 aop is one of the most extensively applied uv based aops zhan et al 2021 uv photons at 254 nm hereafter referred to as uv from a low pressure mercury lp hg lamp generates ho via the homolysis of h2o2 molecule eq 1 quantum yield φ in a photochemical reaction is defined as the amount of reactant consumed or product formed per photon absorbed for the photolysis of h2o2 by uv φ 0 5 in terms of h2o2 consumed and φ 1 in terms of ho produced because there are two ho produced per homolysis of h2o2 molecule 1 h 2 o 2 h ν 254 nm 2 h o φ 0 5 h2o2 is an inefficient absorber of uv because of its low molar absorption coefficient 20 m 1 cm 1 weeks et al 1963 therefore only 5 10 of h2o2 that is dosed is utilized in most drinking water practices rosenfeldt et al 2013 consequently quenching of h2o2 is needed rendering uv h2o2 aop both energy and chemical intensive keen et al 2013 and improvement of uv h2o2 aop is necessary for its broader use in the water industry the second major emission line of a lp hg lamp is at 185 nm hereafter referred to as vuv vuv is transmitted from the lamp when an appropriate lamp sleeve is used claus 2021 and no additional electrical energy is required for its generation vuv generates ho among other redox radicals via photolysis eq 2 and homolysis eq 3 of water molecules therefore combining vuv and conventional uv aop could reduce the h2o2 required and thereby the chemical cost to achieve degradation of omps contrary to the poor absorbance of uv by h2o2 in vuv aop all incident vuv photons are absorbed by water or other major absorbers to generate radicals thus the inherent efficiency of vuv aop is substantially higher than uv h2o2 aop the ho degrades the omps to form transformation products 2 h 2 o h ν 200 nm h o h φ 0 33 3 h 2 o h ν 200 nm h o h e aq φ 0 045 due to the high absorption by pure water at 25 c 1 76cm 1 weeks et al 1963 at 55 55 m water concentration more than 90 of emitted vuv photons are absorbed within 6 mm of the water surface the absorbance in real water matrices in this study are even higher table 1 on the contrary the penetration distance at which 90 of uv at 254 nm is absorbed can vary from 5 20 cm at uv transmittance uvt of 56 and 89 per cm respectively optimizing a reactor for both the short penetrating vuv and relatively longer penetrating uv is challenging most of the laboratory scale configurations like quasi collimated beam apparatus qcb baeza and knappe 2011 duca et al 2017 fang et al 2014 feng et al 2007 annular reactors ngouyap mouamfon et al 2011 zhan et al 2021 zoschke et al 2012 and micro fluidic vacuum uv reactors yang et al 2018 employed in vuv research have small mean reactor pathlengths that favorably uses vuv over uv despite extensive research published using laboratory scale vuv reactors there are scarce applications of vuv reported at pilot scale krakko et al 2021 absence of a standard methodology to accurately represent the experimental qcb data and inform scale up of vuv aop stalls practical applications of this potentially chemical free aop the performance of vuv uv h2o2 aop depends on the design of the reactor fluid hydrodynamics water matrix and even the specific omps targeted for degradation such complexities are not accounted for in the simple figure of merits currently used time s dose mj cm 2 absorbed energy kwh m 3 electrical energy per order eeo kwh m 3 etc and consequently analysis based on these figures of merit risk under or over estimating the efficacy of vuv aop for example time based analysis of experiments performed in the aforementioned literature might lead to erroneous conclusion of a higher efficacy of vuv aop than uv h2o2 aop because of the reactor design that favors the utilization of vuv therefore development of a new methodology to represent and analyze laboratory scale experimental results of vuv uv h2o2 aop is warranted in this paper the merits and limitations of existing methodologies for interpreting laboratory scale results are discussed a novel figure of merit useful absorbed energy uae is introduced as an improvement to these limitations using experiments on various real water matrices 2d plots employing uaeuv and uaevuv is demonstrated as a new methodology for interpreting results of qcb experiments for vuv uv h2o2 aop these 2d plots can be used to predict the maximum degradation of targeted omps and predict the energy requirements in a vuv aop uv h2o2 aop and vuv uv h2o2 aop thereby allowing qcb data to be used for scale up of these aops additionally the 2d plots inform the advantage of varying the uv to vuv output ratio of a lamp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental reactor configurations the qcb apparatus see fig s1 consisted of a lamp housing and a collimator both purged with nitrogen n 2 gas to prevent the formation of ozone o 3 which would otherwise be formed when vuv is absorbed by atmospheric oxygen o 2 oppenlaender 2003 a 22 5 w low pressure mercury lamp with major emission lines at uv and vuv was used the distance between the center of the lamp and the surface of the sample was 33 cm the distance was fixed based on a petri factor of 0 97 bolton and linden 2003 the diameter of the collimator was 5 0 5 cm the outlet of the collimator was equipped with a shutter which was closed after each irradiation experiment with an accuracy of 5 s a closed cylindrical quartz cell type 35 q starna scientific germany was filled with sample and placed directly under the collimator a stir plate placed under the cell ensured the sample is well mixed il1700 radiometer employing the sed254 ns254 and sed185 ns185 detectors international light technologies inc massachusetts were used to measure the uv and vuv irradiations respectively three different advanced oxidation processes aop were evaluated using the qcb setup 1 vuv uv h2o2 aop 2 uv h2o2 aop and 3 vuv uv aop in case of vuv uv h2o2 aop and vuv uv aop the sample with and without h2o2 respectively was placed under the qcb setup and irradiated to block vuv from reaching the sample in uv h2o2 aop experiments a closed cylindrical quartz cell 1 cm filled with 4 m nacl was placed on top of the sample cell this arrangement also resulted in a reduction of 23 of incident uv irradiation which was accounted for in analyses of results 2 2 chemical analyses anions and cations were measured

with a uhplc guard zorbax eclipse plus c18 1 8 μm 2 1 5 mm pre column the flow rate was set at 0 25 ml min 1 and the column temperature was maintained at 40 c for the ms an agilent 6420 triple quadrupole qqq mass analyzer with electrospray ion source was used table 1 indicates the quality of various water matrices experimented in this study 2 3 determination of uv and vuv transmittance of samples a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer at 254 nm was used to measure uvt of the samples see uv absorbance in table 1 vuv transmittance was measured using the qcb setup first an empty 1 mm closed cylindrical quartz cell was placed on top of the detector the shutter of the qcb setup was opened and the radiometer value noted the procedure was repeated with the 1 mm closed cylindrical quartz cell filled with sample and the difference in intensities measured at the two conditions were used to calculate the absorbed intensity from which absorbance was calculated see table 1 beer lambert s law was used to calculate the transmittance from the absorbance 2 4 determination of irradiance at uv and vuv chemical actinometry methods were used to validate the output measured using the il1700 radiometer employing the sed254 ns254 and sed185 ns185 detectors potassium iodide potassium iodate ki kio3 actinometry qiang et al 2015 was used to measure the incident irradiance at uv probe scavenger actinometry furatian 2017 was used to determine the vuv output in this method degradation kinetics of a probe in the presence of a defined amount of scavenging capacity under vuv irradiation is used to calculate the incident fluence rate at vuv the quantum yield for water photolysis second order rate constants for the probe compound and a scavenger with h o must be known a priori both the probe and scavenger must only have a negligible direct photolysis rate and absorption at uv with no other significant degradation pathway other than oxidation via with h o 2 5 experimental design to accentuate that the inaccuracy of the various figures of merit currently used is valid across various water matrices and omps water matrices and omps of principally varying characteristics were chosen table 1 the four water matrices chosen had varying degrees of uvt reverse osmosis permeate and secondary waste water effluent are respectively the best and worst case scenario water matrices for application of uv based treatments given their respective high and low uvt anion contents two drinking water samples especially vary in their chloride content organic ho scavenging capacity etc likewise the five omps were chosen based on their varying degrees of direct photolysis at uv and second order reaction rate constants with ho k h o table 2 classifies the omps based on the degree of direct photolysis and k h o into high average and negligible 2 6 definitions of terminologies the definitions of the major terminologies used in the results and discussion section are described in this section 2 6 1 dose dλ j m 2 dose or fluence is defined as the time integrated average irradiance note that irradiance and fluence rate are the same in a collimated beam setup received by the sample over a specific time eq 4 4 d λ i a v g λ t 5 i a v g λ i 0 λ r f p f d f 1 10 a λ l ln 10 a λ l i a b s λ ln 10 a λ l where d λ is the dose at a given wavelength λ in j m 2 i a v g λ i 0 λ and i a b s λ are the average irradiation delivered to the sample irradiation incident on the sample surface and irradiation absorbed by the sample in w m 2 at a given wavelength respectively t is the time for which the sample was irradiated in s r f p f and d f are the reflection factor petri factor and divergence factor respectively and the term 1 10 a λ l ln 10 a λ l represents the water factor bolton and linden 2003 a λ is the absorbance of the sample at a given wavelength in m 1 l is the pathlength of the sample in m the values of r f p f and d f are calculated separately for each water type and wavelength note that in a qcb system mj cm 2 mw cm 2 cm 1 and cm are the commonly used units for dose irradiation absorbance and path length 2 6 2 absorbed energy aeλ wh m 3 not all incident irradiation entering the fluid domain is absorbed by the sample the fraction of irradiation at a given wavelength that a sample can absorb depends on the absorbance of the sample at that wavelength the absorbed energy ae of a sample is defined as the fraction of irradiation absorbed by the sample eq 6 6 a e λ i a b s λ 3600 s v t where s is the surface area of the sample irradiated in m2 v is the volume of the sample irradiated in m3 note that s v is equal to the pathlength l of the sample in case of the cylindrical cell used in this study the factor 1 3600 converts j m 2 to wh m 2 incorporating eq 4 and eq 5 in eq 6 results in eq 7 7 a e λ d λ ln 10 a λ 3600 2 6 3 useful absorbed energy uaeλ wh m 3 useful absorbed energy uae is the fraction of ae that enters the fluid and is absorbed by constituents in the water sample to generate radicals that contribute towards degradation of omps for example in this study uv photons absorbed by the organic matter of the sample is assumed to be a wasted energy as compared to that absorbed by h2o2 because uv absorption by the former does not result in the formation of radicals that are capable of degrading omps the uaeλ of a sample is obtained using eq 8 by combining eqs 5 eq 6 and eq 8 uaeλ in terms of incident irradiation is obtained 8 u a e λ a e λ f λ 9 u a e λ i a b s λ 3600 s v t f λ i 0 λ r f p f d f 1 10 a λ l

molar absorbance of constituent i in sample at a given wavelength in m 1 m 1 and c is its respective concentration in m the term ε x λ c x i n ε i λ c i includes the fraction absorbed by any other constituent x that can generate oxidative radicals at a given λ n is the number of constituents in the sample note that in a uv h2o2 aop h2o2 will in most cases be the only constituent that contributes to generation of radicals on absorption of uv with respect to vuv besides h2o and h2o2 some anions like chloride cl nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 could also absorb vuv photons to produce oxidative radicals for the sake of simplicity aevuv is considered equal to uaevuv in this study in other words all the absorbed energy at vuv results in the generation of useful radicals the validity of the assumption is further elaborated in section 3 4 2 6 4 electrical energy per order eeo wh m 3 eeo is defined as the energy required to reduce the concentration of an omp by 1 log in 1 m3 of contaminated water 12 e e o p q l o g 10 c i c 0 where p is the total electrical power of the lamps employed in w and q is the flow rate of the fluid in m3 h 1 l o g 10 c i c 0 is the log degradation of the contaminant where c i and c 0 are the final and initial concentrations of the contaminants it is important to note that e e o is not a valid figure of merit for qcb setup rather it is a quantity that is used to compare the efficiency of different aops and reactors that are optimized for specific applications 13 e e o u a e λ log deg o f o m p f λ η λ 14 e e o a e λ log deg o f o m p η λ where η λ is the efficiency of a lamp to convert the input electrical energy to uv or vuv output note that eq 13 and eq 14 are valid only when all the input energy at uv and vuv is absorbed by the sample 3 results and discussion the results of the degradation studies on metformin mtf n butyl paraben n pbn atrazine atz and carbamazepine cbz in ro swwe dw high cl and dw low cl water matrices in three different aops are discussed in this section various pathways of omp degradation involved in each of these aops are described in table 3 general conclusions on the efficacy of aops vary depending on the k chosen data in table 4 indicates the dependence of the ratios of k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 for atz cbz mtf and n pbn in various water matrices on the choice of k for absolute values of k time k total dose k total ae and k total uae see table s2 note that k total dose k time t total dose k total ae k time t total ae k total uae k time t total uae also note that the units of the apparent reaction rate constants are given in table 4 however the ratios of k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 are dimensionless the merits and limitations associated with reporting qcb results on the basis of the time dλ and aeλ are discussed below subsequently uaeλ is introduced as a suitable figure of merit which when implemented on a 2d plot supports the scale up of aops 3 1 merits and limitations of using time as the figure of merit in reporting qcb results the time based apparent reaction rate constant k time s 1 and time s are frequently used for reporting of qcb experimental results of uv based aops for example guo et al 2018 compared uv chlorine and uv h2o2 aops using k time several experimental investigations also use on k time analysis of laboratory scale experiments to compare vuv and uv aops in most cases concluding vuv aops to have higher degradation efficacy than their uv counterparts fu et al 2020 he et al 2021 y sun et al 2019 however such conclusions are only valid for specific laboratory scale reactors employed and should not be generalized because k time do not account for effects of reactor design on utilization of uv and vuv in a reactor in the case of uv and vuv aops the extreme difference in their penetration depths affects their relative contributions towards omp degradation for example relative efficacies of vuv uv h2o2 aop and uv h2o2 aop were compared based on k time using the experimental results of cbz degradation in a sample of milliq water with tert butanol as a scavenger after 10 min of irradiation in a 1 cm and 2 cm cell fig 1 the ratio k time vuv uv h2o2 k time uv h2o2 obtained from these experiments was 5 1 and 3 7 in a 1 cm cell and 2 cm cell respectively thus depending on pathlength conclusions regarding the effect of combining vuv and uv h2o2 aop changes drastically when using k time in case of real water matrices table 1 indicates that in a 2 cm cell barely 20 of the incident uv with the exception of swwe as compared to 100 of the incident vuv is absorbed in 1 cm cell the percent of the incident uv absorbed is further lower than in a 2 cm cell however the percent of the incident vuv absorbed remains 100 for all the water matrices these results prove that reactor design pathlength favors the utilization of vuv therefore when the results of omp degradation in qcb experiments performed in this study using 1 cm or 2 cm cell are analysed based on k time both vuv uv h2o2 and chemical free vuv aop appears to have higher efficacy than the conventional uv h2o2 aop k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 1 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 1 for all water types and omps table 4 on the contrary the conclusion drawn when the same qcb results are reported based on k total uae is that both vuv uv h2o2 and chemical free vuv aop appears to have lower efficacy than the conventional uv h2o2 aop k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 1 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 1 for all water types and omps except cbz in swwe additional to the disregard to effects of reactor design k time based results has two disadvantages 1 k time based results cannot be reproduced or compared among different laboratories because it gives no indication of the total energy used by the system and 2 k time is inappropriate to represent results of both qcb and flow through reactors zhan et al 2021 because it does not indicate the total degradation time spent achieved in a reactor 3 2 merits and limitations of using dose dλ as the figure of merit in reporting qcb results because dose is calculated using the average irradiance a sample receives it accounts for the pathlength of the sample eq 4 thereby overcoming the first drawback that time based assessment poses see section 3 1 nonetheless it must be noted that both duv and dvuv are impacted by pathlength and absorptivity of the sample see fig s2 in si 1d graphs representing dtotal or photon fluence versus log degradation of the omp are currently employed to represent laboratory scale results of aops li et al 2019 dubowski et al 2020 and moradi and moussavi 2018 used plots of duv vs omp degradation to represent degradation in a vuv uv aop however there are two major drawbacks in analyzing or comparing vuv and uv based aops using this approach first vuv and uv based aops differ considerably in their inherent efficiency to generate ho proportional to photon dose and their contributions towards the omp degradation are mostly non additive li et al 2016 sakai et al 2021 second duv is the major contributor to dtotal in the system see fig 2 rendering dtotal for a given sample in vuv uv vuv uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 aops as approximately the same duv is the major contributor because of the substantially higher uv output of lp hg lamps η uv 25 40 and η vuv 6 11 an et al 2015 schalk et al 2005 and the extremely low penetration depth of vuv compared to uv for example in the ro sample vuv uv aop in the absence of h2o2 duv does not contribute to degradation of cbz see table 5 due to negligible direct photolysis at uv cbz degrades solely due to ho reactions generated via vuv aop comparing the observed log degradations of cbz in the various aops in ro water matrix see table 5 it is evident that vuv uv aop is highly efficient in degrading cbz however the efficiency of vuv uv aop is underestimated k vuv uv k uv h2o2 4 04 see k vuv uv k uv h2o2 using k total dose for cbz degradation in ro water matrix in table 4 when k total dose is used where k total dose is 60 times smaller than k vuv dose see table 5 using both k uv dose and k vuv dose or duv and dvuv is a better approach than using k total dose or dtotal gilboa et al 2021 uses both duv and dvuv to represent h2s degradation using vuv uv aop however from a scientific perspective k uv dose and k vuv dose or duv and dvuv are difficult to compare because they differ by one or two orders of magnitude see fig 3 from a practical perspective the units of k uv dose and k vuv dose cm2 mj 1 or duv and dvuv do not intuitively support scale up because there is no direct indication of the energy applied the efficiency of an aop to convert the applied dose to oxidative radicals is obscured from dose based figures of merits note also that the efficiency of both vuv uv aop and uv h2o2 aop can significantly be affected by the amount of h2o2 dosed in to the sample li et al 2019 sakai et al 2021 for example k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 5 46 and k vuv uv k uv h2o2 3 52 for cbz in dw low cl water matrix see table 4 when compared based on k total dose it is apparent that vuv uv h2o2 aop has higher cbz degradation efficiency than vuv uv aop at a given applied dose however the fact that the higher efficiency of the vuv uv h2o2 aop is because of h2o2 dosing and thereby comes with additional operational cost is not included in the dose based apparent reaction rate constants in summary 1 use of k total dose or dtotal is not accurate 2 use of both duv and dvuv obscures the inherent efficiencies of the various aops and 3 use of both k uv dose and k vuv dose does not inform scale up of the aop this demands a much more reliable figure of merit for novel aops to be more widely implemented in the water industry 3 3 merits and limitations of using absorbed energy aeλ as the figure of merit in reporting qcb results aeλ is based on the absorbance of a specific sample at a specific wavelength see section 2 6 2 aeλ has complex relationships with the uvtλ of the sample and the pathlength of the reactor see figure s3 in si therefore depending on the water matrix either aeuv or aevuv is the major contributor to aetotal see fig 2 due to the difference in the inherent efficiency of vuv aop and uv h2o2 aop the contributions of aeuv and aevuv to omp degradation are non additive see section 3 1 therefore a plot of k ae total or aetotal versus log degradation of the omp would not be sufficiently informative because it is critical to define the relative contributions of k ae uv and k ae vuv or aeuv and aevuv employing a 2d plot with both k ae uv and k ae vuv still does not contribute to the scaling up of the vuv uv h2o2 aop this is because the inherent efficiency of the vuv aop and uv h2o2 aop in generating oxidative radicals is not deducible from aeλ for example in the case of the dw highcl sample where both aeuv and aevuv contribute roughly equally to aetotal fig 2 only about 8 3 of the aeuv is absorbed by h2o2 contributing to generation of oxidative radicals note that although the percent of uv absorbed by h2o2 can be increased with increasing h2o2 concentration in the ranges that are relevant to industrial applications 7 20 mg l 1 the percent uv absorbed by h2o2 is not more than 25 aevuv on the other hand is completely absorbed in any practical reactor with a real water matrix note that 90 of vuv photons are absorbed with 6 mm in double distilled water and in most cases all the aevuv contributes towards generating oxidative radicals it is thus warranted to introduce an appropriate figure of merit indicative of the inherent efficiency of various aops involved and assist in the scale up of aops 3 4 useful absorbed energy uaeλ as an appropriate figure of merit in reporting qcb results in a well mixed reactor the efficiency of an aop in generating radicals is proportional to its capacity to degrade omps oxidative radical concentration is the product of aeλ fraction of aeλ absorbed by constituents that can generate oxidative radicals and the quantum yield of oxidative radicals various aops generate diverse oxidant radicals with compound specific second order reaction rate constants based on their reactivity toward a specific omp the diverse oxidant radical concentration can be translated in to an equivalent ho concentration note that such an estimated ho density is omp specific the ho density generated via various aops can be used to compare their inherent efficiencies however such calculations require prior knowledge of quantum yield of oxidative radicals which are not widely available uaeλ the product of aeλ and the fraction of aeλ absorbed by the constituents that can generate oxidative radicals can be a simple surrogate of oxidant concentration without jeopardizing its functionality in the calculation of uaeuv h2o2 can be assumed to be the only constituent that generates radicals upon uv absorption this is a valid assumption in the water matrices tested in this study because of the negligible direct uv photolysis of other major constituents in water samples see table 6 vuv on the other hand is strongly absorbed by anions commonly present in ground and surface water for example in the sample dw highcl 90 of the vuv photons are absorbed by chloride cl in generating chlorine radicals cl owing to the high molar absorption coefficient of chloride ε v u v c l 3800 m c m 1 furatian 2017 cl undergoes many reactions eventually to be scavenged or contributed to omp degradation feng et al 2007 cl radicals are selective but roughly equally reactive to electron rich moieties compared to ho lei et al 2019 here all vuv absorption by cl is assumed to generate oxidative radicals equivalent to ho rendering aevuv equal to uaevuv using the two aforementioned assumptions uaeuv and uaevuv are estimated note that a 1d graph representing log degradation of an omp with respect to k total uae instead of both k uae uv and k uae vuv has similar drawbacks as the use of k total ae see section 3 3 for example the absolute log degradation of cbz in dw low cl water matrix was 0 64 1 cm cell and 0 09 2 cm cell in vuv uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 aop respectively however from table 4 the ratio k vuv uv h2o2 k uv h2o2 aop using k total uae of cbz in dw low cl water matrix is less than 1 implying that the degradation efficiency per kwh m 3 addition in a uv h2o2 aop is better than in a vuv uv h2o2 aop however it should be noted that in reality no extra amount of energy is required for the addition of vuv that is the pitfall of using k total uae therefore a 2d plot that illustrates the dependence of log degradation on both uaeuv and uaevuv is warranted 3 4 1 development of 2d plots as reporting methodology for experimental data from the qcb uaeuv and uaevuv are calculated using the equations presented in section 2 6 3 the effective use of the plot depends on the accuracy of the uaeuv and uaevuv calculated in this study regression analysis was performed on experimental data from qcb system using the statistical software r see si on the generation of regression equations regression equations with log degradation as the output variable and uaevuv and uaeuv as independent variables are further used to generate the 2d plots fig 4 fig s4 and fig s5 in si the extreme points on the isolog lines dotted lines in fig 4 on the x axis and y axis indicate the amount of uaeuv and uaevuv required in a uv h2o2 aop and a standalone vuv uv aop respectively to achieve a given log degradation at a given h2o2 dosing the points between the extremes on the isolog line indicate combinations of uaevuv and uaeuv in vuv uv h2o2 aop that will achieve a given log degradation note that uaevuv and uaeuv are sufficient information for the replication of the experiment in a given water matrix for a specific omp by a different laboratory independent on the design of the reactor used it is crucial to consider that any conclusion that is derived from 2d plots is only valid for the specific h2o2 dosing used in the experiments whose experimental data were used to generate the regression equations 3 4 2 2d plots as a tool for predicting maximum possible degradation in pilot designs isolog lines indicates the maximum achievable log degradations of the specific omp at the uaeλ combination for the given water type and h2o2 concentration this assertion is based on the assumption that the qcb system is a perfectly mixed system thereby is a system in which the highest degradation of omps at the given operational settings can be achieved in contrast in pilot or full scale reactors imperfect mixing is inevitable by providing the maximum possible degradation the 2d plot helps determine the window of hydrodynamic optimization that may be achieved through improving reactor design in pilot systems 3 4 3 2d plots in designing of pilot reactors the design lines solid lines that run through the origin in fig 4 indicate the effect of changing residence times and path length of the reactor on log degradation of an omp there are several implications of these design lines the first is that various combinations of uaevuv and uaeuv at a specific h2o2 concentration achievable in a reactor path length is deducible from the design lines without having to perform individual experiments subsequently uaeλ can be converted to the energy requirement see section 2 6 3 in individual cases to make an informed choice on the most energy efficient aop the optimal design line indicates the situation where all the energy at uv and vuv generated from the lamp are absorbed by the sample the optimal line in black corresponds to the output ratio of uv vuv 4 9 lamp employed in the experiments presented in this paper and the optimal line in blue corresponds to a hypothetical lamp with uv vuv 1 5 thus the effect of varying uv and vuv electrical efficiencies on the energy requirements of an aop is deducible from the 2d plot this is an extremely important outcome of the 2d plot and offers high degree of energy savings potential for the water industry the second implication is that these design lines help determine the maximum possible log degradation in a reactor configuration at a specific h2o2 concentration see section 3 4 2 the third implication is that because each point on the design line corresponds to various residence times i e flow in a reactor the effect of varying flow on log degradations of omps at a specific h2o2 concentration can be deduced it must be emphasized that when flow is varied in a reactor the fluid hydrodynamics and not only the residence time of the fluid change as well this could lead to enhanced mixing and better omp degradations however the effect of change in flow on hydrodynamic and thereby on omp degradations are not deducible from the 2d plot 3 4 4 predicting energy requirements from the 2d plots energy requirement is a major factor in the selection of an aop it is a common practice that treatment plants mostly aim for a specified degradation rate e g log removal for a specific target omp to assess the effectiveness of an aop 2d plots can be used to predict the energy required to degrade a specific omp in a specific water matrix at a specific h2o2 concentration in various reactor configurations for example from fig 4 to achieve 1 log degradation of cbz in the dw high cl sample dosed with 10 mg l 1 h2o2 wherever applicable a u v 0 056cm 1 and a v u v 12 6cm 1 u a e v u v 14 5 wh m 3 and u a e u v 6 2 wh m 3 are required in a vuv uv aop and uv h2o2 aop respectively however in vuv uv h2o2 aop the u a e u v required to achieve 1 log degradation is 2 wh m 3 in a 5 cm cell assuming a lamp of η uv 33 and η vuv 6 7 using eq 13 these uae values are converted to eeo values of 0 215 kwh m 3 0 31 kwh m 3 and 0 1 kwh m 3 in vuv uv aop uv h2o2 aop and vuv uv h2o2 aop respectively fig s4 and fig s5 in si demonstrates the applicability of 2d plot for cbz and atz in dw low cl water matrix respectively 4 conclusion qcb systems have been widely used for laboratory scale experimentation of aops however there is a need for standard approaches in the reporting and interpretation of qcb results for novel dual wavelength aops also currently there are scarce insights on using qcb data for design and development of pilot systems the conventional approaches to report and compare qcb data such as the apparent reaction rate constants based on time dose and absorbed energy are either inadequate or inaccurate for the purpose of informing engineering feasibility and design here 2d plots based on useful absorbed energy is a new methodology introduced to serve as a standard methodology in reporting qcb data for dual wavelength aops the isolog lines on the plot indicates the uaeuv and or uaevuv required to achieve a specified log degradation of a targeted omp in a particular water matrix at a specific h2o2 dosing the extremes of the 2d plot correspond to the standalone vuv and uv h2o2 aops it is thus possible to estimate the difference in energy investments required for the vuv uv uv h2o2 and vuv uv h2o2 aops these plots can also be used to predict the maximum possible degradation of an omp in a specific water matrix and h2o2 concentration consequently the optimization opportunity for design of a reactor with respect to mixing can be estimated the design lines indicate the effect of varying path length and irradiation times which can be translated to flow in a flow through reactor based on the relative and absolute contributions of uaeuv and uaevuv the optimal design lines in the 2d plots opens the discussion of tailor made lamps further data from such plots can be used to approximate the eeo required in pilot system achieve a desired omp treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

19918,the underlying chemistry of weak base wb anion exchange resins aers for contaminant removal from water is not well documented in the literature to address this batch adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 4 7 and 10 using two representative wb aers polyacrylic ira67 and polystyrene ira96 and two representative strong base sb aers polyacrylic ira458 and polystyrene a520e of differing polymer composition for the removal of nitrate sulfate 3 phenylpropionic acid 3 ppa as surrogate for natural organic matter and six perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas under acidic ph 4 and neutral ph 7 conditions the selectivity of aers for each contaminant was predominantly influenced by polymer composition followed by the size of the resin functional group this result reflected the wb aers being fully protonated and functioning identical to sb aers isotherm model parameters revealed wb aer had higher capacity than sb aer with analogous polymer composition and porosity regardless of resin selectivity for each contaminant under basic conditions ph 10 contaminant removal by wb aers declined due to deprotonation of the tertiary amine functional groups removal of pfaas by the more hydrophobic polystyrene wb aer ira96 remained approximately constant with changing ph which was possibly due to electrostatic interactions with remaining protonated amine functional groups on the resin keywords ion exchange natural organic matter nom per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas polyacrylic polystyrene tertiary amine data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anion exchange resins are commonly used in water treatment due to facile operability cost effectiveness and selectivity of specific resin structures for a range of contaminants while the effectiveness of strong base sb anion exchange resins aers is well established dixit et al 2021 hu et al 2016 levchuk et al 2018 the chemistry of weak base wb aers is understudied despite their benefits including strong buffering capability hinrichs and snoeyink 1976 zhang et al 2014 ease of regeneration ateia et al 2019a and high capacity boyer et al 2021b höll and kirch 1978 wb aers are also less prone to organic fouling dixit et al 2021 present greater chemical stability in oxidative environments and have higher thermal resistance harland 1994 than sb analogs all of which increase resin longevity and decrease operational costs the main difference between sb and wb aers is the basicity of their alkylamine functional groups where wb aers are nonionic tertiary amine typically above ph 10 but function as sb aer otherwise due to protonation of the resin functional group quaternary ammonium clifford and weber 1983 sb aers have been extensively studied for the removal of inorganic anions e g chloride sulfate nitrate perchlorate arsenic uranium dron and dodi 2011a gu et al 2005 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 hu et al 2016 song et al 2012 dissolved organic carbon doc edgar and

significantly less research has been conducted on wb aer resulting in a lack of understanding regarding resin solute solution interactions while the selectivity and removal efficiency of sb aer is generally influenced by the mobile counterion form laura del moral et al 2020 and resin properties such as polymer composition li and sengupta 1998 and functional group samatya et al 2006 wb aer

protonated at practical ph i e 13 clifford and weber 1983 howe et al 2012 whereas wb aer contains primary secondary and or tertiary amines which become deprotonated at ph greater than their acid

pfaas are a subgroup of pfas that are amenable to removal by wb aer given their low pka 1 0 and hydrophobic character park et al 2020a the human health concerns posed by pfas are due to extensive use in industrial applications buck et al 2011 exceptional resistance to biotic pontius 2019 and abiotic tow et al 2021 degradation and high potential for toxicity in mammals abunada et al 2020 domingo and nadal 2019 previous research evaluating the effect of resin basicity on pfaa adsorption highlighted the decreasing performance of wb aer with increasing solution ph gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 which has overshadowed their treatment effectiveness and limited their use for instance wb aer ira67 exhibited up two orders of magnitude higher adsorption capacity for pfos deng et al 2010 and 9 times greater loading of pfoa than other commercial adsorbents du et al 2015 although wb aers have been examined in some literature key gaps in knowledge remain polyacrylic resin has been the focus of recent work investigating the ph dependence of wb aer for the removal of hydrophobic contaminants deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 shuang et al 2012 wang et al 2019 where adsorption for polyacrylic aer is accompanied by a stoichiometric release of the mobile counterion e g chloride that indicates removal due to electrostatic interactions dixit et al 2019 2020 rahmani and mohseni 2017 however the influence of ph and the use of polystyrene wb aer is understudied despite the high uptake for hydrophobic contaminants observed by polystyrene resins even under highly alkaline conditions wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2011 zhang et al 2014 that has been attributed to non electrostatic adsorption such as hydrophobic interactions and van der waals forces landry et al 2015 when chloride was the mobile counterion polyacrylic wb aer had three times higher adsorption capacity for lactic acid compared to the resin in free base form whereas polystyrene wb aer had less than two times similarly explained by the absence of electrostatic interactions moldes et al 2003 an enhanced understanding of the influence of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions between wb aer and contaminants with different properties is needed to devise a framework for effective treatment and regeneration the adsorption mechanism selectivity and capacity of aers are generally deduced from isotherm models however using linear regression to determine model parameters may lead to misinformed conclusions allen et al 2003 bolster and hornberger 2007 dron and dodi 2011a foo and hameed 2010 haupert et al 2021 tran et al 2017b the overall goal of this work was to gain new insights on the chemistry of wb aer for contaminant removal from water the specific objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the impact of solution ph and resin properties such as resin basicity polymer structure and functional group on the removal efficiency 2 evaluate the influence of pfaas properties in term of perfluorocarbon tail lengths and head group on the selectivity sequence for each aer 3 discuss the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of chloride form wb aer for various water pollutants and 4 assess the reliability of different isotherm modeling techniques for single solute ion exchange systems the improved understanding presented in this research benefits municipal and industrial

of 2 14 meq l by varying the resin mass which showed to be a better representation of the ion exchange process than varying the initial concentration of analytes at same resin mass millar et al 2015 the contaminant solutions were prepared at three different solution ph 4 7 and 10 to investigate the influence of alkaline conditions on wb aer removal efficiency wb resins were contacted with a highly basic solution ph 11 for 24 h then carefully decanted the test water at ph 11 4 was subsequently added to the resin and equilibrated for 24 h this method was adopted for wb aer to compensate for the deprotonation of amine groups which constantly decreases the ph in unbuffered test water gustafson et al 1970 for simplicity the two methods used to equilibrate wb and sb aers in basic conditions are referred to as ph 10 in this paper all samples were tested in triplicate and the ph was measured before and after adsorption experiments control samples with no resin showed negligible

dry mass of resin and v is the volume of synthetic solution the removal efficiency at each percent resin dose was determined as the amount of contaminant removed from solution normalized by initial concentration to account for additional chloride sites stemming from resin pre conditioning the resin capacity was recalculated for all resins using 10 more no3 and 10 more so4 2 than the manufacturer value the highest exchange capacity for each aer was then used for determination of isotherm model parameters see electronic supplementary material this recalculation was due to higher observed contaminant uptake and chloride release for low percent resin dose than the maximum theoretical resin capacity previous work reported polyacrylic sb aer to have capacity approx 2 the manufacturer

supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of solution ph on contaminant removal by wb aer fig 1 shows the impact of solution ph on contaminant removal by wb aer the wb aers showed 10 removal of 3 ppa fig 1a and b nitrate fig 1c and d sulfate fig 1e and f and dic fig 1g and h at solution ph 10 the ph decreased as more resin was added to the test water due to the increasing number of deprotonating wb aer functional groups i e h release at the 300 dose both wb pa g dimethyl resin ira67 and wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 reached removals of 97 sulfate 60 nitrate and 55 dic at ph 6 7 and 10 3 ppa at ph 8 10 4 the higher contaminant removal at lower ph and higher resin dose is consistent with increasing protonated functional groups of the wb aer at resin dose 100 h released from the resin was neutralized by excess oh in solution which kept the ph stable at ph 10 and the functional groups uncharged at higher resin doses h was in excess relative to oh thereby decreasing the solution ph to 6 8 the wb aers function as nonionic resins as ph surpasses the pka and electrostatic interactions diminish the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the pfaa mixture contributed to 107 mg l as caco3 of alkalinity which is on the low end of realistic groundwater and was not sufficient to buffer the ph the ph values measured at the 300 dose and the pka values estimated from previous studies were in closer agreement for ira96 ph 6 3 6 6 pka 6 0 6 3 than ira67 ph 6 8 7 2 pka 9 3 macpherson 2009 miyazaki and nakai 2011 zhang et al 2014 the wb pa g dimethyl resin ira67 fig 1g followed the same trend for pfaas as the other contaminants while the wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 fig 1h was not affected by solution ph and still achieved 90 removal at ph 10 in fact wb ps mp dimethyl resin consistently showed measurable removal of all contaminants even when solution ph was much greater than the resin pka while the polystyrene composition could have allowed ira96 to adsorb pfaas and 3 ppa via hydrophobic interactions and or van der waals forces sulfate nitrate and bicarbonate are only bound electrostatically to the resin which suggested that ira96 had a fraction of protonated functional groups with higher pka since the initial pfaa concentration of 480 μg l was substantially exceeded by the resin dose electrostatic interactions with remaining charged amine groups of the ira96 were sufficient to achieve 95 removal of all pfaas at the 50 resin dose in a previous study multiple asymmetric peaks were detected over the 31p nmr spectral range of ira96 indicating heterogeneity in amine functionalities of the resin structure miyazaki and nakai 2011 in another study some wb aers had polyamine functional groups while commercially advertised as secondary or tertiary amine resins clifford and weber 1983 such non uniformity arises from the difficulties of controlling the chloromethylation step during resin synthesis anderson 1964 the results in the literature showed similar decrease in wb aer uptake of inorganic anions awual et al 2008 kołodyńska 2009 2010 hydrophobic contaminants greluk and hubicki 2011 gustafson and lirio 1968 hinrichs and snoeyink 1976 wawrzkiewicz 2011 wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2011 zhang et al 2014 and pfas deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 with increasing solution ph however the results of this study clearly demonstrated the reversibility of this behavior in batch conditions whereby a decrease in solution ph resulted in protonation of amine functional groups and increasing removal thereupon these findings justify pre treating wb aers with solutions of strong acids such as hcl as described elsewhere bolto et al 2002 moldes et al 2003 sengupta and clifford 1986 and precludes using free base form wb aers in unbuffered test water with low ionic strength wb aer could bind electrostatically to charged contaminants only when h and a mobile counterion simultaneously occupy aer sites helfferich 1995 for instance a study showed a 10 fold decrease in the adsorption capacity for pfos on free base ira67 resin compared with its chloride form gao et al 2017 although ira67 wb pa g dimethyl demonstrated no adsorption capacity for contaminants at ph 11 5 the resin exhibited 50 removal of all pfaas and greater removal of pfsas than pfcas when solution ph decreased to 7 2 fig 1g the trends for pfaa removal are consistent with stronger electrostatic interactions between more negatively charged sulfonate than carboxylate head group of pfaa ateia et al 2019b and increasing number of protonated resin functional groups at lower ph these results indicate that wb aer could be effectively used for pfaa treatment given that the majority of drinking water applications involve water sources having ph 9 0 du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 while higher ph applications are mostly for regeneration purposes using alkaline solutions more importantly the low removal of pfaas under highly basic conditions i e ph 11 5 suggested no available ion exchange sites on the resin due to complete deprotonation of amine functional groups and thus the potential for effective regeneration using dilute naoh and or naoh brine solutions hinrichs and snoeyink 1976 jackson and bolto 1990 ateia et al 2019a used various nonionic adsorbents such as highly porous nanostructured polymers to highlight the benefits of deprotonation of tertiary amine functional groups in alkaline conditions likewise effective pfas desorption from ira67 was achieved using 0 04 1 naoh du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 with an interesting result showing increasing desorption efficiency with decreasing naoh as 4 naoh 0 4 naoh 0 04 naoh deng et al 2010 while single use resins have been used for the removal of pfas at trace levels ng l fang et al 2021 zaggia et al 2016 regenerable resins have been pursued for the remediation of waters containing pfas concentrations ranging from tens to several hundreds of μg l liu and sun 2021 woodard et al 2017 the results of the current work suggest that the fraction of naoh could be decreased to 0 015 ph 11 57 thus reducing chemical requirements and thereby operating costs for drinking water applications involving high concentrations of pfaas at μg l levels however this does not pertain to ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl which showed high affinity for pfaas regardless of ph in addition a previous study showed that the selectivity for hydroxide ions depends on the equilibrium concentration of naoh in solution and resin properties such as porosity and polymer composition höll and kirch 1978 which could explain the different ph trends in the current study to confirm these conjectures studies involving continuous flow column regeneration of wb aer using alkaline solutions are the next logical steps in this research 3 2 effect of resin properties on individual contaminant removal ira458 sb pa g trimethyl a520e sb ps mp triethyl ira67 wb pa g dimethyl and ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl resins were tested to investigate the effect of resin characteristics for separate removal of contaminants fig 2 shows the percentage removal of 3 phenylpropionic acid 3 ppa nitrate and sulfate at ph 4 7 and 10 as a function of resin dose from 25 to 300 at a given resin dose nitrate and sulfate exhibited similar removal by sb aers regardless of solution ph 4 7 and 10 and by wb aers at solution ph 4 and 7 the same removal trend in terms of solution ph held for 3 ppa except for the lower removal observed at ph 4 the wb aers showed no to low removal of contaminants at ph 10 see section 3 1 these results indicated the tertiary amine functional groups of the wb aers behaved similarly as the quaternary ammonium functional groups of the sb aers at ph 7 previous findings also corroborated minor change in adsorption capacity of aers with quaternary ammonium and tertiary amine functional groups over solution ph 3 8 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 greluk and hubicki 2011 which is of importance since most water bodies are at ph 8 the reason for the lower removal of 3 ppa under acidic than neutral conditions 20 removal at the 100 dose was due to a portion of the contaminant being in the conjugate base form pka 4 66 at 25 c kortüm et al 1960 which is consistent with weaker electrostatic interactions between the carboxylic acid moiety of 3 ppa and the resin functional group hence removal of weakly acidic contaminants by wb aers must consider the acid base properties of both the contaminant and resin the following results are specific to ph 4 and ph 7 and are referred to as nitrate sulfate 3 paa at ph 7 and 3 ppa at ph 4 similar removal was observed between ira458 sb pa g trimethyl and ira67 wb pa g dimethyl 10 difference under all ph conditions and resin dose except 3 ppa at ph 4 briefly the functional groups of the selected wb aers and type i sb aers were dimethylamine r ch3 2hn ira67 and ira96 and trialkylamine with sb aer groups further subdivided into triethyl r ch2ch3 3n a520e and trimethyl r ch3 3n ira458 these results show no influence of aer basicity on resin performance at ph 7 suggesting that tertiary amine and quaternary ammonium functional groups with same alkylamine chain length impart similar adsorption properties to the resin the higher observed removal of 3 ppa by dimethyl compared to trimethyl functionalized pa resin at ph 4 was due to the wb aer release of h in unbuffered solution several studies compared the impact of resin basicity for the removal of charged organic dyes and showed ira458 sb pa g trimethyl to have half wawrzkiewicz 2011 seven greluk and hubicki 2011 and ten times greluk and hubicki 2010 wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2011 more maximum capacity than ira67 wb pa g dimethyl reasons for these differences were the use of non normalized data different resin dose and contaminant concentration in this work resin dose accounted for the capacity of the resin see section 2 3 which implied aer selectivity a previous study supported all these statements whereby wb pa dimethyl resin had higher loading capacity meq g and similar selectivity i e normalized loading for various hydrophobic contaminants than sb pa trimethyl resin gustafson and lirio 1968 nitrate and 3 ppa at ph 7 and 3 ppa at ph 4 followed the same trend for all aers fig 2a b with the respective order of decreasing removal as sb ps mp triethyl 87 66 and 44 wb ps mp dimethyl 77 59 and 36 sb pa g trimethyl 65 45 and 26 wb pa g dimethyl 59 46 and 18 the order of decreasing sulfate removal fig 2c before reaching complete uptake was wb pa g dimethyl 88 89 sb pa g trimethyl 82 83 wb ps mp dimethyl 65 67 sb ps mp triethyl 64 as a rule the affinity of the solute is highest for the resin with complementary polar character the polystyrene matrix of the resin is composed of a repeating ch2 ch ch2 benzene unit making it more hydrophobic than polyacrylic resin with benzene rings substituted by carbonyl groups a520e sb ps mp triethyl is slightly more hydrophobic than ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl due to the longer alkylamine chains of ethyl than methyl functional groups helfferich 1995 zaggia et al 2016 sulfate is 4 times more hydrated than nitrate marcus 1991 thus immobilizing water molecules within the hydration shell more effectively however hydrogen bonds with water molecules are less likely to form in the case of 3 ppa given the nonpolar phenyl moiety attached to an aliphatic chain li and sengupta 1998 hence 3 ppa and nitrate had higher affinity to polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin and to a520e ps triethyl than ira96 ps dimethyl whereas sulfate adsorption was more favorable by polyacrylic resins at the stoichiometric resin dose i e 100 all aers exhibited 96 sulfate removal apart from a520e sb ps mp triethyl with 88 removal implying the preference of resins with closely spaced alkylamine groups for divalent over monovalent ions clifford and weber 1983 subramonian and clifford 1988 the trends comparing alkylamine chain length and polymer composition of the resin are validated by δg0 values for the adsorption of hydrophobic contaminants landry and boyer 2013 landry et al 2015 li and sengupta 2004 and inorganic anions hu et al 2016 on aers with structures similar to the ones tested in this study the length of the resin functional group could also affect adsorption kinetics gu et al 2000 but it was not included in this research the water content of the free base wb aers and chloride form sb aers considered in this study are similar ranging 50 64 table 1 however the degree of resin swelling as expressed by its water content increases by up to 20 upon conversion of free base wb aers to the chloride form and decreases equally in solutions of high ionic strength e g extreme ph conditions harland 1994 all of which are important considerations for the removal of high molecular weight organic compounds such as nom bolto et al 2002 shuang et al 2015 but are less relevant for smaller contaminants e g 3 ppa pfaa laura del moral et al 2020 additionally previous studies have shown aer porosity to have no influence on contaminant removal in batch equilibrium tests this is because macroporous and gel resins vary in pore size distribution 50 100 nm vs 2 nm dudley 2012 and surface morphology which affect adsorption kinetics li and sengupta 2000 and not adsorption equilibrium the results indicated that the hydrophobicity polymer composition and functional group length and spacing between functional groups of the resin were the key properties influencing contaminant selectivity as opposed to resin basicity i e tertiary amine vs quaternary ammonium which showed no measurable impact at ph 7 3 3 competitive removal of six pfaas figs 3 4 and s1 show the effect of resin properties on the co removal of pfaas at different solution ph wb aers and sb aers with analogous properties i e ira67 ira458 and ira96 a520e had same removal results for pfaas at ph 7 which indicates no impact of resin basicity on resin hydrophobicity and thereby pfaas selectivity non electrostatic interactions play important role in resin selectivity and become more pronounced with increasing hydrophobicity of the resin boyer et al 2021b however due to the more hydrophobic character of ethyl than methyl alkylamine functional group a520e sb ps mp triethyl was expected to remove pfaas to a greater extent than ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl conte et al 2015 zaggia et al 2016 given the significant removal of pfaas 100 by polystyrene aers at all resin doses the impact of functional group length of the resin on pfaa selectivity was barely measurable the results on resin hydrophobicity are supported by a previous study showing the order of decreasing normalized loading i e selectivity for pfos as triethylammonium trimethylammonium dimethylamine schuricht et al 2017 figs 3 and 4 show equal removal at ph 4 and ph 7 for all aers ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl and a520e sb ps mp triethyl resins maintained their performance with respect to pfaas removal over the range of ph but decreased by up to 90 for ira67 wb pa g dimethyl and by 5 50 for ira458 sb pa g trimethyl at ph 10 see fig s1 because the pka of selected pfaas spans from 3 33 to 1 07 maimaiti et al 2018 park et al 2020a any effect on removal efficiency was attributed to either the protonating state of amine functional group of the resin or the speciation of dic i e carbonic acid bicarbonate carbonate inorganic carbon species were mostly in the neutral co2 aq h2co3 form at ph 4 pka 6 3 and partly as carbonate ions co3 2 at ph 10 pka 10 3 this indicated no impact of hco3 on pfaas removal for all aers i e ph 4 vs ph 7 whereas the lower removal by the polyacrylic ira458 could be due to competing co3 2 and oh at low pfaas concentration since ira458 sb pa g trimethyl showed similar dic removal on molar basis between ph 7 and ph 10 more ion exchange sites were occupied by divalent co3 2 decreasing the ones that were available for pfaas this is supported in previous research where pfoa removal was reduced by less than 8 but nearly 27 after separate addition of 1 meq l hco3 and co3 2 yang et al 2018 other studies that have investigated the efficiency of sb aer under different ph conditions are in major disagreement deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2019 maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2009 with dixit et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and yu et al 2009 showing decreasing pfas removal with increasing ph but with no clear consensus at ph 4 and ph 7 all aers achieved 85 pfos removal regardless of resin dose i e 25 to 300 or resin properties across all resin doses pfos removal by polyacrylic aers was consistent and ranged from 86 to 95 whereas polystyrene aers exhibited complete removal 100 the high value of the ph corrected octanol water partition coefficient log dow for pfos table s1 is indicative of its substantially more hydrophobic and less water soluble character than remaining pfaas i e two orders of magnitude park et al 2020a zeng et al 2020 pfos partitions even into relatively polar resin e g polyacrylic in response to a driving force while the polystyrene resin has inherent affinity for hydrophobic compounds dietz et al 2021 pfaas become more hydrophobic i e less polarizable as the number of electron withdrawing c fn group increases given the highly nonpolarizable character of fluorine atoms i e high electron binding energy liu and sun 2021 moody and field 2000 similarly pfsas are more hydrophobic than pfcas with same number of carbons due to the more polarizable carboxylate coo than sulfonate so3 head groups and the additional c fn group residing on the carbon tail of pfsas du et al 2014 park et al 2020b the differences across pfaa structures in terms of number of c fn and head group are in line with the order of decreasing log dow listed in table s1 as pfos 8 c fn so3 pfhxs 6 c fn so3 pfoa 7 c fn coo pfbs 4 c fn so3 pfhxa 5 c fn coo pfba 3 c fn coo nonetheless the selectivity of polyacrylic aers was not completely consistent with the perfluorinated carbon tail length and thus the hydrophobic character of pfcas and pfsas because all pfaas had same initial mass concentration 80 μg l low molecular weight pfaas were present at higher equivalent concentration than larger compounds e g pfba to pfoa ratio of 2 see table s1 which made exact comparison in terms of carbon chain length difficult although previous studies have shown that high molecular weight pfaas could block resin pores limiting the intraparticle diffusion of smaller counterparts at low resin to pfaa dose e g 0 2 meq resin meq pfaa maimaiti et al 2018 schuricht et al 2017 the number of ion exchange sites in this study exceeded 370 the total concentration of pfaa at the smallest resin dose i e 25 thereby providing access for all pfaas other trends include the greater removal of pfaas by polystyrene ira96 and a520e than polyacrylic ira67 and ira458 resins and of pfsas than pfcas by polyacrylic resins which are consistent with the nonpolar character of the polystyrene resin matrix and the stronger ionic charge of sulfonates than carboxylates head groups ateia et al 2019b park et al 2020a the observed resin pfaa selectivity align with previous research results evaluating the impacts of changing the resin polymer composition and pfaas head group using sb aers laura del moral et al 2020 park et al 2020a zaggia et al 2016 the resin pfaa selectivity has important implications on aer selection in doc rich waters e g surface water for example previous literature showed lesser interference of background organic matter on pfaa removal using polystyrene than polyacrylic resin dixit et al 2019 laura del moral et al 2020 3 4 adsorption isotherms 3 4 1 approaches to isotherm modeling for ion exchange the nonlinear and linear equations and plots of each isotherm model are summarized in table s2 in supplementary material to investigate the inaccuracies of the linearized curve fitting method the langmuir isotherm parameters kl and q0 and goodness of fit measures for the adsorption of sulfate and nitrate were calculated using the nonlinear and four different linear forms of the langmuir model table s3 excluding a520e data the langmuir type i form linear r2 0 991 was a better fit than the langmuir type ii form 0 600 linear r2 0 889 for sulfate data whereas type ii linearization provided the best fit to nitrate data linear r2 0 995 in contrast the a520e data were well fit by both linearization linear r2 0 98 with a slightly better fit of type i than type ii for nitrate and type ii than type i for sulfate the different outcomes are consistent with the limitations of the linearized langmuir forms discussed in supplementary material all of which agreeing with aer affinity after using the nonlinear least squares regression method parameters of the four linearized langmuir forms converged to unique values varying from 169 to 62 for instance ira67 wb pa g dimethyl had 1 33 times the nitrate capacity of ira458 sb pa g trimethyl using nonlinear least squares method but 3 times more with type ii linearization the linear models that showed decreasing average linear r2 values for sulfate data were langmuir type i 0 9940 redlich peterson rp 0 9940 dubinin astakhov da 0 9475 dubinin radushkevich dr 0 8571 langmuir type ii 0 8370 freundlich 0 819 langmuir type iii langmuir type iv 0 698 data not shown a study on the adsorption of safranin showed a similar order of decreasing r2 values as rp langmuir type i freundlich langmuir type ii langmuir type iii langmuir type iv kumar and sivanesan 2005 these trends create possible misunderstanding where adsorbates occupy a single layer within resin walls using the langmuir type i or the rp linearization but follow a pore filling mechanism otherwise i e langmuir type ii iii or iv in summary the nonlinear least squares method provided a unified error distribution structure eliminating biases in the estimation of model fitting parameters and corrected abnormal values e g langmuir type ii whereas the linearly transformed plots were conditioned by the distortion of their error structures instead of their ability to describe the theory behind each model 3 4 2 ion exchange behavior in single solute systems fis 5 7 and figs s2 s4 show experimental adsorption data fit to the langmuir freundlich dr da and rp isotherm models using the nonlinear least squares regression method to evaluate adsorption behavior and aer properties the isotherm parameters are tabulated in tables s3 s8 in supplementary material the following analysis excludes wb aer at ph 10 since the resin behaves different than sb aer under basic conditions the order of decreasing maximum capacity for all the contaminants q0 mmol g determined from the langmuir and dr models was ira67 wb pa g dimethyl ira458 sb pa g trimethyl ira67 wb ps mp dimethyl a520e sb ps mp triethyl the trend shows higher capacity for wb aer than sb aer analogs and the lowest capacity for the triethyl alkylamine functional group a520e consistent with smaller tertiary amine than quaternary ammonium functional groups boyer et al 2021b and increasing distance between alkylamines with increasing chain length subramonian and clifford 1988 the estimation of the maximum capacity parameter q0 is dependent on the solution condition e g initial contaminant concentration resin dose water matrix competing anions hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and batch adsorption test procedure millar et al 2015 all of which make comparison between studies difficult but provide useful insights on resin properties under same experimental conditions regardless of the goodness of model fit to sulfate equilibrium data the selectivity 1 n rl and thermodynamic δg0 e model parameters all agreed on the selectivity sequence for each resin where selectivity increased with decreasing rl 1 n δg0 and increasing edr and eda values a520e sb ps mp triethyl had significantly lower selectivity for sulfate compared to ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl which showed equally high selectivity than remaining aers a520e and ira96 have same polymer composition but differ in the identity of functional group i e triethylamine vs dimethylamine although the removal results of previous research and in fig 1c had demonstrated increasing sulfate adsorption with increasing resin polarity and decreasing spacing of functional groups hu et al 2016 the model data in this work are complementary suggesting much greater impact of aer site spacing than polymer composition figs s5 s7 show binary exchange plots for chloride form aer in single solute systems the contaminant is more preferred by aer over the mobile counterion i e cl as the distance of data points above the 1 1 line increases the general order of decreasing selectivity for each aer at ph 4 and 7 were as follows ira458 sb pa g trimethyl so4 2 no3 cl 3 ppa ph 7 3 ppa ph 4 a520e sb ps mp triethyl no3 so4 2 3 ppa ph 7 cl 3 ppa ph 4 ira67 wb pa g dimethyl so4 2 no3 cl 3 ppa ph 7 3 ppa ph 4 ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl no3 so4 2 3 ppa ph 7 cl 3 ppa ph 4 the results agree with isotherm models fig 5 7 and s2 s4 and normalized removal data fig 1 looking collectively at adsorption isotherms model parameters and binary exchange plots for the nitrate and sulfate equilibrium experiments all plots were the same between ph 4 and ph 7 with relative difference 10 for model parameters sulfate showed the highest affinity among the contaminants for all aers except a520e resin finally the trends for ira458 sb pa g trimethyl and ira67 wb pa g dimethyl support the discussion in section 3 2 on the negligible impact of solution ph and aer basicity on resin selectivity at ph 7 to further investigate the ion exchange process the equivalent concentration of contaminant removed from solution meq l was plotted as a function of chloride ions released from the resin meq l figs s8 10 most data points were on the 1 1 line i e stoichiometric exchange indicating that the removal of nitrate sulfate and 3 ppa is predominantly through electrostatic interactions the reason for the higher release of chloride than the amount of contaminant removed by wb aer was due to the deprotonation of amine groups in unbuffered test water accompanied by a release of the mobile counterion i e chloride see section 3 1 the results of nitrate and sulfate further justify the observed difference between sb and wb aer experiments since inorganic contaminants could only bind electrostatically to the resin most importantly the uptake of 3 ppa by a520e sb ps mp triethyl resulting in stoichiometric release of chloride at ph 7 fig s9c ph 10 fig s10b and to a lesser extent at ph 4 fig s8c implies that electrostatic interactions are necessary for removal regardless of the hydrophobic character of the system which rather contributes to the selectivity between the solute and the resin landry et al 2015 the results are consistent with previous studies evaluating the ion exchange stoichiometry using polystyrene resin for the removal of large doc compounds boyer et al 2008 walker and boyer 2011 and hiocs landry and boyer 2013 li and sengupta 1998 2004 in terms of nonlinear r2 and are values the order of decreasing two parameter model fit to sulfate equilibrium data was da dr langmuir freundlich while nitrate equilibrium data was equally well fit by all isotherm models r2 0 96 are 10 suggesting that ion exchange of sulfate and nitrate were best represented by intraparticle diffusion rather than the layer by layer theory this approach was supported in a previous study for various inorganic counterion solute ion exchange systems including cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and oh dron and dodi 2011a the da and dr models suggest adsorption by aer to be based on the average free energy of the resin solute solution system with electrostatic interactions as the primary mechanism of removal for example li and sengupta 1998 showed favorable adsorption when the hydrophobic character of the solute is closest to that of adsorbent polyacrylic vs polystyrene than of solution water vs cosolvent 3 5 implications of adsorption mechanisms for wb aer treatment fig 8 shows possible interactions contributing to hydrophobic contaminant e g 3 ppa pfaa removal by wb aer these include 1 electrostatic interactions and non electrostatic interactions namely hydrophobic attractions and van der waals forces such as 2 dipole dipole interactions 3 π π bonding 4 yoshida hydrogen bonding and 5 n π bonding tran et al 2017b 3 5 1 wb pa g dimethyl resin ira67 the close packed methyl amine functional group and polyacrylic composition of ira67 wb pa g dimethyl impart greater sulfate selectivity and higher ion exchange capacity among all the resins in addition the ira67 resin showed the greatest reduction in removal

hydrogen bonds fig 8a occurring between the deprotonated nitrogen atom of the resin functional group and polarized hydrogen atoms of the solute head group e g hydroxyl carbonyl bolto et al 2002 greluk and hubicki 2011 sulfates are known competitors for ion exchange sites song et al 2012 and have shown to reduce the resin capacity for nitrates hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and pfas such as short chain pfaas zeng et al 2020 and the more selective pfoa yang et al 2018 pfhxs maimaiti et al 2018 pfos deng et al 2010 and f 53b gao et al 2017 the semiconductor industry requires high amounts of soluble sulfate based organic chemicals for chip manufacturing while also discharging high levels of pfos i e hundreds μg l lin et al 2009 both presume using reverse osmosis and or nanofiltration for pfas treatment in sulfate rich waters which is problematic due to scaling by calcium sulfate and barium sulfate macadam and jarvis 2015 therefore a pretreatment step using wb pa g dimethyl resin e g ira67 could be a cost effective strategy to increase membrane longevity 3 5 2 wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 the wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 demonstrated high affinity for nitrate 3 ppa and pfaas due to the nonpolar polystyrene composition of the resin which has the potential to form π bonds see fig 8b between aromatic carbons of the resin matrix and the solute li and sengupta 2004 tran et al 2017a transferring the solute from water polar solvent is more favorable with increasing hydrophobicity of solute and or resin but would require a regeneration solution with nonpolar character e g methanol for effective desorption du et al 2014 landry and boyer 2013 the next step in this work is to evaluate the reuse of pfaas laden ira96 resin considering salt solvent composition of the regeneration solution in addition the high buffering capability of ira96 observed in this study and in a previous study zhang et al 2014 would provide a more selective removal of pfaas for example pfaas removal from typically acidic ph 3 chromium plating wastewater was shown to be less effective in the presence of competing chromate anions deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 hu et al 2016 with a decrease in chromium removal as ph increased over the range 2 6 bajpai et al 2012 edebali and pehlivan 2010 wang et al 2015 the use of ira96 would thus play important role in pfaa uptake 5 conclusions at neutral ph contaminant removal was not influenced by the basicity of the resin functional groups this indicated the potential for wb aer to be used in place of sb aer in water and wastewater treatment applications wb and sb aer of polystyrene composition were proven most effective for pfaa removal with a greater selectivity for pfsas than pfcas and for pfos than remaining pfaas to minimize the impact of competing sulfate and carbonate anions on pfaa adsorption aers with large alkylamine functional groups and polystyrene composition are suggested these conclusions are limited to synthetic solutions containing the six pfaas tested in this work future research should evaluate real test waters rich in competing organic matter and explore wb aer with functional groups that are more selective for monovalent anions to extend its use in pfaa impacted water the results at ph 10 demonstrated the protonation of tertiary amine resin functional groups to be reversible and ph dependent this implies the amenable regeneration of wb aer using alkaline solutions with lower impacts than organic cosolvent regeneration wb polystyrene ira96 resin maintained complete removal of pfaas at low concentration μg l suggesting electrostatic binding between pfaa and remaining protonated amine functional groups on the resin further research should focus on continuous flow column experiments to explore the trade offs in both pfaas removal by wb polystyrene and regeneration by wb polyacrylic aers the nonlinear least squares regression is essential when applying the langmuir model to avoid biases from the four linearized forms whereas the remaining two parameter isotherm models were not affected by the regression method all isotherms agreed on the greater capacity of wb aers than sb aers with same polymer composition implying benefit for operation and treatment relying on goodness of fit measures only is not enough to determine the adsorption mechanism and could be misleading as two isotherms with conflicting theories e g langmuir freundlich might fit equilibrium data similarly therefore qualitative rather than quantitative analysis should be considered to identify potential

19918,the underlying chemistry of weak base wb anion exchange resins aers for contaminant removal from water is not well documented in the literature to address this batch adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 4 7 and 10 using two representative wb aers polyacrylic ira67 and polystyrene ira96 and two representative strong base sb aers polyacrylic ira458 and polystyrene a520e of differing polymer composition for the removal of nitrate sulfate 3 phenylpropionic acid 3 ppa as surrogate for natural organic matter and six perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas under acidic ph 4 and neutral ph 7 conditions the selectivity of aers for each contaminant was predominantly influenced by polymer composition followed by the size of the resin functional group this result reflected the wb aers being fully protonated and functioning identical to sb aers isotherm model parameters revealed wb aer had higher capacity than sb aer with analogous polymer composition and porosity regardless of resin selectivity for each contaminant under basic conditions ph 10 contaminant removal by wb aers declined due to deprotonation of the tertiary amine functional groups removal of pfaas by the more hydrophobic polystyrene wb aer ira96 remained approximately constant with changing ph which was possibly due to electrostatic interactions with remaining protonated amine functional groups on the resin keywords ion exchange natural organic matter nom per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas polyacrylic polystyrene tertiary amine data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anion exchange resins are commonly used in water treatment due to facile operability cost effectiveness and selectivity of specific resin structures for a range of contaminants while the effectiveness of strong base sb anion exchange resins aers is well established dixit et al 2021 hu et al 2016 levchuk et al 2018 the chemistry of weak base wb aers is understudied despite their benefits including strong buffering capability hinrichs and snoeyink 1976 zhang et al 2014 ease of regeneration ateia et al 2019a and high capacity boyer et al 2021b höll and kirch 1978 wb aers are also less prone to organic fouling dixit et al 2021 present greater chemical stability in oxidative environments and have higher thermal resistance harland 1994 than sb analogs all of which increase resin longevity and decrease operational costs the main difference between sb and wb aers is the basicity of their alkylamine functional groups where wb aers are nonionic tertiary amine typically

significantly less research has been conducted on wb aer resulting in a lack of understanding regarding resin solute solution interactions while the selectivity and removal efficiency of sb aer is generally influenced by the mobile counterion form laura del moral et al 2020 and resin properties such as polymer composition li and sengupta 1998 and functional group samatya et al 2006 wb aer

protonated at practical ph i e 13 clifford and weber 1983 howe et al 2012 whereas wb aer contains primary secondary and or tertiary amines which become deprotonated at ph greater than their acid

and nadal 2019 previous research evaluating the effect of resin basicity on pfaa adsorption highlighted the decreasing performance of wb aer with increasing solution ph gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 which has overshadowed their treatment effectiveness and limited their use for instance wb aer ira67 exhibited up two orders of magnitude higher adsorption capacity for pfos deng et al 2010 and 9 times greater loading of pfoa than other commercial adsorbents du et al 2015 although wb aers have been examined in some literature key gaps in knowledge remain polyacrylic resin has been the focus of recent work investigating the ph dependence of wb aer for the removal of hydrophobic contaminants deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 shuang et al 2012 wang et al 2019 where adsorption for polyacrylic aer is accompanied by a stoichiometric release of the mobile counterion e g chloride that indicates removal due to electrostatic interactions dixit et al 2019 2020 rahmani and mohseni 2017 however the influence of ph and the use of polystyrene wb aer is understudied despite the high uptake for hydrophobic contaminants observed by polystyrene resins even under highly alkaline conditions wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2011 zhang et al 2014 that has been attributed to non electrostatic adsorption such as hydrophobic interactions and van der waals forces landry et al 2015 when chloride was the mobile counterion polyacrylic wb aer had three times higher adsorption capacity for lactic acid compared to the resin in free base form whereas polystyrene wb aer had less than two times similarly explained by the absence of electrostatic interactions moldes et al 2003 an enhanced understanding of the influence of electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions between wb aer and contaminants with different properties is needed to devise a framework for effective treatment and regeneration the adsorption mechanism selectivity and capacity of aers are generally deduced from isotherm models however using linear regression to determine model parameters may lead to misinformed conclusions allen et al 2003 bolster and hornberger 2007 dron and dodi 2011a foo and hameed 2010 haupert et al 2021 tran et al 2017b the overall goal of this work was to gain new insights on the chemistry of wb aer for contaminant removal from water the specific objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the impact of solution ph and resin properties such as resin basicity polymer structure and functional group on the removal efficiency 2 evaluate the influence of pfaas properties in term of perfluorocarbon tail lengths and head group on the selectivity sequence for each aer 3 discuss the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of chloride form wb aer for various water pollutants and 4 assess the reliability of different isotherm modeling techniques for single solute ion exchange systems the improved understanding presented in this research benefits municipal and industrial

maxq for 24 h at ambient laboratory temperature with dry resins in 125 ml amber glass bottles containing 100 ml of synthetic contaminant solution the percent resin dose was defined as the ratio of resin dose meq l to initial total concentration of analytes meq l five resin doses 25 50 100 150 and 300 were selected for this study batch equilibrium tests were carried out at constant concentration of 2 14 meq l by varying the resin mass which showed to be a better representation of the ion exchange process than varying the initial concentration of analytes at same resin mass millar et al 2015 the contaminant solutions were prepared at three different solution ph 4 7 and 10 to investigate the influence of alkaline conditions on wb aer removal efficiency wb resins were contacted with a highly basic solution ph 11 for 24 h then carefully decanted the test water at ph 11 4 was subsequently added to the resin and equilibrated for 24 h this method was adopted for wb aer to compensate for the deprotonation of amine groups which constantly decreases the ph in unbuffered test water gustafson et al 1970 for simplicity the two methods used to equilibrate wb and sb aers in basic conditions are referred to as ph 10 in this paper all samples were tested in triplicate and the ph was measured before and after adsorption experiments control samples with no resin showed negligible loss of contaminant due to adsorption to glass walls 2 4 analytical methods concentrations of cl nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 anions and sodium na cations were measured using ion chromatography ic

were purchased from fischer scientific at optima hplc grade the mixture flow rate was maintained at 0 8 ml min 2 5 data analysis the equivalent concentration of each analyte in the resin phase qe meq g was calculated on a mass balance basis from eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e m v where c 0 meq l and c e meq l are the initial and equilibrium aqueous concentration of the target analyte respectively m g is the dry mass of resin and v is the volume of synthetic solution the removal efficiency at each percent resin dose was determined as the amount of contaminant removed from solution normalized by initial concentration to account for additional chloride sites stemming from resin pre conditioning the resin capacity was recalculated for all resins using 10 more no3 and 10 more so4 2 than the manufacturer value the highest exchange capacity for each aer was then used for determination of isotherm model parameters see electronic supplementary material this recalculation was due to higher observed contaminant uptake and chloride release for low percent resin dose than the maximum theoretical resin capacity previous work reported polyacrylic sb aer to have capacity approx 2 the manufacturer value hu et al 2016 percent removal qe and separation factors for each percent resin dose and analyte were computed as the average of triplicate samples with error bars representing one standard deviation to investigate the controlling adsorption mechanism responsible for contaminant removal the experimental qe data were fit to the langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich dr dubinin astakhov da and redlich peterson rp isotherm models the langmuir isotherm model expressed in eq 2 is widely used to fit ion exchange equilibrium data due to the ease and usefulness of estimating the model parameters dron and dodi 2011b song et al 2012 2 q e q 0 k l c e 1 k l c e where q0 mmol g is the maximum theoretical capacity of the resin and kl l mmol is the langmuir coefficient associated with

supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of solution ph on contaminant removal by wb aer fig 1 shows the impact of solution ph on contaminant removal by wb aer the wb aers showed 10 removal of 3 ppa fig 1a and b nitrate fig 1c and d sulfate fig 1e and f and dic fig 1g and h at solution ph 10 the ph decreased as more resin was added to the test water due to the increasing number of deprotonating wb aer functional groups i e h release at the 300 dose both wb pa g dimethyl resin ira67 and wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 reached removals of 97 sulfate 60 nitrate and 55 dic at ph 6 7 and 10 3 ppa at ph 8 10 4 the higher contaminant removal at lower ph and higher resin dose is consistent with increasing protonated functional groups of the wb aer at resin dose 100 h released from the resin was neutralized by excess oh in solution which kept the ph stable at ph 10 and the functional groups uncharged at higher resin doses h was in excess relative to oh thereby decreasing the solution ph to 6 8 the wb aers function as nonionic resins as ph surpasses the pka and electrostatic interactions diminish the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the pfaa mixture contributed to 107 mg l as caco3 of alkalinity which is on the low end of realistic groundwater and was not sufficient to buffer the ph the ph values measured at the 300 dose and the pka values estimated from previous studies were in closer agreement for ira96 ph 6 3 6 6 pka 6 0 6 3 than ira67 ph 6 8 7 2 pka 9 3 macpherson 2009 miyazaki and nakai 2011 zhang et al 2014 the wb pa g dimethyl resin ira67 fig 1g followed the same trend for pfaas as the other contaminants while the wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 fig 1h was not affected by solution ph and still achieved 90 removal at ph 10 in fact wb ps mp dimethyl resin consistently showed measurable removal of all contaminants even when solution ph was much greater than the resin pka while the polystyrene composition could have allowed ira96 to adsorb pfaas and 3 ppa via hydrophobic interactions and or van der waals forces sulfate nitrate and bicarbonate are only bound electrostatically to the resin which suggested that ira96 had a fraction of protonated functional groups with higher pka since the initial pfaa concentration of 480 μg l was substantially exceeded by the resin dose electrostatic interactions with remaining charged amine groups of the ira96 were sufficient to achieve 95 removal of all pfaas at the 50 resin dose in a previous study multiple asymmetric peaks were detected over the 31p nmr spectral range of ira96 indicating heterogeneity in amine functionalities of the resin structure miyazaki and nakai 2011 in another study some wb aers had polyamine functional groups while commercially advertised as secondary or tertiary amine resins clifford and weber 1983 such non uniformity arises from the difficulties of controlling the chloromethylation step during resin synthesis anderson 1964 the results in the literature showed similar decrease in wb aer uptake of inorganic anions awual et al 2008 kołodyńska 2009 2010 hydrophobic contaminants greluk and hubicki 2011 gustafson and lirio 1968 hinrichs and snoeyink 1976 wawrzkiewicz 2011 wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2011 zhang et al 2014 and pfas deng et al 2010 du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 with increasing solution ph however the results of this study clearly demonstrated the reversibility of this behavior in batch conditions whereby a decrease in solution ph resulted in protonation of amine functional groups and increasing removal thereupon these findings justify pre treating wb aers with solutions of strong acids such as hcl as described elsewhere bolto et al 2002 moldes et al 2003 sengupta and clifford 1986 and precludes using free base form wb aers in unbuffered test water with low ionic strength wb aer could bind electrostatically to charged contaminants only when h and a mobile counterion simultaneously occupy aer sites helfferich 1995 for instance a study showed a 10 fold decrease in the adsorption capacity for pfos on free base ira67 resin compared with its chloride form gao et al 2017 although ira67 wb pa g dimethyl demonstrated no adsorption capacity for contaminants at ph 11 5 the resin exhibited 50 removal of all pfaas and greater removal of pfsas than pfcas when solution ph decreased to 7 2 fig 1g the trends for pfaa removal are consistent with stronger electrostatic interactions between more negatively charged sulfonate than carboxylate head group of pfaa ateia et al 2019b and increasing number of protonated resin functional groups at lower ph these results indicate that wb aer could be effectively used for pfaa treatment given that the majority of drinking water applications involve water sources having ph 9 0 du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 while higher ph applications are mostly for regeneration purposes using alkaline solutions more importantly the low removal of pfaas under highly basic conditions i e ph 11 5 suggested no available ion exchange sites on the resin due to complete deprotonation of amine functional groups and thus the potential for effective regeneration using dilute naoh and or naoh brine solutions hinrichs and snoeyink 1976 jackson and bolto 1990 ateia et al 2019a used various nonionic adsorbents such as highly porous nanostructured polymers to highlight the benefits of deprotonation of tertiary amine functional groups in alkaline conditions likewise effective pfas desorption from ira67 was achieved using 0 04 1 naoh du et al 2015 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 with an interesting result showing increasing desorption efficiency with decreasing naoh as 4 naoh 0 4 naoh 0 04 naoh deng et al 2010 while single use resins have been used for the removal of pfas at trace levels ng l fang et al 2021 zaggia et al 2016 regenerable resins have been pursued for the remediation of waters containing pfas concentrations ranging from tens to several hundreds of μg l liu and sun 2021 woodard et al 2017 the results of the current work suggest that the fraction of naoh could be decreased to 0 015 ph 11 57 thus reducing chemical requirements and thereby operating costs for drinking water applications involving high concentrations of pfaas at μg l levels however this does not pertain to ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl which showed high affinity for pfaas regardless of ph in addition a previous study showed that the selectivity for hydroxide ions depends on the equilibrium concentration of naoh in solution and resin properties such as porosity and polymer composition höll and kirch 1978 which could explain the different ph trends in the current study to confirm these conjectures studies involving continuous flow column regeneration of wb aer using alkaline solutions are the next logical steps in this research 3 2 effect of resin properties on individual contaminant removal ira458 sb pa g trimethyl a520e sb ps mp triethyl ira67 wb pa g dimethyl and ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl resins were tested to investigate the effect of resin characteristics for separate removal of contaminants fig 2 shows the percentage removal of 3 phenylpropionic acid 3 ppa nitrate and sulfate at ph 4 7 and 10 as a function of resin dose from 25 to 300 at a given resin dose nitrate and sulfate exhibited similar removal by sb aers regardless of solution ph 4 7 and 10 and by wb aers at solution ph 4 and 7 the same removal trend in terms of solution ph held for 3 ppa except for the lower removal observed at ph 4 the wb aers showed no to low removal of contaminants at ph 10 see section 3 1 these results indicated the tertiary amine functional groups of the wb aers behaved similarly as the quaternary ammonium functional groups of the sb aers at ph 7 previous findings also corroborated minor change in adsorption capacity of aers with quaternary ammonium and tertiary amine functional groups over solution ph 3 8 deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 greluk and hubicki 2011 which is of importance since most water bodies are at ph 8 the reason for the lower removal of 3 ppa under acidic than neutral conditions 20 removal at the 100 dose was due to a portion of the contaminant being in the conjugate base form pka 4 66 at 25 c kortüm et al 1960 which is consistent with weaker electrostatic interactions between the carboxylic acid moiety of 3 ppa and the resin functional group hence removal of weakly acidic contaminants by wb aers must consider the acid base properties of both the contaminant and resin the following results are specific to ph 4 and ph 7 and are referred to as nitrate sulfate 3 paa at ph 7 and 3 ppa at ph 4 similar removal was observed between ira458 sb pa g trimethyl and ira67 wb pa g dimethyl 10 difference under all ph conditions and resin dose except 3 ppa at ph 4 briefly the functional groups of the selected wb aers and type i sb aers were dimethylamine r ch3 2hn ira67 and ira96 and trialkylamine with sb aer groups further subdivided into triethyl r ch2ch3 3n a520e and trimethyl r ch3 3n ira458 these results show no influence of aer basicity on resin performance at ph 7 suggesting that tertiary amine and quaternary ammonium functional groups with same alkylamine chain length impart similar adsorption properties to the resin the higher observed removal of 3 ppa by dimethyl compared to trimethyl functionalized pa resin at ph 4 was due to the wb aer release of h in unbuffered solution several studies compared the impact of resin basicity for the removal of charged organic dyes and showed ira458 sb pa g trimethyl to have half wawrzkiewicz 2011 seven greluk and hubicki 2011 and ten times greluk and hubicki 2010 wawrzkiewicz and hubicki 2011 more maximum capacity than ira67 wb pa g dimethyl reasons for these differences were the use of non normalized data different resin dose and contaminant concentration in this work resin dose accounted for the capacity of the resin see section 2 3 which implied aer selectivity a previous study supported all these statements whereby wb pa dimethyl resin had higher loading capacity meq g and similar selectivity i e normalized loading for various hydrophobic contaminants than sb pa trimethyl resin gustafson and lirio 1968 nitrate and 3 ppa at ph 7 and 3 ppa at ph 4 followed the same trend for all aers fig 2a b with the respective order of decreasing removal as sb ps mp triethyl 87 66 and 44 wb ps mp dimethyl 77 59 and 36 sb pa g trimethyl 65 45 and 26 wb pa g dimethyl 59 46 and 18 the order of decreasing sulfate removal fig 2c before reaching complete uptake was wb pa g dimethyl 88 89 sb pa g trimethyl 82 83 wb ps mp dimethyl 65 67 sb ps mp triethyl 64 as a rule the affinity of the solute is highest for the resin with complementary polar character the polystyrene matrix of the resin is composed of a repeating ch2 ch ch2 benzene unit making it more hydrophobic than polyacrylic resin with benzene rings substituted by carbonyl groups a520e sb ps mp triethyl is slightly more hydrophobic than ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl due to the longer alkylamine chains of ethyl than methyl functional groups helfferich 1995 zaggia et al 2016 sulfate is 4 times more hydrated than nitrate marcus 1991 thus immobilizing water molecules within the hydration shell more effectively however hydrogen bonds with water molecules are less likely to form in the case of 3 ppa given the nonpolar phenyl moiety attached to an aliphatic chain li and sengupta 1998 hence 3 ppa and nitrate had higher affinity to polystyrene resin than polyacrylic resin and to a520e ps triethyl than ira96 ps dimethyl whereas sulfate adsorption was more favorable by polyacrylic resins at the stoichiometric resin dose i e 100 all aers exhibited 96 sulfate removal apart from a520e sb ps mp triethyl with 88 removal implying the preference of resins with closely spaced alkylamine groups for divalent over monovalent ions clifford and weber 1983 subramonian and clifford 1988 the trends comparing alkylamine chain length and polymer composition of the resin are validated by δg0 values for the adsorption of hydrophobic contaminants landry and boyer 2013 landry et al 2015 li and sengupta 2004 and inorganic anions hu et al 2016 on aers with structures similar to the ones tested in this study the length of the resin functional group could also affect adsorption kinetics gu et al 2000 but it was not included in this research the water content of the free base wb aers and chloride form sb aers considered in this study are similar ranging 50 64 table 1 however the degree of resin swelling as expressed by its water content increases by up to 20 upon conversion of free base wb aers to the chloride form and decreases equally in solutions of high ionic strength e g extreme ph conditions harland 1994 all of which are important considerations for the removal of high molecular weight organic compounds such as nom bolto et al 2002 shuang et al 2015 but are less relevant for smaller contaminants e g 3 ppa pfaa laura del moral et al 2020 additionally previous studies have shown aer porosity to have no influence on contaminant removal in batch equilibrium tests this is because macroporous and gel resins vary in pore size distribution 50 100 nm vs 2 nm dudley 2012 and surface morphology which affect adsorption kinetics li and sengupta 2000 and not adsorption equilibrium the results indicated that the hydrophobicity polymer composition and functional group length and spacing between functional groups of the resin were the key properties influencing contaminant selectivity as opposed to resin basicity i e tertiary amine vs quaternary ammonium which showed no measurable impact at ph 7 3 3 competitive removal of six pfaas figs 3 4 and s1 show the effect of resin properties on the co removal of pfaas at different solution ph wb aers and sb aers with analogous properties i e ira67 ira458 and ira96 a520e had same removal results for pfaas at ph 7 which indicates no impact of resin basicity on resin hydrophobicity and thereby pfaas selectivity non electrostatic interactions play important role in resin selectivity and become more pronounced with increasing hydrophobicity of the resin boyer et al 2021b however due to the more hydrophobic character of ethyl than methyl alkylamine functional group a520e sb ps mp triethyl was expected to remove pfaas to a greater extent than ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl conte et al 2015 zaggia et al 2016 given the significant removal of pfaas 100 by polystyrene aers at all resin doses the impact of functional group length of the resin on pfaa selectivity was barely measurable the results on resin hydrophobicity are supported by a previous study showing the order of decreasing normalized loading i e selectivity for pfos as triethylammonium trimethylammonium dimethylamine schuricht et al 2017 figs 3 and 4 show equal removal at ph 4 and ph 7 for all aers ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl and a520e sb ps mp triethyl resins maintained their performance with respect to pfaas removal over the range of ph but decreased by up to 90 for ira67 wb pa g dimethyl and by 5 50 for ira458 sb pa g trimethyl at ph 10 see fig s1 because the pka of selected pfaas spans from 3 33 to 1 07 maimaiti et al 2018 park et al 2020a any effect on removal efficiency was attributed to either the protonating state of amine functional group of the resin or the speciation of dic i e carbonic acid bicarbonate carbonate inorganic carbon species were mostly in the neutral co2 aq h2co3 form at ph 4 pka 6 3 and partly as carbonate ions co3 2 at ph 10 pka 10 3 this indicated no impact of hco3 on pfaas removal for all aers i e ph 4 vs ph 7 whereas the lower removal by the polyacrylic ira458 could be due to competing co3 2 and oh at low pfaas concentration since ira458 sb pa g trimethyl showed similar dic removal on molar basis between ph 7 and ph 10 more ion exchange sites were occupied by divalent co3 2 decreasing the ones that were available for pfaas this is supported in previous research where pfoa removal was reduced by less than 8 but nearly 27 after separate addition of 1 meq l hco3 and co3 2 yang et al 2018 other studies that have investigated the efficiency of sb aer under different ph conditions are in major disagreement deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2019 maimaiti et al 2018 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2009 with dixit et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and yu et al 2009 showing decreasing pfas removal with increasing ph but with no clear consensus at ph 4 and ph 7 all aers achieved 85 pfos removal regardless of resin dose i e 25 to 300 or resin properties across all resin doses pfos removal by polyacrylic aers was consistent and ranged from 86 to 95 whereas polystyrene aers exhibited complete removal 100 the high value of the ph corrected octanol water partition coefficient log dow for pfos table s1 is indicative of its substantially more hydrophobic and less water soluble character than remaining pfaas i e two orders of magnitude park et al 2020a zeng et al 2020 pfos partitions even into relatively polar resin e g polyacrylic in response to a driving force while the polystyrene resin has inherent affinity for hydrophobic compounds dietz et al 2021 pfaas become more hydrophobic i e less polarizable as the number of electron withdrawing c fn group increases given the highly nonpolarizable character of fluorine atoms i e high electron binding energy liu and sun 2021 moody and field 2000 similarly pfsas are more hydrophobic than pfcas with same number of carbons due to the more polarizable carboxylate coo than sulfonate so3 head groups and the additional c fn group residing on the carbon tail of pfsas du et al 2014 park et al 2020b the differences across pfaa structures in terms of number of c fn and head group are in line with the order of decreasing log dow listed in table s1 as pfos 8 c fn so3 pfhxs 6 c fn so3 pfoa 7 c fn coo pfbs 4 c fn so3 pfhxa 5 c fn coo pfba 3 c fn coo nonetheless the selectivity of polyacrylic aers was not completely consistent with the perfluorinated carbon tail length and thus the hydrophobic character of pfcas and pfsas because all pfaas had same initial mass concentration 80 μg l low molecular weight pfaas were present at higher equivalent concentration than larger compounds e g pfba to pfoa ratio of 2 see table s1 which made exact comparison in terms of carbon chain length difficult although previous studies have shown that high molecular weight pfaas could block resin pores limiting the intraparticle diffusion of smaller counterparts at low resin to pfaa dose e g 0 2 meq resin meq pfaa maimaiti et al 2018 schuricht et al 2017 the number of ion exchange sites in this study exceeded 370 the total concentration of pfaa at the smallest resin dose i e 25 thereby providing access for all pfaas other trends include the greater removal of pfaas by polystyrene ira96 and a520e than polyacrylic ira67 and ira458 resins and of pfsas than pfcas by polyacrylic resins which are consistent with the nonpolar character of the polystyrene resin matrix and the stronger ionic charge of sulfonates than carboxylates head groups ateia et al 2019b park et al 2020a the observed resin pfaa selectivity align with previous research results evaluating the impacts of changing the resin polymer composition and pfaas head group using sb aers laura del moral et al 2020 park et al 2020a zaggia et al 2016 the resin pfaa selectivity has important implications on aer selection in doc rich waters e g surface water for example previous literature showed lesser interference of background organic matter on pfaa removal using polystyrene than polyacrylic resin dixit et al 2019 laura del moral et al 2020 3 4 adsorption isotherms 3 4 1 approaches to isotherm modeling for ion exchange the nonlinear and linear equations and plots of each isotherm model are summarized in table s2 in supplementary material to investigate the inaccuracies of the linearized curve fitting method the langmuir isotherm parameters kl and q0 and goodness of fit measures for the adsorption of sulfate and nitrate were calculated using the nonlinear and four different linear forms of the langmuir model table s3 excluding a520e data the langmuir type i form linear r2 0 991 was a better fit than the langmuir type ii form 0 600 linear r2 0 889 for sulfate data whereas type ii linearization provided the best fit to nitrate data linear r2 0 995 in contrast the a520e data were well fit by both linearization linear r2 0 98 with a slightly better fit of type i than type ii for nitrate and type ii than type i for sulfate the different outcomes are consistent with the limitations of the linearized langmuir forms discussed in supplementary material all of which agreeing with aer affinity after using the nonlinear least squares regression method parameters of the four linearized langmuir forms converged to unique values varying from 169 to 62 for instance ira67 wb pa g dimethyl had 1 33 times the nitrate capacity of ira458 sb pa g trimethyl using nonlinear least squares method but 3 times more with type ii linearization the linear models that showed decreasing average linear r2 values for sulfate data were langmuir type i 0 9940 redlich peterson rp 0 9940 dubinin astakhov da 0 9475 dubinin radushkevich dr 0 8571 langmuir type ii 0 8370 freundlich 0 819 langmuir type iii langmuir type iv 0 698 data not shown a study on the adsorption of safranin showed a similar order of decreasing r2 values as rp langmuir type i freundlich langmuir type ii langmuir type iii langmuir type iv kumar and sivanesan 2005 these trends create possible misunderstanding where adsorbates occupy a single layer within resin walls using the langmuir type i or the rp linearization but follow a pore filling mechanism otherwise i e langmuir type ii iii or iv in summary the nonlinear least squares method provided a unified error distribution structure eliminating biases in the estimation of model fitting parameters and corrected abnormal values e g langmuir type ii whereas the linearly transformed plots were conditioned by the distortion of their error structures instead of their ability to describe the theory behind each model 3 4 2 ion exchange behavior in single solute systems fis 5 7 and figs s2 s4 show experimental adsorption data fit to the langmuir freundlich dr da and rp isotherm models using the nonlinear least squares regression method to evaluate adsorption behavior and aer properties the isotherm parameters are tabulated in tables s3 s8 in supplementary material the following analysis excludes wb aer at ph 10 since the resin behaves different than sb aer under basic conditions the order of decreasing maximum capacity for all the contaminants q0 mmol g determined from the langmuir and dr models was ira67 wb pa g dimethyl ira458 sb pa g trimethyl ira67 wb ps mp dimethyl a520e sb ps mp triethyl the trend shows higher capacity for wb aer than sb aer analogs and the lowest capacity for the triethyl alkylamine functional group a520e consistent with smaller tertiary amine than quaternary ammonium functional groups boyer et al 2021b and increasing distance between alkylamines with increasing chain length subramonian and clifford 1988 the estimation of the maximum capacity parameter q0 is dependent on the solution condition e g initial contaminant concentration resin dose water matrix competing anions hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and batch adsorption test procedure millar et al 2015 all of which make comparison between studies difficult but provide useful insights on resin properties under same experimental conditions regardless of the goodness of model fit to sulfate equilibrium data the selectivity 1 n rl and thermodynamic δg0 e model parameters all agreed on the selectivity sequence for each resin where selectivity increased with decreasing rl 1 n δg0 and increasing edr and eda values a520e sb ps mp triethyl had significantly lower selectivity for sulfate compared to ira96 wb ps mp dimethyl which showed equally high selectivity than remaining aers a520e and ira96 have same polymer composition but differ in the identity of functional group i e triethylamine vs dimethylamine although the removal results of previous research and in fig 1c had demonstrated increasing sulfate adsorption with increasing resin polarity and decreasing spacing of functional groups hu et al 2016 the model data in this work are complementary suggesting much greater impact of aer site spacing than polymer composition figs s5 s7 show binary exchange plots for chloride form aer in single solute systems the contaminant is more preferred by aer over the mobile counterion i e cl as the distance of data points above the 1 1 line increases the general order of decreasing selectivity for each aer at ph 4 and

wb ps mp dimethyl no3 so4 2 3 ppa ph 7 cl 3 ppa ph 4 the results agree with isotherm models fig 5 7 and s2 s4 and normalized removal data fig 1 looking collectively at adsorption isotherms model parameters and binary exchange plots for the nitrate and sulfate equilibrium experiments all plots were the same between ph 4 and ph 7 with relative difference 10 for model parameters sulfate showed the highest affinity among the contaminants for all aers except a520e resin finally the trends for ira458 sb pa g trimethyl and ira67 wb pa g dimethyl support the discussion in section 3 2 on the negligible impact of solution ph and aer basicity on resin selectivity at ph 7 to further investigate the ion exchange process the equivalent concentration of contaminant removed from solution meq l was plotted as a function of chloride ions released from the resin meq l figs s8 10 most data points were on the 1 1 line i e stoichiometric exchange indicating that the removal of nitrate sulfate and 3 ppa is predominantly through electrostatic interactions the reason for the higher release of chloride than the amount of contaminant removed by wb aer was due to the deprotonation of amine groups in unbuffered test water accompanied by a release of the mobile counterion i e chloride see section 3 1 the results of nitrate and sulfate further justify the observed difference between sb and wb aer experiments since inorganic contaminants could only bind electrostatically to the resin most importantly the uptake of 3 ppa by a520e sb ps mp triethyl resulting in stoichiometric release of chloride at ph 7 fig s9c ph 10 fig s10b and to a lesser extent at ph 4 fig s8c implies that electrostatic interactions are necessary for removal regardless of the hydrophobic character of the system which rather contributes to the selectivity between the solute and the resin landry et al 2015 the results are consistent with previous studies evaluating the ion exchange stoichiometry using polystyrene resin for the removal of large doc compounds boyer et al 2008 walker and boyer 2011 and hiocs landry and boyer 2013 li and sengupta 1998 2004 in terms of nonlinear r2 and are values the order of decreasing two parameter model fit to sulfate equilibrium data was da dr langmuir freundlich while nitrate equilibrium data was equally well fit by all isotherm models r2 0 96 are 10 suggesting that ion exchange of sulfate and nitrate were best represented by intraparticle diffusion rather than the layer by layer theory this approach was supported in a previous study for various inorganic counterion solute ion exchange systems including cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and oh dron and dodi 2011a the da and dr models suggest adsorption by aer to be based on the average free energy of the resin solute solution system with electrostatic interactions as the primary mechanism of removal for example li and sengupta 1998 showed favorable adsorption when the hydrophobic character of the solute is closest to that of adsorbent polyacrylic vs polystyrene than of solution water vs cosolvent 3 5 implications of adsorption mechanisms for wb aer treatment fig 8 shows possible interactions contributing to hydrophobic contaminant e g 3 ppa pfaa removal by wb aer these include 1 electrostatic interactions and non electrostatic interactions namely hydrophobic attractions and van der waals forces such as 2 dipole dipole interactions 3 π π bonding 4 yoshida hydrogen bonding and 5 n π bonding tran et al 2017b 3 5 1 wb pa g dimethyl resin ira67 the close packed methyl amine functional group and polyacrylic composition of ira67 wb pa g dimethyl impart greater sulfate selectivity and higher ion exchange capacity among all the resins in addition the ira67 resin showed the greatest reduction in removal

hydrogen bonds fig 8a occurring between the deprotonated nitrogen atom of the resin functional group and polarized hydrogen atoms of the solute head group e g hydroxyl carbonyl bolto et al 2002 greluk and hubicki 2011 sulfates are known competitors for ion exchange sites song et al 2012 and have shown to reduce the resin capacity for nitrates hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and pfas such as short chain pfaas zeng et al 2020 and the more selective pfoa yang et al 2018 pfhxs maimaiti et al 2018 pfos deng et al 2010 and f 53b gao et al 2017 the semiconductor industry requires high amounts of soluble sulfate based organic chemicals for chip manufacturing while also discharging high levels of pfos i e hundreds μg l lin et al 2009 both presume using reverse osmosis and or nanofiltration for pfas treatment in sulfate rich waters which is problematic due to scaling by calcium sulfate and barium sulfate macadam and jarvis 2015 therefore a pretreatment step using wb pa g dimethyl resin e g ira67 could be a cost effective strategy to increase membrane longevity 3 5 2 wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 the wb ps mp dimethyl resin ira96 demonstrated high affinity for nitrate 3 ppa and pfaas due to the nonpolar polystyrene composition of the resin which has the potential to form π bonds see fig 8b between aromatic carbons of the resin matrix and the solute li and sengupta 2004 tran et al 2017a transferring the solute from water polar solvent is more favorable with increasing hydrophobicity of solute and or resin but would require a regeneration solution with nonpolar character e g methanol for effective desorption du et al 2014 landry and boyer 2013 the next step in this work is to evaluate the reuse of pfaas laden ira96 resin considering salt solvent composition of the regeneration solution in addition the high buffering capability of ira96 observed in this study and in a previous study zhang et al 2014 would provide a more selective removal of pfaas for example pfaas removal from typically acidic ph 3 chromium plating wastewater was shown to be less effective in the presence of competing chromate anions deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 hu et al 2016 with a decrease in chromium removal as ph increased over the range 2 6 bajpai et al 2012 edebali and pehlivan 2010 wang et al 2015 the use of ira96 would thus play important role in pfaa uptake 5 conclusions at neutral ph contaminant removal was not influenced by the basicity of the resin functional groups this indicated the potential for wb aer to be used in place of sb aer in water and wastewater treatment applications wb and sb aer of polystyrene composition were proven most effective for pfaa removal with a greater selectivity for pfsas than pfcas and for pfos than remaining pfaas to minimize the impact of competing sulfate and carbonate anions on pfaa adsorption aers with large alkylamine functional groups and polystyrene composition are suggested these conclusions are limited to synthetic solutions containing the six pfaas tested in this work future research should evaluate real test waters rich in competing organic matter and explore wb aer with functional groups that are more selective for monovalent anions to extend its use in pfaa impacted water the results at ph 10 demonstrated the protonation of tertiary amine resin functional groups to be reversible and ph dependent this implies the amenable regeneration of wb aer using alkaline solutions with lower impacts than organic cosolvent regeneration wb polystyrene ira96 resin maintained complete removal of pfaas at low concentration μg l suggesting electrostatic binding between pfaa and remaining protonated amine functional groups on the resin further research should focus on continuous flow column experiments to explore the trade offs in both pfaas removal by wb polystyrene and regeneration by wb polyacrylic aers the nonlinear least squares regression is essential when applying the langmuir model to avoid biases from the four linearized forms whereas the remaining two parameter isotherm models were not affected by the regression method all isotherms agreed on the greater capacity of wb aers than sb aers with same polymer composition implying benefit for operation and treatment relying on goodness of fit measures only is not enough to determine the adsorption mechanism and could be misleading as two isotherms with conflicting theories e g langmuir freundlich might fit equilibrium data similarly therefore qualitative rather than quantitative analysis should be considered to identify potential

19919,to ensure access to safe sanitation facilities in rural communities cheap off grid technologies need to be developed to substitute pit latrines and open defecation in this study we present a prototype system based on hydrothermal oxidation which under optimal conditions converts a fecal sludge simulant almost completely to co 2 and water leaving behind only a carbon poor aqueous phase with the minerals the prototype has been designed to process the feces from two households this technology does not only enable a fast and complete conversion but is potentially also very energy efficient as the feed does not require any pre treatment or drying the system was found to effectively remove 97 99 of the total organic carbon within a reaction time of 600 s under an external energy demand of roughly 4 kwh per kilogram of wet feces by using the oxygen in air as an oxidant a total of ten experiments with varying injection pressure total solids content of the feed and residence time in the reactor were performed to find experimental settings with high conversion only when the residence time was decreased from 600 to 300 s did the conversion fall significantly below 97 to reach a target value of 99 9 toc conversion the reactor temperature and or the residence time must be increased further to achieve a system applicable in regions with no connection to the energy grid the thermal loss of the reactor insulation needs to be lowered further to achieve an overall thermally self sustaining operation keywords supercritical water oxidation scwo hydrothermal oxidation hto off grid feces treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction roughly two billion people still lack access to basic sanitation services resulting practices such as open defecation or defecation into latrines which are seldom or never emptied can lead to the contamination of drinking water and to the propagation of diseases while the number of people with access to hygienically safe sanitation facilities is increasing the progress needs to be accelerated to meet the goal of universal basic sanitation by 2030 who 2017 2021 the missing access to sanitation services is especially pronounced in low income and remote rural areas as most of these rural communities also lack access to electricity and sewage systems self sufficient off grid solutions will be key to ensure coverage in such regions one of the technologies that would allow such an on site treatment of fecal sludge is hydrothermal oxidation hto being a high pressure and high temperature technology developing a safe reliable and affordable hto system for rural communities presents an enormous challenge hydrothermal processes take place in aqueous medium at temperatures above 100 c and at pressures above the corresponding saturation pressure of water if the conditions exceed the critical point of water at 374 c and 221 bar the term supercritical water process is also used peterson et al 2008 under supercritical water conditions the polarity of water decreases drastically rendering non ionic species and gases such as o 2 n 2 nh 3 co co 2 fully miscible brunner 2009a 2009b on the other hand salts and other minerals are almost insoluble and will precipitate in hydrothermal oxidation and supercritical water oxidation scwo an oxidant is added to the water and the organic matter which can be readily decomposed to form co 2 h 2 o nh 3 and minerals jiang et al 2020 this has been demonstrated with biological polymers such as proteins and feeds containing polysaccharides jin et al 2001 mochidzuki et al 2003 zhu et al 2019 as well as their monomers holgate et al 1995 all main components of feces human feces are a semi solid mixture of waste products of human digestion made up predominantly of water 63 87 as well as organic and inorganic solids the main elements in the solid organic fraction are c o h n and s found in bacterial biomass protein carbohydrates and lipids rose et al 2015 the treatment of urine feces waste streams with hto scwo collectively called hto herein was first investigated in relation to life support systems for short or long term manned space missions as well as for lunar bases in these environments suitable recycling technologies for human waste are needed due to the high cost of resupplying resources from earth hicks et al 2012 sedej 1985 hto has been identified as an ideal candidate as the reaction allows a fast and complete waste conversion to benign products and can be made self sufficient additionally the waste stream does not require drying and nutrients and water can easily be reclaimed hicks et al 2012 sedej 1985 the first hto reactors for such purposes were built in 1975 1977 by lockheed missiles and space company weitzman 1977 they reported toc conversions of 88 94 at 288 to 315 c and 64 to 150 bar with residence times between 19 and 90 min in a continuous flow reactor using pure oxygen as oxidant these conditions were still far from supercritical conditions closer to typical wet oxidation processes price 1981 observed conversions in the range of 56 82 at roughly 24 min reaction time pressures of 157 to 221 bar and temperatures of 277 to 295 c at supercritical conditions conversions of 88 92 were obtained at shorter reaction times of 2 5 min pressures of 265 279 bar and temperatures of 400 to 440 c but their urine feces slurry had a higher weight fraction of feces compared to lockheed takahashi et al 1989 studied solutions of ammonium hydroxide and acetic acid and a slurry of human urine feces and wipes as model wastes for a controlled ecological life support system these model wastes were oxidized with h 2 o 2 as the oxidizer in a stirred batch reactor at 250 500 c at pressures from 47 to 240 bar and residence times up to 120 min for the mixture of urine feces and wipes temperatures below the critical temperature led to incomplete carbon conversion for a residence time of 60 min the nitrogen in the ammonium hydroxide was oxidized more slowly up to the maximum temperature of 500 c less than 50 of the n were oxidized for a residence time of 60 min hong et al 1987 also investigated the treatment of a urine feces mixture for the same purpose but focused on supercritical conditions of 256 bar and more than 600 c the retrieved product solution contained about 1 ppm of total carbon energy efficient off grid technologies to treat human waste are also needed for facilities in remote areas here on earth within the reinvent the toilet challenge hübner et al 2016 showed that the organic carbon in fecal sludge can be completely decomposed and oxidized to co 2 and co within 25 min in a batch reactor using air as the oxidant miller et al 2015 investigated the hto of a dilute simulant feces mixture in a continuous tubular reactor and found greater 99 toc conversion for a stoichiometric oxygen excess above 20 and reactor temperatures above 535 c at residence times of ca 10 s within esa s melissa project zhang et al 2019 investigated the hto of a dilute fermenter filtrate in a continuous tubular reactor using h 2 o 2 at residence times up to 68 s and temperatures between 300 and 380 c at these conditions the toc removal efficiency was always below 70 in this study the conversion of a fecal sludge model mixture was investigated under different experimental settings using a semi automated prototype hto reactor with ambient air as the oxidant the goal was to study the hto of fecal sludge one step closer to an automated full scale system running in a thermally self sufficient mode eventually such a system would have to fulfill the private standard for reinvented toilets international organization for standardization 2020 here the focus was set on the conversion of the injected synthetic feces feed sff and the energy consumption the carbon conversion and the energy consumption were measured depending on the injection pressure the reaction time as well as the total solids ts content of the feed nitrogen is another important element which was not monitored in this study and is recommended to be the subject of future work 2 rationale drawing from the experience reported in the literature about fecal sludge management and designing and operating hto systems several key learnings were derived for the design of the prototype system such as fecal sludges can have a broad range of solids concentrations preprocessing the sludges to a constant dry solids content is a challenge on its own a robust hto system will be able to process a wide range of solids concentrations urine separated feces should be preferred as they have the advantage of lower chloride content and thus a lower potential for corrosion in hto systems the mineral fraction produced in hto must be recovered for reuse as fertilizer air is by far the cheapest most abundant and safest oxidant available continuous hto systems have traditionally been preferred over batch systems for their higher efficiency while such continuous systems can use direct heat recovery via heat exchangers batch systems need a storage capability to transfer heat from one batch to the next pumping heterogeneous sludges containing particles at low flow rates is a big challenge the batch wise operation of a household toilet calls also for a batch wise treatment of the feces to avoid large storage tanks which would entail additional challenges such as anaerobic decomposition of the sludge and odor emissions thermal inertia of batch systems is high this bears potential for heat recovery by solid heat storage materials continuous hto systems seem advantageous for larger scale multi user toilets while a batch system appears as the most appropriate choice for small scale household systems the main unit operations required in an hto system are i preprocessing ii feeding iii heating and reacting iv discharging for a system to be thermally efficient heat recovery is an additional necessary unit operation 2 1 preprocessing preprocessing of the fecal sludge is a very important step to enable a smooth and sustained operation of the feces treatment unit for a broad range of feed compositions initially a wet grinding device insinkerator was installed just below the feed container it was later replaced by an in line macerating pump ta3p10 19 24v johnson that allowed a more reproducible filling of the feed injector this macerator cuts down larger soft and fibrous particles and homogenizes the solid mixture it is not able to process large hard particles and tough parts such as plastic foil 2 2 feeding feeding a viscous sludge containing particles of different size shape and hardness and whose consistency may vary largely poses an enormous challenge to any feeding system for high pressure operation one requirement for a robust toilet was its ability to cope with all the intake that the users would produce it may well be that items other than feces would end up in the toilet bowl and finally in the inlet to the treatment unit one important decision when designing the prototype fox 02 was to avoid any kind of mechanical pump for the feces on the high pressure side the concept of fox 02 uses air both as the propellant for the feces and as the oxidant avoiding any moving part except for some valves for the feeding under high pressure 2 3 heating and reacting high destruction efficiencies of organic carbon require a good control of the reaction parameters i e local availability of the oxidant via a well mixed reacting fluid and both temperature and residence time high enough to oxidize also recalcitrant compounds for supercritical reaction conditions a complete miscibility of the gaseous oxygen and nitrogen if the oxidant is air and the fluid phase is expected peterson et al 2008 the solid phase may pose a bigger challenge before the organic solids can oxidize they need to be liquefied and mixed with the oxidant on a molecular scale liquefaction is typically a slower process than oxidation peterson et al 2008 adding to the total time needed for reaction in the fox 02 setup the rapid expansion of the air sludge mixture under high pressure into the hot reaction chamber at low pressure presumably produces a highly turbulent spray of small droplets and particles surrounded by air ensuring a high mixing rate as well as a high heating rate heat up rates of 2 to 6 k s from 290 to 390 c have been achieved for the feed mixture in that setup when biomass is heated up slowly under hydrothermal conditions some of its constituents may undergo dehydration reactions leading to coke formation before being oxidized coke itself is hard to oxidize matsumura et al 2002 or gasify in supercritical water matsumura et al 1997 thus another rationale for heating up the fecal sludge quickly is the avoidance of coke formation by rapidly passing through the window of temperatures promoting coke formation under non oxidizing conditions müller found this temperature window to be around 350 370 c for small organic compounds such as glycerol müller and vogel 2012 but solid biomass particles may carbonize already at lower temperatures coke formation is also possible under oxidizing conditions especially at low oxygen to carbon ratios and when the mixing of oxygen water and organics is slow hübner et al found some coke and tar formation in their batch experiments with fecal sludge at low oxygen to carbon ratios hübner et al 2016 another situation leading to coke formation is the disappearance of the liquid phase when crossing the vapor region to evaluate the probability of coke formation by this pathway in the fox 02 setup the p t trajectories as depicted in fig 2c were recorded 2 4 discharging in the fox 02 concept a rapid discharge of the hot reactor contents is achieved by suddenly opening the exit valve and allowing the mixture to flow into a vessel of larger volume than the reactor this rapid discharge has several aims quenching the reaction by reducing the temperature of the mixture very rapidly flushing particles out of the reactor vessel by entraining them with the fluid at a high velocity to avoid settling of particles emptying the reactor vessel while keeping it hot i e no active cooling of the vessel before discharge due to the high pressure difference during discharge a critical or choked flow is established across the exit valve such a high velocity flow creates challenges for the valve hard mineral particles may lead to erosion and abrasion of the needle and or the seat also the large temperature difference between the fluid and the valve body of around 200 k induces thermal stress on this component the discharge valve v7 was found to leak after a random number of cycles making it the most critical part of the current design 2 5 heat recovery the approach chosen for the fox 02 prototype is based on two half shells made of low grade steel attached firmly to the external surface of the hto reactor vessel the half shells allow for easy handling during assembly and disassembly heat would be transferred from the hot reactor wall to the storage shells by conduction and vice versa depending on the sign of the temperature gradient between the reactor and the shell the shells have been fitted with electric heating cartridges to provide the energy for the initial heating up of the reactor a safety thermocouple connected to a safety shut off controller prevents the shells and consequently the reactor from overheating for this system to work efficiently a high performance thermal insulation was used around the reactor and the heat storage shells heat recovery from the exothermic reaction and its storage for several hours is an important feature for such a stand alone batch system as the toilet will experience intermittent operation and longer idle times the heat storage capacity of the fox 02 setup was neither optimized nor designed to meet a specific target it was a first best guess design to show in principle the performance of such a system as a next step alternative heat storage materials may be selected and tested for a longer heat storage capability 3 materials and methods 3 1 fox 02 setup and operation fox 02 is a prototype for conducting repeated hto batch tests in an automated manner a simplified scheme of the fox 02 setup is displayed in fig 1 and a picture of the setup is shown in the supplementary fig s1 1 a list of components is given in the supplementary table s1 1 the feed is stored in a tube on top of which a graduated 1000 ml cylinder has been mounted to determine the injected volume at the beginning of a cycle the feed is pumped into the injector at ambient pressure by turning on the macerating pump p1 and opening the ball valve v1 for five seconds then the injector is pressurized with air by opening valve v5 valve v6 is then opened leading to the injection of the sff air mixture into the preheated reactor two seconds later v5 and v6 are closed again roughly 35 50 ml of sff are injected per cycle in this way the feed mixture reacts under hydrothermal conditions at around 250 to 320 bar for the set residence time after which the needle valve v7 is opened ejecting the hot mixture into the expansion vessel internal volume 3 l the water vapor condenses in the colder expansion vessel the expansion vessel heats up to about 30 70 c after each emptying cycle and it cools down again between cycles by losses to the environment the permanent gases saturated with water vapor are ejected from the expansion vessel at the top via the valves v9 and v10 to analyze the amount and the composition of the flue gas in every fifth cycle v9 is switched towards the μ gc and a gas meter fi1 after the reacted fluid has been ejected the injector is still pressurized and might contain some residual feed the injector content can therefore not simply be released into the expansion vessel and instead is injected with air into the reactor after closing v7 again the content is kept in the hot reactor but at low pressure for 20 s to allow the oxidation of the residues then the reactor content is once again released via the expansion vessel the residual pressure from the secondary reaction is used to drain the process water from the expansion vessel via valve v8 the process water is collected in a tank and analyzed only after the whole series of cycles has been completed the amount of sff injected was determined from the level drop in the graduated feed cylinder over the course of a measurement series for the evaluation the volume of feed injected was averaged over all cycles additionally the amount of sff injected was determined by the weight difference of the feed storage canister after filling up to the starting level once all cycles were completed the amount of product solution ejected from the reactor was determined from the weight difference of the collection vessels before and after all cycles were completed the volume and composition of the gas ejected from the reactor were measured after every fifth cycle the pressurized air used for the reaction and for switching the pneumatic valves is generated by a compressor and stored in two 6 l pressurized air tanks pressure sensors are connected to the pressurized air vessels ptr 1 injector ptr 2 reactor ptr 3 and to the expansion vessel ptr 4 the temperature inside the reactor is measured by the thermocouple ttr 2 heating of the reactor vessel is controlled with ttrc 1 which is placed in a groove between the heating shells and the reactor vessel the reactor is of cylindrical shape with an inner diameter of 60 mm has an inner volume of 1000 ml and is made of alloy 286 no 1 4980 two half shells made of low grade steel no 1 0045 36 4 kg each shell are placed around the reactor in direct contact with the vessel one heating cartridge is placed in each half shell and is connected to a temperature controller the reactor is equipped with a rupture disc 400 40 bar and can operate at a maximum temperature of 500 c its use is limited to 20 000 cycles this value was chosen for the design of the reactor in accordance with the code ad2000 the pressure vessel is checked regularly by svti the swiss inspectorate for pressure vessels the reactor is insulated by a ceramic fiber insulation which is between 80 to 150 mm thick the operation of the fox 02 is controlled by a plc and a custom made control and data acquisition software 3 2 synthetic fecal sludge not only is it difficult to source large amounts of fecal sludge with a high total solids ts content but different batches of fecal sludge typically exhibit a large variability in composition heating value and chemical oxygen demand for this systematic study a synthetic feces feed sff mixture proposed by penn et al 2018 was slightly adapted and used instead see si for exact composition a batch of roughly 3 5 kg per experiment was prepared by adding all components and the desired volume of water in a bucket on the day before the experiment the mixture was stirred thoroughly and kept below 10 c overnight the chemical composition and physical properties of the solid part of sff were determined as described in section 3 4 and can be found in table 1 3 3 experimental design the goal of this experimental series was to determine reaction parameters that allow a high conversion under low external energy demand in this setup only the reactor preheat temperature the injection pressure the ts content of the sff and the reaction time can be set by the operator and are thus considered reliable experimental variables other variables such as the amount of sff injected or the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio can only be determined indirectly and are thus not experimental variables the experimentally accessible range for each variable is limited by safety and technical considerations which will be shortly summarized here the residence time t r e s i d e n c e was set to either 300 or 600 s to investigate its effect on the total conversion and on the energy demand since the goal was to achieve high carbon conversions shorter reaction times were not explored the injection pressure p i n j e c t i o n was varied between 160 and 120 bar allowing us to lower the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio and limit the amount of air injected per cycle while still reaching supercritical conditions the ts content of the sff was varied between 9 and 15 wt to simulate the varying thickness of the stool entering the reactor under these conditions reactor pressures between 250 to 320 bar were reached some combinations such as high injection pressures and high ts contents or low injection pressure and low ts contents were not tested while the former conditions might lead to bursting of the rupture disk due to pressure reaching the limit of 400 40 bar the latter could lead to low reactor pressures and subcritical conditions where coke formation occurs in addition the sff separated into its oily and watery phases at ts contents below ca 10 wt which led to a low reproducibility of the injected amount of carbon see test11 and test12 in table 2 for each set of parameters investigated during the campaign 15 cycles were performed one cycle corresponds to one batch test it starts with re heating the reactor and filling a feed sample into the injector the cycle ends with the release of the reacted mixture from the reactor before each set of 15 cycles ten start up cycles were necessary to reach reproducible injections these start up cycles were disregarded for the analysis as the conditions still changed drastically in some cases the process water was collected in the same vessel for all 15 cycles producing an averaged sample for each set of 15 cycles the amount of gas ejected and the gas composition were measured after every fifth cycle 3 4 analytics the ts content of the sff and of the product solution were determined by drying the wet sample at 105 c in a moisture analyzer mettler toledo he53 the ash content was determined in accordance with the standard din en 14775 by heating the dry sample to 250 c in 0 5 h holding the temperature for 1 h heating to 550 c in 0 5 h in air and holding the final temperature for 1 5 h the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined using the nanocolor csb lr 150 test macherey nagel the chns composition was analyzed using a varioelcube elementar hanau germany the oxygen fraction in the dried feed was calculated by subtraction of the weight percentages of c h n s and ash from 100 the hhv was determined with an ika c1 bomb calorimeter cole parmer illinois usa to determine the tc tic toc content of the product solution the solution was diluted to lie within the experimentally accessible range of 10 1000 ppm toc tic tc and measured with a dimatoc 200 dimatec essen germany 3 5 evaluation of results 3 5 1 oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio λ the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio λ is defined as the amount of oxygen present in the system at the beginning n o 2 0 divided by the stoichiometric oxygen demand of the feed n o 2 s t o i c

mass ξ f e e d d r y the amount of oxygen n o 2 0 present in the reactor at the beginning was calculated by the pressure drop in the gas cylinder during injection using the real gas equation with the van der waals coefficients atkins and paula 2019 a 135 8 10 3 pa m 6 mol 2 and b 0 0364 10 3 m 3 mol 1 and the content of oxygen in ambient air y o 2 0 21 mol mol 3 5 2 carbon conversion the conversion of the sff was calculated by two independent ways i e as x t o c from the amount of total organic carbon toc left in the product solution and as x co 2 from the amount of co 2 formed with 2 x t o c 1 n t o c o u t n t o c 0 3 x co 2 n co 2 n t o c 0 where n t o c o u t is the amount of toc in the product solution n t o c 0 the amount of toc injected into the reactor and n co 2 the amount of co 2 generated per cycle carbon containing residues such as coke were not found and therefore not included in the evaluation the amount of toc injected per cycle was calculated using the toc content of the dry feed ω t o c f e e d d r y the ts content of the feed ω t s f e e d the volume of feed v f e e d injected per cycle the density of the feed ρ f e e d and the molar mass of carbon m

from the toc concentration in the product solution c t o c o u t and the volume of product solution ejected v p s 5 n t o c o u t c t o c o u t v p s m c the amount of co 2 generated was calculated

to the molar amount of all injected carbon n c i n because the feed contained nearly no inorganic carbon the amount of carbon injected is equal to the molar amount of toc n t o c 0 ejected carbon was accounted for in the gas phase as n co 2 and in the product solution as n t c o u t while our gc was able to detect also co and ch 4 the concentration of theses compounds was around the quantification limit of the instrument and their contribution was thus not included 7 c b n c o u t n c i n n co 2 n t c o u t n t o c 0 4 results and discussion the experimental parameters as well as the energy demand of the heating shells e h e a t e r the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio λ the conversions x t o c and x c o 2 and the carbon balance of all tests are displayed in table 2 more information regarding the toc content of the process water and the gas composition of the off gas can be found in the supplemental information table s3 3 4 1 carbon conversion and carbon balance in all experiments the sff was converted to a semi transparent suspension containing only a fraction of the initial carbon the injected feed contained 75 000 mg l of toc at a ts of 15 wt which was transformed into co 2 as the main gaseous product and dissolved organic carbon doc together with carbonates under all experimental conditions the toc concentration of the final process water was between 455 and 9000 mg l the ejected gas contained between 5 9 mol of co 2 see table s3 3 the overall carbon conversion was in the range of 97 such high conversion values lead to the assumption that no significant inhomogeneities or dead zones were present in the reactor the faint color of the product solution compared to similar work of miller et al 2015 most probably stemmed from the higher ts concentrations and lower peak temperatures used in our study only traces of co and ch 4 were found in the gas phase this is remarkable as in earlier batch experiments with real feces hübner found some of the carbon being converted to co hübner et al 2016 test09 is the experiment most likely to produce co because it has the lowest oxygen to fuel ratio a short reaction time and a high feed concentration the concentration of co in the gas from test09 was below 0 3 which was just around the quantification limit the biggest difference between the batch reactor and the fox 02 setup is the rapid heating up and mixing of oxygen water and organics in the fox 02 during the injection as opposed to the static situation in the batch reactor used by hübner in the latter case it was found that most of the carbon conversion happened already during the subcritical heating up during which still a liquid phase prevailed a fraction of the initial carbon was transformed to co most likely by decarbonylation of partially oxidized organics the oxygen had first to dissolve in the liquid phase and diffuse to the organics and to the dissolved co to oxidize it to co 2 our hypothesis is that in the fox 02 supercritical monophasic conditions are reached much more rapidly than in hübner s batch reactor accelerating the oxidation of the co formed from the decarbonylation of the organics in earlier experiments with real human feces so called ignition peaks in temperature and pressure were observed to occur if the ts content of the feed exceeded 12 wt the sff used in the present study showed a similar behavior the typical pressure and temperature profile measured inside the reactor during two selected runs with a ts content a above and b below this critical ts content of about 12 wt is shown in fig 2 the pressure and temperature profiles of all series are depicted in the supplementary figs s3 1 and s3 2 upon injection of the feed and the pressurized air from the injector at t 0 the pressure in the reactor increased sharply irrespective of the ts content simultaneously the temperature dropped by about 100 c due to the injection of the cold feed as the feed heated up the temperature returned to the set point temperature of 390 c while the pressure increased further due to the heat up of the injected mixture if the ts content of the feed was sufficiently high 15 wt in this case test01 blue both pressure and temperature increased rapidly after about 2 min denoted as ignition peak during this ignition peak the maximum pressure and temperature reached about 330 bar and 485 c respectively due to the symmetrical design of the reactor we assume that the temperature peak occurred throughout the whole reactor volume however every thermocouple has an inherent response inertia and may not be able to detect temperature peaks on very short time scales in some cases a second less distinct ignition peak δ p about 10 bar and δ t about 5 c was observed if feed with a ts content lower than 11 wt was injected at an identical preheating temperature and injection pressure no such ignition peaks were visible compare test01 with test02 in fig 2 the occurrence of ignition peaks does not seem to affect the conversion even though their higher temperatures would lead to faster reaction rates hübner concluded that only a relatively small fraction of volatile organics were responsible for the ignition peaks and this small fraction would thus not influence the overall carbon conversion much hübner et al 2016 comparing the experiments in this study with and without ignition peaks the same conclusion can be drawn as the conversion is not higher for the experiments exhibiting ignition peaks similarly no relation between the occurrence of ignition peaks and the co concentration was found the resulting pressure temperature p t trajectories of the high and low ts case are displayed in fig 2c in blue and orange respectively the hypothetical p t trajectory of the feed itself follows a different initial course dotted orange line as the feed is already pressurized in the injector prior to the injection but is not at the reaction temperature yet once the valve v6 is opened the pressure inside the injector drops while the feed is injected into the reactor where it is quickly repressurized the feed now heats up rapidly to reactor temperature indicated by the dotted line merging after about 3 s with the p t trajectory derived from the temperature sensor inside the reactor we found that the time after which supercritical conditions are reached strongly correlates with the injection pressure at high injection pressures of 160 or 180 bar it takes between 25 to 40 s to reach supercritical conditions after injection while it takes between 60 to 90 s at an injection pressure of 140 bar this means that depending on the residence time and injection pressure the feed spends around 70 to 95 of the total reaction time under supercritical conditions this trajectory is important to detect whether the feed mixture passes through the vapor phase region or whether it always stays liquid up to the transition to the supercritical region a reduction of the injection pressure from 160 to 140 bar resulted in a decrease of the oxygen to fuel ratio λ which did not have an effect on the conversion compare test01 and test 02 with test04 and test03 respectively from an energetic and economic standpoint it is preferable to inject the feed with as little pressure as possible as long as λ 1 and supercritical conditions are reached in the reactor because this minimizes the operating time of the compressor however in previous experiments with a small batch reactor the formation of coke and tar was observed when the p t trajectory crossed the vapor liquid equilibrium line of water hübner et al 2016 coke and tar form under oxygen deficient conditions i e when λ 1 and only slowly decompose once formed therefore coke and tar formation must be prevented as it will ultimately lower the conversion contaminate the liquid product phase and may lead to clogging of valves and pipes over time passing through the vapor region will dry out the liquid phase resulting in very high concentrations in the remaining liquid which promotes coke formation a trajectory from test04 with the same ts content as in test01 blue but with an injection pressure of only 140 bar instead of 160 bar is displayed in fig 2c in gray because of the lower injection pressure the vapor pressure curve was crossed and coke formation may have taken place however it was not possible to determine the amount of coke in the effluent from these tests the only series in which x t o c was below 97 were experiments run with a shorter residence time of 300 instead of 600 s this indicates that a residence time of more than 300 s is needed to achieve almost complete conversion in the current setup the low conversion in test11 and test12 is due to a separation of the feed into its oily and watery phases in the feces tank because of the phase separation the feed becomes inhomogeneous and the amount of carbon injected per cycle is subject to a large uncertainty the carbon conversion x c o 2 and the c balance of these two experiments were low probably the phase separation resulted in less carbon rich feed being transferred into the injector we therefore excluded these two series from the further discussions the mass of the ejected product solution was consistently about 20 lower than the mass of the injected feed this difference in total mass can be explained by i the decomposition of the solid feed fraction into gases and ii water losses by saturation of the ejected gas stream with water vapor 4 2 energy balance to make the feces treatment unit applicable in remote regions the energy demand needs to be as low as possible ideally to be covered by a small array of solar panels on top of the toilet the two most energetically demanding process steps in the fox 02 are the heating of the reactor and the compression of the air fig 3 a and b show the cumulative energy demand of the heating shells starting from the injection for test01 and test02 with a ts content of 15 and 11 wt respectively in both cases about 0 05 kwh was needed per cycle to keep the temperature of the shells at 390 c the heating switched on as soon as the temperature sensor ttrc 1 located in the groove between the heating shells and the outer surface of the reactor dropped below 390 c fig 3b and f this happened in the beginning after the injection of the cold feed and at the end after the ejection of the hot fluid fox 02 did not require any external heating during the reaction time which was due to the heat generation from the exothermic feed conversion in the insulated reactor vessel over all series the system required between 0 03 and 0 05 kwh of heating energy per cycle which equals to 0 7 to 1 6 kwh per kilogram of wet feed 37 to 49 g per cycle in comparison the heat provided by complete oxidation of sff with 12 5 wt ts released 0 8 kwh per kilogram of wet feed which is in the same range as the energy provided by the heaters from a comparison of the temperature at the outer surface of the reactor ttrc 1 fig 3b and f and the temperature inside the reactor ttr 2 fig 3c and g the effect of the large thermal mass of the reactor and the shell can be seen while the temperature variation at the heating shell is about 5 c the temperature inside the reactor can increase or decrease by almost 100 c the slow decrease of ttrc 1 from the peak value to the ejection point of the reactor contents is due to the heat losses to the surroundings in fig 3d and h the difference ttr 2 ttrc 1 has been plotted to highlight the sign of the heat flux between the reactor contents and the shell when it is positive heat flows from the fluid inside the reactor to the reactor wall and the shell when it is negative heat from the shell is transferred to the reactor and the fluid the energy demand of the fox 02 system may be reduced further by using better insulation material and also by allowing less gaps around tubing sensors etc in principle the average temperature of the reactor and the shells should slightly increase with each cycle due to the exothermic heat of reaction because the insulation is not perfect the temperatures ttr 2 and ttrc 1 both do not increase with each cycle as seen in fig 3 the compressor requires about 0 12 kwh per cycle or 3 kwh per kilogram of wet feed to replenish the air ejected from the gas cylinder in the previous cycle because the control circuit and the pump require very little energy in comparison the overall energy consumption of the system is on average about 4 kwh per kilogram of wet feed injected 3 kwh from the compressor 1 kwh from the heating shells additionally the gas tanks were refilled after every injection to improve the reproducibility of the injected amount which led to a high energy demand as the pressure repeatedly needed to be built up to 280 bar before the gas tanks could be filled for a real world application the air tanks filled to 310 bar contain enough air to allow 10 to 12 injections with 160 bar 4 3 transient thermal behavior the reaction system realized in the fox 02 setup corresponds to an autothermal oxidation with heat transfer to the storage shells the heat liberated by the exothermic oxidation reactions increases the temperature of the reacting mixture accelerating the oxidation kinetics this leads to a faster heat release rate which corresponds to a self acceleration also known as runaway reaction in safety considerations this system can be described and analyzed by a transient heat balance when the kinetics are known a simplified and generalized theory of such systems was proposed by semenoff 1928 in this work semenov s theory was applied to describe the ignition peaks for such a peak to occur the heat release rate must be significantly faster than the heat transfer rate to the reactor wall in the opposite case where the heat transfer rate to the wall is of similar or higher magnitude than the heat release rate only a small peak or no peak at all is assumed to occur semenov s theory assumes a batch reactor with irreversible first order kinetics also a constant wall temperature and no consumption of the reactant is assumed even if some of these assumptions are violated semenov s theory is a good approximation for various real systems varma et al 1999 the kinetics of hübner et al 2016 for hydrothermal fecal sludge oxidation and direct irreversible decomposition of toc to co 2 with a single activation energy were used to describe the reactions this first order kinetics have a preexponential factor k 0 1 of 36 13 s 1 and an activation energy e 0 of 43 kj mol the dimensionless energy balance 8 d θ d τ ψ exp θ 1 θ γ θ is based on the dimensionless temperature θ time τ activation energy γ and the semenov number ψ 9 ψ k 0 1 e γ m t s 0 h h v t s v r e a c t o r a f w α f w t w γ 10 θ t t w t w γ 11 τ t a f w α f w c v f m f v r e a c t o r 12 γ e 0 r t w a l l the heat transfer coefficient from the fluid to the wall α f w of 800 w m 2 k was estimated by fitting t t trajectories for water air mixtures to a transient system model mangold 2021 for a wall temperature of 390 c the critical semenov number ψ c is 0 4272 only if ψ ψ c a thermal runaway is expected as the amount of feed injected is low the assumption of no consumption is violated shortly after ignition starts as a consequence an ignition peak instead of a thermal runaway is observed the experimental series with semenov numbers below ψ c calculated according to eq 9 showed no ignition peak for series with ψ above ψ c an ignition peak was observed the theoretical limit in ts content for ignition peaks of 13 1 wt supports the experimental value which was between 11 0 0 2 and 12 9 0 7 wt 5 conclusions small amounts of homogenized fecal simulant mixtures can be fed pneumatically at high pressure into an hto reactor in a reproducible way and without clogging a minimum toc concentration of 11 13 wt is needed to produce an ignition peak in both temperature and pressure in a nearly adiabatic batch reactor system ignition peaks are important safety design parameters they can be predicted with good accuracy using semenov s theory and the kinetics for hto of feces determined by hübner et al 2016 an ignition peak is not a prerequisite for reaching high carbon conversions the cyclic batch hto system fox 02 reached total carbon conversions from 97 to 99 for a range of feed concentrations 11 15 wt at a reactor preheating temperature of 390 c an oxygen to carbon ratio 1 9 and a minimum reaction time of 600 s toc values of the process water were in the range of 455 1600 mg l for a reaction time of 600 s for a reaction time of 300 s the toc values increased to 5600 9900 mg l starting with a feed at 15 wt ts content a toc conversion of at least 99 9 is needed to reach toc values below 100 mg l in the process water to reach this goal higher reactor temperatures and or longer reaction times should be explored the fox 02 system requires 0 7 1 6 kwh kg wetf eed of external energy to reheat the reactor contents after injecting cold reactants and after rapid discharge during the oxidation phase at the reactor set point temperature of 390 c no external heating is needed to sustain the operation due to the heat generation from the exothermic feed conversion minimizing thermal losses further is critical for attaining a

19919,to ensure access to safe sanitation facilities in rural communities cheap off grid technologies need to be developed to substitute pit latrines and open defecation in this study we present a prototype system based on hydrothermal oxidation which under optimal conditions converts a fecal sludge simulant almost completely to co 2 and water leaving behind only a carbon poor aqueous phase with the minerals the prototype has been designed to process the feces from two households this technology does not only enable a fast and complete conversion but is potentially also very energy efficient as the feed does not require any pre treatment or drying the system was found to effectively remove 97 99 of the total organic carbon within a reaction time of 600 s under an external energy demand of roughly 4 kwh per kilogram of wet feces by using the oxygen in air as an oxidant a total of ten experiments with varying injection pressure total solids content of the feed and residence time in the reactor were performed to find experimental settings with high conversion only when the residence time was decreased from 600 to 300 s did the conversion fall significantly below 97 to reach a target value of 99 9 toc conversion the reactor temperature and or the residence time must be increased further to achieve a system applicable in regions with no connection to the energy grid the thermal loss of the reactor insulation needs to be lowered further to achieve an overall thermally self sustaining operation keywords supercritical water oxidation scwo hydrothermal oxidation hto off grid feces treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction roughly two billion people still lack access to basic sanitation services resulting practices such as open defecation or defecation into latrines which are seldom or never emptied can lead to the contamination of drinking water and to the propagation of diseases while the number of people with access to hygienically safe sanitation facilities is increasing the progress needs to be accelerated to meet the goal of universal basic sanitation by 2030 who 2017 2021 the missing access to sanitation services is especially pronounced in low income and remote rural areas as most of these rural communities also lack access to electricity and sewage systems self sufficient off grid solutions will be key to ensure coverage in such regions one of the technologies that would allow such an on site treatment of fecal sludge is hydrothermal oxidation hto being a high pressure and high temperature technology developing a safe reliable and affordable hto system for rural communities presents an enormous challenge hydrothermal processes take place in aqueous medium at temperatures above 100 c and at pressures above the corresponding saturation pressure of water if the conditions exceed the critical point of water at 374 c and 221 bar the term supercritical water process is also used peterson et al 2008 under supercritical water conditions the polarity of water decreases drastically rendering non ionic species and gases such as o 2 n 2 nh 3 co co 2 fully miscible brunner 2009a 2009b on the other hand salts and other minerals are almost insoluble and will precipitate in hydrothermal oxidation and supercritical water oxidation scwo an oxidant is added to the water and the organic matter which can be readily decomposed to form co 2 h 2 o nh 3 and minerals jiang et al 2020 this has been demonstrated with biological polymers such as proteins and feeds containing polysaccharides jin et al 2001 mochidzuki et al 2003 zhu et al 2019 as well as their monomers holgate et al 1995 all main components of feces human feces are a semi solid mixture of waste products of human digestion made up predominantly of water 63 87 as well as organic and inorganic solids the main elements in the solid organic fraction are c o h n and s found in bacterial biomass protein carbohydrates and lipids rose et al 2015 the treatment of urine feces waste streams with hto scwo collectively called hto herein was first investigated in relation to life support systems for short or long term manned space missions as well as for lunar bases in these environments suitable recycling technologies for human waste are needed due to the high cost of resupplying resources from earth hicks et al 2012 sedej 1985 hto has been identified as an ideal candidate as the reaction allows a fast and complete waste conversion to benign products and can be made self sufficient additionally the waste stream does not require drying and nutrients and water can easily be reclaimed hicks et al 2012 sedej 1985 the first hto reactors for such purposes were built in 1975 1977 by lockheed missiles and space company weitzman 1977 they reported toc conversions of 88 94 at 288 to 315 c and 64 to 150 bar with residence times between 19 and 90 min in a continuous flow reactor using pure oxygen as oxidant these conditions were still far from supercritical conditions closer to typical wet oxidation processes price 1981 observed conversions in the range of 56 82 at roughly 24 min reaction time pressures of 157 to 221 bar and temperatures of 277 to 295 c at supercritical conditions conversions of 88 92 were obtained at shorter reaction times of 2 5 min pressures of 265 279 bar and temperatures of 400 to 440 c but their urine feces slurry had a higher weight fraction of feces compared to lockheed takahashi et al 1989 studied solutions of ammonium hydroxide and acetic acid and a slurry of human urine feces and wipes as model wastes for a controlled ecological life support system these model wastes were oxidized with h 2 o 2 as the oxidizer in a stirred batch reactor at 250 500 c at pressures from 47 to 240 bar and residence times up to 120 min for the mixture of urine feces and wipes temperatures below the critical temperature led to incomplete carbon conversion for a residence time of 60 min the nitrogen in the ammonium hydroxide was oxidized more slowly up to the maximum temperature of 500 c less than 50 of the n were oxidized for a residence time of 60 min hong et al 1987 also investigated the treatment of a urine feces mixture for the same purpose but focused on supercritical conditions of 256 bar and more than 600 c the retrieved product solution contained about 1 ppm of total carbon energy efficient off grid technologies to treat human waste are also needed for facilities in remote areas here on earth within the reinvent the toilet challenge hübner et al 2016 showed that the organic carbon in fecal sludge can be completely decomposed and oxidized to co 2 and co within 25 min in a batch reactor using air as the oxidant miller et al 2015 investigated the hto of a dilute simulant feces mixture in a continuous tubular reactor and found greater 99 toc conversion for a stoichiometric oxygen excess above 20 and reactor temperatures above 535 c at residence times of ca 10 s within esa s melissa project zhang et al 2019 investigated the hto of a dilute fermenter filtrate in a continuous tubular reactor using h 2 o 2 at residence times up to 68 s and temperatures between 300 and 380 c at these conditions the toc removal efficiency was always below 70 in this study the conversion of a fecal sludge model mixture was investigated under different experimental settings using a semi automated prototype hto reactor with ambient air as the oxidant the goal was to study the hto of fecal sludge one step closer to an automated full scale system running in a thermally self sufficient mode eventually such a system would have to fulfill the private standard for reinvented toilets international organization for standardization 2020 here the focus was set on the conversion of the injected synthetic feces feed sff and the energy consumption the carbon conversion and the energy consumption were measured depending on the injection pressure the reaction time as well as the total solids ts content of the feed nitrogen is another important element which was not monitored in this study and is recommended to be the subject of future work 2 rationale drawing from the experience reported in the literature about fecal sludge management and designing and operating hto systems several key learnings were derived for the design of the prototype system such as fecal sludges can have a broad range of solids concentrations preprocessing the sludges to a constant dry solids content is a challenge on its own a robust hto system will be able to process a wide range of solids concentrations urine separated feces should be preferred as they have the advantage of lower chloride content and thus a lower potential for corrosion in hto systems the mineral fraction produced in hto must be recovered for reuse as fertilizer air is by far the cheapest most abundant and safest oxidant available continuous hto systems have traditionally been preferred over batch systems for their higher efficiency while such continuous systems can use direct heat recovery via heat exchangers batch systems need a storage capability to transfer heat from one batch to the next pumping heterogeneous sludges containing particles at low flow rates is a big challenge the batch wise operation of a household toilet calls also for a batch wise treatment of the feces to avoid large storage tanks which would entail additional challenges such as anaerobic decomposition of the sludge and odor emissions thermal inertia of batch systems is high this bears potential for heat recovery by solid heat storage materials continuous hto systems seem advantageous for larger scale multi user toilets while a batch system appears as the most appropriate choice for small scale household systems the main unit operations required in an hto system are i preprocessing ii feeding iii heating and reacting iv discharging for a system to be thermally efficient heat recovery is an additional necessary unit operation 2 1 preprocessing preprocessing of the fecal sludge is a very important step to enable a smooth and sustained operation of the feces treatment unit for a broad range of feed compositions initially a wet grinding device insinkerator was installed just below the feed container it was later replaced by an in line macerating pump ta3p10 19 24v johnson that allowed a more reproducible filling of the feed injector this macerator cuts down larger soft and fibrous particles and homogenizes the solid mixture it is not able to process large hard particles and tough parts such as plastic foil 2 2 feeding feeding a viscous sludge containing particles of different size shape and hardness and whose consistency may vary largely poses an enormous challenge to any feeding system for high pressure operation one requirement for a robust toilet was its ability to cope with all the intake that the users would produce it may well be that items other than feces would end up in the toilet bowl and finally in the inlet to the treatment unit one important decision when designing the prototype fox 02 was to avoid any kind of mechanical pump for the feces on the high pressure side the concept of fox 02 uses air both as the propellant for the feces and as the oxidant avoiding any moving part except for some valves for the feeding under high pressure 2 3 heating and reacting high destruction efficiencies of organic carbon require a good control of the reaction parameters i e local availability of the oxidant via a well mixed reacting fluid and both temperature and residence time high enough to oxidize also recalcitrant compounds for supercritical reaction conditions a complete miscibility of the gaseous oxygen and nitrogen if the oxidant is air and the fluid phase is expected peterson et al 2008 the solid phase may pose a bigger challenge before the organic solids can oxidize they need to be liquefied and mixed with the oxidant on a molecular scale liquefaction is typically a slower process than oxidation peterson et al 2008 adding to the total time needed for reaction in the fox 02 setup the rapid expansion of the air sludge mixture under high pressure into the hot reaction chamber at low pressure presumably produces a highly turbulent spray of small droplets and particles surrounded by air ensuring a high mixing rate as well as a high heating rate heat up rates of 2 to 6 k s from 290 to 390 c have been achieved for the feed mixture in that setup when biomass is heated up slowly under hydrothermal conditions some of its constituents may undergo dehydration reactions leading to coke formation before being oxidized coke itself is hard to oxidize matsumura et al 2002 or gasify in supercritical water matsumura et al 1997 thus another rationale for heating up the fecal sludge quickly is the avoidance of coke formation by rapidly passing through the window of temperatures promoting coke formation under non oxidizing conditions müller found this temperature window to be around 350 370 c for small organic compounds such as glycerol müller and vogel 2012 but solid biomass particles may carbonize already at lower temperatures coke formation is also possible under oxidizing conditions especially at low oxygen to carbon ratios and when the mixing of oxygen water and organics is slow hübner et al found some coke and tar formation in their batch experiments with fecal sludge at low oxygen to carbon ratios hübner et al 2016 another situation leading to coke formation is the disappearance of the liquid phase when crossing the vapor region to evaluate the probability of coke formation by this pathway in the fox 02 setup the p t trajectories as depicted in fig 2c were recorded 2 4 discharging in the fox 02 concept a rapid discharge of the hot reactor contents is achieved by suddenly opening the exit valve and allowing the mixture to flow into a vessel of larger volume than the reactor this rapid discharge has several aims quenching the reaction by reducing the temperature of the mixture very rapidly flushing particles out of the reactor vessel by entraining them with the fluid at a high velocity to avoid settling of particles emptying the reactor vessel while keeping it hot i e no active cooling of the vessel before discharge due to the high pressure difference during discharge a critical or choked flow is established across the exit valve such a high velocity flow creates challenges for the valve hard mineral particles may lead to erosion and abrasion of the needle and or the seat also the large temperature difference between the fluid and the valve body of around 200 k induces thermal stress on this component the discharge valve v7 was found to leak after a random number of cycles making it the most critical part of the current design 2 5 heat recovery the approach chosen for the fox 02 prototype is based on two half shells made of low grade steel attached firmly to the external surface of the hto reactor vessel the half shells allow for easy handling during assembly and disassembly heat would be transferred from the hot reactor wall to the storage shells by conduction and vice versa depending on the sign of the temperature gradient between the reactor and the shell the shells have been fitted with electric heating cartridges to provide the energy for the initial heating up of the reactor a safety thermocouple connected to a safety shut off controller prevents the shells and consequently the reactor from overheating for this system to work efficiently a high performance thermal insulation was used around the reactor and the heat storage shells heat recovery from the exothermic reaction and its storage for several hours is an important feature for such a stand alone batch system as the toilet will experience intermittent operation and longer idle times the heat storage capacity of the fox 02 setup was neither optimized nor designed to meet a specific target it was a first best guess design to show in principle the performance of such a system as a next step alternative heat storage materials may be selected and tested for a longer heat storage capability 3 materials and methods 3 1 fox 02 setup and operation fox 02 is a prototype for conducting repeated hto batch tests in an automated manner a simplified scheme of the fox 02 setup is displayed in fig 1 and a picture of the setup is shown in the supplementary fig s1 1 a list of components is given in the supplementary table s1 1 the feed is stored in a tube on top of which a graduated 1000 ml cylinder has been mounted to determine the injected volume at the beginning of a cycle the feed is pumped into the injector at ambient pressure by turning on the macerating pump p1 and opening the ball valve v1 for five seconds then the injector is pressurized with air by opening valve v5 valve v6 is then opened leading to the injection of the sff air mixture into the preheated reactor two seconds later v5 and v6 are closed again roughly 35 50 ml of sff are injected per cycle in this way the feed mixture reacts under hydrothermal conditions at around 250 to 320 bar for the set residence time after which the needle valve v7 is opened ejecting the hot mixture into the expansion vessel internal volume 3 l the water vapor condenses in the colder expansion vessel the expansion vessel heats up to about 30 70 c after each emptying cycle and it cools down again between cycles by losses to the environment the permanent gases saturated with water vapor are ejected from the expansion vessel at the top via the valves v9 and v10 to analyze the amount and the composition of the flue gas in every fifth cycle v9 is switched towards the μ gc and a gas meter fi1 after the reacted fluid has been ejected the injector is still pressurized and might contain some residual feed the injector content can therefore not simply be released into the expansion vessel and instead is injected with air into the reactor after closing v7 again the content is kept in the hot reactor but at low pressure for 20 s to allow the oxidation of the residues then the reactor content is once again released via the expansion vessel the residual pressure from the secondary reaction is used to drain the process water from the expansion vessel via valve v8 the process water is collected in a tank and analyzed only after the whole series of cycles has been completed the amount of sff injected was determined from the level drop in the graduated feed cylinder over the course of a measurement series for the evaluation the volume of feed injected was averaged over all cycles additionally the amount of sff injected was determined by the weight difference of the feed storage canister after filling up to the starting level once all cycles were completed the amount of product solution ejected from the reactor was determined from the weight difference of the collection vessels before and after all cycles were completed the volume and composition of the gas ejected from the reactor were measured after every fifth cycle the pressurized air used for the reaction and for switching the pneumatic valves is generated by a compressor and stored in two 6 l pressurized air tanks pressure sensors are connected to the pressurized air vessels ptr 1 injector ptr 2 reactor ptr 3 and to the expansion vessel ptr 4 the temperature inside the reactor is measured by the thermocouple ttr 2 heating of the reactor vessel is controlled with ttrc 1 which is placed in a groove between the heating shells and the reactor vessel the reactor is of cylindrical shape with an inner diameter of 60 mm has an inner volume of 1000 ml and is made of alloy 286 no 1 4980 two half shells made of low grade steel no 1 0045 36 4 kg each shell are placed around the reactor in direct contact with the vessel one heating cartridge is placed in each half shell and is connected to a temperature controller the reactor is equipped with a rupture disc 400 40 bar and can operate at a maximum temperature of 500 c its use is limited to 20 000 cycles this value was chosen for the design of the reactor in accordance with the code ad2000 the pressure vessel is checked regularly by svti the swiss inspectorate for pressure vessels the reactor is insulated by a ceramic fiber insulation which is between 80 to 150 mm thick the operation of the fox 02 is controlled by a plc and a custom made control and data acquisition software 3 2 synthetic fecal sludge not only is it difficult to source large amounts of fecal sludge with a high total solids ts content but different batches of fecal sludge typically exhibit a large variability in composition heating value and chemical oxygen demand for this systematic study a synthetic feces feed sff mixture proposed by penn et al 2018 was slightly adapted and used instead see si for exact composition a batch of roughly 3 5 kg per experiment was prepared by adding all components and the desired volume of water in a bucket on the day before the experiment the mixture was stirred thoroughly and kept below 10 c overnight the chemical composition and physical properties of the solid part of sff were determined as described in section 3 4 and can be found in table 1 3 3 experimental design the goal of this experimental series was to determine reaction parameters that allow a high conversion under low external energy demand in this setup only the reactor preheat temperature the injection pressure the ts content of the sff and the reaction time can be set by the operator and are thus considered reliable experimental variables other variables such as the amount of sff injected or the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio can only be determined indirectly and are thus not experimental variables the experimentally accessible range for each variable is limited by safety and technical considerations which will be shortly summarized here the residence time t r e s i d e n c e was set to either 300 or 600 s to investigate its effect on the total conversion and on the energy demand since the goal was to achieve high carbon conversions shorter reaction times were not explored the injection pressure p i n j e c t i o n was varied between 160 and 120 bar allowing us to lower the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio and limit the amount of air injected per cycle while still reaching supercritical conditions the ts content of the sff was varied between 9 and 15 wt to simulate the varying thickness of the stool entering the reactor under these conditions reactor pressures between 250 to 320 bar were reached some combinations such as high injection pressures and high ts contents or low injection pressure and low ts contents were not tested while the former conditions might lead to bursting of the rupture disk due to pressure reaching the limit of 400 40 bar the latter could lead to low reactor pressures and subcritical conditions where coke formation occurs in addition the sff separated into its oily and watery phases at ts contents below ca 10 wt which led to a low reproducibility of the injected amount of carbon see test11 and test12 in table 2 for each set of parameters investigated during the campaign 15 cycles were performed one cycle corresponds to one batch test it starts with re heating the reactor and filling a feed sample into the injector the cycle ends with the release of the reacted mixture from the reactor before each set of 15 cycles ten start up cycles were necessary to reach reproducible injections these start up cycles were disregarded for the analysis as the conditions still changed drastically in some cases the process water was collected in the same vessel for all 15 cycles producing an averaged sample for each set of 15 cycles the amount of gas ejected and the gas composition were measured after every fifth cycle 3 4 analytics the ts content of the sff and of the product solution were determined by drying the wet sample at 105 c in a moisture analyzer mettler toledo he53 the ash content was determined in accordance with the standard din en 14775 by heating the dry sample to 250 c in 0 5 h holding the temperature for 1 h heating to 550 c in 0 5 h in air and holding the final temperature for 1 5 h the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined using the nanocolor csb lr 150 test macherey nagel the chns composition was analyzed using a varioelcube elementar hanau germany the oxygen fraction in the dried feed was calculated by subtraction of the weight percentages of c h n s and ash from 100 the hhv was determined with an ika c1 bomb calorimeter cole parmer illinois usa to determine the tc tic toc content of the product solution the solution was diluted to lie within the experimentally accessible range of 10 1000 ppm toc tic tc and measured with a dimatoc 200 dimatec essen germany 3 5 evaluation of results 3 5 1 oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio λ the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio λ is defined as the amount of oxygen present in the system at the beginning n o 2 0 divided by the stoichiometric oxygen demand of the feed n o 2 s t o i c h this ratio can be written as 1 λ n o 2 0 n o 2 s t o i c h n o 2 0 ξ f e e d d r y m f e e d d r y with the amount of dry feed m f e e d d r y injected per cycle and the chemical oxygen demand per mass ξ f e e d d r y the amount of oxygen n o 2 0 present in the reactor at the beginning was calculated by the pressure drop in the gas cylinder during injection using the real gas equation with the van der waals coefficients atkins and paula 2019 a 135 8 10 3 pa m 6 mol 2 and b 0 0364 10 3 m 3 mol 1 and the content of oxygen in ambient air y o 2 0 21 mol mol 3 5 2 carbon conversion the conversion of the sff was calculated by two independent ways i e as x t o c from the amount of total organic carbon toc left in the product solution and as x co 2 from the amount of co 2 formed with 2 x t o c 1 n t o c o u t n t o c 0 3 x co 2 n co 2 n t o c 0 where n t o c o u t is the amount of toc in the product solution n t o c 0 the amount of toc injected into the reactor and n co 2 the amount of co 2 generated per cycle carbon containing residues such as coke were not found and therefore not included in the evaluation the amount of toc injected per cycle was calculated using the toc content of the dry feed ω t o c f e e d d r y the ts content of the feed ω t s f e e d the volume of feed v f e e d injected per cycle the density of the feed ρ f e e d and the molar mass of carbon m c the density of the feed in the used ts range was found to be 1 g ml 4 n t o c 0 ω t o c f e e d d r y ω t s f e e d v f e e d ρ f e e d m c the amount of toc in the product solution was calculated from the toc concentration in the product solution c t o c o u t and the volume of product solution ejected v p s 5 n t o c o u t c t o c o u t v p s m c the amount of co 2 generated was calculated using the volumes of gas injected v a i r 0 and ejected v g a s o u t at standard conditions the molar ratio of co 2 in the injected y co 2 a i r and ejected y co 2 o u t gas and the molar volume of

to the molar amount of all injected carbon n c i n because the feed contained nearly no inorganic carbon the amount of carbon injected is equal to the molar amount of toc n t o c 0 ejected carbon was accounted for in the gas phase as n co 2 and in the product solution as n t c o u t while our gc was able to detect also co and ch 4 the concentration of theses compounds was around the quantification limit of the instrument and their contribution was thus not included 7 c b n c o u t n c i n n co 2 n t c o u t n t o c 0 4 results and discussion the experimental parameters as well as the energy demand of the heating shells e h e a t e r the oxygen to fuel equivalence ratio λ the conversions x t o c and x c o 2 and the carbon balance of all tests are displayed in table 2 more information regarding the toc content of the process water and the gas composition of the off gas can be found in the supplemental information table s3 3 4 1 carbon conversion and carbon balance in all experiments the sff was converted to a semi transparent suspension containing only a fraction of the initial carbon the injected feed contained 75 000 mg l of toc at a ts of 15 wt which was transformed into co 2 as the main gaseous product and dissolved organic carbon doc together with carbonates under all experimental conditions the toc concentration of the final process water was between 455 and 9000 mg l the ejected gas contained between 5 9 mol of co 2 see table s3 3 the overall carbon conversion was in the range of 97 such high conversion values lead to the assumption that no significant inhomogeneities or dead zones were present in the reactor the faint color of the product solution compared to similar work of miller et al 2015 most probably stemmed from the higher ts concentrations and lower peak temperatures used in our study only traces of co and ch 4 were found in the gas phase this is remarkable as in earlier batch experiments with real feces hübner found some of the carbon being converted to co hübner et al 2016 test09 is the experiment most likely to produce co because it has the lowest oxygen to fuel ratio a short reaction time and a high feed concentration the concentration of co in the gas from test09 was below 0 3 which was just around the quantification limit the biggest difference between the batch reactor and the fox 02 setup is the rapid heating up and mixing of oxygen water and organics in the fox 02 during the injection as opposed to the static situation in the batch reactor used by hübner in the latter case it was found that most of the carbon conversion happened already during the subcritical heating up during which still a liquid phase prevailed a fraction of the initial carbon was transformed to co most likely by decarbonylation of partially oxidized organics the oxygen had first to dissolve in the liquid phase and diffuse to the organics and to the dissolved co to oxidize it to co 2 our hypothesis is that in the fox 02 supercritical monophasic conditions are reached much more rapidly than in hübner s batch reactor accelerating the oxidation of the co formed from the decarbonylation of the organics in earlier experiments with real human feces so called ignition peaks in temperature and pressure were observed to occur if the ts content of the feed exceeded 12 wt the sff used in the present study showed a similar behavior the typical pressure and temperature profile measured inside the reactor during two selected runs with a ts content a above and b below this critical ts content of about 12 wt is shown in fig 2 the pressure and temperature profiles of all series are depicted in the supplementary figs s3 1 and s3 2 upon injection of the feed and the pressurized air from the injector at t 0 the pressure in the reactor increased sharply irrespective of the ts content simultaneously the temperature dropped by about 100 c due to the injection of the cold feed as the feed heated up the temperature returned to the set point temperature of 390 c while the pressure increased further due to the heat up of the injected mixture if the ts content of the feed was sufficiently high 15 wt in this case test01 blue both pressure and temperature increased rapidly after about 2 min denoted as ignition peak during this ignition peak the maximum pressure and temperature reached about 330 bar and 485 c respectively due to the symmetrical design of the reactor we assume that the temperature peak occurred throughout the whole reactor volume however every thermocouple has an inherent response inertia and may not be able to detect temperature peaks on very short time scales in some cases a second less distinct ignition peak δ p about 10 bar and δ t about 5 c was observed if feed with a ts content lower than 11 wt was injected at an identical preheating temperature and injection pressure no such ignition peaks were visible compare test01 with test02 in fig 2 the occurrence of ignition peaks does not seem to affect the conversion even though their higher temperatures would lead to faster reaction rates hübner concluded that only a relatively small fraction of volatile organics were responsible for the ignition peaks and this small fraction would thus not influence the overall carbon conversion much hübner et al 2016 comparing the experiments in this study with and without ignition peaks the same conclusion can be drawn as the conversion is not higher for the experiments exhibiting ignition peaks similarly no relation between the occurrence of ignition peaks and the co concentration was found the resulting pressure temperature p t trajectories of the high and low ts case are displayed in fig 2c in blue and orange respectively the hypothetical p t trajectory of the feed itself follows a different initial course dotted orange line as the feed is already pressurized in the injector prior to the injection but is not at the reaction temperature yet once the valve v6 is opened the pressure inside the injector drops while the feed is injected into the reactor where it is quickly repressurized the feed now heats up rapidly to reactor temperature indicated by the dotted line merging after about 3 s with the p t trajectory derived from the temperature sensor inside the reactor we found that the time after which supercritical conditions are reached strongly correlates with the injection pressure at high injection pressures of 160 or 180 bar it takes between 25 to 40 s to reach supercritical conditions after injection while it takes between 60 to 90 s at an injection pressure of 140 bar this means that depending on the residence time and injection pressure the feed spends around 70 to 95 of the total reaction time under supercritical conditions this trajectory is important to detect whether the feed mixture passes through the vapor phase region or whether it always stays liquid up to the transition to the supercritical region a reduction of the injection pressure from 160 to 140 bar resulted in a decrease of the oxygen to fuel ratio λ which did not have an effect on the conversion compare test01 and test 02 with test04 and test03 respectively from an energetic and economic standpoint it is preferable to inject the feed with as little pressure as possible as long as λ 1 and supercritical conditions are reached in the reactor because this minimizes the operating time of the compressor however in previous experiments with a small batch reactor the formation of coke and tar was observed when the p t trajectory crossed the vapor liquid equilibrium line of water hübner et al 2016 coke and tar form under oxygen deficient conditions i e when λ 1 and only slowly decompose once formed therefore coke and tar formation must be prevented as it will ultimately lower the conversion contaminate the liquid product phase and may lead to clogging of valves and pipes over time passing through the vapor region will dry out the liquid phase resulting in very high concentrations in the remaining liquid which promotes coke formation a trajectory from test04 with the same ts content as in test01 blue but with an injection pressure of only 140 bar instead of 160 bar is displayed in fig 2c in gray because of the lower injection pressure the vapor pressure curve was crossed and coke formation may have taken place however it was not possible to determine the amount of coke in the effluent from these tests the only series in which x t o c was below 97 were experiments run with a shorter residence time of 300 instead of 600 s this indicates that a residence time of more than 300 s is needed to achieve almost complete conversion in the current setup the low conversion in test11 and test12 is due to a separation of the feed into its oily and watery phases in the feces tank because of the phase separation the feed becomes inhomogeneous and the amount of carbon injected per cycle is subject to a large uncertainty the carbon conversion x c o 2 and the c balance of these two experiments were low probably the phase separation resulted in less carbon rich feed being transferred into the injector we therefore excluded these two series from the further discussions the mass of the ejected product solution was consistently about 20 lower than the mass of the injected feed this difference in total mass can be explained by i the decomposition of the solid feed fraction into gases and ii water losses by saturation of the ejected gas stream with water vapor 4 2 energy balance to make the feces treatment unit applicable in remote regions the energy demand needs to be as low as possible ideally to be covered by a small array of solar panels on top of the toilet the two most energetically demanding process steps in the fox 02 are the heating of the reactor and the compression of the air fig 3 a and b show the cumulative energy demand of the heating shells starting from the injection for test01 and test02 with a ts content of 15 and 11 wt respectively in both cases about 0 05 kwh was needed per cycle to keep the temperature of the shells at 390 c the heating switched on as soon as the temperature sensor ttrc 1 located in the groove between the heating shells and the outer surface of the reactor dropped below 390 c fig 3b and f this happened in the beginning after the injection of the cold feed and at the end after the ejection of the hot fluid fox 02 did not require any external heating during the reaction time which was due to the heat generation from the exothermic feed conversion in the insulated reactor vessel over all series the system required between 0 03 and 0 05 kwh of heating energy per cycle which equals to 0 7 to 1 6 kwh per kilogram of wet feed 37 to 49 g per cycle in comparison the heat provided by complete oxidation of sff with 12 5 wt ts released 0 8 kwh per kilogram of wet feed which is in the same range as the energy provided by the heaters from a comparison of the temperature at the outer surface of the reactor ttrc 1 fig 3b and f and the temperature inside the reactor ttr 2 fig 3c and g the effect of the large thermal mass of the reactor and the shell can be seen while the temperature variation at the heating shell is about 5 c the temperature inside the reactor can increase or decrease by almost 100 c the slow decrease of ttrc 1 from the peak value to the ejection point of the reactor contents is due to the heat losses to the surroundings in fig 3d and h the difference ttr 2 ttrc 1 has been plotted to highlight the sign of the heat flux between the reactor contents and the shell when it is positive heat flows from the fluid inside the reactor to the reactor wall and the shell when it is negative heat from the shell is transferred to the reactor and the fluid the energy demand of the fox 02 system may be reduced further by using better insulation material and also by allowing less gaps around tubing sensors etc in principle the average temperature of the reactor and the shells should slightly increase with each cycle due to the exothermic heat of reaction because the insulation is not perfect the temperatures ttr 2 and ttrc 1 both do not increase with each cycle as seen in fig 3 the compressor requires about 0 12 kwh per cycle or 3 kwh per kilogram of wet feed to replenish the air ejected from the gas cylinder in the previous cycle because the control circuit and the pump require very little energy in comparison the overall energy consumption of the system is on average about 4 kwh per kilogram of wet feed injected 3 kwh from the compressor 1 kwh from the heating shells additionally the gas tanks were refilled after every injection to improve the reproducibility of the injected amount which led to a high energy demand as the pressure repeatedly needed to be built up to 280 bar before the gas tanks could be filled for a real world application the air tanks filled to 310 bar contain enough air to allow 10 to 12 injections with 160 bar 4 3 transient thermal behavior the reaction system realized in the fox 02 setup corresponds to an autothermal oxidation with heat transfer to the storage shells the heat liberated by the exothermic oxidation reactions increases the temperature of the reacting mixture accelerating the oxidation kinetics this leads to a faster heat release rate which corresponds to a self acceleration also known as runaway reaction in safety considerations this system can be described and analyzed by a transient heat balance when the kinetics are known a simplified and generalized theory of such systems was proposed by semenoff 1928 in this work semenov s theory was applied to describe the ignition peaks for such a peak to occur the heat release rate must be significantly faster than the heat transfer rate to the reactor wall in the opposite case where the heat transfer rate to the wall is of similar or higher magnitude than the heat release rate only a small peak or no peak at all is assumed to occur semenov s theory assumes a batch reactor with irreversible first order kinetics also a constant wall temperature and no consumption of the reactant is assumed even if some of these assumptions are violated semenov s theory is a good approximation for various real systems varma et al 1999 the kinetics of hübner et al 2016 for hydrothermal fecal sludge oxidation and direct irreversible decomposition of toc to co 2 with a single activation energy were used to describe the reactions this first order kinetics have a preexponential factor k 0 1 of 36 13 s 1 and an activation energy e 0 of 43 kj mol the dimensionless energy balance 8 d θ d τ ψ exp θ 1 θ γ θ is based on the dimensionless temperature θ time τ activation energy γ and the semenov number ψ 9 ψ k 0

f w of 800 w m 2 k was estimated by fitting t t trajectories for water air mixtures to a transient system model mangold 2021 for a wall temperature of 390 c the critical semenov number ψ c is 0 4272 only if ψ ψ c a thermal runaway is expected as the amount of feed injected is low the assumption of no consumption is violated shortly after ignition starts as a consequence an ignition peak instead of a thermal runaway is observed the experimental series with semenov numbers below ψ c calculated according to eq 9 showed no ignition peak for series with ψ above ψ c an ignition peak was observed the theoretical limit in ts content for ignition peaks of 13 1 wt supports the experimental value which was between 11 0 0 2 and 12 9 0 7 wt 5 conclusions small amounts of homogenized fecal simulant mixtures can be fed pneumatically at high pressure into an hto reactor in a reproducible way and without clogging a minimum toc concentration of 11 13 wt is needed to produce an ignition peak in both temperature and pressure in a nearly adiabatic batch reactor system ignition peaks are important safety design parameters they can be predicted with good accuracy using semenov s theory and the kinetics for hto of feces determined by hübner et al 2016 an ignition peak is not a prerequisite for reaching high carbon conversions the cyclic batch hto system fox 02 reached total carbon conversions from 97 to 99 for a range of feed concentrations 11 15 wt at a reactor preheating temperature of 390 c an oxygen to carbon ratio 1 9 and a minimum reaction time of 600 s toc values of the process water were in the range of 455 1600 mg l for a reaction time of 600 s for a reaction time of 300 s the toc values increased to 5600 9900 mg l starting with a feed at 15 wt ts content a toc conversion of at least 99 9 is needed to reach toc values below 100 mg l in the process water to reach this goal higher reactor temperatures and or longer reaction times should be explored the fox 02 system requires 0 7 1 6 kwh kg wetf eed of external energy to reheat the reactor contents after injecting cold reactants and after rapid discharge during the oxidation phase at the reactor set point temperature of 390 c no external heating is needed to sustain the operation due to the heat generation from the exothermic feed conversion minimizing thermal losses further is critical for attaining a
