21220,abstract seawater hydraulic axial piston pump shapp is a critical power component in underwater operating systems a parameterized elasto hydrodynamic ehd lubrication model of the piston cylinder tribopair in the shapp is originally established which considers the elasto hydrodynamic behavior viscosity temperature effect and deep sea environmental pressure the deformation of piston bush bearing mechanism and energy loss characteristics of the water film under different operating conditions are discussed the results show that the deformation of piston bush made of polyetheretherketone peek is in micron scale under water film and deep sea pressure which could increase the leakage and viscous friction power loss of piston cylinder tribopair in deep sea environment the leakage and viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd are always greater than those calculated by hydrodynamic hd and increase with the increase of working pressure shaft speed gap size sea depth and piston bush thickness besides the increase of sea surface temperature could increase the leakage and decrease the viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair respectively finally design instructions to optimize the piston cylinder tribopair are presented therefore the proposed methodology can be used as a designing tool for shapp keywords seawater hydraulic axial piston pump piston

society s requirements on environmental protection sustainable development and safety in production water hydraulic transmission has caught attention as a renascent technique and has become one of the research hotspots in the field of fluid transmission and control because of its outstanding characteristics of flame retardancy greenness cleanliness and energy saving during the past two or three decades lim et al 2003 yang and pan 2015 yin et al 2016 2018 the seawater lubricated hydraulic transmission is a fluid transmission method that uses filtered seawater without any auxiliary components as the energy conversion transmission and control medium which has been widely used in ocean engineering deep underwater apparatus underwater tool systems seawater reverse osmosis desalination projects and so on liu et al 2017a b wu et al 2017 shapp is one of the key power components in seawater hydraulic systems as shown in fig 1 it is environmentally friendly and has high efficiency which can work in the open circuit seawater hydraulic transmission systems with the function of pressure self compensation zhang et al 2018 there are three key tribopairs namely slipper swashplate tribopair piston cylinder tribopair and valve port plate tribopair in shapp the piton cylinder tribopair which is the key factor to determine the efficiency performance and the main weak link to affect the reliability and service life of the shapp is a crucial tribopair to complete the water suction and delivery function particularly the piston cylinder tribopair is the only tribopair that cannot achieve hydrostatic support in the shapp and its load carrying capacity can only be achieved by hydrodynamic effects while the piston cylinder tribopair carries a huge external load force it plays an important role in sealing the high pressure water in the piston chamber and it is also one of the main power loss sources of the shapp the huge external load force could generate high pressure acting on the surface of the piston and piston bush which can lead to elastic deformation of the surface this elastic deformation would change the thickness and pressure distribution of the seawater film in the piston cylinder tribopair therefore it is a dynamic process of reciprocating cycle and interaction until the film pressure field and the elastic deformation of the tribopair surface reach a dynamic equilibrium state ye et al 2019 this is the so called fluid structure coupling effect in the piston cylinder tribopair moreover due to the existence of deep sea pressure the effect of fluid structure interaction on the lubrication bearing mechanism and energy consumption characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair could be more obvious therefore it is necessary to establish the ehd model to study the lubrication characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair in deep sea environment scholars have conducted a series of studies to reveal the lubrication mechanism of the piston cylinder tribopair in traditional oil hydraulic axial piston pumps and combustion engines zhang et al 2016 optimized the shape of piston ring faces using the inverse method kumar and bergada 2013 developed a finite volume method fvm based reynolds equation model for the piston cylinder tribopair which considers the piston eccentricity and the relative tangential movement between piston and cylinder block and the effect of different piston grooves configurations on the pressure distribution leakage force and cavitation of piston cylinder tribopair has been investigated zavos and nikolakopoulos 2015 numerically investigated the hydrodynamic lubrication characteristics of piston ring cylinder tribopair using a fluid structural algorithm wang et al 2018 proposed a mathematical model considering the structure piston motion and piston dynamic load to predict the oil film thickness and verified by experiments jiang et al 2018 studied the working efficiency and reliability of the piston cylinder tribopair in the radial piston pump by calculating the shape and pressure distribution ma et al 2018 2019 established the transient hydrodynamic lubrication model of the piston cylinder interface with variable length and discussed the influence of cylinder length clearance and piston texture design schemes on piston force and friction force of the axial piston pump xu et al 2013 investigated the radial micro motion and pressure distribution of the piston cylinder tribopair by considering the influences of roughness elastic deformation of piston and pressure viscosity effect liu et al 2016 2017 numerically analyzed the deformation of the piston bush and rear front sliding bearings of seawater hydraulic axial piston motor and the dynamic performance of seawater hydraulic relief valve in the deep sea environment by ansys workbench similarly the leakage performance of piston swiveling cylinder pair considering one way fluid structure interaction in high water based hydraulic motor has been reported zhao et al 2020 lu et al 2018 established a mixed lubrication model to investigate the tribological properties of the compression ring cylinder tribopair under cylinder deactivation jiang et al 2019 presented a comprehensive multi domain simulation tool that could predict the lubricating flow between piston and bush and the influence of the thickness of the piston bush on the leakage and friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair was investigated meng et al 2007 studied the influence of oil film inertia forces on thermo elasto hydrodynamic tehd lubrication properties of a piston skirt in combustion engine tang et al 2017 developed a novel tehd lubrication model for slipper tribopair in axial piston pump and investigated the effects of working conditions and slipper structure parameters on tehd lubrication performance such as film thickness pressure temperature and leakage flow rate li et al 2017 and ji 2018 proposed a novel and effective thermal fluid structure coupling model of valve plate pair in an axial piston pump with high pressure and high speed qian et al 2017 presented a thermal fluid structure interaction model that can simulate the complex phenomena taking place at the piston cylinder interface and discussed the impacts of pressure induced and thermal elastic deformations of the structure parameters on the leakage the numerical calculated leakage rates showed good agreement with the experimental results however the tilt of the piston is not considered in the model gels and murrenhoff 2014 created a simulation tool to numerically compute the reynolds equation for the lubricating film of the contoured piston cylinder tribopair in axial piston pump besides fluid structure and thermal interaction model has been developed to study the heat transfer and thermal elastic deformation characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair in oil axial piston pumps and a novel temperature adaptive piston design was proposed pelosi and ivantysynova 2012a 2012b shang and ivantysynova 2016 generally the piston and cylinder are made of stainless steel after heat treatment and the piston bush is usually made of high performance engineering plastics peek to improve the friction performance and prevent seawater corrosion the deformation of the piston bush in piston cylinder tribopair directly affects its bearing capacity lubrication characteristics and energy loss characteristics in addition this effect is particularly obvious in the deep sea environment most of the previous studies have focused on oil lubricated piston pumps and combustion engine whereas the analysis of the lubrication characteristics in the open shapps is relatively less besides the ehd lubrication model of piston cylinder tribopair considering the ocean environment has not been studied in this paper a novel ehd lubrication model considering the ocean environment and two way fluid structure interaction of the piston cylinder tribopair in the open shapp was developed and solved accurately based on fvm and finite element method fem theory the effects of working pressure shaft speed gap size sea depth sea surface temperature and piston bush thickness on the piston bush deformation lubrication and bearing mechanism of water film and energy loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair are investigated 2 mathematical model 2 1 ocean environment model 2 1 1 deep sea pressure in a deep sea environment the pressure of seawater varies with the sea depths which can be expressed as gill 1982 1 p h p 0 ρ h g h 1 2 ρ h v m 2 1 v s v m 2 p 0 ρ h g h h 1000 7000 where p 0 is the atmospheric pressure ρ h 1050 kg m3 is the seawater density g is gravity acceleration h is the sea depth v s is the velocity of seawater at sea depth h v m is the velocity of underwater equipment relative to seawater 2 1 2 seawater temperature generally the temperature of the seawater varies from 0 to 35 c and the average annual temperature of seawater in half of the waters is above 20 c however in the deep sea environment due to the weakening of light and the fluctuation of current the seawater temperature decreases unevenly with the increase of depth and the relationship between seawater temperature and sea depth can be described as griffies 2004 2 t h h 1 96 10 8 h 3 1 02 10 4 h 2 2 29 10 3 28 17 h 0 430 9337 h 1 155 0 5226 h 430 7000 where t h is the seawater temperature at the sea depth of h 2 1 3 seawater viscosity in deep sea environment it is known that the viscosity of seawater is affected by temperature and pressure riisgard and larsen 2007 fitted the experimental data and found that when the temperature of seawater was 0 35 c the viscosity variation of standard seawater salinity 35 with the depth of seawater could be expressed as 3 μ s w h t μ s w 0 e λ s w t δ μ s w where μ s w 0 1 89 10 3 pa s is the atmospheric seawater viscosity when the salinity of seawater is 35 and the viscosity temperature coefficient λ s w of seawater with a salinity of 35 is 1 38 7 at the temperature of 0 35 c 4 δ μ s w p h 10 4 10 13 a 1 a 2 t a 3 t 2 p h 10 4 10 13 a 4 a 5 t a 6 t 2 where p h is seawater pressure at sea depth of h a 1 1 8266 10 8 a 2 1 3817 10 9 a 3 2 6362 10 11 a 4 9 8965 10 13 a 5 6 325 10 14 a 6 1 2115 10 15 because of the great difference of seawater temperature in different waters and seasons the seawater viscosity is obviously different however in the deep sea environment the viscosity of seawater is mainly affected by the sea depth 2 2 dynamics model of the piston cylinder tribopair fig 2 shows the trajectory of the piston head center it is described that the reciprocating movement of the piston relative to the cylinder along the cylinder axis and the rotational movement of the slipper together with the cylinder act as two main movements assuming that the top dead center of the piston trajectory is the initial position two left hand coordinate systems are defined the coordinate system x y z is a global coordinate system whose origin is located at the point of intersection between the centerline of the cylinder block and the particular plane passing through the center of all piston head centers as the cylinder rotates the piston head center moved from point a to point b the coordinates of the piston head center can be expressed as 5 x y z r b sin ϕ r b cos ϕ r b cos ϕ tan β where r b is the piston pitch radius ϕ is the shaft angle ω is the angular speed of the cylinder block and β is the swashplate angle the rotational velocity around cylinder axis u p axial velocity v p and axial acceleration a p of pistons assembly are 6 u p ω r b v p d z d t ω r b tan β sin ϕ a p d v d t ω 2 r b tan β cos ϕ the water film characteristics in the piston cylinder tribopair was affected by the forces acting on the piston to derive the force acting on the piston a left handed coordinate system x p y p z p rotating with the cylinder is established in fig 3 the coordinate system rotates with the cylinder block so that the z p axis always coincides with the cylinder hole axis and the y p axis is always directed radially outward the origin of the coordinate system is always on the ball head side of the piston bush the displacement pressure force f p c can be expressed as 7 f p c π d p 2 p p c p c a s e 4 where d p is the piston outer diameter p p c is the pressure in the piston chamber and p c a s e is the case drain pressure as shown in fig 4 the pressure in the piston chamber changes with the rotation of the cylinder block liu et al 2017a b the periodic change of displacement pressure will lead to the oscillation of the load acting on the piston the inertia force of the piston slipper assembly f ap can be described as 8 f a p m s p a p m s m p r b ω 2 tan β cos φ where m s p is the mass of the piston slipper assembly m s is the slipper mass and m p is the piston mass as illustrated in fig 5 when the flow state of the water film in the piston cylinder tribopair is laminar flow the viscous friction force between piston and piston bush can be calculated as 9 f f p v a μ v p h p p y ˆ h p 2 d a 10 f f p u a μ u p h p p x ˆ h p 2 d a where f f p v is axial viscous friction force f f p u is circumferential viscous friction force p is the pressure of the water film μ is the viscosity of seawater h p is the thickness of the water film r p is the radius of piston the centrifugal force of the piston slipper assembly f ω p is given by 11 f ω p m s m p ω 2 r b the viscous friction force between the slipper and the swashplate f f s can be presented as 12 f f s μ ω r b h s π 4 d s o u t 2 d s i n 2 where h s is the thickness of the water film between slipper and swashplate d sout is the slipper outside diameter and d sin is the slipper inside diameter the reaction force of the swashplate f sp can be expressed as 13 f s p f p c f f p f a p cos β 14 f s p y sin β f s p the external forces and moments of the piston must be balanced with the fluid forces and moments and the balance equations of the force and torque can be obtained in eq 15 where the forces and moments with subscript px py are applied by the water film 15

as 16 f p x a p x ˆ y ˆ cos θ p d x ˆ d y ˆ 17 f p y a p x ˆ y ˆ sin ϕ p d x ˆ d y ˆ 2 3 the isothermal fluid flow model 2 3 1 water film thickness equation in a typical seawater axial piston pump the gap between the piston and the piston bush is about 10 μm which is far less than the piston radius for the convenience of calculation the cut surface of the piston can be regarded as a circle mathematically the shaft eccentricity vector e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 is used to determine the thickness value of water film between the piston and piston bush at each point in the fluid domain where e 1 e 2 is the eccentricity vector of piston axis close to the ball head of the piston and e 3 e 4 is the eccentricity vector of the piston axis close to the piston chamber in fig 6 the main geometric parameters for defining the water film thickness equation are depicted the projection of piston axis on the plane x p z p and the plane y p z p can be described as 18 x p z p z p e 3 e 1 l b e 1 y p z p z p e 4 e 2 l b e 2 the coordinates of the piston axis on any x p y p section are obtained through the above analysis then the expression of the water film thickness of the piston cylinder tribopair can be obtained by the following trigonometric equation 19 h z p φ p r c cos φ p e 3 e 1 l b z p e 1 2 r c sin φ p e 4 e 2 l b z p e 2 2 r p δ h where δh represents the elastic deformation of the piston bush surface which will be discussed later similarly the normal extrusion velocity field can be defined as a function of time derivative vector e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 of piston eccentricity 20 h z p φ p e 3 e 1 l b z p e 1 cos φ p e 4 e 2 l b z p e 2 sin φ p δ h in this paper the transient squeeze film effect caused by elastic surface deformation of solid boundary δ h is neglected 2 3 2 reynolds equation to study the ehd lubrication characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair in the shapp reynolds equation must be written with reference to the clearance of water film as shown in fig 7 the pressure distribution in the lubricating gap can be determined by solving the reynolds equation as the shapps were usually used in open circuit deep seawater hydraulic systems the piston cylinder tribopair has good heat exchange conditions and the temperature rise can be neglected liu et al 2017a b wu et al 2017 due to the small pressure gradient in the thickness direction it is reasonable to solve the two dimensional reynolds equation to obtain the pressure field of water film ma et al 2018 pelosi and ivantysynova 2012b the water film thickness of the piston cylinder tribopair differs greatly from the length and radius of the piston besides the structured grid was used to conveniently solve the fluid pressure field of the piston cylinder tribopair therefore the cylindrical thickness field can be expanded into a rectangular thickness field with length 2πr p and width l b as shown in fig 5 a finally the two dimensional transient reynolds equation for an incompressible newtonian fluid in the left handed coordinate system can be expressed as 21 x ˆ h 3 μ p x ˆ y ˆ h 3 μ p y ˆ 6 ω p r p h x ˆ v p h y ˆ 2 h t where ω p is the piston rotation speed and r p is the piston radius 2 3 3 energy consumption characteristics the energy loss of the shapp mainly comes from the leakage and viscous friction power loss in the tribopairs to obtain the leakage and viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair the stress field and velocity field of the water film should be calculated the stress field and the velocity field of the water film in the coordinate system x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ are presented as follows 22 τ p x μ d u ˆ d z ˆ z ˆ h p x ˆ h 2 μ u ˆ h τ p y μ d v ˆ d z ˆ z ˆ h p y ˆ h 2 μ v ˆ h 23 u ˆ 1 2 μ p x ˆ z ˆ 2 z ˆ h p u s p z ˆ h p v ˆ 1 2 μ p y ˆ z ˆ 2 z ˆ h p v s p z ˆ h p by integrating eq 22 along the friction surface between the piston and piston bush the total viscous friction force acting on the piston in eq 9 can be obtained the leakage of the piston cylinder tribopair q pc can be calculated by integrating the axial velocity v ˆ of the fluid along any section of the gap between the piston and piston bush the leakage and viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair are defined as follows 24 q p c 0 2 π r p 0 h p v ˆ d x ˆ d z ˆ 25 p f f f p v v p 2 4 solids finite element elastic deformation model since the elastic modulus of peek is much smaller than that of steel the deformation of piston and cylinder can be almost ignored and the water film thickness in the gap is only affected by the deformation of the piston bush the material properties of peek are assumed to be linear piecewise interpolation functions of pressure liu et al 2017a b wang et al 1997 the force governing equation is solved and the constraint conditions are introduced to obtain the deformation of the piston bush in this study the fem was used to calculate the deformation of the piston bush 26 u k 1 f where k is the global stiffness matrix and f is the external force acting on the piston bush as shown in fig 7 the elastic deformation of the solid bodies is analyzed for one single element and then extended to the rest of the numerical domain 3 numerical method to reveal the ehd characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair the sequential coupled field method was used to solve the fluid pressure field of the water film and the elastic deformation of the piston bush two dimensional finite volume hydrodynamic model with structured grid were adopted to study the pressure field of water film in the gap as shown in the upper part of fig 7 the elastic deformation of the piston bush is solved by a three dimensional finite element elastic mechanics model with hexahedral mesh as shown in the lower part of fig 7 the finite element mesh of the solid field fixed on the cylinder rotates with the cylinder and the fluid domain mesh fixed on the piston surface changes with the movement of the piston these two grid systems dynamically interact with each other 3 1 water film finite volume isothermal flow model as eq 21 is an elliptic partial differential equation and cannot find the analytical solution the fvm is used to solve the problem the piston sub value domain is discretized and subdivided into a finite number of discrete grids and each grid is sufficiently small that the pressure values in each unit are linearly changed or equal referring to fig 7 the control volume centered on node p is selected which has four boundaries the cell has a height of δ x ˆ and a width of δ y ˆ the four faces separating the central control volume from its adjacent control volume which are centered on nodes n s w and e are labeled n s w and e as illustrated in fig 7 the reynolds equation is integrated in the control volume of the fluid domain which can be represented as 27 δ v x ˆ h 3 μ p x ˆ d v δ v y ˆ h 3 μ p y ˆ d v δ v 6 ω p r p h x ˆ v p h y ˆ 2 h t d v 0 3 1 1 discrete equations of internal nodes 28 h n 3

calculation method the control volume linear algebraic pressure equation expressed by eq 30 is extended to the entire numerical domain and a linear algebraic system that can be solved numerically is obtained dirichlet boundary conditions are assumed at the fluid film boundaries as shown in section 3 1 2 a successive over relaxation method sor is used to solve the linear algebraic pressure equation this iterative procedure employs a guess and correct philosophy which progressively improves the guessed solution by repeated application of the discrete equation in this solution the over relaxation coefficient α sor is set to 1 7 for a single volume centroid the sor method at the kth iteration states is 35 p i j k α s o r a w p i j 1 k a e p i j 1 k 1 a s p i 1 j k a n p i 1 j k 1 s a

system the jacobian matrix is constructed by the difference scheme in the form of 39 f i e e j 1 e h f i e 1 e j e 4 f i e 1 e j e h e 4 where i 1 2 3 4 j 1 2 3 4 and e h 10 9 is the step size which should be as small as possible to ensure the accuracy of the solution 3 2 elastic deformation of the piston bush as the shapp is completely submerged in the deep sea environment and working in high pressure condition the piston bush as presented in fig 8 is affected by the water film pressure the displacement pressure and the environmental pressure moreover due to the rotation of the cylinder block the piston cylinder interface is constantly changing the action range of the water film pressure on the piston bush and the displacement pressure changes simultaneously the size of the piston bush mesh corresponding to the water film mesh changes at the same time in the axial direction so this link will be built on every angle step therefore the ansys parametric design language apdl is used to solve the deformation problem of piston bush with variable contact length based on the analysis in section 2 4 the deformation of the piston bush can be assumed to be linear elasticity the density young s modulus and poisson s ratio of peek are 1310 kg m3 4200 mpa and 0 4 respectively according to the real working condition of the shapp the water film pressure field delivery pressure and deep sea environmental pressure are loaded on the corresponding surface of the piston bush as shown in fig 9 3 3 a complete two way numerical fluid structure coupling flow the complete transient two way fluid structure coupling numerical model captures the impact of the piston macro and micro motion fluid and material properties deep sea environmental pressure and surface elastic deformation on the pressure and thickness distributions of the piston cylinder tribopair the model couples iteratively different numerical domains and solution schemes as shown in fig 10 two main different numerical environments were defined in the process of solution the link between fluid and solid mesh is established dynamically a closed loop is established to realize the two way coupling of flow field and structure field on the one hand the pressure calculated by fluid mesh should be transferred to solid mesh on the other hand the deformation calculated by solid mesh is transferred to fluid mesh to solve reynolds equation with deformed gap height the convergence of external load is regarded as the termination condition when the external load converges the micro velocity of piston is modified and the water film thickness is updated at the next moment the typical time step of piston cylinder fully coupled simulation corresponds to δϕ 0 25 so 1440 simulation points are used in one shaft revolution this scheme repeats itself until the end of one shaft revolution fig 7 shows the process of the linking of fluid and solid mesh the fluid mesh is staggered with the solid mesh for the solid mesh element selected in fig 7 the pressure of the node p is transferred to the center of solid mesh cell and after calculating the deformation of the piston bush the deformation of the four nodes on the selected solid mesh cell is transferred to the node p of the fluid mesh besides the fluid and solid mesh changes along with the rotation of shaft so this link will be built on every angle step the proposed model can be used to analyze the transient ehd lubrication characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair during an entire shaft revolution in deep sea environment based on the dynamic interaction of matlab and apdl numerical calculation results of fluid and structure can be obtained the main structural parameters and initial operating conditions are listed in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation and grid independency test to validate the correctness of the model the results given by the analytical expression provided by eq s 39 and 40 munson et al 2013 were compared with our calculation results the proposed transient model was simplified to a steady state one without considering the inclination of the piston fig 11 illustrates the leakage and the viscous friction power loss of piston cylinder tribopair in one shaft revolution without considering the tilt effect of piston and comparison between numerical and analytical results under p pc 14 mpa c b 10

independent of the grid size and therefore a common grid size 40 60 is selected for the rest of the numerical simulation in the present work 4 2 water film performance 4 2 1 water film bearing mechanism fig 13 represents the simulated thickness distribution and the projection of the thickness field on the plane x ˆ y ˆ in the gap calculated by hd and ehd at ϕ 90 and 270 under p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m these particular shaft angles have been selected because the piston is working in delivery and suction strokes respectively and the sliding velocity is at its maximum and therefore the dynamic pressure effect is expected to be at its highest level the x ˆ axis and y ˆ axis represent the circumferential and axial direction of the water film respectively it is clear from fig 13 that the distributions of water film thickness calculated by ehd and hd show waveform in the fluid film area this reflects that the piston needs to adjust its eccentric posture in the cylinder to produce a squeezing force and a dynamic pressure of suitable strength to balance the external load at the current moment notice as well in fig s 13 a 13 d that the distributions of water film thickness are non uniform in the delivery stroke which means that the piston is inclined in the cylinder block in the water suction stroke ϕ 270 the thickness of the water film is relatively uniform which means that the piston does not have a large inclination in the cylinder block as expected the water film thickness calculated by ehd varies much larger than hd indicating that the deformation of the piston bush could aggravate the inclination of piston as shown in fig 13 e there is a significant difference in the film thickness between the ehd results and the hd results in the delivery stroke ϕ 90 while this difference is relatively low in the suction stroke which mainly caused by the deep sea environmental pressure as presented in fig 13 f therefore the deformation of the piston bush could increase the swing amplitude and instability of the piston similar to the thickness field the pressure field of water film also presents a waveform in the fluid domain as illustrated in fig s 14 a and 14 c the maximum pressure calculated by hd and ehd are 26 14 mpa and 26 17 mpa in the delivery stroke respectively fig s 14 e and 14 f show the water film pressure field calculated by ehd and hd has no significant difference the explanation for this is that the film pressure is mainly determined by the external load it must be pointed out that due to the existence of dynamic pressure effect the peak pressure of the film is greater than the sum of working pressure and environmental pressure of 24 mpa under the premise of subtracting the working pressure and environmental pressure the maximum dynamic pressure of the water film calculated by hd and ehd in the delivery stroke is 2 14 mpa and 2 17 mpa respectively while the maximum dynamic pressure of the water film is both 0 39 mpa in the suction stroke calculated by hd and ehd as presented in figs 14 b and 14 d therefore the effect of dynamic pressure on the piston in the delivery stroke is greater than that in the suction stroke similar results have been presented by pelosi and ivantysynova 2012a 2012b 4 2 2 piston attitude analysis the minimum thickness determines the lubrication performance of the piston cylinder tribopair and can also indirectly measure the inclination of the piston fig 15 represents the simulated minimum thickness maximum pressure piston axis trajectory and piston bush deformation at p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m it can be noticed from fig 15 a that minimum thickness decreases at first reaching the minimum value of 0 8 μm at about ϕ 45 and then increases to its maximum value at ϕ 225 because the minimum water film thickness is less than 3 μm at about ϕ 45 the piston cylinder tribopair underwent a mixed lubrication bhushan 2013 it is shown in fig 15 b that the maximum water film pressures calculated by hd and ehd are almost the same fig 15 c illustrates the trajectory of the axes on both sides of the piston the blue dotted line calculated by hd is the trajectory of the intersection point of piston axis and x p y p plane while the blue solid line calculated by hd is the trajectory axis end of piston in one shaft revolution the red line calculated by ehd is the trajectory of piston axis under the same working condition points a b a and b in fig 15 c indicate the position of piston axis in x p y p plane at ϕ 45 so the length of line ab indicates the inclination of the piston in the cylinder the inclination of the piston first increases reaching the maximum at about ϕ 45 and then decreases slowly however the inclination of the piston does not change much due to the absence of the delivery pressure in the suction stroke which means the inclination of piston in the delivery stroke is far greater than that in the suction stroke as presented in fig 15 d the minimum and maximum deformation calculated by ehd is 0 9 μm and 3 75 μm respectively in other words the deformation of the piston bush is the same order of magnitude as the water film thickness which increases the water film thickness and has a significant impact on the lubrication performance of the piston cylinder tribopair although the deformation of the piston bush will affect the water film thickness and inclination of the piston the minimum water film thickness is always positive therefore it can be concluded from fig 15 that there is no collision between piston and cylinder block at p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m which indicates that the water film can withstand the change of external load 4 3 deformation of piston bush fig 16 shows the deformation distribution of piston bush with different shaft angles at p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m as expected the changing trend and law of piston bush deformation are basically consistent with the pressure field of the water film indicating that the deformation of the piston bush is positively related to the pressure of the water film during the delivery stroke when the piston cylinder tribopair is subjected to heavy oscillating load it can be noticed that the increase in the elastic deformation of the piston bush surface is reflected by the increase of the water film thickness it has to be noticed from fig 16 that the piston bush shows obvious nonlinearity with the application of non uniform pressure field in the delivery stroke combined with fig 16 b and c it is found that the piston bush has the largest deformation of 3 75 μm at ϕ 45 and the water film in the region of local high elasto hydrodynamic pressure is more obvious due to the greater inclination of the piston the unevenness of the pressure field and the deformation of the piston is more obvious another thing to be noticed from fig 16 b that the position of deformed piston bush has changed and the deformation has occurred over a larger area moreover figs 16 d 16 f show that the surface elastic deformation in suction stroke is lower than that in the delivery stroke which corresponds to the lower elasto hydrodynamic pressure however due to the existence of the deep sea environmental pressure the piston bush is still deformed and the deformation of the piston bush is mainly distributed with a value of 1 3 μm as shown in figs 16 a 16 e and 16 f as a result the hydrodynamic pressure could lead to the elastic surface deformation and increase the thickness of the water film 4 4 energy loss characteristics to provide a theoretical guidance for the design of the piston cylinder tribopair in the shapp the sensitivity analysis of leakage flow and power loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair was presented by changing factors such as working pressure shaft speed gap size sea depth sea surface temperature and piston bush thickness as listed in table 2 in particular when studying the influence of the sea surface temperature t 0 in different waters on the leakage and viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair the sea depth is set to 0 m 4 4 1 leakage analysis fig 17 shows the leakage calculated by hd and ehd versus shaft angle under different operating and structural parameters it is expected in fig 17 a that the increase of working pressure could obviously increase the leakage and the leakage of the piston cylinder tribopair considering the elastic deformation ehd of piston bush is larger than that without elastic deformation hd of piston bush in the delivery stroke however there is little difference between the leakage calculated by ehd and hd in the suction stroke it can be explained that the deformation of the peek piston bush could increase with the increase of working pressure resulting in the larger leakage an interesting thing to be noticed from fig 17 a is that the leakage changes from positive to negative with the increase of working pressure this is attributed to the fact that the poiseuille flow leakage flowing towards the case becomes more relevant than couette flow leakage flowing towards the piston chamber with the increase of working pressure however when the rotating speed increases the change of leakage is opposite as presented in fig 17 b this is because that as the speed increases couette flow which is link with piston velocity is higher that poiseuille flow ivantysynova and lasaar 2004 have found similar results besides it can be seen from figs 17 a 17 c and 17 e that the maximum leakage of the piston cylinder tribopair occurs at ϕ 180 when considering the influence of working pressure shaft speed gap size and sea surface temperature on the leakage moreover it should be noted in figs 17 d and 17 f that an increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness significantly increases the leakage calculated by ehd and has no effect on the leakage calculated by hd an interesting thing to be noticed that the maximum leakage occurs at about ϕ 45 this is due to the fact that the increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness significantly increases the deformation of the piston bush thus significant increasing the inclination of the piston as well as the poiseuille flow kumar and bergada 2013 also proved the similar point to quantitatively study the influence of working conditions and structural parameters on the leakage of the piston cylinder tribopair a representative shaft angle of 180 is selected for analysis due to the relatively large leakage as presented in fig 18 the ratio of ehd to hd is used to judge the influence of the deformation of the piston bush on the leakage when the gap size increases from 5 μm to 20 μm the leakage calculated by hd increases from 0 0051 l min to 0 33 l min and the leakage calculated by ehd increases from 0 017 l min to 0 45 l min correspondingly the volumetric efficiency loss of nine piston cylinder tribopairs increases from 0 036 to 2 3 calculated by hd and increases from 0 12 to 3 14 calculated by ehd the displacement of shapp is 86 ml r this shows that the increase of the gap size can make the poiseuille flow significantly larger than couette flow so the selection of gap size is very important for the sealing and lubricating performance of the piston cylinder tribopair another significant change was that the ratio of ehd to hd increased from 1 85 to 5 68 with the increase of sea depth from 1000 m to 5000 m and increased from 1 85 to 5 07 with the increase of piston bush thickness from 1 mm to 2 8 mm respectively this demonstrates that the increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness can significantly increase the deformation of the piston bush resulting in a larger gap size of piston cylinder tribopair 4 4 2 viscous friction power loss analysis fig 19 illustrates the viscous friction power loss under different operating conditions it can be clearly seen from figs 19 a to 19 c that the viscous friction power loss increases with the increase of working pressure 2 6 10 and 14 mpa shaft speed 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 rpm and gap size 5 10 15 and 20 μm during the delivery stroke the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd is larger than that calculated by hd under the same operating conditions and the change of the viscous friction power loss is more obvious with the increase of working pressure shaft rotational speed and gap size as expected there is no significant difference between the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd and hd in the suction stroke according to eq s 22 23 and 25 the viscous friction power loss is positively related to the pressure difference in piston cylinder tribopair so the higher pressure difference in delivery stroke could result to the larger viscous friction loss than that in suction stroke with the increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness as shown in fig 19 d and f the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd increases while the viscous friction power loss calculated by hd does not change this indicates that the flexible piston bush could have a great negative impact on the viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair with the increase of sea depth and the piston bush thickness besides it is shown in fig 19 e that the viscous friction power loss decreases with the increase of the sea surface temperatures 5 15 25 and 35 c this can be attributed to that the seawater viscosity and the friction force on the piston decrease with the increase of the sea surface temperature fig 20 presents the viscous friction power loss calculated by hd and ehd at ϕ 90 under different conditions similarly the ratio of ehd to hd is used to quantitatively analyze the influence of the piston bush deformation on the viscous friction power loss it can be clearly seen that the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd is greater than that calculated by hd at ϕ 90 under any working conditions as the sea surface temperature increases from 5 c to 35 c the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd decreases from 12 02 w to 10 89 w because of the slightly increase of seawater viscosity obviously with the change of shaft speed the change of viscous friction power loss is the largest when the shaft speed increases from 1000 rpm to 3000 rpm the viscous friction power loss calculated by hd and ehd increases from 7 15 w to 27 73 w and 8 35 w 30 15 w respectively this is because the increase of shaft speed directly increases the axial velocity of piston moreover the ratio of ehd to hd increased from 1 13 to 1 56 when the sea depth increased from 1000 m to 5000 m besides as the thickness of the piston bush increases from 1 μm to 2 8 μm the ratio of ehd to hd increases from 1 14 to 1 52 this means that under the same working conditions the changes in the sea depth and the piston bush thickness make the deformation of the piston bush have a greater impact on the viscous friction power loss also indicating that the elastic deformation of the piston bush influences the viscous friction force from the results obtained it can be found that the piston cylinder tribopair of shapp with higher working pressure piston bush thickness and sea depth could increase the piston bush deformation leakage and the friction power loss the results highlight the model potentials to be used as a guide for the optimization design of the piston cylinder tribopair in deep sea environment and provide suggestions for the optimal working conditions of shapps future developments of this study include importing the heat transfer on the interface in the piston cylinder tribopair model and the further verification of simulation results in the test 5 conclusions the transient two way fluid structure analysis was performed over one shaft revolution to capture the impact of the surface elastic deformation of the piston bush on water film performance and energy loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair the bearing mechanism of water film deformation characteristics of piston bush and energy loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair under the condition of hd and ehd are obtained the influences of working pressure shaft speed gap size sea surface temperature sea depth and piston bush thickness on the energy loss characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair are comparatively analyzed the following can be concluded 1 the dynamic pressure effect on the piston in the delivery stroke is obviously greater than that in suction stroke whether the deformation of the piston bush is considered or not the inclination of the piston increases gradually and reaches the maximum value at about ϕ 45 the water film pressure could produce a micron scale deformation of the piston bush the deformation of the piston bush not only increases the thickness of the water film but also increases the inclination of the piston in the cylinder which is unfavorable to the stability of the piston however the pressure field is mainly determined by the external load 2 the gap size is an extremely important design parameter for shapp when the initial gap size of piston cylinder tribopair is 10 μm there is no collision between the piston and the cylinder hole and local area of the piston cylinder tribopair undergo mixed lubrication with the piston bush thickness of 1 mm shaft speed of 1500 rpm working pressure of 14 mpa and sea depth of 1000 m 3 the deformation of the peek piston bush which have a negative effect on the lubrication and sealing performance of the piston cylinder tribopair not only increases the leakage but also increases the viscous friction power loss the gap size and shaft speed have the greatest influence on the leakage and friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair respectively under the same working conditions the changes in sea depth and piston bush thickness make a greater impact of the piston bush deformation on the leakage and viscous friction power loss credit authorship

21220,abstract seawater hydraulic axial piston pump shapp is a critical power component in underwater operating systems a parameterized elasto hydrodynamic ehd lubrication model of the piston cylinder tribopair in the shapp is originally established which considers the elasto hydrodynamic behavior viscosity temperature effect and deep sea environmental pressure the deformation of piston bush bearing mechanism and energy loss characteristics of the water film under different operating conditions are discussed the results show that the deformation of piston bush made of polyetheretherketone peek is in micron scale under water film and deep sea pressure which could increase the leakage and viscous friction power loss of piston cylinder tribopair in deep sea environment the leakage and viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd are always greater than those calculated by hydrodynamic hd and increase with the increase of working pressure shaft speed gap size sea depth and piston bush thickness besides the increase of sea surface temperature could increase the leakage and decrease the viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair respectively finally design

society s requirements on environmental protection sustainable development and safety in production water hydraulic transmission has caught attention as a renascent technique and has become one of the research hotspots in the field of fluid transmission and control because of its outstanding characteristics of flame retardancy greenness cleanliness and energy saving during the past two or three decades lim et al 2003 yang and pan 2015 yin et al 2016 2018 the seawater lubricated hydraulic transmission is a fluid transmission method that uses filtered seawater without any auxiliary components as the energy conversion transmission and control medium which has been widely used in ocean engineering deep underwater apparatus underwater tool systems seawater reverse osmosis desalination projects and so on liu et al 2017a b wu et al 2017 shapp is one of the key power components in seawater hydraulic systems as shown in fig 1 it is environmentally friendly and has high efficiency which can work in the open circuit seawater hydraulic transmission systems with the function of pressure self compensation zhang et al 2018 there are three key tribopairs namely slipper swashplate tribopair piston cylinder tribopair and valve port plate tribopair in shapp the piton cylinder tribopair which is the key factor to determine the efficiency performance and the main weak link to affect the reliability and service life of the shapp is a crucial tribopair to complete the water suction and delivery function particularly the piston cylinder tribopair is the only tribopair that cannot achieve hydrostatic support in the shapp and its load carrying capacity can only be achieved by hydrodynamic effects while the piston cylinder tribopair carries a huge external load force it plays an important role in sealing the high pressure water in the piston chamber and it is also one of the main power loss sources of the shapp the huge external load force could generate high pressure acting on the surface of the piston and piston bush which can lead to elastic deformation of the surface this elastic deformation would change the thickness and pressure distribution of the seawater film in the piston cylinder tribopair therefore it is a dynamic process of reciprocating cycle and interaction until the film pressure field and the elastic deformation of the tribopair surface reach a dynamic equilibrium state ye et al 2019 this is the so called fluid structure coupling effect in the piston cylinder tribopair moreover due to the existence of deep sea pressure the effect of fluid structure interaction on the lubrication bearing mechanism and energy consumption characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair could be more obvious therefore it is necessary to establish the ehd model to study the lubrication characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair in deep sea environment scholars have conducted a series of studies to reveal the lubrication mechanism of the piston cylinder tribopair in traditional oil hydraulic axial piston pumps and combustion engines zhang et al 2016 optimized the shape of piston ring faces using the inverse method kumar and bergada 2013 developed a finite volume method fvm based reynolds equation model for the piston cylinder tribopair which considers the piston eccentricity and the relative tangential movement between piston and cylinder block and the effect of different piston grooves configurations on the pressure distribution leakage force and cavitation of piston cylinder tribopair has been investigated zavos and nikolakopoulos 2015 numerically investigated the hydrodynamic lubrication characteristics of piston ring cylinder tribopair using a fluid structural algorithm wang et al 2018 proposed a mathematical model considering the structure piston motion and piston dynamic load to predict the oil film thickness and verified by experiments jiang et al 2018 studied the working efficiency and reliability of the piston cylinder tribopair in the radial piston pump by calculating the shape and pressure distribution ma et al 2018 2019 established the transient hydrodynamic lubrication model of the piston cylinder interface with variable length and discussed the influence of cylinder length clearance and piston texture design schemes on piston force and friction force of the axial piston pump xu et al 2013 investigated the radial micro motion and pressure distribution of the piston cylinder tribopair by considering the influences of roughness elastic deformation of piston and pressure viscosity effect liu et al 2016 2017 numerically analyzed the deformation of the piston bush and rear front sliding bearings of seawater hydraulic axial piston motor and the dynamic performance of seawater hydraulic relief valve in the deep sea environment by ansys workbench similarly the leakage performance of piston swiveling cylinder pair considering one way fluid structure interaction in high water based hydraulic motor has been reported zhao et al 2020 lu et al 2018 established a mixed lubrication model to investigate the tribological properties of the compression ring cylinder tribopair under cylinder deactivation jiang et al 2019 presented a comprehensive multi domain simulation tool that could predict the lubricating flow between piston and bush and the influence of the thickness of the piston bush on the leakage and friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair was investigated meng et al 2007 studied the influence of oil film inertia forces on thermo elasto hydrodynamic tehd lubrication properties of a piston skirt in combustion engine tang et al 2017 developed a novel tehd lubrication model for slipper tribopair in axial piston pump and investigated the effects of working conditions and slipper structure parameters on tehd lubrication performance such as film thickness pressure temperature and leakage flow rate li et al 2017 and ji 2018 proposed a novel and effective thermal fluid structure coupling model of valve plate pair in an axial piston pump with high pressure and high speed qian et al 2017 presented a thermal fluid structure interaction model that can simulate the complex phenomena taking place at the piston cylinder interface and discussed the impacts of pressure induced and thermal elastic deformations of the structure parameters on the leakage the numerical calculated leakage rates showed good agreement with the experimental results however the tilt of the piston is not considered in the model gels and murrenhoff 2014 created a simulation tool to numerically compute the reynolds equation for the lubricating film of the contoured piston cylinder tribopair in axial piston pump besides fluid structure and thermal interaction model has been developed to study the heat transfer and thermal elastic deformation characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair in oil axial piston pumps and a novel temperature adaptive piston design was proposed pelosi and ivantysynova 2012a 2012b shang and ivantysynova 2016 generally the piston and cylinder are made of stainless steel after heat treatment and the piston bush is usually made of high performance engineering plastics peek to improve the friction performance and prevent seawater corrosion the deformation of the piston bush in piston cylinder tribopair directly affects its bearing capacity lubrication characteristics and energy loss characteristics in addition this effect is particularly obvious in the deep sea environment most of the previous studies have focused on oil lubricated piston pumps and combustion engine whereas the analysis of the lubrication characteristics in the open shapps is relatively less besides the ehd lubrication model of piston cylinder tribopair considering the ocean environment has not been studied in this paper a novel ehd lubrication model considering the ocean environment and two way fluid structure interaction of the piston cylinder tribopair in the open shapp was developed and solved accurately based on fvm and finite element method fem theory the effects of working pressure shaft speed gap size sea depth sea surface temperature and piston bush thickness on the piston bush deformation lubrication and bearing mechanism of water film and energy loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair are investigated 2 mathematical model 2 1 ocean environment model 2 1 1 deep sea pressure in a deep sea environment the pressure of seawater varies with the sea depths which can be expressed as gill 1982 1 p h p 0 ρ h g h 1 2 ρ h v m 2 1 v s v m 2 p 0 ρ h g h h 1000 7000 where p 0 is the atmospheric pressure ρ h 1050 kg m3 is the seawater density g is gravity acceleration h is the sea depth v s is the velocity of seawater at sea depth h v m is the velocity of underwater equipment relative to seawater 2 1 2 seawater temperature generally the temperature of the seawater varies from 0 to 35 c and the average annual temperature of seawater in half of the waters is above 20 c however in the deep sea environment due to the weakening of light and the fluctuation of current the seawater temperature decreases unevenly with the increase of depth and the relationship between seawater temperature and sea depth can be described as griffies 2004 2 t h h 1 96 10 8 h 3 1 02 10 4 h 2 2 29 10 3 28 17 h 0 430 9337 h 1 155 0 5226 h 430 7000 where t h is the seawater temperature at the sea depth of h 2 1 3 seawater viscosity in deep sea environment it is known that the viscosity of seawater is affected by temperature and pressure riisgard and larsen 2007 fitted the experimental data and found that when the temperature of seawater was 0 35 c the viscosity variation of standard seawater salinity 35 with the depth of seawater could be expressed as 3 μ s w h t μ s w 0 e λ s w t δ μ s w where μ s w 0 1 89 10 3 pa s is the atmospheric seawater viscosity when the salinity of seawater is 35 and the viscosity temperature coefficient λ s w of seawater with a salinity of 35 is 1 38 7 at the temperature of 0 35 c 4 δ μ s w p h 10 4 10 13 a 1 a 2 t a 3 t 2 p h 10 4 10 13 a 4 a 5 t a 6 t 2 where p h is seawater pressure at sea depth of h a 1 1 8266 10 8 a 2 1 3817 10 9 a 3 2 6362 10 11 a 4 9 8965 10 13 a 5 6 325 10 14 a 6 1 2115 10 15 because of the great difference of seawater temperature in different waters and seasons the seawater viscosity is obviously different however in the deep sea environment the viscosity of seawater is mainly affected by the sea depth 2 2 dynamics model of the piston cylinder tribopair fig 2 shows the trajectory of the piston head center it is described that the reciprocating movement of the piston relative to the cylinder along the cylinder axis and the rotational movement of the slipper together with the cylinder act as two main movements assuming that the top dead center of the piston trajectory is the initial position two left hand coordinate systems are defined the coordinate system x y z is a global coordinate system whose origin is located at the point of intersection between the centerline of the cylinder block and the particular plane passing through the center of all piston head centers as the cylinder rotates the piston head center moved from point a to point b the coordinates of the piston head center can be expressed as 5 x y z r b sin ϕ r b cos ϕ r b cos ϕ tan β where r b is the piston pitch radius ϕ is the shaft angle ω is the angular speed of the cylinder block and β is the swashplate angle the rotational velocity around cylinder axis u p axial velocity v p and axial acceleration a p of pistons assembly are 6 u p ω r b v p d z d t ω r b tan β sin ϕ a p d v d t ω 2 r b tan β cos ϕ the water film characteristics in the piston cylinder tribopair was affected by the forces acting on the piston to derive the force acting on the piston a left handed coordinate system x p y p z p rotating with the cylinder is established in fig 3 the coordinate system rotates with the cylinder block so that the z p axis always coincides with the cylinder hole axis and the y p axis is always directed radially outward the origin of the coordinate system is always on the ball head side of the piston bush the displacement pressure force f p c can be expressed as 7 f p c π d p 2 p p c p c a s e 4 where d p is the piston outer diameter p p c is the pressure in the piston chamber and p c a s e is the case drain pressure as shown in fig 4 the pressure in the piston chamber changes with the rotation of the cylinder block liu et al 2017a b the periodic change of displacement pressure will lead to the oscillation of the load acting on the piston the inertia force of the piston slipper assembly f ap can be described as 8 f a p m s p a p m s m p r b ω 2 tan β cos φ where m s p is the mass of the piston slipper assembly m s is the slipper mass and m p is the piston mass as illustrated in fig 5 when the flow state of the water film in the piston cylinder tribopair is laminar flow the viscous friction force between piston and piston bush can be calculated as 9 f f p v a μ v p h p p y ˆ h p 2 d a 10 f f p u a μ u p h p p x ˆ h p 2 d a where f f p v is axial viscous friction force f f p u is circumferential viscous friction force p is the pressure of the water film μ is the viscosity of seawater h p is the thickness of the water film r p is the radius of piston the centrifugal force of the piston slipper assembly f ω p is given by 11 f ω p m s m p ω 2 r b the viscous friction force between the slipper and the swashplate

gap between the piston and the piston bush is about 10 μm which is far less than the piston radius for the convenience of calculation the cut surface of the piston can be regarded as a circle mathematically the shaft eccentricity vector e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 is used to determine the thickness value of water film between the piston and piston bush at each point in the fluid domain where e 1 e 2 is the eccentricity vector of piston axis close to the ball head of the piston and e 3 e 4 is the eccentricity vector of the piston axis close to the piston chamber in fig 6 the main geometric parameters for defining the water film thickness equation are depicted the projection of piston axis on the plane x p z p and the plane y p z p can be described as 18 x p z p z p e 3 e 1 l b e 1 y p z p z p e 4 e 2 l b e 2 the coordinates of the piston axis on any x p y p section are obtained through the above analysis then the expression of the water film thickness of the piston cylinder tribopair can be obtained by the following trigonometric equation 19 h z p φ p r c cos φ p e 3 e 1 l b z p e 1 2 r c sin φ p e 4 e 2 l b z p e 2 2 r p δ h where δh represents the elastic deformation of the piston bush surface which will be discussed later similarly the normal extrusion velocity field can be defined as a function of time derivative vector e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 of piston eccentricity 20 h z p φ

equation to study the ehd lubrication characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair in the shapp reynolds equation must be written with reference to the clearance of water film as shown in fig 7 the pressure distribution in the lubricating gap can be determined by solving the reynolds equation as the shapps were usually used in open circuit deep seawater hydraulic systems the piston cylinder tribopair has good heat exchange conditions and the temperature rise can be neglected liu et al 2017a b wu et al 2017 due to the small pressure gradient in the thickness direction it is reasonable to solve the two dimensional reynolds equation to obtain the pressure field of water film ma et al 2018 pelosi and ivantysynova 2012b the water film thickness of the piston cylinder tribopair differs greatly from the length and radius of the piston besides the structured grid was used to conveniently solve the fluid pressure field of the piston cylinder tribopair therefore the cylindrical thickness field can be expanded into a rectangular thickness field with length 2πr p and width l b as shown in fig 5 a finally the two dimensional transient reynolds equation for an incompressible newtonian fluid in the left handed coordinate system can be expressed as 21 x ˆ h 3 μ p x ˆ y ˆ h 3 μ p y ˆ 6 ω p r p h x ˆ v p h y ˆ 2 h t where ω p is the piston rotation speed and r p is the piston radius 2 3 3 energy consumption characteristics the energy loss of the shapp mainly comes from the leakage and viscous friction power loss in the tribopairs to obtain the leakage and viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair the stress field and velocity field of the water film should be calculated the stress field and the velocity field of the water film in the coordinate

of the piston cylinder tribopair q pc can be calculated by integrating the axial velocity v ˆ of the fluid along any section of the gap between the piston and piston bush the leakage and viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair are defined as follows 24 q p c 0 2 π r p 0 h p v ˆ d x ˆ d z ˆ 25 p f f f p v v p 2 4 solids finite element elastic deformation model since the elastic modulus of peek is much smaller than that of steel the deformation of piston and cylinder can be almost ignored and the water film thickness in the gap is only affected by the deformation of the piston bush the material properties of peek are assumed to be linear piecewise interpolation functions of pressure liu et al 2017a b wang et al 1997 the force governing equation is solved and the constraint conditions are introduced to obtain the deformation of the piston bush in this study the fem was used to calculate the deformation of the piston bush 26 u k 1 f where k is the global stiffness matrix and f is the external force acting on the piston bush as shown in fig 7 the elastic deformation of the solid bodies is analyzed for one single element and then extended to the rest of the numerical domain 3 numerical method to reveal the ehd characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair the sequential coupled field method was used to solve the fluid pressure field of the water film and the elastic deformation of the piston bush two dimensional finite volume hydrodynamic model with structured grid were adopted to study the pressure field of water film in the gap as shown in the upper part of fig 7 the elastic deformation of the piston bush is solved by a three dimensional finite element elastic mechanics model with hexahedral mesh as shown in the lower part of fig 7 the finite element mesh of the solid field fixed on the cylinder rotates with the cylinder and the fluid domain mesh fixed on the piston surface changes with the movement of the piston these two grid systems dynamically interact with each other 3 1 water film finite volume isothermal flow model as eq 21 is an elliptic partial differential equation and cannot find the analytical solution the fvm is used to solve the problem the piston sub value domain is discretized and subdivided into a finite number of discrete grids and each grid is sufficiently small that the pressure values in each unit are linearly changed or equal referring to fig 7 the control volume centered on node p is selected which has four boundaries the cell has a height of δ x ˆ and a width of δ y ˆ the four faces separating the central control volume from its adjacent control volume which are centered on nodes n s w and e are labeled n s w and e as illustrated in fig 7 the reynolds equation is integrated in the control volume of the fluid domain which can be represented as 27 δ v x ˆ h 3 μ p x ˆ d v δ v y ˆ h 3 μ p y ˆ d v δ v 6 ω p r p h x ˆ v p h y ˆ 2 h t d v 0 3 1 1 discrete equations of internal nodes 28 h n 3

calculation method the control volume linear algebraic pressure equation expressed by eq 30 is extended to the entire numerical domain and a linear algebraic system that can be solved numerically is

equation this iterative procedure employs a guess and correct philosophy which progressively improves the guessed solution by repeated application of the discrete equation in this solution the over

system the jacobian matrix is constructed by the difference scheme in the form of 39 f i e e j 1 e h f i e 1 e j e 4 f i e 1 e j e h e 4 where i 1 2 3 4 j 1 2 3 4 and e h 10 9 is the step size which should be as small as possible to ensure the accuracy of the solution 3 2 elastic deformation of the piston bush as the shapp is completely submerged in the deep sea environment and working in high pressure condition the piston bush as presented in fig 8 is affected by the water film pressure the displacement pressure and the environmental pressure moreover due to the rotation of the cylinder block the piston cylinder interface is constantly changing the action range of the water film pressure on the piston bush and the displacement pressure changes simultaneously the size of the piston bush mesh corresponding to the water film mesh changes at the same time in the axial direction so this link will be built on every angle step therefore the ansys parametric design language apdl is used to solve the deformation problem of piston bush with variable contact length based on the analysis in section 2 4 the deformation of the piston bush can be assumed to be linear elasticity the density young s modulus and poisson s ratio of peek are 1310 kg m3 4200 mpa and 0 4 respectively according to the real working condition of the shapp the water film pressure field delivery pressure and deep sea environmental pressure are loaded on the corresponding surface of the piston bush as shown in fig 9 3 3 a complete two way numerical fluid structure coupling flow the complete transient two way fluid structure coupling numerical model captures the impact of the piston macro and micro motion fluid and material properties deep sea environmental pressure and surface elastic deformation on the pressure and thickness distributions of the piston cylinder tribopair the model couples iteratively different numerical domains and solution schemes as shown in fig 10 two main different numerical environments were defined in the process of solution the link between fluid and solid mesh is established dynamically a closed loop is established to realize the two way coupling of flow field and structure field on the one hand the pressure calculated by fluid mesh should be transferred to solid mesh on the other hand the deformation calculated by solid mesh is transferred to fluid mesh to solve reynolds equation with deformed gap height the convergence of external load is regarded as the termination condition when the external load converges the micro velocity of piston is modified and the water film thickness is updated at the next moment the typical time step of piston cylinder fully coupled simulation corresponds to δϕ 0 25 so 1440 simulation points are used in one shaft revolution this scheme repeats itself until the end of one shaft revolution fig 7 shows the process of the linking of fluid and solid mesh the fluid mesh is staggered with the solid mesh for the solid mesh element selected in fig 7 the pressure of the node p is transferred to the center of solid mesh cell and after calculating the deformation of the piston bush the deformation of the four nodes on the selected solid mesh cell is transferred to the node p of the fluid mesh besides the fluid and solid mesh changes along with the rotation of shaft so this link will be built on every angle step the proposed model can be used to analyze the transient ehd lubrication characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair during an entire shaft revolution in deep sea environment based on the dynamic interaction of matlab and apdl numerical calculation results of fluid and structure can be obtained the main structural parameters and initial operating conditions are listed in table 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation and grid independency test to validate the correctness of the model the results given by the analytical expression provided by eq s 39 and 40 munson et al 2013 were compared with our calculation results the proposed transient model was simplified to a steady state one without considering the inclination of the piston fig 11 illustrates the leakage and the viscous friction power loss of piston cylinder tribopair in one shaft revolution without considering the tilt effect of piston and comparison between numerical and analytical results under p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m fig 11 shows a good agreement between the numerical and analytical results verifying the accuracy of the proposed model 40 q p c 2 π r p h 3 d p 12 μ l b π r p h v p 41 p f p v 2 π l b r p v p d p h 2 l b μ v p h for the hd and ehd model created a staggered type grid with two directions x ˆ y ˆ was selected grid independency was tested on two different grid sizes 40 60 and 80 120 fig 12 presents the resulting pressure distribution under p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m at ϕ 45 it can be concluded from fig 12 that solution is independent of the grid size and therefore a common grid size 40 60 is selected for the rest of the numerical simulation in the present work 4 2 water film performance 4 2 1 water film bearing mechanism fig 13 represents the simulated thickness distribution and the projection of the thickness field on the plane x ˆ y ˆ in the gap calculated by hd and ehd at ϕ 90 and 270 under p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m these particular shaft angles have been selected because the piston is working in delivery and suction strokes respectively and the sliding velocity is at its maximum and therefore the dynamic pressure effect is expected to be at its highest level the x ˆ axis and y ˆ axis represent the circumferential and axial direction of the water film respectively it is clear from fig 13 that the distributions of water film thickness calculated by ehd and hd show waveform in the fluid film area this reflects that the piston needs to adjust its eccentric posture in the cylinder to produce a squeezing force and a dynamic pressure of suitable strength to balance the external load at the current moment notice as well in fig s 13 a 13 d that the distributions of water film thickness are non uniform in the delivery stroke which means that the piston is inclined in the cylinder block in the water suction stroke ϕ 270 the thickness of the water film is relatively uniform which means that the piston does not have a large inclination in the cylinder block as expected the water film thickness calculated by ehd varies much larger than hd indicating that the deformation of the piston bush could aggravate the inclination of piston as shown in fig 13 e there is a significant difference in the film thickness between the ehd results and the hd results in the delivery stroke ϕ 90 while this difference is relatively low in the suction stroke which mainly caused by the deep sea environmental pressure as presented in fig 13 f therefore the deformation of the piston bush could increase the swing amplitude and instability of the piston similar to the thickness field the pressure field of water film also presents a waveform in the fluid domain as illustrated in fig s 14 a and 14 c the maximum pressure calculated by hd and ehd are 26 14 mpa and 26 17 mpa in the delivery stroke respectively fig s 14 e and 14 f show the water film pressure field calculated by ehd and hd has no significant difference the explanation for this is that the film pressure is mainly determined by the external load it must be pointed out that due to the existence of dynamic pressure effect the peak pressure of the film is greater than the sum of working pressure and environmental pressure of 24 mpa under the premise of subtracting the working pressure and environmental pressure the maximum dynamic pressure of the water film calculated by hd and ehd in the delivery stroke is 2 14 mpa and 2 17 mpa respectively while the maximum dynamic pressure of the water film is both 0 39 mpa in the suction stroke calculated by hd and ehd as presented in figs 14 b and 14 d therefore the effect of dynamic pressure on the piston in the delivery stroke is greater than that in the suction stroke similar results have been presented by pelosi and ivantysynova 2012a 2012b 4 2 2 piston attitude analysis the minimum thickness determines the lubrication performance of the piston cylinder tribopair and can also indirectly measure the inclination of the piston fig 15 represents the simulated minimum thickness maximum pressure piston axis trajectory and piston bush deformation at p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m it can be noticed from fig 15 a that minimum thickness decreases at first reaching the minimum value of 0 8 μm at about ϕ 45 and then increases to its maximum value at ϕ 225 because the minimum water film thickness is less than 3 μm at about ϕ 45 the piston cylinder tribopair underwent a mixed lubrication bhushan 2013 it is shown in fig 15 b that the maximum water film pressures calculated by hd and ehd are almost the same fig 15 c illustrates the trajectory of the axes on both sides of the piston the blue dotted line calculated by hd is the trajectory of the intersection point of piston axis and x p y p plane while the blue solid line calculated by hd is the trajectory axis end of piston in one shaft revolution the red line calculated by ehd is the trajectory of piston axis under the same working condition points a b a and b in fig 15 c indicate the position of piston axis in x p y p plane at ϕ 45 so the length of line ab indicates the inclination of the piston in the cylinder the inclination of the piston first increases reaching the maximum at about ϕ 45 and then decreases slowly however the inclination of the piston does not change much due to the absence of the delivery pressure in the suction stroke which means the inclination of piston in the delivery stroke is far greater than that in the suction stroke as presented in fig 15 d the minimum and maximum deformation calculated by ehd is 0 9 μm and 3 75 μm respectively in other words the deformation of the piston bush is the same order of magnitude as the water film thickness which increases the water film thickness and has a significant impact on the lubrication performance of the piston cylinder tribopair although the deformation of the piston bush will affect the water film thickness and inclination of the piston the minimum water film thickness is always positive therefore it can be concluded from fig 15 that there is no collision between piston and cylinder block at p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m which indicates that the water film can withstand the change of external load 4 3 deformation of piston bush fig 16 shows the deformation distribution of piston bush with different shaft angles at p pc 14 mpa c b 10 μm n 1500 rpm w b 1 mm and h 1000 m as expected the changing trend and law of piston bush deformation are basically consistent with the pressure field of the water film indicating that the deformation of the piston bush is positively related to the pressure of the water film during the delivery stroke when the piston cylinder tribopair is subjected to heavy oscillating load it can be noticed that the increase in the elastic deformation of the piston bush surface is reflected by the increase of the water film thickness it has to be noticed from fig 16 that the piston bush shows obvious nonlinearity with the application of non uniform pressure field in the delivery stroke combined with fig 16 b and c it is found that the piston bush has the largest deformation of 3 75 μm at ϕ 45 and the water film in the region of local high elasto hydrodynamic pressure is more obvious due to the greater inclination of the piston the unevenness of the pressure field and the deformation of the piston is more obvious another thing to be noticed from fig 16 b that the position of deformed piston bush has changed and the deformation has occurred over a larger area moreover figs 16 d 16 f show that the surface elastic deformation in suction stroke is lower than that in the delivery stroke which corresponds to the lower elasto hydrodynamic pressure however due to the existence of the deep sea environmental pressure the piston bush is still deformed and the deformation of the piston bush is mainly distributed with a value of 1 3 μm as shown in figs 16 a 16 e and 16 f as a result the hydrodynamic pressure could lead to the elastic surface deformation and increase the thickness of the water film 4 4 energy loss characteristics to provide a theoretical guidance for the design of the piston cylinder tribopair in the shapp the sensitivity analysis of leakage flow and power loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair was presented by changing factors such as working pressure shaft speed gap size sea depth sea surface temperature and piston bush thickness as listed in table 2 in particular when studying the influence of the sea surface temperature t 0 in different waters on the leakage and viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair the sea depth is set to 0 m 4 4 1 leakage analysis fig 17 shows the leakage calculated by hd and ehd versus shaft angle under different operating and structural parameters it is expected in fig 17 a that the increase of working pressure could obviously increase the leakage and the leakage of the piston cylinder tribopair considering the elastic deformation ehd of piston bush is larger than that without elastic deformation hd of piston bush in the delivery stroke however there is little difference between the leakage calculated by ehd and hd in the suction stroke it can be explained that the deformation of the peek piston bush could increase with the increase of working pressure resulting in the larger leakage an interesting thing to be noticed from fig 17 a is that the leakage changes from positive to negative with the increase of working pressure this is attributed to the fact that the poiseuille flow leakage flowing towards the case becomes more relevant than couette flow leakage flowing towards the piston chamber with the increase of working pressure however when the rotating speed increases the change of leakage is opposite as presented in fig 17 b this is because that as the speed increases couette flow which is link with piston velocity is higher that poiseuille flow ivantysynova and lasaar 2004 have found similar results besides it can be seen from figs 17 a 17 c and 17 e that the maximum leakage of the piston cylinder tribopair occurs at ϕ 180 when considering the influence of working pressure shaft speed gap size and sea surface temperature on the leakage moreover it should be noted in figs 17 d and 17 f that an increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness significantly increases the leakage calculated by ehd and has no effect on the leakage calculated by hd an interesting thing to be noticed that the maximum leakage occurs at about ϕ 45 this is due to the fact that the increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness significantly increases the deformation of the piston bush thus significant increasing the inclination of the piston as well as the poiseuille flow kumar and bergada 2013 also proved the similar point to quantitatively study the influence of working conditions and structural parameters on the leakage of the piston cylinder tribopair a representative shaft angle of 180 is selected for analysis due to the relatively large leakage as presented in fig 18 the ratio of ehd to hd is used to judge the influence of the deformation of the piston bush on the leakage when the gap size increases from 5 μm to 20 μm the leakage calculated by hd increases from 0 0051 l min to 0 33 l min and the leakage calculated by ehd increases from 0 017 l min to 0 45 l min correspondingly the volumetric efficiency loss of nine piston cylinder tribopairs increases from 0 036 to 2 3 calculated by hd and increases from 0 12 to 3 14 calculated by ehd the displacement of shapp is 86 ml r this shows that the increase of the gap size can make the poiseuille flow significantly larger than couette flow so the selection of gap size is very important for the sealing and lubricating performance of the piston cylinder tribopair another significant change was that the ratio of ehd to hd increased from 1 85 to 5 68 with the increase of sea depth from 1000 m to 5000 m and increased from 1 85 to 5 07 with the increase of piston bush thickness from 1 mm to 2 8 mm respectively this demonstrates that the increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness can significantly increase the deformation of the piston bush resulting in a larger gap size of piston cylinder tribopair 4 4 2 viscous friction power loss analysis fig 19 illustrates the viscous friction power loss under different operating conditions it can be clearly seen from figs 19 a to 19 c that the viscous friction power loss increases with the increase of working pressure 2 6 10 and 14 mpa shaft speed 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 rpm and gap size 5 10 15 and 20 μm during the delivery stroke the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd is larger than that calculated by hd under the same operating conditions and the change of the viscous friction power loss is more obvious with the increase of working pressure shaft rotational speed and gap size as expected there is no significant difference between the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd and hd in the suction stroke according to eq s 22 23 and 25 the viscous friction power loss is positively related to the pressure difference in piston cylinder tribopair so the higher pressure difference in delivery stroke could result to the larger viscous friction loss than that in suction stroke with the increase of the sea depth and the piston bush thickness as shown in fig 19 d and f the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd increases while the viscous friction power loss calculated by hd does not change this indicates that the flexible piston bush could have a great negative impact on the viscous friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair with the increase of sea depth and the piston bush thickness besides it is shown in fig 19 e that the viscous friction power loss decreases with the increase of the sea surface temperatures 5 15 25 and 35 c this can be attributed to that the seawater viscosity and the friction force on the piston decrease with the increase of the sea surface temperature fig 20 presents the viscous friction power loss calculated by hd and ehd at ϕ 90 under different conditions similarly the ratio of ehd to hd is used to quantitatively analyze the influence of the piston bush deformation on the viscous friction power loss it can be clearly seen that the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd is greater than that calculated by hd at ϕ 90 under any working conditions as the sea surface temperature increases from 5 c to 35 c the viscous friction power loss calculated by ehd decreases from 12 02 w to 10 89 w because of the slightly increase of seawater viscosity obviously with the change of shaft speed the change of viscous friction power loss is the largest when the shaft speed increases from 1000 rpm to 3000 rpm the viscous friction power loss calculated by hd and ehd increases from 7 15 w to 27 73 w and 8 35 w 30 15 w respectively this is because the increase of shaft speed directly increases the axial velocity of piston moreover the ratio of ehd to hd increased from 1 13 to 1 56 when the sea depth increased from 1000 m to 5000 m besides as the thickness of the piston bush increases from 1 μm to 2 8 μm the ratio of ehd to hd increases from 1 14 to 1 52 this means that under the same working conditions the changes in the sea depth and the piston bush thickness make the deformation of the piston bush have a greater impact on the viscous friction power loss also indicating that the elastic deformation of the piston bush influences the viscous friction force from the results obtained it can be found that the piston cylinder tribopair of shapp with higher working pressure piston bush thickness and sea depth could increase the piston bush deformation leakage and the friction power loss the results highlight the model potentials to be used as a guide for the optimization design of the piston cylinder tribopair in deep sea environment and provide suggestions for the optimal working conditions of shapps future developments of this study include importing the heat transfer on the interface in the piston cylinder tribopair model and the further verification of simulation results in the test 5 conclusions the transient two way fluid structure analysis was performed over one shaft revolution to capture the impact of the surface elastic deformation of the piston bush on water film performance and energy loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair the bearing mechanism of water film deformation characteristics of piston bush and energy loss characteristics of the piston cylinder tribopair under the condition of hd and ehd are obtained the influences of working pressure shaft speed gap size sea surface temperature sea depth and piston bush thickness on the energy loss characteristics of piston cylinder tribopair are comparatively analyzed the following can be concluded 1 the dynamic pressure effect on the piston in the delivery stroke is obviously greater than that in suction stroke whether the deformation of the piston bush is considered or not the inclination of the piston increases gradually and reaches the maximum value at about ϕ 45 the water film pressure could produce a micron scale deformation of the piston bush the deformation of the piston bush not only increases the thickness of the water film but also increases the inclination of the piston in the cylinder which is unfavorable to the stability of the piston however the pressure field is mainly determined by the external load 2 the gap size is an extremely important design parameter for shapp when the initial gap size of piston cylinder tribopair is 10 μm there is no collision between the piston and the cylinder hole and local area of the piston cylinder tribopair undergo mixed lubrication with the piston bush thickness of 1 mm shaft speed of 1500 rpm working pressure of 14 mpa and sea depth of 1000 m 3 the deformation of the peek piston bush which have a negative effect on the lubrication and sealing performance of the piston cylinder tribopair not only increases the leakage but also increases the viscous friction power loss the gap size and shaft speed have the greatest influence on the leakage and friction power loss of the piston cylinder tribopair respectively under the same working conditions the changes in sea depth and piston bush thickness make a greater impact of the piston bush deformation on the leakage and viscous friction power loss credit authorship

21221,analyzing maritime accidents plays a key role in improving maritime safety and raising environmental awareness the functional resonance analysis model fram describes a structure to provide a system for achieving the aims of accident analysis this paper considers the application of fram for qualitative risk analysis of shipping operations the prestige oil spill an environmental catastrophe that caused a great amount of oil spill is analyzed by using the aforementioned method through the results of the analysis the variabilities of events underlying the accident are tried to be determined and suggestions to examine them are provided the essence of having a consistent opinion on the operation of the system and the fact that fram is an integral part for enhancing the risk analysis of the ship accidents were found out based on the results of the study keywords fram prestige maritime accident oil spill safety 1 introduction today more than eighty percent of the products around the world are carried by ships therefore maritime transport is at the very center of global trade production and supply unctad 2019 there have been numerous ship accidents and unknown damages chen et al 2017a b because more than 50 000 ships have been used in international commerce daily chen and yahalom 2013 for the intense maritime shipping network therefore the focus for the global transportation industry is the safety of seas chen et al 2019 the environment for the maritime transportation operations generally has challenging conditions in order to ensure a reliable navigation system for the national and international maritime transportation operations authorities did their utmost effort within the last decade according to akten 2006 despite increasing safety standards and improved technology shipping has still many risks and that is how it will remain it is hard to minimize the ship accidents due to the tough conditions and risky nature of seas despite the safety regulations such as colreg 72 international regulations for preventing collisions at sea marpol 73 78 marine pollution solas 74 78 88 international convention for the safety of life at sea marpol 73 78 marine pollution and stcw 78 standards of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers celik et al 2010 chen et al 2014 fan et al 2020a maritime transportation by nature involves various hazards which may cause detrimental consequences luo and shin 2019 montewka et al 2014 akyuz et al 2020 the numerous ship accidents around the world cause loss of life and property and they are one of the biggest threats to the ocean environment qiao et al 2020 there are numerous shipping accidents by type however collision or contact foundering grounding capsize stranding breaking up and fire or explosion are among the common examples of shipping accidents abbassi et al 2017 akten 2006 baalisampang et al 2018 more precisely human factors technical and mechanical deficiencies and environmental conditions are the major causes of maritime accidents celik et al 2010 stated that different prospects of continuing shipping accidents are complication and automation of the system human error potential design based failures and human centered system design it is also recognized that the main driving forces to maritime accidents involve working condition organisation and navigational environment garcía herrero et al 2012 today today s ships have sophisticated technologies such as onboard information electronic navigation means and bridge resource management systems nevertheless human factor is yet the main tool to reveal maritime accidents fan et al 2020b in general compared to the researches and arrangements in other methods of transportation such as air transport or railroad human factors were taken into consideration by the international maritime organisation imo much later schroder hinrichs et al 2011 statistically human failures mistakes are the reason of 80 percent of maritime accidents for this reason they have an essential role in preventing accidents trucco et al 2008 tzannatos 2010 fan et al 2018 in maritime accidents human factors are generally related with conditions of workplace natural and physical environment technology organisation procedures training management and also individual causes such as tiredness work load and psychological state psarros 2015 human factors are generally considered as the main reason when anything goes wrong at sea fan et al 2020b since there is a discrepancy among the opinions regarding accident analysis no agreement regarding the statistical aspect on the causes of the maritime accidents has been reached therefore the maritime authorities have been focusing on avoiding maritime accidents celik et al 2010 marine accidents are complex by their nature and this complexity is not caused by one single factor kristiansen 2013 jin et al 2002 hetherington et al 2006 thus an effective analysis of the combination of factors that cause a specific accident becomes difficult therefore compared to the number of accidents the increase of studies on maritime safety and resultant progress in the literature are fairly slow soner et al 2015 coraddu et al 2020 avoiding maritime accidents and ensuring a safe and reliable seaway are among the most important research subjects within the literature studies that have been conducted previously to find out the causes of the maritime accidents through gathering numerous accidents to discover causal accident patterns for example zhang et al 2018 puisa et al 2018 bye and aalberg 2018 yet it has been discussed with the recent improvements in accident causation current thinking hollnagel 2012 2013 tian et al 2016 smith 2019 kulkarni et al 2020 that it is necessary to evaluate the accidents by focusing on the factors of the system function performance to discover the accidents that will support the effort to formulize the success mechanism within a specific environment a rising concern to maritime authorities the shipping sector and community is the ship safety which indicates the significance of maritime risk assessment huang et al 2019 high risk is represented by each operation carried out on board ships risk factor has to be minimized to a tolerable level to enhance maritime safety at sea goerlandt and montewka 2015 risk assessment has an important role to improve safety in maritime industry akyuz et al 2020 risk analysis is an effective way of devising mitigation measures that avoid accidents a great number of studies on maritime transportation risk have been conducted including qualitative assessments and quantitative evaluations on a global scale zhou et al 2020 various analysis methods and models have been created that support performing risk assessments selecting the correct method or group of methods for the current situation is the key to a successful risk analysis lim et al 2018 qualitative techniques to assess frequency and consequence are adequate to perform the risk assessment after the hazards are determined for some cases however a more detailed quantitative analysis is necessary for some other cases compared with quantitative research more detailed focused and complementary observations are provided by qualitative research by analysing small samples therefore qualitative research provides a comprehensive view of the research topic and related comments and also promotes the production of information or knowledge for further research chang et al 2020 possibilities and consequences are fully determined qualitatively in qualitative risk analysis the main risk assessment type is qualitative assessment in which nominal or ordinal scales are used to categorize the potential risks fram root cause analysis failure modes and effects analysis fmea delphi technique risk rating scales swot analysis are among the techniques in performing qualitative risk analysis to determine the probability and impact of risks for system modelling and analysis a qualitative approach which is systematical and non linear is adopted by fram by defining the normal performance variability in accordance with a socio technical system aguilera et al 2016 the qualitative interpretation of the safety of target systems is also supported by fram hirose and sawaragi 2020 a fram network is carried out to represent a qualitative risk assessment it involves task analysis as function definitions for maritime accidents this study used fram method since fram is a more appropriate method to investigate the maritime accidents within systems which are more tightly connected and insoluble hollnagel 2012 compared to other tools like fta fault tree analysis eta event tree analysis and hazop hazard and operability other reason why fram is preferred is that it provides a model for the positive and negative results of the intended and unintended dependency between the functional elements related to the maritime accidents anvarifar et al 2017 accordingly in this study fram was used to obtain results of qualitative risk analysis for the 2002 prestige oil spill a maritime accident that caused environmental destruction hollnagel 2012 prestige oil tanker broke in two and sank nearly 130 miles away from the spain s north west coast thus 76 972 tons of fuel oil blended in the sea consequently the coasts of spain and france got their share for this spill bahamas maritime authority 2004 prestige oil spill accident is considered as an international issue as oil spill can spread more than one coastal country due to the negative environmental effects and adverse consequences of maritime accidents it is essential to conduct researches on the causational models with a collective effort and a systematic model in order to avoid future maritime accidents this study is formulated as follows section 2 includes a literature review in section 3 the method and variables are described analysis results are provided in section 4 section 5 provides the discussion of the findings by comparing with the previous research finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 literature review 2 1 maritime risk assessment studies an effective way to minimize the maritime transportation risks is to analyze maritime accidents in the literature several studies have been conducted related to the risk analysis of the ship operations and maritime accidents accident investigation is carried out by the maritime administrations to learn the reason of the accidents and how the systems fail schroder hinrichs et al 2011 then maritime administrations are simulated for examining and amending regulations management and standard the formal safety assessment fsa was introduced by the international maritime organisation imo methodology for use in the imo rule making process to reduce the risk and improve the safety of maritime transportation imo and imo 2002 2013 a review is provided by hetherington et al 2006 on human factors in maritime safety human error concentrating on similarities in maritime accidents and involvement to enhance maritime safety furthermore analysing methods of ship crash and running aground are reviewed by pedersen 2010 in this review pedersen focuses not only on the possibility of accident occurrence methods but also on the constructional damages for accident scenarios the literature regarding the risk analysis of safety of maritime transportation is described by ozbas 2013 in the study conducted by ozbas the concept of risk analysis and introduction of this concept in the shipping industry is covered and a top quality study including qualitative and quantitative methods regarding watercourse risk analysis is provided in the study conducted by goerlandt and montewka 2015 the literature regarding the risk analysis of maritime transport is made focusing on chosen fundamental issues in risk study they particularly go through the accepted definition of risk the scientific method underpinning the analysis and the risk perspective that is used to measure and define the risk in other words the commitment to specific meta theoretical concepts of what the risk analysis aims at and how it should be carried out are reviewed in their study a state of the art literature search on ship ship clash probabilistic risk analysis is performed by chen et al 2019 in the study made by luo and shin 2019 studies on maritime accidents are reviewed in their review they laid stress on the disciplines included which causes are taken into account and which research techniques are used along with insights in effects of certain authors and worldwide collaboration networks and also overall publishing trends in various journals and geographical areas kulkarni et al 2020 present a comprehensive review of approaches models and tools for identifying analysing and evaluating risks of shipping accidents with a particular focus on the baltic sea region commonly maritime reports and statistical approaches are the basis for the researches on risk evaluation of maritime transportation zhang et al 2019 a multi layered approach was introduced by vander hoorn and knapp 2015 to evaluate maritime transport risk in order to perform risk analysis a methodology was improved by abbassi et al 2017 in accordance with the bow tie diagram which could be applied to shipping in arctic waters in order to make an assessment regarding the ship accident possibility along the northern sea route a risk model was presented by baksh et al 2018 the risk of grounding quantitatively was calculated by huang et al 2019 who integrated crossing line and monte carlo approaches these studies provided approaches which can be used to make an assessment regarding a ship s long term risk situation the issue of dependency was the focus point in these models furthermore several aspects of the system such as technical and social characters were intended to be included in those models zhou et al 2020 in order to make the risk assessment in a maritime accident one of the most valuable sources to achieve the main data is the maritime accident database which includes the historical accident data collected from national regional maritime administration zhang et al 2016 and the global database like global integrated shipping information system gisis pristrom et al 2016 however compared to the extractions from the reports of maritime accident such databases include less detailed information from this point of view the navigational circumstance the failure chain process information on environment direct or indirect causes of the accidents and the actions taken during the accidents are provided by the maritime accident investigation reports even the covert possible hazards and causal relations among various factors are shown in detail fan et al 2020b generally in the maritime sector there is a critical mass shortage in the data of historical accident to support meaning statistical analysis of different factors contributing to maritime accidents besides particularly in the light of maritime accidents the ambiguity and lack of database also contributes to the statistical research limitation fan et al 2020b 2 2 fram method in maritime accident modelling the focus point of conventional risk analysis methods is primarily the linear cause and effect relationships that cause accidents however some hazards have evolved without following linear risk propagation paths which bring emergent accidents in order to analyze risk in a broad and proactive perspective the safety managers are required in hazardous industries particular importance should be given to the way of learning from success rather than failure to be proactive fram has come out to be an effective tool fram tries to provide possible scenarios for accidents and damages in addition to the conventional tools cf leveson 2011 leveson et al 2005 hollnagel 2013 ishimatsu et al 2014 belmonte et al 2011 song 2012 rosa et al 2015 and bjerga et al 2016 recently most of the accidents are accepted to be caused by more than one factor together woods and hollnagel 2006 and this indicates that they occur as a result of a couple of combining as technological technical human or structural organizational aspects causes in accordance with a socio technical system it also means that the listed causes of accidents created through conventional safety engineering methods such as fta watson 1961 eta rasmussen 1975 and imo 2013 and failure modes effects and criticality analysis fmeca military 1949 are restricted with explaining when there is an accident how a couple of reasons can cause accidents and can also cause other occurrences a couple of system based damage analysis method have been presented in order to provide an explanation especially for determining the possible accident scenarios and more detailed data related to the damages within the frame of the complicated socio technical systems fram hollnagel 2012 is used to provide possible accident scenarios hollnagel 2004 was the one who introduced fram to the literature and then developed it hollnagel 2012 fram can be implemented through describing functions with detailed data related to the method of doing something determining the variables of the functions explaining the couplings of the variables and dealing with the unexpected variables fram hollnagel 2012 identifies complex system by their functions instead of their physical structuring capturing interactions and dynamics among functions is enabled by fram through modelling performance variability and non linear dependencies hollnagel 2012 patriarca et al 2017a b to determine system functions whether technological technical human or structural organizational or otherwise is the first step of a fram analysis every function is explained from the viewpoint of the following six aspects of fram i the input that is used or converted by a function ii the output that is produced by a function iii preconditions of a function that has to be fulfilled to carry out its function iv the resources required or consumed by a function v the time of a function by which time availability is affected and vi the control necessary to manage or amend the behavior of a function hollnagel et al 2008 characterizing the context dependent observed and potential variability of the identified system functions is involved in the second step hollnagel et al 2008 third step links various functions from step one while it takes into account the determined factors and situations in the second step for producing a fram diagram presenting aggregate variability in the fourth and final step the variability presented across the fram model is examined hulme et al 2019 the critical paths of functions are aimed to be defined by this approach which can cause major accidents based on a probabilistic assessment of each function s performance variability once the critical functions are individuated the fram can make contributions in describing the most suitable mitigating actions to manage this variability and to minimize risks fram theory is a more recent concept this is emphasized either in the title or in the abstract of the articles applying this concept explicitly in general this relatively new accident theory has been used by a few studies smith 2019 the only review actually on the fram includes 22 documents which is only a very small sample of the available literature pardo ferreira and canas 2019 fram s first application in the shipping industry was published in 2011 praetorius et al 2011 a re analysis of the harald of free enterprise is presented by the article ms harald of free enterprise capsized almost 20 min after leaving from zeebrugge although the shipping company was considered to be held partly responsible the result of the original investigation was based on a rather individual centered dimension as for other case studies such as the catastrophe of cruiser eastern star in 2015 wang et al 2017 and the sewol ferry accident kee 2017 a deeper understanding was provided by the fram analysis on how functional resonance may have emerged by stressing the flaw of the system and suggesting proactive countermeasures the ship navigation safety is an example with the variation of operating safety among ship crew in the arctic smith 2019 in order to enhance the formal safety assessment application made by imo fram was proposed to be introduced by praetorius et al 2017 as the tool fram has been used to explain the daily performance of vessel traffic services vts praetorius 2014 the socio technical processes related to the human system interaction vries 2017 accident analysis with human and system interaction lee and chung 2018 analyzing ferry capsizing accident tian et al 2016 and the complexity of modelling related to the mooring operations within the scope of the maritime domain patriarca and bergström 2017 this study has important contributions for the literature by providing a model through fram in order to discover the variables related to the complex maritime operations and accidents in this study discovering the reasons of maritime accidents within ordinary variability conditions without terrible failures is aimed to make recommendations related to discovering and developing maritime operation safety for reducing the variability it is essential to provide that the accident scenarios can be explained as completely as possible and the alternative scenarios show the ways related to the system behaviors in a plain and systematical way 3 functional resonance analysis method fram hollnagel 2004 proposed fram as an accident analysis and a risk assessment method at first a non linear accident model is used and it is based on the hypothesis that unforeseen combinations resonance of normal performance variability cause accidents according to opinion damping and observing variability among system functions enable to control and prevent accidents and safety requires the ability to frequently expect future incidents de carvalho 2011 fram can be used to understand how a safe state can be maintained by the system even when subjected to dynamic operational situations smith et al 2017 according to hollnagel 2012 fram method is based on four principles equivalence of successes and failures it means that origin of failures and successes are the same so that they happen for the same reason in other words things go well for the same reasons that they go wrong the principle of approximate adjustments it expresses that especially socio technical systems are very complicated that working conditions are underspecified all the time therefore partially unexpected alternatively it can be said that the daily performance of social and technical systems is generally adjusted to match the system conditions when humans are involved individually and collectively the principle of emergence the normal performance variability is scarcely large enough to be the cause for an accident in itself or even to form a malfunction but the variability from several functions may come together in unforeseen ways resulting in consequences that are disproportionately large hence a non linear effect is produced functional resonance it states the capacity of the variability in a group of functions to resonate so that an extraordinary big amount of variability might be carried with the result of a function which the system capacity is not enough to manage given the current terms consequently the accident may happen the four steps are introduced in the following paragraphs to prepare a fram analysis nevertheless at the beginning which is named step 0 it is essential to choose and assess whether the analysis is a risk assessment or an investigation of an accident while data directly obtained from the events or a report about an accident is the basis of an accident analysis it is usually hard to determine what should have happened instead of what did happen patriarca et al 2017a 3 1 identification of the system functions according to fram at socio technical systems human machines or organizations can perform the system functions the description of the functions focused on that should sit in for the accomplished system operation according to the type of the function tian et al 2016 the first step describes functions which the system needs to operate in collaboration with six aspects of every function the specifications of a function are characterized by six aspects hollnagel 2012 as shown in fig 1 with a hexagonal shape in their study clay williams et al 2015 stated the questions that will be the guide in developing six aspects of each function or activity used when building the fram model within the scope of this study the answers and aspects given to the guide questions by three of the functions used within the prestige accident model analyzed using fram method are indicated in table 1 as an example to understand the method better 3 2 identifying the variability the second step characterizes the variability of functions according to potential variability and actual variability the easy way to identify the results of performance variability is to specify that the output that is belong to a function or activity can be changeable timing and precision hollnagel 2012 the probable function or activity performance can result in four categories which are discussed in the next part describing the function variability is aimed in this step a function completed as it is supposed to be in terms of timing and precision a necessary function is not completed in other words no output or is executed unsatisfactorily i e with inadmissible precision a wrong function is executed in other words and cause to an inadmissible output a function is completed before or after the required time or out of sequence in other words at the wrong time tian et al 2016 hollnagel 2012 classifies the different causes of performance variability according to the etiology of the variability and defines the importance with different variability manifestation the so called phenotypes i e timing precision sequence speed distance force object duration and direction hollnagel 2012and patriarca et al 2017b three different reasons are classified by hollnagel 2018 regarding why a function s output is variable internal or endogenous variability the function variability consequence itself can be the output variability such as the function s uniqueness or character consequence external or exogenous variability the output variability may stem from the work environment variability such as the circumstances under which the function is performed functional upstream downstream coupling the output variability may eventually stem from the output variability from upstream functions and the input requirement resource control or time is provided for downstream functions the functional resonance is based on this type of coupling a combination of the three conditions can cause the variability of a function such as internal variability external variability and upstream downstream couplings 3 3 aggregation of variability in step three the focus is on analyzing specific model instantiations to figure out how the possible variability of functions can be resonant causing to unpredictable outcomes as expressed within the functional resonance process patriarca et al 2017a there are links among different functions in the fram model these links are occasionally called as upstream and downstream couplings throughout the system when considered as a whole the couplings and the functions linked with these couplings may provide support to desirable or unwanted variability in performances and attitude throughout the system this study focuses on the breaking points of the accident as a case study and analyzes that how the variability of functions actions which can be done during the accident for the case study affects the outcomes 3 4 management of variability the performance variability is monitored and managed in the final step of the fram system and the prior steps define this issue by the functional resonance positive or negative results can be caused by the performance variability the most efficient strategy comprises of increasing the positive effects such as easing their occurrence without losing function control and reducing the negative effects with removing and preventing their occurrence patriarca et al 2017b 4 prestige accident and fram application there have been lots of maritime accidents which resulted in the loss of lives ship sinking crew injuries and environmental disasters in history over the last 120 years some of those accidents have shocked the world with their effects on the economy society and environment some of the specific accidents reshaped the maritime industry with new legislations and international conventions for instance the sinking of titanic is the most famous maritime disaster which resulted in new legislation with real international cooperation on safety regulations solas after titanic disaster hundreds of accidents happened at seas prestige accident is one of the famous and important accidents which happened in 2002 because at the time of the accident more than 40 000 tons of oil were spilled and in the following days more than 22 000 tons of oil reached the coasts as three black tides bohannon and bosh 2003 the prestige accident seriously affected the countries where the leakage reached the coasts and sea pollution had negative impacts in terms of fishing tourism health and economy many studies have been conducted to measure the cost of these effects for example loureiro et al 2009 stated that the environmental cost of the accident was 574 722 million the short term financial losses in all affected sectors due to prestige oil spill cleaning and retreatment costs and all losses about environment reached up around 770 580 million on the 31st of august in 2003 a sum of 23 181 birds were collected along the coasts of spain portugal and france 6120 26 40 of them were still alive and 17 061 73 59 were dead loureiroa et al 2006 these results show another aspect of the prestige oil spill accident in this paper the prestige accident is analyzed by using fram based on the bahamas maritime authority s very detailed accident investigation report to be more clear about prestige s fram model the following section summarizes the accident of prestige 4 1 summary of the prestige accident prestige 26 year old bahamian registered tanker with an overall length of 243 49 m had departed from ventspils latvia on the 31st of october in 2002 and started to sail to gibraltar for orders prestige loaded nearly 76 972 tonnes of fuel oil at ventspils and st petersburg although the weather got worse after entering biscay bay prestige had decreased speed due to the high seas prestige was enroute to gibraltar without any problem till 13 november afternoon when she arrived the traffic separation scheme off cape finisterre spain the positions and the routes of prestige from 15 00 on 13 november to the date of final sinking is shown on the map in fig 2 on november the 13th around 15 00 prestige was hit by a large wave and she quickly developed a list of 200 to starboard when the ship heeled some of butterworth covers were dislocated from many starboard tanks the spray was flowing from the resulting openings in three starboard wing tank they had been empty and cargo oil was flowing from the butterworth openings in other starboard wing tanks to reduce listing to the starboard side two port after wing tank and three port wing tank were flooded by gravity upon the order of the master the list reduced slowly to less than 50 at 2200 two helicopters based in spain evacuated the entire crew except the master chief officer and chief engineer owing to distress message at around 18 00 although three remaining crew made a great effort they were not able to connect the ship to the tug until about 09 00 on 14th of november after some extra personnel had boarded after that the master requested to be taken to a sheltered and safe place but that request was rejected by the spanish authorities who instructed the ship being towed in a northwesterly routes away off the coast of spain on the 14th of november in morning hours to start the main engine a spanish surveyor and additional technician crew boarded although the master thought and clarified that further damage to the hull could occur due to the vibration of the engine and because of that he didn t want to start the engine he followed the instruction of the surveyor the salvage team was on board at around 03 00 on the 15th of november and the salvage master requested to take the ship to a sheltered and safe place however his request was rejected and the team was ordered to navigate the prestige 120 miles off the coast pursuant to an undertaking signed by the team before being allowed out to the ship prestige was towed in southwesterly routes to find better weather conditions and calmer sea state but was not permitted to enter the exclusive economic zone of portugal the damage of the hull got increasingly worse and finally prestige broke in two at 08 00 on november 19 2002 as the salvage team was on board the main engine was stopped by the master as further plating broke away from the starboard side when the cargo tanks finally breached on the 15th of november morning a great amount of oil was spilled and then the ship sank after prestige sank more leakage from the wreck occurred especially the spanish coastline was polluted by much of the oil then stretches of the french coast were polluted bahamas maritime authority 2004 4 2 the application of fram to the prestige accident as a case study this section is taking the case of prestige disaster to analyze with fram method according to bahama s maritime authority accident investigation report bahamas maritime authority 2004 the model was developed using the fram model visualizer to investigate the accident resulted in the sinking of prestige with the fram method 4 2 1 identifying the functions of the prestige case the events before and after the accident specified in the maritime accident investigation report published by bahama maritime authority were sorted chronologically and divided into parts these parts are as follows part 1 before accident part 2 accident damage and rescue operation part 3 salvage part 4 towing and sinking by dividing the accident into parts and numbering every function used in the model from 1 to 58 chronologically it was aimed both to simplify the long and detailed accident report and to make the model developed easy to understand the model and its parts developed for the investigation of the prestige accident with the fram method are shown in figs 3 6 the aspects of three functions within the scope of the model developed are presented to set an example in table 1 in part 3 1 the first stage of the fram methodology was realized with the development of the model the events which took place in the first part of the prestige accident are listed as twelve functions in table 2 the function is symbolized by the letter f and variability by the letter v in table 2 the variabilities applied to the functions in the first part of the prestige accident were performed with variabilities such as timing speed direction and amount and it was observed how the obtained potential results affected a lower or upper function functions were also performed with variabilities such as direction sequence and distance in other parts of the prestige accident 4 2 2 aggregation of the variability of prestige case in terms of the third step of fram which is aggregation of variability how the outputs changed was examined as a result of performing each function with the defined variabilities since the functions have to depend upon each other according to the time sequence and the preceding function must be performed or completed for the other function to start a delay in the first function will cause a delay in other functions as well for example a delay in commencing the loading in st petersburg specified in the f1v2 line in table 2 will cause the loading to be completed later as shown in the f2v3 line and the departure time of the ship will also be delayed therefore unless the ship increases its speed it will arrive the port of ventspil much later and the loading at the port of ventspils will also commence later as specified in line f3v2 if the loading at the port of ventspils is desired to be commenced on time as specified in line f3v0 the prestige must increase its speed since she departed late from the port of st petersburg however this would pose several risks in terms of navigational safety if the damage to the ship specified in line f12v0 was greater as specified in line f12v5 this would result in more sea pollution and the ship take on more water as in f12v6 line a smaller damage would decrease the listing degree of the ship which would result in less sea pollution and the ship take on less water 4 2 3 management of the variability of prestige case in the fourth stage to manage and monitor the variability of the functions involved in the prestige accident the resonance of the functions was looked through and functions with variability providing positive effects were protected and efforts were made to reduce negative effects thus it was tried to observe how the accident could be altered so that the ship would not sink and it would damage the environment at the minimum level for this purpose an effort was made to determine the functions that could greatly change the accident outcome by providing the variability which caused the ship to sink and create a large sea pollution building the fram model made it easy to determine the functions that have outputs of various type it also affected the subsequent multiple functions to a large extent in addition it had the critical importance which would minimize the adverse effects of the accident by providing the variability the critical functions mentioned were determined as functions numbered 14 15 27 37 and 46 for the prestige accident model and these critical functions were presented in table 3 5 discussion there are many methods for analysis of marine accidents in the literature among these methods fram provides great convenience to analyze complex accidents in terms of showing the relationship between the events occurred during the accident and determining how a possible change affects other functions regarding the accident which was divided into 4 parts in order to better understand the prestige oil spill case that was analyzed in the study the critical decisions that caused the ship to sink have been tried to be determined between the events from the initial damage to final sinking in this context the functions specified in table 3 were determined and performed with variabilities and the following results were achieved 14 15 27 37 and 46 numbered functions were performed according to timing distance direction amount variability and results were found as listed below at table 3 listing to starboard side function f14 was performed with amount variability the state of ship listing to starboard side more than 20 was examined through f14v1 variability in this case since ship listing to starboard side would increase the ship might capsize in case of reaching the maximum listing degree due to the effect of the load or more sea pollution might result since the butterworth covers might be opened more and the oil flow towards the sea would increase due to the listing the f14v2 variability enabled us to observe that in case that the listing degree is less than 20 butterworth covers might not be opened might be opened less and thus oil flow to the sea might be less which would result in sea pollution to be less furthermore it was observed that efforts to stabilize the ship could result earlier since the ship would list with a smaller degree in other words it was seen that f24 function could be performed earlier and with a smaller listing degree activating epirb and transmitting a distress message f15 is a very important action in an emergency situation this function performed with timing variability although activating epirb action was carried out with the order of captain after the initial accident and listing to starboard side towing operations and receiving messages from other ships could be earlier if it was carried out at an earlier time f15v1 variability is defining this too early condition from the opposite side with f15v2 variability if the captain didn t order or lately ordered to activate epirb or did not transmit a distress message towing and salvage operation might not happen and prestige could sink at an earlier time the master of prestige called to finisterre traffic function f27 is performed with timing variabilities and the f27v1 variability describes the case that the result can be achieved earlier thus it was observed that towage could start earlier and navigational safety for the prestige would be ensured it was performed with the variability f27v2 that the message sent to finisterre traffic by the master of prestige on the subject that he was prepared to accept a towing line could be transmitted much later and it was observed that this would cause a delay in the subsequent functions and would endanger the navigational safety while analyzing the accident it is observed that the master asked for a place of refuge function f37 is also critical if the request of the master of prestige had been accepted by the surveyor perhaps this would have prevented prestige s sinking and the effect of sea pollution would have been reduced by confining the pollution in a certain area however the fact that the surveyor refused the request of the master to take prestige to a place of refuge eliminated this possibility looking at prestige s position in the early hours of 14 november in fig 2 it was observed that the position of the ship was close to the coast it could be seen from the accident report that winds were from the south south west at 10 to 15 knots and the wave height was 1 1 5 m high at the time of performing of the f37 function when the ship was in this position if the f37 function in table 3 had been performed eastwards as in f37v1 instead of the nw it would be possible to approach the coast and take prestige to a place of refuge the variability f37v2 indicates that the ship continued to sail west in this case as the distance of prestige from the coast would increase both the chance of prestige reaching a place of refuge would be eliminated and stability of the ship would be negatively affected since it would be towed with an angle almost 90 to the wind with the variability f37v3 in case that prestige continued to sail north the ship would be towed in a more stable position as the wind and waves would be acting from behind and the prestige would proceed parallel to the spanish coast for a while with the variability f37v4 in case that prestige continued to sail south prestige would be towed with the wind and waves on the bow and the prestige would proceed parallel to the spanish coast for a while since proceeding of prestige parallel to the coast will not increase the distance from the coast it would shorten the time for the other ships and the salvage team to reach prestige and these functions would be performed earlier the fact that the meeting f46 between salvors and the spanish authority resulted in moving the prestige 120nm off the spanish coast is another critical function in the accident with the f46v1 variability the possibility was performed which prestige proceeded east more than 120 nm and in this case it was observed that prestige could not be taken to a place of refuge and thus prestige could likely sink earlier with the f46v2 variability moving prestige close to spanish coast was examined and in this case it was observed that taking prestige to a place of refuge could enable to limit the marine pollution and to prevent the prestige from sinking one of the reasons why the prestige accident took place as a major accident in the world s maritime history is that it caused an international crisis and that countries were not able to act jointly on intervention in the accident therefore imo adopted the guidelines on places of refuge for ships in need of assistance on december 5 2003 no doubt a challenging and potentially hazardous and vital situation confronted the spanish authorities when the emergency appeared the duties of spanish authorities were to minimize the casualty effects along the spanish coast and they had the legal control to manage prestige movements or routes the option of taking prestige to a place of refuge was not chosen and it was decided to tow the prestige away from the coast of spain they did not wait to learn the salvage master s advice or opinions or to make any other detailed assessment about prestige s condition before making a decision bahamas maritime authority 2004 the results of the fram application show that the decision about towing the prestige to the north westernly direction from the spanish coasts is critical if the decision had been based on to take the prestige to a place of refugee at spanish coasts the impact of oil leakage from prestige would be much less and the loss of prestige would have been prevented the master chief engineer and chief officer were eventually brought ashore at around 18 00 on the 15th of november after it was decided by the salvage master that remaining on board overnight was unsafe meanwhile all of them had been on watch keeping for 51 h consistently since the initial damage and the master had been on the bridge prior to the accident accident reports indicate that the prestige was close to the spanish coasts when the initial damage occurred after the initial damage the master activated the epirb and transmitted a distress message also 2 and 3 port wing tank were ordered by the master to be filled to reduce the list after 25 min of listing to starboard side about 200 then to reduce the list these tanks were filled by gravity and after almost 6 h the list had reduced to about 5 it was stated from the fram application that the listing to starboard side and activating epirb and transmitting a distress signal were also critical actions furthermore these were proper and right actions that were carried out under the pressure of emergency conditions 6 conclusion fram was applied to prestige oil spill a great disaster that had adverse effects on environment to ensure a safe and reliable seaway and also to protect environment by providing a model for their complex interactions it is possible to obtain an effective understanding how the system operates through the functional models of ship accidents it is also possible to adopt it to discover the potential variability in the system functions and to provide answers for the possible reasons of the relevant accident when the accident report is compared with fram it shows that the process of fram is more reliable than the conventional analysis processes which are used for accident analysis in order to describe the causes as completely as possible the interaction problems causing the current systems and processes difficult to describe may not be founded easily yet it is proved that fram is able to discover more detailed causes of potential interactions rather than the ones provided in the accident report in the application of the fram method to the prestige accident first of all the critical functions were determined which had an effect on the accident resulting in the sinking of the ship and creating a large marine pollution afterwards various variables were applied to these functions and then how other functions affected was observed the observations we have made are as follows in case the listing to starboard function occurs less than 20 butterworth covers may not open the stability of the ship may be restored earlier and marine pollution may occur at much reduced amounts if the activating epirb and sending a distress message function occurs earlier towing and rescue operations will be able to start earlier and thus the impacts of the accident can be reduced if the the master of prestige called to finisterre traffic function occurs earlier the towing operation may also be carried out earlier thus changing the result of the accident in case that the master requested a place of refugee function results in altering the course of the ship so that waves would be acting from behind the marine pollution can be controlled by towing the prestige to an appropriate location in case the meeting between salvors and spanish authorities function results in towing the ship to an appropriate location a limited marine pollution and leakage may occur this study provides several contributions to the literature on maritime accident analysis primarily it provides a comprehensive analysis related to the maritime accidents by focusing on the functions of the systems and their variability secondly it presents a functional tool in order to analyze the shipboard operations which cause accidents which are exemplified for a particular case study and finally in order to provide efficient designs to avoid maritime accidents for the national and international policymakers the results of this case study introduces a basis and a reference nevertheless the relevant method has some constraints and needs to be developed for instance the fram is based on subjective judgments the values of the person who carries out the analysis and also the quantified valued of measurable effects when the aforementioned issues are taken into consideration in order to conduct a more reliable study this study can be enhanced by aggregating fram with other methods credit authorship

21221,analyzing maritime accidents plays a key role in improving maritime safety and raising environmental awareness the functional resonance analysis model fram describes a structure to provide a system for achieving the aims of accident analysis this paper considers the application of fram for qualitative risk analysis of shipping operations the prestige oil spill an environmental catastrophe that caused a great amount of oil spill is analyzed by using the aforementioned method through the results of the analysis the variabilities of events underlying the accident are tried to be determined and suggestions to examine them are provided the essence of having a consistent opinion on the operation of the system and the fact that fram is an integral part for enhancing the risk analysis of the ship accidents were found out based on the results of the study keywords fram prestige maritime accident oil spill safety 1 introduction today more than eighty percent of the products around the world are carried by ships therefore maritime transport is at the very center of global trade production and supply unctad 2019 there have been numerous ship accidents and unknown damages chen et al 2017a b because more than 50 000 ships have been used in international commerce daily chen and yahalom 2013 for the intense maritime shipping network therefore the focus for the global transportation industry is the safety of seas chen et al 2019 the environment for the maritime transportation operations generally has challenging conditions in order to ensure a reliable navigation system for the national and international maritime transportation operations authorities did their utmost effort within the last decade according to akten 2006 despite increasing safety standards and improved technology shipping has still many risks and that is how it will remain it is hard to minimize the ship accidents due to the tough conditions and risky nature of seas despite the safety regulations such as colreg 72 international regulations for preventing collisions at sea marpol 73 78 marine pollution solas 74 78 88 international convention for the safety of life at sea marpol 73 78 marine pollution and stcw 78 standards of training certification and watch keeping for seafarers celik et al 2010 chen et al 2014 fan et al 2020a maritime transportation by nature involves various hazards which may cause detrimental consequences luo and shin 2019 montewka et al 2014 akyuz et al 2020 the numerous ship accidents around the world cause loss of life and property and they are one of the biggest threats to the ocean environment qiao et al 2020 there are numerous shipping accidents by type however collision or contact foundering grounding capsize stranding breaking up and fire or explosion are among the common examples of shipping accidents abbassi et al 2017 akten 2006 baalisampang et al 2018 more precisely human factors technical and mechanical deficiencies and environmental conditions are the major causes of maritime accidents celik et al 2010 stated that different prospects of continuing shipping accidents are complication and automation of the system human error potential design based failures and human centered system design it is also recognized that the main driving forces to maritime accidents involve working condition organisation and navigational environment garcía herrero et al 2012 today today s ships have sophisticated technologies such as onboard information electronic navigation means and bridge resource management systems nevertheless human factor is yet the main tool to reveal maritime accidents fan et al 2020b in general compared to the researches and arrangements in other methods of transportation such as air transport or railroad human factors were taken into consideration by the international maritime organisation imo much later schroder hinrichs et al 2011 statistically human failures mistakes are the reason of 80 percent of maritime accidents for this reason they have an essential role in preventing accidents trucco et al 2008 tzannatos 2010 fan et al 2018 in maritime accidents human factors are generally related with conditions of workplace natural and physical environment technology organisation procedures training management and also individual causes such as tiredness work load and psychological state psarros 2015 human factors are generally considered as the main reason when anything goes wrong at sea fan et al 2020b since there is a discrepancy among the opinions regarding accident analysis no agreement regarding the statistical aspect on the causes of the maritime accidents has been reached therefore the maritime authorities have been focusing on avoiding maritime accidents celik et al 2010 marine accidents are complex by their nature and this complexity is not caused by one single factor kristiansen 2013 jin et al 2002 hetherington et al 2006 thus an effective analysis of the combination of factors that cause a specific accident becomes difficult therefore compared to the number of accidents the increase of studies on maritime safety and resultant progress in the literature are fairly slow soner et al 2015 coraddu et al 2020 avoiding maritime accidents and ensuring a safe and reliable seaway are among the most important research subjects within the literature studies that have been conducted previously to find out the causes of the maritime accidents through gathering numerous accidents to discover causal accident patterns for example zhang et al 2018 puisa et al 2018 bye and aalberg 2018 yet it has been discussed with the recent improvements in accident causation current thinking hollnagel 2012 2013 tian et al 2016 smith 2019 kulkarni et al 2020 that it is necessary to evaluate the accidents by focusing on the factors of the system function performance to discover the accidents that will support the effort to formulize the success mechanism within a specific environment a rising concern to maritime authorities the shipping sector and community is the ship safety which indicates the significance of maritime risk assessment huang et al 2019 high risk is represented by each operation carried out on board ships risk factor has to be minimized to a tolerable level to enhance maritime safety at sea goerlandt and montewka 2015 risk assessment has an important role to improve safety in maritime industry akyuz et al 2020 risk analysis is an effective way of devising mitigation measures that avoid accidents a great number of studies on maritime transportation risk have been conducted including qualitative assessments and quantitative evaluations on a global scale zhou et al 2020 various analysis methods and models have been created that support performing risk assessments selecting the correct method or group of methods for the current situation is the key to a successful risk analysis lim et al 2018 qualitative techniques to assess frequency and consequence are adequate to perform the risk assessment after the hazards are determined for some cases however a more detailed quantitative analysis is necessary for some other cases compared with quantitative research more detailed focused and complementary observations are provided by qualitative research by analysing small samples therefore qualitative research provides a comprehensive view of the research topic and related comments and also promotes the production of information or knowledge for further research chang et al 2020 possibilities and consequences are fully determined qualitatively in qualitative risk analysis the main risk assessment type is qualitative assessment in which nominal or ordinal scales are used to categorize the potential risks fram root cause analysis failure modes and effects analysis fmea delphi technique risk rating scales swot analysis are among the techniques in performing qualitative risk analysis to determine the probability and impact of risks for system modelling and analysis a qualitative approach which is systematical and non linear is adopted by fram by defining the normal performance variability in accordance with a socio technical system aguilera et al 2016 the qualitative interpretation of the safety of target systems is also supported by fram hirose and sawaragi 2020 a fram network is carried out to represent a qualitative risk assessment it involves task analysis as function definitions for maritime accidents this study used fram method since fram is a more appropriate method to investigate the maritime accidents within systems which are more tightly connected and insoluble hollnagel 2012 compared to other tools like fta fault tree analysis eta event tree analysis and hazop hazard and operability other reason why fram is preferred is that it provides a model for the positive and negative results of the intended and unintended dependency between the functional elements related to the maritime accidents anvarifar et al 2017 accordingly in this study fram was used to obtain results of qualitative risk analysis for the 2002 prestige oil spill a maritime accident that caused environmental destruction hollnagel 2012 prestige oil tanker broke in two and sank nearly 130 miles away from the spain s north west coast thus 76 972 tons of fuel oil blended in the sea consequently the coasts of spain and france got their share for this spill bahamas maritime authority 2004 prestige oil spill accident is considered as an international issue as oil spill can spread more than one coastal country due to the negative environmental effects and adverse consequences of maritime accidents it is essential to conduct researches on the causational models with a collective effort and a systematic model in order to avoid future maritime accidents this study is formulated as follows section 2 includes a literature review in section 3 the method and variables are described analysis results are provided in section 4 section 5 provides the discussion of the findings by comparing with the previous research finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 literature review 2 1 maritime risk assessment studies an effective way to minimize the maritime transportation risks is to analyze maritime accidents in the literature several studies have been conducted related to the risk analysis of the ship operations and maritime accidents accident investigation is carried out by the maritime administrations to learn the reason of the accidents and how the systems fail schroder hinrichs et al 2011 then maritime administrations are simulated for examining and amending regulations management and standard the formal safety assessment fsa was introduced by the international maritime organisation imo methodology for use in the imo rule making process to reduce the risk and improve the safety of maritime transportation imo and imo 2002 2013 a review is provided by hetherington et al 2006 on human factors in maritime safety human error concentrating on similarities in maritime accidents and involvement to enhance maritime safety furthermore analysing methods of ship crash and running aground are reviewed by pedersen 2010 in this review pedersen focuses not only on the possibility of accident occurrence methods but also on the constructional damages for accident scenarios the literature regarding the risk analysis of safety of maritime transportation is described by ozbas 2013 in the study conducted by ozbas the concept of risk analysis and introduction of this concept in the shipping industry is covered and a top quality study including qualitative and quantitative methods regarding watercourse risk analysis is provided in the study conducted by goerlandt and montewka 2015 the literature regarding the risk analysis of maritime transport is made focusing on chosen fundamental issues in risk study they particularly go through the accepted definition of risk the scientific method underpinning the analysis and the risk perspective that is used to measure and define the risk in other words the commitment to specific meta theoretical concepts of what the risk analysis aims at and how it should be carried out are reviewed in their study a state of the art literature search on ship ship clash probabilistic risk analysis is performed by chen et al 2019 in the study made by luo and shin 2019 studies on maritime accidents are reviewed in their review they laid stress on the disciplines included which causes are taken into account and which research techniques are used along with insights in effects of certain authors and worldwide collaboration networks and also overall publishing trends in various journals and geographical areas kulkarni et al 2020 present a comprehensive review of approaches models and tools for identifying analysing and evaluating risks of shipping accidents with a particular focus on the baltic sea region commonly maritime reports and statistical approaches are the basis for the researches on risk evaluation of maritime transportation zhang et al 2019 a multi layered approach was introduced by vander hoorn and knapp 2015 to evaluate maritime transport risk in order to perform risk analysis a methodology was improved by abbassi et al 2017 in accordance with the bow tie diagram which could be applied to shipping in arctic waters in order to make an assessment regarding the ship accident possibility along the northern sea route a risk model was presented by baksh et al 2018 the risk of grounding quantitatively was calculated by huang et al 2019 who integrated crossing line and monte carlo approaches these studies provided approaches which can be used to make an assessment regarding a ship s long term risk situation the issue of dependency was the focus point in these models furthermore several aspects of the system such as technical and social characters were intended to be included in those models zhou et al 2020 in order to make the risk assessment in a maritime accident one of the most valuable sources to achieve the main data is the maritime accident database which includes the historical accident data collected from national regional maritime administration zhang et al 2016 and the global database like global integrated shipping information system gisis pristrom et al 2016 however compared to the extractions from the reports of maritime accident such databases include less detailed information from this point of view the navigational circumstance the failure chain process information on environment direct or indirect causes of the accidents and the actions taken during the accidents are provided by the maritime accident investigation reports even the covert possible hazards and causal relations among various factors are shown in detail fan et al 2020b generally in the maritime sector there is a critical mass shortage in the data of historical accident to support meaning statistical analysis of different factors contributing to maritime accidents besides particularly in the light of maritime accidents the ambiguity and lack of database also contributes to the statistical research limitation fan et al 2020b 2 2 fram method in maritime accident modelling the focus point of conventional risk analysis methods is primarily the linear cause and effect relationships that cause accidents however some hazards have evolved without following linear risk propagation paths which bring emergent accidents in order to analyze risk in a broad and proactive perspective the safety managers are required in hazardous industries particular importance should be given to the way of learning from success rather than failure to be proactive fram has come out to be an effective tool fram tries to provide possible scenarios for accidents and damages in addition to the conventional tools cf leveson 2011 leveson et al 2005 hollnagel 2013 ishimatsu et al 2014 belmonte et al 2011 song 2012 rosa et al 2015 and bjerga et al 2016 recently most of the accidents are accepted to be caused by more than one factor together woods and hollnagel 2006 and this indicates that they occur as a result of a couple of combining as technological technical human or structural organizational aspects causes in accordance with a socio technical system it also means that the listed causes of accidents created through conventional safety engineering methods such as fta watson 1961 eta rasmussen 1975 and imo 2013 and failure modes effects and criticality analysis fmeca military 1949 are restricted with explaining when there is an accident how a couple of reasons can cause accidents and can also cause other occurrences a couple of system based damage analysis method have been presented in order to provide an explanation especially for determining the possible accident scenarios and more detailed data related to the damages within the frame of the complicated socio technical systems fram hollnagel 2012 is used to provide possible accident scenarios hollnagel 2004 was the one who introduced fram to the literature and then developed it hollnagel 2012 fram can be implemented through describing functions with detailed data related to the method of doing something determining the variables of the functions explaining the couplings of the variables and dealing with the unexpected variables fram hollnagel 2012 identifies complex system by their functions instead of their physical structuring capturing interactions and dynamics among functions is enabled by fram through modelling performance variability and non linear dependencies hollnagel 2012 patriarca et al 2017a b to determine system functions whether technological technical human or structural organizational or otherwise is the first step of a fram analysis every function is explained from the viewpoint of the following six aspects of fram i the input that is used or converted by a function ii the output that is produced by a function iii preconditions of a function that has to be fulfilled to carry out its function iv the resources required or consumed by a function v the time of a function by which time availability is affected and vi the control necessary to manage or amend the behavior of a function hollnagel et al 2008 characterizing the context dependent observed and potential variability of the identified system functions is involved in the second step hollnagel et al 2008 third step links various functions from step one while it takes into account the determined factors and situations in the second step for producing a fram diagram presenting aggregate variability in the fourth and final step the variability presented across the fram model is examined hulme et al 2019 the critical paths of functions are aimed to be defined by this approach which can cause major accidents based on a probabilistic assessment of each function s performance variability once the critical functions are individuated the fram can make contributions in describing the most suitable mitigating actions to manage this variability and to minimize risks fram theory is a more recent concept this is emphasized either in the title or in the abstract of the articles applying this concept explicitly in general this relatively new accident theory has been used by a few studies smith 2019 the only review actually on the fram includes 22 documents which is only a very small sample of the available literature pardo ferreira and canas 2019 fram s first application in the shipping industry was published in 2011 praetorius et al 2011 a re analysis of the harald of free enterprise is presented by the article ms harald of free enterprise capsized almost 20 min after leaving from zeebrugge although the shipping company was considered to be held partly responsible the result of the original investigation was based on a rather individual centered dimension as for other case studies such as the catastrophe of cruiser eastern star in 2015 wang et al 2017 and the sewol ferry accident kee 2017 a deeper understanding was provided by the fram analysis on how functional resonance may have emerged by stressing the flaw of the system and suggesting proactive countermeasures the ship navigation safety is an example with the variation of operating safety among ship crew in the arctic smith 2019 in order to enhance the formal safety assessment application made by imo fram was proposed to be introduced by praetorius et al 2017 as the tool fram has been used to explain the daily performance of vessel traffic services vts praetorius 2014 the socio technical processes related to the human system interaction vries 2017 accident analysis with human and system interaction lee and chung 2018 analyzing ferry capsizing accident tian et al 2016 and the complexity of modelling related to the mooring operations within the scope of the maritime domain patriarca and bergström 2017 this study has important contributions for the literature by providing a model through fram in order to discover the variables related to the complex maritime operations and accidents in this study discovering the reasons of maritime accidents within ordinary variability conditions without terrible failures is aimed to make recommendations related to discovering and developing maritime operation safety for reducing the variability it is essential to provide that the accident scenarios can be explained as completely as possible and the alternative scenarios show the ways related to the system behaviors in a plain and systematical way 3 functional resonance analysis method fram hollnagel 2004 proposed fram as an accident analysis and a risk assessment method at first a non linear accident model is used and it is based on the hypothesis that unforeseen combinations resonance of normal performance variability cause accidents according to opinion damping and observing variability among system functions enable to control and prevent accidents and safety requires the ability to frequently expect future incidents de carvalho 2011 fram can be used to understand how a safe state can be maintained by the system even when subjected to dynamic operational situations smith et al 2017 according to hollnagel 2012 fram method is based on four principles equivalence of successes and failures it means that origin of failures and successes are the same so that they happen for the same reason in other words things go well for the same reasons that they go wrong the principle of approximate adjustments it expresses that especially socio technical systems are very complicated that working conditions are underspecified all the time therefore partially unexpected alternatively it can be said that the daily performance of social and technical systems is generally adjusted to match the system conditions when humans are involved individually and collectively the principle of emergence the normal performance variability is scarcely large enough to be the cause for an accident in itself or even to form a malfunction but the variability from several functions may come together in unforeseen ways resulting in consequences that are disproportionately large hence a non linear effect is produced functional resonance it states the capacity of the variability in a group of functions to resonate so that an extraordinary big amount of variability might be carried with the result of a function which the system capacity is not enough to manage given the current terms consequently the accident may happen the four steps are introduced in the following paragraphs to prepare a fram analysis nevertheless at the beginning which is named step 0 it is essential to choose and assess whether the analysis is a risk assessment or an investigation of an accident while data directly obtained from the events or a report about an accident is the basis of an accident analysis it is usually hard to determine what should have happened instead of what did happen patriarca et al 2017a 3 1 identification of the system functions according to fram at socio technical systems human machines or organizations can perform the system functions the description of the functions focused on that should sit in for the accomplished system operation according to the type of the function tian et al 2016 the first step describes functions which the system needs to operate in collaboration with six aspects of every function the specifications of a function are characterized by six aspects hollnagel 2012 as shown in fig 1 with a hexagonal shape in their study clay williams et al 2015 stated the questions that will be the guide in developing six aspects of each function or activity used when building the fram model within the scope of this study the answers and aspects given to the guide questions by three of the functions used within the prestige accident model analyzed using fram method are indicated in table 1 as an example to understand the method better 3 2 identifying the variability the second step characterizes the variability of functions according to potential variability and actual variability the easy way to identify the results of performance variability is to specify that the output that is belong to a function or activity can be changeable timing and precision hollnagel 2012 the probable function or activity performance can result in four categories which are discussed in the next part describing the function variability is aimed in this step a function completed as it is supposed to be in terms of timing and precision a necessary function is not completed in other words no output or is executed unsatisfactorily i e with inadmissible precision a wrong function is executed in other words and cause to an inadmissible output a function is completed before or after the required time or out of sequence in other words at the wrong time tian et al 2016 hollnagel 2012 classifies the different causes of performance variability according to the etiology of the variability and defines the importance with different variability manifestation the so called phenotypes i e timing precision sequence speed distance force object duration and direction hollnagel 2012and patriarca et al 2017b three different reasons are classified by hollnagel 2018 regarding why a function s output is variable internal or endogenous variability the function variability consequence itself can be the output variability such as the function s uniqueness or character consequence external or exogenous variability the output variability may stem from the work environment variability such as the circumstances under which the function is performed functional upstream downstream coupling the output variability may eventually stem from the output variability from upstream functions and the input requirement resource control or time is provided for downstream functions the functional resonance is based on this type of coupling a combination of the three conditions can cause the variability of a function such as internal variability external variability and upstream downstream couplings 3 3 aggregation of variability in step three the focus is on analyzing specific model instantiations to figure out how the possible variability of functions can be resonant causing to unpredictable outcomes as expressed within the functional resonance process patriarca et al 2017a there are links among different functions in the fram model these links are occasionally called as upstream and downstream couplings throughout the system when considered as a whole the couplings and the functions linked with these couplings may provide support to desirable or unwanted variability in performances and attitude throughout the system this study focuses on the breaking points of the accident as a case study and analyzes that how the variability of functions actions which can be done during the accident for the case study affects the outcomes 3 4 management of variability the performance variability is monitored and managed in the final step of the fram system and the prior steps define this issue by the functional resonance positive or negative results can be caused by the performance variability the most efficient strategy comprises of increasing the positive effects such as easing their occurrence without losing function control and reducing the negative effects with removing and preventing their occurrence patriarca et al 2017b 4 prestige accident and fram application there have been lots of maritime accidents which resulted in the loss of lives ship sinking crew injuries and environmental disasters in history over the last 120 years some of those accidents have shocked the world with their effects on the economy society and environment some of the specific accidents reshaped the maritime industry with new legislations and international conventions for instance the sinking of titanic is the most famous maritime disaster which resulted in new legislation with real international cooperation on safety regulations solas after titanic disaster hundreds of accidents happened at seas prestige accident is one of the famous and important accidents which happened in 2002 because at the time of the accident more than 40 000 tons of oil were spilled and in the following days more than 22 000 tons of oil reached the coasts as three black tides bohannon and bosh 2003 the prestige accident seriously affected the countries where the leakage reached the coasts and sea pollution had negative impacts in terms of fishing tourism health and economy many studies have been conducted to measure the cost of these effects for example loureiro et al 2009 stated that the environmental cost of the accident was 574 722 million the short term financial losses in all affected sectors due to prestige oil spill cleaning and retreatment costs and all losses about environment reached up around 770 580 million on the 31st of august in 2003 a sum of 23 181 birds were collected along the coasts of spain portugal and france 6120 26 40 of them were still alive and 17 061 73 59 were dead loureiroa et al 2006 these results show another aspect of the prestige oil spill accident in this paper the prestige accident is analyzed by using fram based on the bahamas maritime authority s very detailed accident investigation report to be more clear about prestige s fram model the following section summarizes the accident of prestige 4 1 summary of the prestige accident prestige 26 year old bahamian registered tanker with an overall length of 243 49 m had departed from ventspils latvia on the 31st of october in 2002 and started to sail to gibraltar for orders prestige loaded nearly 76 972 tonnes of fuel oil at ventspils and st petersburg although the weather got worse after entering biscay bay prestige had decreased speed due to the high seas prestige was enroute to gibraltar without any problem till 13 november afternoon when she arrived the traffic separation scheme off cape finisterre spain the positions and the routes of prestige from 15 00 on 13 november to the date of final sinking is shown on the map in fig 2 on november the 13th around 15 00 prestige was hit by a large wave and she quickly developed a list of 200 to starboard when the ship heeled some of butterworth covers were dislocated from many starboard tanks the spray was flowing from the resulting openings in three starboard wing tank they had been empty and cargo oil was flowing from the butterworth openings in other starboard wing tanks to reduce listing to the starboard side two port after wing tank and three port wing tank were flooded by gravity upon the order of the master the list reduced slowly to less than 50 at 2200 two helicopters based in spain evacuated the entire crew except the master chief officer and chief engineer owing to distress message at around 18 00 although three remaining crew made a great effort they were not able to connect the ship to the tug until about 09 00 on 14th of november after some extra personnel had boarded after that the master requested to be taken to a sheltered and safe place but that request was rejected by the spanish authorities who instructed the ship being towed in a northwesterly routes away off the coast of spain on the 14th of november in morning hours to start the main engine a spanish surveyor and additional technician crew boarded although the master thought and clarified that further damage to the hull could occur due to the vibration of the engine and because of that he didn t want to start the engine he followed the instruction of the surveyor the salvage team was on board at around 03 00 on the 15th of november and the salvage master requested to take the ship to a sheltered and safe place however his request was rejected and the team was ordered to navigate the prestige 120 miles off the coast pursuant to an undertaking signed by the team before being allowed out to the ship prestige was towed in southwesterly routes to find better weather conditions and calmer sea state but was not permitted to enter the exclusive economic zone of portugal the damage of the hull got increasingly worse and finally prestige broke in two at 08 00 on november 19 2002 as the salvage team was on board the main engine was stopped by the master as further plating broke away from the starboard side when the cargo tanks finally breached on the 15th of november morning a great amount of oil was spilled and then the ship sank after prestige sank more leakage from the wreck occurred especially the spanish coastline was polluted by much of the oil then stretches of the french coast were polluted bahamas maritime authority 2004 4 2 the application of fram to the prestige accident as a case study this section is taking the case of prestige disaster to analyze with fram method according to bahama s maritime authority accident investigation report bahamas maritime authority 2004 the model was developed using the fram model visualizer to investigate the accident resulted in the sinking of prestige with the fram method 4 2 1 identifying the functions of the prestige case the events before and after the accident specified in the maritime accident investigation report published by bahama maritime authority were sorted chronologically and divided into parts these parts are as follows part 1 before accident part 2 accident damage and rescue operation part 3 salvage part 4 towing and sinking by dividing the accident into parts and numbering every function used in the model from 1 to 58 chronologically it was aimed both to simplify the long and detailed accident report and to make the model developed easy to understand the model and its parts developed for the investigation of the prestige accident with the fram method are shown in figs 3 6 the aspects of three functions within the scope of the model developed are presented to set an example in table 1 in part 3 1 the first stage of the fram methodology was realized with the development of the model the events which took place in the first part of the prestige accident are listed as twelve functions in table 2 the function is symbolized by the letter f and variability by the letter v in table 2 the variabilities applied to the functions in the first part of the prestige accident were performed with variabilities such as timing speed direction and amount and it was observed how the obtained potential results affected a lower or upper function functions were also performed with variabilities such as direction sequence and distance in other parts of the prestige accident 4 2 2 aggregation of the variability of prestige case in terms of the third step of fram which is aggregation of variability how the outputs changed was examined as a result of performing each function with the defined variabilities since the functions have to depend upon each other according to the time sequence and the preceding function must be performed or completed for the other function to start a delay in the first function will cause a delay in other functions as well for example a delay in commencing the loading in st petersburg specified in the f1v2 line in table 2 will cause the loading to be completed later as shown in the f2v3 line and the departure time of the ship will also be delayed therefore unless the ship increases its speed it will arrive the port of ventspil much later and the loading at the port of ventspils will also commence later as specified in line f3v2 if the loading at the port of ventspils is desired to be commenced on time as specified in line f3v0 the prestige must increase its speed since she departed late from the port of st petersburg however this would pose several risks in terms of navigational safety if the damage to the ship specified in line f12v0 was greater as specified in line f12v5 this would result in more sea pollution and the ship take on more water as in f12v6 line a smaller damage would decrease the listing degree of the ship which would result in less sea pollution and the ship take on less water 4 2 3 management of the variability of prestige case in the fourth stage to manage and monitor the variability of the functions involved in the prestige accident the resonance of the functions was looked through and functions with variability providing positive effects were protected and efforts were made to reduce negative effects thus it was tried to observe how the accident could be altered so that the ship would not sink and it would damage the environment at the minimum level for this purpose an effort was made to determine the functions that could greatly change the accident outcome by providing the variability which caused the ship to sink and create a large sea pollution building the fram model made it easy to determine the functions that have outputs of various type it also affected the subsequent multiple functions to a large extent in addition it had the critical importance which would minimize the adverse effects of the accident by providing the variability the critical functions mentioned were determined as functions numbered 14 15 27 37 and 46 for the prestige accident model and these critical functions were presented in table 3 5 discussion there are many methods for analysis of marine accidents in the literature among these methods fram provides great convenience to analyze complex accidents in terms of showing the relationship between the events occurred during the accident and determining how a possible change affects other functions regarding the accident which was divided into 4 parts in order to better understand the prestige oil spill case that was analyzed in the study the critical decisions that caused the ship to sink have been tried to be determined between the events from the initial damage to final sinking in this context the functions specified in table 3 were determined and performed with variabilities and the following results were achieved 14 15 27 37 and 46 numbered functions were performed according to timing distance direction amount variability and results were found as listed below at table 3 listing to starboard side function f14 was performed with amount variability the state of ship listing to starboard side more than 20 was examined through f14v1 variability in this case since ship listing to starboard side would increase the ship might capsize in case of reaching the maximum listing degree due to the effect of the load or more sea pollution might result since the butterworth covers might be opened more and the oil flow towards the sea would increase due to the listing the f14v2 variability enabled us to observe that in case that the listing degree is less than 20 butterworth covers might not be opened might be opened less and thus oil flow to the sea might be less which would result in sea pollution to be less furthermore it was observed that efforts to stabilize the ship could result earlier since the ship would list with a smaller degree in other words it was seen that f24 function could be performed earlier and with a smaller listing degree activating epirb and transmitting a distress message f15 is a very important action in an emergency situation this function performed with timing variability although activating epirb action was carried out with the order of captain after the initial accident and listing to starboard side towing operations and receiving messages from other ships could be earlier if it was carried out at an earlier time f15v1 variability is defining this too early condition from the opposite side with f15v2 variability if the captain didn t order or lately ordered to activate epirb or did not transmit a distress message towing and salvage operation might not happen and prestige could sink at an earlier time the master of prestige called to finisterre traffic function f27 is performed with timing variabilities and the f27v1 variability describes the case that the result can be achieved earlier thus it was observed that towage could start earlier and navigational safety for the prestige would be ensured it was performed with the variability f27v2 that the message sent to finisterre traffic by the master of prestige on the subject that he was prepared to accept a towing line could be transmitted much later and it was observed that this would cause a delay in the subsequent functions and would endanger the navigational safety while analyzing the accident it is observed that the master asked for a place of refuge function f37 is also critical if the request of the master of prestige had been accepted by the surveyor perhaps this would have prevented prestige s sinking and the effect of sea pollution would have been reduced by confining the pollution in a certain area however the fact that the surveyor refused the request of the master to take prestige to a place of refuge eliminated this possibility looking at prestige s position in the early hours of 14 november in fig 2 it was observed that the position of the ship was close to the coast it could be seen from the accident report that winds were from the south south west at 10 to 15 knots and the wave height was 1 1 5 m high at the time of performing of the f37 function when the ship was in this position if the f37 function in table 3 had been performed eastwards as in f37v1 instead of the nw it would be possible to approach the coast and take prestige to a place of refuge the variability f37v2 indicates that the ship continued to sail west in this case as the distance of prestige from the coast would increase both the chance of prestige reaching a place of refuge would be eliminated and stability of the ship would be negatively affected since it would be towed with an angle almost 90 to the wind with the variability f37v3 in case that prestige continued to sail north the ship would be towed in a more stable position as the wind and waves would be acting from behind and the prestige would proceed parallel to the spanish coast for a while with the variability f37v4 in case that prestige continued to sail south prestige would be towed with the wind and waves on the bow and the prestige would proceed parallel to the spanish coast for a while since proceeding of prestige parallel to the coast will not increase the distance from the coast it would shorten the time for the other ships and the salvage team to reach prestige and these functions would be performed earlier the fact that the meeting f46 between salvors and the spanish authority resulted in moving the prestige 120nm off the spanish coast is another critical function in the accident with the f46v1 variability the possibility was performed which prestige proceeded east more than 120 nm and in this case it was observed that prestige could not be taken to a place of refuge and thus prestige could likely sink earlier with the f46v2 variability moving prestige close to spanish coast was examined and in this case it was observed that taking prestige to a place of refuge could enable to limit the marine pollution and to prevent the prestige from sinking one of the reasons why the prestige accident took place as a major accident in the world s maritime history is that it caused an international crisis and that countries were not able to act jointly on intervention in the accident therefore imo adopted the guidelines on places of refuge for ships in need of assistance on december 5 2003 no doubt a challenging and potentially hazardous and vital situation confronted the spanish authorities when the emergency appeared the duties of spanish authorities were to minimize the casualty effects along the spanish coast and they had the legal control to manage prestige movements or routes the option of taking prestige to a place of refuge was not chosen and it was decided to tow the prestige away from the coast of spain they did not wait to learn the salvage master s advice or opinions or to make any other detailed assessment about prestige s condition before making a decision bahamas maritime authority 2004 the results of the fram application show that the decision about towing the prestige to the north westernly direction from the spanish coasts is critical if the decision had been based on to take the prestige to a place of refugee at spanish coasts the impact of oil leakage from prestige would be much less and the loss of prestige would have been prevented the master chief engineer and chief officer were eventually brought ashore at around 18 00 on the 15th of november after it was decided by the salvage master that remaining on board overnight was unsafe meanwhile all of them had been on watch keeping for 51 h consistently since the initial damage and the master had been on the bridge prior to the accident accident reports indicate that the prestige was close to the spanish coasts when the initial damage occurred after the initial damage the master activated the epirb and transmitted a distress message also 2 and 3 port wing tank were ordered by the master to be filled to reduce the list after 25 min of listing to starboard side about 200 then to reduce the list these tanks were filled by gravity and after almost 6 h the list had reduced to about 5 it was stated from the fram application that the listing to starboard side and activating epirb and transmitting a distress signal were also critical actions furthermore these were proper and right actions that were carried out under the pressure of emergency conditions 6 conclusion fram was applied to prestige oil spill a great disaster that had adverse effects on environment to ensure a safe and reliable seaway and also to protect environment by providing a model for their complex interactions it is possible to obtain an effective understanding how the system operates through the functional models of ship accidents it is also possible to adopt it to discover the potential variability in the system functions and to provide answers for the possible reasons of the relevant accident when the accident report is compared with fram it shows that the process of fram is more reliable than the conventional analysis processes which are used for accident analysis in order to describe the causes as completely as possible the interaction problems causing the current systems and processes difficult to describe may not be founded easily yet it is proved that fram is able to discover more detailed causes of potential interactions rather than the ones provided in the accident report in the application of the fram method to the prestige accident first of all the critical functions were determined which had an effect on the accident resulting in the sinking of the ship and creating a large marine pollution afterwards various variables were applied to these functions and then how other functions affected was observed the observations we have made are as follows in case the listing to starboard function occurs less than 20 butterworth covers may not open the stability of the ship may be restored earlier and marine pollution may occur at much reduced amounts if the activating epirb and sending a distress message function occurs earlier towing and rescue operations will be able to start earlier and thus the impacts of the accident can be reduced if the the master of prestige called to finisterre traffic function occurs earlier the towing operation may also be carried out earlier thus changing the result of the accident in case that the master requested a place of refugee function results in altering the course of the ship so that waves would be acting from behind the marine pollution can be controlled by towing the prestige to an appropriate location in case the meeting between salvors and spanish authorities function results in towing the ship to an appropriate location a limited marine pollution and leakage may occur this study provides several contributions to the literature on maritime accident analysis primarily it provides a comprehensive analysis related to the maritime accidents by focusing on the functions of the systems and their variability secondly it presents a functional tool in order to analyze the shipboard operations which cause accidents which are exemplified for a particular case study and finally in order to provide efficient designs to avoid maritime accidents for the national and international policymakers the results of this case study introduces a basis and a reference nevertheless the relevant method has some constraints and needs to be developed for instance the fram is based on subjective judgments the values of the person who carries out the analysis and also the quantified valued of measurable effects when the aforementioned issues are taken into consideration in order to conduct a more reliable study this study can be enhanced by aggregating fram with other methods credit authorship

21222,this study experimentally investigated a control method for the vertical stabilization of a trimaran experiments were conducted on a bare trimaran a trimaran with fixed appendages and one with actively controlled appendages a t foil and flap were selected as the stability appendages and installed on the vessel whose dimension and installation position are provided next the t foil and flap were uncoupled and the stabilization controller for motion reduction of the trimaran was designed on the basis of the idea of the resultant force and moment with kalman filter rfmd k finally the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the appendages and the proposed controller keywords trimaran vertical motion control t foil and flap rfmd k model test 1 introduction as a trimaran has a wide deck can move at high speed and features excellent anti rolling performances it has become a popular type of marine vessel fang and chen 2008 however vertical motion is violent when a trimaran sails and large vertical motion can include heave and pitch motion that can cause damage to the equipment on the trimaran the vertical acceleration caused by the heave and pitch motion is the principal factor behind seasickness in crew and passengers on board fang and chan 2007 as a ship stabilization method installed appendages are widely used the usual appendage suite for a mono hull is a bilge fin rudder etc fins and rudders are often utilized in anti rolling approaches sharif et al 1996 tanguy et al 2003 surendran et al 2007 liang et al 2018 and fins are also used to reduce the vertical motion of ships four fins were used for pitch stabilization and experiments featuring regular and irregular waves were carried out huang et al 2018 the results showed that with regular waves the effectiveness of the appendages is related to the wavelength and wave height the maximum pitch motion can be reduced by 89 91 and the pitch motion can be reduced by approximately 31 at state 5 and 23 at sea state 6 t foil and flaps were used in mono hull and multihull aranda et al 2001 2005 santos et al 2005 the appendages include active and passive components with passive appendages being convenient for installation however the effectiveness of the fixed appendage for improving ship stability performance is not obvious and hence the actively controlled appendages appear to improve the effect of ship stabilization zong et al 2019a conducted studied stability control for a trimaran in irregular waves fixed and controlled t foil experiments were all performed in a towing tank in different installation positions of the side hull the fixed and controlled appendages were effective in improving stability performance moreover in most cases the effectiveness of a controlled appendage in reducing trimaran s motion was significantly greater than in the case of a passive appendage in zong et al 2019b the researchers investigated a trimaran with fixed and actively controlled t foil and the results revealed that the actively controlled t foil could improve the effect of heave and pitch motion by approximately 20 over the use of fixed t foil in regular waves the actively controlled appendage must be motor driven and requires a hardware system hydraulic cylinder and control algorithm the control algorithm is critical to the controller s design in ship stabilization control algorithm design the proportion integration differential pid controller is always used in ship motion control a t foil and two flaps were applied to reduce the vertical motion of a ferry and worst vertical acceleration wva was used as the pd controller s index cruz et al 2004 esteban et al 2005 the results showed that the appendages effectively reduced the ship s vertical motion after that an advanced controller including a robust controller hinostroza et al 2015 zhu and du 2020 yu et al 2017 sliding mode controller liu et al 2016 and model predictive controller liu et al 2011 was also designed for ship motion control ertogan et al 2016 proposed intelligent control with particle swarm optimization algorithm for ship roll motion reduction and luo et al 2017 indicated a robust adaptive fin controller using a feedforward neural network the above mentioned research results have had an admirable effect on simulations however in the experimental environment the controllers mentioned above are accompanied by some restrictions the main problem is ship model uncertainly six control models including a pitch control model heave control mode and local control mode for the ride control system rcs alavimehr et al 2017 2019 with each control mode being divided into linear and nonlinear versions the results verified that the method achieves good performance for catamaran stabilization however only regular waves have been studied in this context in actual ship sailing wave disturbance is irregular in light of the actual wave situation this paper analyzes a method for controlling the stability of a trimaran subjected to irregular waves under irregular wave conditions the controller must be robust therefore for this study an s plane controller was chosen the structure of the s plane controller corresponds to a pid the structure of the s plane controller is similar to a pid and can be regarded as a nonlinear pid cruz et al 2004 considered an uncoupled method for the t foil and flap in conjunction with a pd controller the results showed that the controller has an excellent effect but the uncoupled strategy is complex and sometimes not convenient for use in experiments therefore a novel uncoupled method that makes use of an s plane controller is proposed in this paper and is applied to the vertical motion control of a trimaran compared with previous works the key innovations of this paper are summarized as follows 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation is introduced as an auxiliary tool in the control system the range of a trimaran s force moment heave related motion heave displacement heave velocity and heave acceleration and pitch related motion pitch angle pitch angular velocity and pitch angle acceleration are calculated according to the cfd simulation an approximate control gain was obtained by calculating the corresponding coefficient 2 two control channels were designed for heave and pitch motion reduction in the pitch motion channel design the wave moment is the key factor determining the pitch motion in the heave motion channel design the pitch related term is regarded as the disturbance term using the s plane controller the disturbance term could be suppressed 3 rfmd k is applied in the control system the essence of the algorithm is the use of the force of appendages to inhibit the wave force acting on the trimaran and the use of the appendages moment to inhibit the wave moment acting on the vessel the heave velocity and pitch angular velocity were used as the feedback values through kalman filtering displacement and acceleration were converted into velocity values then the controller inversely resolved the corresponding force and moment through velocity value feedback and control gain and then inversely solves the appendages attack angle the structure of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the structure and parameters of the experimental trimaran t foil and flap section 3 outlines the conditions of the experiment with respect to irregular waves in section 4 the details of the controller design are presented section 5 shows the results of the test a comparison is made of the bare trimaran the trimaran with fixed appendages and that with actively controlled appendages finally section 6 concludes the study 2 description of the trimaran and appendages the trimaran s vertical motion equations are given by zong et al 2019b 1 m a 33 x 3 b 33 x 3 c 33 x 3 a 35 x 5 b 35 x 5 c 35 x 5 f 3 2 i a 55 x 5 b 55 x 5 c 55 x 5 a 53 x 3 b 53 x 3 c 53 x

b i j is the damping coefficients and c i j is the restoring coefficient f 3 and m 5 are the amplitude of wave force and moment respectively to investigate the stabilization method for reducing motion of the trimaran a model trimaran model was built its parameters are listed in table 1 and fig 1 shows the trimaran model itself fig 1 a and b show views of the model from different perspectives and fig 1 c shows a side view of the trimaran the t foil and flap were used as the appendages for the vessel s vertical stabilization control a three view drawing of the appendages is presented in fig 2

gain of the kalman filter q process noise matrix r measurement noise matrix h measurement coefficient matrix z measurement vector t sample time t wave period in regular waves because the motion of the trimaran is mainly caused by the wave force and moment the key to reducing the motion is therefore to inhibit the wave force and moment then the appendages can be installed on the trimaran the force and moment provided by appendages can inhibit the wave force and moment the equation for the lift force and moment of the t foil can be expressed as lewis 1988 3 f t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c l θ t 4 m t f t l t where ρ is the seawater density s is the area of the t foil u is the velocity of the trimaran c l is the lift coefficient θ t is the attack angle and l t is the distance between the center of the t foil and the center of the trimaran f t m t are the t foil force and moment respectively to control the attack angle of the t foil and flap it is necessary to change the lift force and moment provided by the t foil and flap are required for the sake of convenience the slope of the lift force s curve must be calculated and the relationship between the lift force and attack angle can be directly obtained then eq 3 can be rewritten as 5 f t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c l θ 1 k t θ t 6 m t f t l t k t l t θ t similarly the equation for the lift force and moment of the flap can be expressed as 7 f f k f θ f 8 m f k f l f θ f where l f is the distances of the flap relative to the center of the trimaran f f and m f are the force and moment of the flap respectively k t and k f are the lift force s slopes of t foil and flap in liu et al 2019 the authors showed that the values of k t and k f can be calculated through cfd simulation and polynomial fitting the value of k t and k f are 53 8 and 80 6 at 40 knots and 10 63 and 19 34 at 18 knots respectively the range of t foil s maximum angle is 15 whereas the flap is 0 15 the flap is usually installed in the central position of the range and the rotational range is equivalent to 7 5 kawazoe et al 1994 through the calculation the slope of the lift force on the t foil and flap with different attack angles and different velocity is obtained the stability appendages installed on the trimaran is shown in fig 3 fig 3 a and b present the transverse installation position while fig 3 c shows the longitudinal installation position 3 preparation for the model tests the type of hardware is shown in zeng et al 2019 fig 4 and fig 5 show the hardware of the trimaran s vertical stabilization system a model test of the trimaran was performed in a towing tank fig 6 shows the elements related to the model test fig 6 a displays the towing tank and its corresponding information is listed in table 3 in fig 6 b the trimaran with the appendages in the towing tank is presented and marked fig 6 c is the position of the sensor installed the heave displacement data are measured using an ultrasonic sensor and the pitch angle is measured using the posture sensor the acceleration data of the heave and pitch are measured using accelerometers which are installed in the bow stern and center of the trimaran the accelerometers are installed inside of the trimaran fig 6 d and e show the composition of the actuator the towing tank has a wave damper region and the plan graph of the towing tank is shown in fig 7 for an irregular wave the conditions of the trimaran s model tests are listed in table 4 h s represents the significant wave height the trimaran s velocities were 2 93 m s and 6 51 m s which are equivalent to 18 knots and 40 knots respectively because the trimaran is a 1 10 model the displacement and acceleration data of the heave and pitch were measured using an ultrasonic sensor an accelerometer and a posture sensor the acceleration sensor was installed at the center bow and stern of the vessel the ultrasonic sensor was installed on the carriage through a threaded connection and its position corresponded to the center of the trimaran fig 6 c when performing the model tests the position of the carriage was fixed directly above the trimaran when the trimaran moved up and down under the action of the waves the ultrasonic sensor obtained its heave data in accordance with the trimaran s up or down movement the posture sensor was installed on the bow of the vessel the installation positions of sensors are shown in fig 6 c the performance parameters including the range resolution of the sensors are listed in table 5 3 1 data processing for data processing the data on the heave displacement pitch angle and acceleration were regarded as wave data in the irregular wave experiment multiple tests were carried out the wave height pitch and heave data should be taken as the average of multiple tests note the trimaran with actively controlled appendages marked by subscript s y and without them marked by subscript s w the result of the motion is a significant value under two conditions namely 9 h s w i 1 n h s w i n 10 h s y i 1 n h s y i n 11 θ s w i 1 n θ s w i n 12 θ s y i 1 n θ s y i n where h s w h s y θ s w and θ s y represent the heave data of the bare trimaran heave data of the trimaran with actively controlled appendages pitch data of the bare trimaran and pitch data of the trimaran with actively controlled appendages respectively n is the number of model tests i 1 2 3 n on this basis the stabilization effect of the vertical motion during the model test was calculated as 13 r h c h s y h s w h s w 100 14 r p c θ s y θ s w θ s w 100 where r h c and r p c are the heave and pitch reduction rates in actively controlled conditions respectively the data from the experiment were not smooth and the burr could lead to an error in data processing when using the statistical algorithm the results will not be accuracy therefore the first priority was to smoothen the data the conventional method for this is the moving average filter and the effectiveness of the method is illustrated in fig 8 the case is 18 knots ssn4 and heave displacement fig 8 shows the moving average filter for experimental data processing fig 8 a displays the unfiltered data and fig 8 b shows the filtered data in fig 8 the smoothing result has been achieved and the smoothing method does not affect the amplitude of the heave motion the data processing requires to count the amplitude of the heave and pitch motions therefore it was necessary to obtain the crest and trough of the heave and pitch motions this step is described as follows 1 finding the position of crest and trough value to find the position of the crest and trough values in the data it is important to find the position of data s extreme points first we should differentiate the data as we can then find out the difference value of adjacent elements then we introduce the signum function sign and use it for the differences between the above mentioned adjacent elements next we continue to solve for the differences between the adjacent elements for the value obtained in the previous step after that elements greater than 0 are identified note that after solving the difference the returned data will be one less than the original data therefore the position of the crest should be added to the position noted above the matlab command is p crest find diff sign diff data 0 1 similarly the command in finding the position of the trough is p trough find diff sign diff data 0 1 2 obtaining the value of crest and trough in the analysis of step 1 the position of the crest and trough were identified then we merely needed to find the data corresponding to the position the commands were v crest data crest and v trough data trough on the basis of the description of the previous two steps the effect is shown in fig 9 which is an example of how to obtain the wave height of the motion the data are derived from a set of heave data of the model tests 3 solving the motion wave height the motion data are treated as the wave height based on step 2 and the motion wave height can be obtained through the motion wave height crest trough command 3 2 irregular waves in the model tests in the irregular wave experiment the wave spectrum was given by faulknotser 1989 15 s ζ ω 173 h s 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 where h s is the significant wave height t 1 is the wave period ω is the circular wave frequency and s ζ ω is the power spectral density the wave amplitude of the random wave can be represented as perez 2005 16 ζ t n 1 n ζ a n cos ω n t ε n where ζ t is the amplitude of random waves n is the total number of superimposed harmonics ζ a n and ε n are the amplitude and phase of n t h respectively in the model tests because the trimaran model is a scale model the wave height and period were changed based on froude s scaling law the wave height of ssn 3 and ssn 4 as used in this test are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a and b are the wave views of ssn 3 and ssn 4 respectively 4 controller design to improve the stabilization effect the actively controlled appendages were applied to the trimaran therefore the controller design was required the motion equations of the trimaran with the t foil and flap were rewritten as 17 m a 33 x 3 b 33 x 3 c 33 x 3 a 35 x 5 b 35 x 5 c 35 x 5 f r 18 i a 55 x 5 b 55 x 5 c 55 x 5 a 53 x 3 b 53 x 3 c 53 x 3 m r where f r f 3 f t f f m r m 5 m t m f for the trimaran s vertical stabilization controller design the first step was to determine the correct logic relationship between the trimaran s motion trend and the actuator s attack angle tendency the heave motion is the trimaran s centroid upward and downward motions the pitch motion includes two conditions the trimaran s bow moving upward and its stern moving downward and its bow being downward and the stern upward fig 11 shows the logical relationship between the appendages and the vessel in fig 11 the number 1 and 2 represent the heave motions and pitch motions respectively the appendages are used to produce the damping force and moment that prevent the wave force and moment acting on the trimaran in the model test the attack angle of appendages was changed based on the controller 4 1 control strategy the pitch dynamics uncoupled from heave for the controller design and the model are represented by basturk et al 2015 19 i a 55 x 5 t b 55 x 5 t c 55 x 5 t b 1 u 1 t m 5 e t eq 19 can be rewritten as 20 i a 55 x 5 t b 55 x 5 t c 55 x 5 t m 5 t b 1 u 1 t it can be seen from above eq 20 that the term relating to heave motion is removed this means that the pitch angle pitch angular velocity and pitch angle acceleration primarily relate to the wave moment for the pitch motion model of the trimaran the heave coupling is removed and the s plane controller is designed to reduce the pitch motion combined with eq 1 the heave motion with control force can be written as 21 m a 33 x 3 t b 33 x 3 t c 33 x 3 t f 3 e t b 2 u 2 t f d where f d a 35 x 5 t b 35 x 5 t c 35 x 5 t f d can be used as a disturbance term for the controller design we used the s plane controller the s plane has the advantages of higher control accuracy robustness and anti interference ability zhao et al 2019 liao et al 2017 thus the disturbance term can be suppressed by employing the s plane controller the pitch coupling amount f d can also be used as the disturbance term of the heave motion model and the s plane controller can be used to reduce the heave motion on the basis of the analysis above the rfmd k algorithm with the s plane controller is proposed and summarized in section 4 3 the core principle of the method is as follows the heave and pitch motions of the trimaran are primarily caused by the wave disturbance the controller is designed to control and change the attack angle of the appendages in order to suppress the wave disturbance as much as possible it can be seen in eqs 1 and 2 that both the wave force and moment can generate heave and pitch motions which means that both the t foil and flap have an impact on heave and pitch consequently the control input of the appendages must be uncoupled basturk et al 2015 considered the moment to produce pitch related motion the pitch coupling term in the heave motion was regarded as a disturbance term and it can be approximated that force related to the heave motion duo of the controller can suppress the disturbance fig 12 shows the description between the appendages and the wave force and moment fig 12 can be divided into two stages the first stage is the wave disturbance acting on the vessel and the second is the force and moment of appendages that inhibit the wave disturbance then the remaining wave force and moment act on the trimaran 4 2 role of cfd in the control system targeting the wave force and moment was difficult especially in an actual marine environment therefore for this stabilization investigation a cfd simulation was used to obtain the wave force and moment in recent years cfd simulations have played a key role in the design and analysis of ships in the simulation of ship motion the commercial software star ccm is more widely used for instance the related fluid dynamics phenomena of a stepped planing hull and full scale ship performance in the head sea were analyzed by means of cfd simulations de marco et al 2017 tezdogan et al 2015 the results of which proved the reliability and accuracy of the simulation in our research cfd simulations were used to assist in the calculation of forces moments and motion of the trimaran fig 13 shows the flowchart of the numerical simulation and experiment the first step was to build a 3d model of the trimaran based on the profile and parameters and then the model was analyzed using the cfd software the simulation results were compared to the experimental results and the simulation results were verified as feasible next the simulation of the trimaran with a fixed t foil and flap was performed the results showed the design and installation position of the appendages were effective in reducing motion finally the experiment was performed with the control algorithm appendix b shows the cfd calculation condition the comparison of cfd simulation and model tests in regular waves is given as an example which proves cfd simulation is feasible 4 3 rfmd k algorithm step 1 obtaining the corresponding coefficient the corresponding coefficient of force to heave velocity and moment to pitch angular velocity were obtained through the cfd simulation the correspondence coefficient or gain was not a directly proportional relationship from the perspective of control was an approximation value the condition of the model test was simulated by the cfd software the introduction and role of cfd were mentioned in section 4 2 from the cfd simulation the maximum and minimum force and moment acting on the trimaran could be solved in other words the range of force and moment acting on the trimaran could be solved by simulation simultaneously heave related and pitch related motions heave displacement heave velocity heave acceleration pitch angle pitch angular velocity and pitch angle acceleration were also solved on the basis of the analysis result in section 4 1 the heave related motion corresponded to the force and pitch related motion corresponded to the moment by maintaining the control motions within their maximum range of physical movement the gain between force to heave velocity and moment to pitch angular velocity was selected as 23 k p v m 5 max p max step 2 design of pitch channel controller the controller design was divided into two independent channels one was the heave channel and the other was the pitch channel step 2 describes the design of the pitch channel controller the pitch dynamics uncoupled from heave for the controller design and model are incorporated into eq 20 basturk et al 2015 the s plane was designed here the total control moment could be solved using the s plane controller μ 1 is written as 24 u 1 2 0 1 0 exp k p p e p v k p d e p v 1 0 1 u 1 1 and 25 b 1 k p v 26 m 5 b 1 u 1 where u 1 is the control input of the pitch controller channel k p p and k p d are the parameter of the controller e p v and e p v are the deviation of the controlled quantity and the change rate of the deviation respectively step 3 design of heave channel controller the heave motion is described in eq 21 similarly the s plane controller was used to reduce the heave motion here the total control force could be calculated for the heave dynamics of the trimaran pitch coupling was regarded as a disturbance term because the s plane controller has an anti interference capacity the disturbance term was suppressed in the model tests then using the s plane controller u 2 is written as 27 u 2 2 0 1 0 exp k h p e h v k h d e h v 1 0 1 u 2 1 and 28 b 2 k h v 29 f 3 b 2 u 2 where u 2 is the control input of the heave controller channel k h p and k h d are the parameter of the controller e h v and e h v are the deviation of the controlled quantity and the change rate of the deviation respectively step 4 solution to attack angle of appendage using the force and moment of appendages to inhibit the wave force and moment acting on the trimaran the formula is yielded as 30 f 3 f t f f 31 m 5 f t l t f f l f form eqs 30 and 31 f t and f f can be obtained as 32 f t m 5 f 3 l f l t l f 33 f f f 3 l t m 5 l t l f then the attack angles of the appendage are solved as 34 θ t f t k t m 5 f 3 l f k t l t l f 35 θ f f f k f f 3 l t m 5 k f l t l f the matrix form of eqs 34 and 35 is written as 36 θ t θ f k t k f k t l t k f l f 1 f 3 m 5 through multiple cfd simulations the range of gain is obtained after the gain has obtained the matrix is rewritten as 37 θ t θ f k t k f k t l t k f l f 1 f 3 m 5 k t k f k t l t k f l f 1 b 1 u 1 b 2 u 2 utilizing the idea of rfmd k combined with the controller the angle of attack of the accessory can be calculated in real time so that the appendages can generate control force and moment on the trimaran and achieve the goal of reducing heave and pitch motion the s plane controller with the rfmd k was utilized for the trimaran s motion stabilization control the method used the force of appendages to inhibit the wave disturbance on the basis of the data on displacement angle and acceleration using a kalman filter welch and bishop 1997 the data on heave velocity and pitch angular velocity could be estimated fig 14 shows the control system and the uncoupled block is shown in fig 15 δ f and δ m represent real time changing of forces and moments 4 4 explanation of the algorithm f t and f f could be obtained through the wave force and moment and the attack angles of appendage which were obtained according to f t and f f in real time to solve f t and f f f 3 and m 5 are required however in the actual experiment the wave force and moment were generally difficult to obtain the wave force moment heave velocity pitch angular velocity can be monitored by means of cfd simulation then the gain between the force to heave velocity and moment to pitch angular velocity could be obtained to maintain the control motions within their maximum range of physical movement the gain was selected as k h v f 3 max h max and k p v m 5 max p max k h v is the relationship between the wave force and the heave velocity and k p v is the relationship between the wave moment and the pitch angular velocity from liu et al 2019 the resultant force and moment distribution rfmd was used for the same trimaran s vertical stabilization control the method directly used the heave displacement and pitch angle as the feedback values the experimental results proved that the method was effective however the displacement indicates that motion had occurred and the velocity represents its tendency therefore for a better effect it was necessary to restrain the motion s tendency in this study the heave velocity and pitch angular velocity were used as the feedback values the velocity value could be obtained using a sensor and kalman filter this study used the data of displacement and acceleration to estimate the velocity data with the kalman filter the discrete time form of kalman filter is shown as 38 x k a k 1 x k 1 w k 1 39 z k h k x k v k where k is the discrete time index x k ℝ n is the state vector z k ℝ m is the measurement vector a k ℝ n n is the state transition matrix h k ℝ m n is the observation matrix w k ℝ n is the process noise and v k ℝ m is the measurement noise in velocity value estimation predicting the next state of the system is undertaken as follows 39 x k k 1 a k 1 x k 1 k 1 40 p k k 1 a k 1 p k 1 k 1 a k 1 t q k where p is the covariance matrix q is the process noise matrix then the process of calculating the kalman gain is 41 k k p k k 1 h t h p k k 1 h t r k where k is the gain of the kalman filter and r is the measurement noise matrix combined with the estimated and predicted value the current state value could be estimated as 42 x k k x k k 1 k k z k x k k 1 the update covariance is 43 p k k 1 k k p k k 1 in the description above the matrix a and h are defined as a 1 t 0 0 1 t 0 0 1 h 1 0 0 0 0 1 the direct output of the s plane controller is force and moment it can be understood as the current input under the size of the action of the controller u 1 and u 2 are the control input e h v and e p v are the deviation of heave velocity and pitch angular velocity s controlled quantity e h v and e p are the change rate of deviation of heave velocity and pitch angular velocity s controlled quantity prior to the model tests a mathematical simulation of the entire system was carried out multiple simulations were conducted to determine the appropriate parameters certainly the relevant controller parameters were also debugged on site the numerical values of heave and pitch of the trimaran were obtained according to the cfd simulation table 6 shows the controller s parameters 5 results and discussion 5 1 comparison with the fixed appendages fig 16 shows the condition with 18 knots ssn3 fig 16 a and b present the results of the heave and pitch comparison and the attack angle changes of the t foil and flap are shown in fig 16 c and d similarly the other conditions 18 knots ssn4 40 knots ssn3 40 knots ssn4 are shown in figs 17 19 in the case of 18 knots because the carriage requires time and distance to accelerate and decelerate the effective time of a model test is approximately 50 55 s in the case of 40 knots each valid time is approximately 20 25 s to make a wider data comparison professional data analysis software was used to superimpose the two sets of experimental data the attack angle of the flap cannot be directly observed as the trimaran s stern will generate waves when carrying out the model test please see fig 6 c only the angle of the attack curve of the flap can be obtained please see fig 16 d fig 19 d in fig 20 only the variation of the attack angle of the t foil in the model tests can be seen then quantitative calculation was performed for the irregular waves test table 7 shows the results of the trimaran s vertical stabilization effect including the trimaran with fixed appendages and actively controlled appendages under four conditions 18 knots ssn3 18 knots ssn4 40 knots ssn3 and 40 knots ssn4 moreover r h f and r p f represent the heave and pitch reduction rates of the trimaran with fixed appendages the comparison of the controlled and fixed appendages is necessary the trimaran with fixed appendages was investigated in a towing tank appendix a shows the part results of the trimaran with fixed appendages fig 21 shows the comparison of the fixed appendages and the rfmd k controlled results 5 2 comparison with the different uncoupled strategies for comparison the authors performed tests in the same trimaran with different uncoupled strategies zeng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the uncoupled method was performed on the basis of the trimaran s mathematical model the heave reduction rates in the four conditions above were 35 13 27 63 32 47 and 29 32 and the pitch reduction rates were 48 25 36 41 41 04 and 38 65 respectively moreover liu et al 2019 used the uncoupled method of the rfmd strategy to uncouple the t foil and flap with the heave reduction rates in the four conditions above being 46 69 37 20 36 37 and 31 31 and the pitch reduction rate is 57 82 41 03 58 79 and 40 67 respectively the comparison results are shown in fig 22 a and b and indicate that the rfmd k strategy proposed in this paper has a better motion reduction effect than the rfmd and the controlled method based on the trimaran s mathematical model in most cases statistically 6 conclusions this study investigated a trimaran s heave and pitch motions reduction in the presence of irregular waves a t foil and flap were selected as the appendages for trimaran stabilization the control strategy of the rfmd k was adopted for the uncoupled appendages along with an s plane controller and the experimental results show an obvious reduction in the trimaran s heave and pitch motion however the controller was based on the collected data sensor fault must be considered in a future study a fault tolerant controller could be designed for trimaran s vertical stabilization moreover the appendages control algorithm and controller parameters must be optimized to improve the effectiveness of the stabilization during high speed sailing the actuator is not full fig 18 c and d fig 19 c and d and is mainly affected by two factors one is that the bow of a trimaran has an upward tendency while sailing which causes the controller to misjudge the value of the pitch and heave motion the other factor is the insufficient response time of the actuator at a high speed which means that the performance of the actuator is not fully utilized although the appendages will produce greater force and moment at a high speed for high speed navigation a faster response time by the actuator is required and the problem of bow upward must be solved these issues will be considered in future research finally the scaled trimaran model investigated in this article is intended to be applied to a full scale trimaran a full scale trimaran will be tested at sea after solving the c above mentioned

21222,this study experimentally investigated a control method for the vertical stabilization of a trimaran experiments were conducted on a bare trimaran a trimaran with fixed appendages and one with actively controlled appendages a t foil and flap were selected as the stability appendages and installed on the vessel whose dimension and installation position are provided next the t foil and flap were uncoupled and the stabilization controller for motion reduction of the trimaran was designed on the basis of the idea of the resultant force and moment with kalman filter rfmd k finally the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the appendages and the proposed controller keywords trimaran vertical motion control t foil and flap rfmd k model test 1 introduction as a trimaran has a wide deck can move at high speed and features excellent anti rolling performances it has become a popular type of marine vessel fang and chen 2008 however vertical motion is violent when a trimaran sails and large vertical motion can include heave and pitch motion that can cause damage to the equipment on the trimaran the vertical acceleration caused by the heave and pitch motion is the principal factor behind seasickness in crew and passengers on board fang and chan 2007 as a ship stabilization method installed appendages are widely used the usual appendage suite for a mono hull is a bilge fin rudder etc fins and rudders are often utilized in anti rolling approaches sharif et al 1996 tanguy et al 2003 surendran et al 2007 liang et al 2018 and fins are also used to reduce the vertical motion of ships four fins were used for pitch stabilization and experiments featuring regular and irregular waves were carried out huang et al 2018 the results showed that with regular waves the effectiveness of the appendages is related to the wavelength and wave height the maximum pitch motion can be reduced by 89 91 and the pitch motion can be reduced by approximately 31 at state 5 and 23 at sea state 6 t foil and flaps were used in mono hull and multihull aranda et al 2001 2005 santos et al 2005 the appendages include active and passive components with passive appendages being convenient for installation however the effectiveness of the fixed appendage for improving ship stability performance is not obvious and hence the actively controlled appendages appear to improve the effect of ship stabilization zong et al 2019a conducted studied stability control for a trimaran in irregular waves fixed and controlled t foil experiments were all performed in a towing tank in different installation positions of the side hull the fixed and controlled appendages were effective in improving stability performance moreover in most cases the effectiveness of a controlled appendage in reducing trimaran s motion was significantly greater than in the case of a passive appendage in zong et al 2019b the researchers investigated a trimaran with fixed and actively controlled t foil and the results revealed that the actively controlled t foil could improve the effect of heave and pitch motion by approximately 20 over the use of fixed t foil in regular waves the actively controlled appendage must be motor driven and requires a hardware system hydraulic cylinder and control algorithm the control algorithm is critical to the controller s design in ship stabilization control algorithm design the proportion integration differential pid controller is always used in ship motion control a t foil and two flaps were applied to reduce the vertical motion of a ferry and worst vertical acceleration wva was used as the pd controller s index cruz et al 2004 esteban et al 2005 the results showed that the appendages effectively reduced the ship s vertical motion after that an advanced controller including a robust controller hinostroza et al 2015 zhu and du 2020 yu et al 2017 sliding mode controller liu et al 2016 and model predictive controller liu et al 2011 was also designed for ship motion control ertogan et al 2016 proposed intelligent control with particle swarm optimization algorithm for ship roll motion reduction and luo et al 2017 indicated a robust adaptive fin controller using a feedforward neural network the above mentioned research results have had an admirable effect on simulations however in the experimental environment the controllers mentioned above are accompanied by some restrictions the main problem is ship model uncertainly six control models including a pitch control model heave control mode and local control mode for the ride control system rcs alavimehr et al 2017 2019 with each control mode being divided into linear and nonlinear versions the results verified that the method achieves good performance for catamaran stabilization however only regular waves have been studied in this context in actual ship sailing wave disturbance is irregular in light of the actual wave situation this paper analyzes a method for controlling the stability of a trimaran subjected to irregular waves under irregular wave conditions the controller must be robust therefore for this study an s plane controller was chosen the structure of the s plane controller corresponds to a pid the structure of the s plane controller is similar to a pid and can be regarded as a nonlinear pid cruz et al 2004 considered an uncoupled method for the t foil and flap in conjunction with a pd controller the results showed that the controller has an excellent effect but the uncoupled strategy is complex and sometimes not convenient for use in experiments therefore a novel uncoupled method that makes use of an s plane controller is proposed in this paper and is applied to the vertical motion control of a trimaran compared with previous works the key innovations of this paper are summarized as follows 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation is introduced as an auxiliary tool in the control system the range of a trimaran s force moment heave related motion heave displacement heave velocity and heave acceleration and pitch related motion pitch angle pitch angular velocity and pitch angle acceleration are calculated according to the cfd simulation an approximate control gain was obtained by calculating the corresponding coefficient 2 two control channels were designed for heave and pitch motion reduction in the pitch motion channel design the wave moment is the key factor determining the pitch motion in the heave motion channel design the pitch related term is regarded as the disturbance term using the s plane controller the disturbance term could be suppressed 3 rfmd k is applied in the control system the essence of the algorithm is the use of the force of appendages to inhibit the wave force acting on the trimaran and the use of the appendages moment to inhibit the wave moment acting on the vessel the heave velocity and pitch angular velocity were used as the feedback values through kalman filtering displacement and acceleration were converted into velocity values then the controller inversely resolved the corresponding force and moment through velocity value feedback and control gain and then inversely solves the appendages attack angle the structure of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the structure and parameters of the experimental trimaran t foil and flap section 3 outlines the conditions of the experiment with respect to irregular waves in section 4 the details of the controller design are presented section 5 shows the results of the test a comparison is made of the bare trimaran the trimaran with fixed appendages and that with actively controlled appendages finally section 6 concludes the study 2 description of the trimaran and appendages the trimaran s vertical motion equations are given by zong et al 2019b 1 m a 33 x 3 b 33 x 3 c 33 x 3 a 35 x 5 b 35 x 5 c 35 x 5 f 3 2 i a 55 x 5 b 55 x 5 c 55 x 5 a 53 x 3 b 53 x 3 c 53 x

b i j is the damping coefficients and c i j is the restoring coefficient f 3 and m 5 are the amplitude of wave force and moment respectively to investigate the stabilization method for reducing motion of the trimaran a model trimaran model was built its parameters are listed in table 1 and fig 1 shows the trimaran model itself fig 1 a and b show views of the model from different perspectives and

gain of the kalman filter q process noise matrix r measurement noise matrix h measurement coefficient matrix z measurement vector t sample time t wave period in regular waves because the motion of the trimaran is mainly caused by the wave force and moment the key to reducing the motion is therefore to inhibit the wave force and moment then the appendages can be installed on the trimaran the force and moment provided by appendages can inhibit the wave force and moment the equation for the lift force and moment of the t foil can be expressed as lewis 1988 3 f t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c l θ t 4 m t f t l t where ρ is the seawater density s is the area of the t foil u is the velocity of the trimaran c l is the lift coefficient θ t is the attack angle and l t is the distance between the center of the t foil and the center of the trimaran f t m t are the t foil force and moment respectively to control the attack angle of the t foil and flap it is necessary to change the lift force and moment provided by the t foil and flap are required for the sake of convenience the slope of the lift force s curve must be calculated and the relationship between the lift force and attack angle can be directly obtained then eq 3 can be rewritten as 5 f t 1 2 ρ s u 2 c l θ 1 k t θ t 6 m t f t l t k t l t θ t similarly the equation for the lift force and moment of the flap can be expressed as 7 f f k f θ f 8 m f k f l f θ f where l f is the distances of the flap relative to the center of the trimaran f f and m f are the force and moment of the flap respectively k t and k f are the lift force s slopes of t foil and flap in liu et al 2019 the authors showed that the values of k t and k f can be calculated through cfd simulation and polynomial fitting the value of k t and k f are 53 8 and 80 6 at 40 knots and 10 63 and 19 34 at 18 knots respectively the range of t foil s maximum angle is 15 whereas the flap is 0 15 the flap is usually installed in the central position of the range and the rotational range is equivalent to 7 5 kawazoe et al 1994 through the calculation the slope of the lift force on the t foil and flap with different attack angles and different velocity is obtained the stability

presented and marked fig 6 c is the position of the sensor installed the heave displacement data are measured using an ultrasonic sensor and the pitch angle is measured using the posture sensor the acceleration data of the heave and pitch are measured using accelerometers which are installed in the bow stern and center of the trimaran the accelerometers are installed inside of the trimaran fig 6 d and e show the composition of the actuator the towing tank has a wave damper region and the plan graph of the towing tank is shown in fig 7 for an irregular wave the conditions of the trimaran s model tests are listed in table 4 h s represents the significant wave height the trimaran s velocities were 2 93 m s and 6 51 m s which are equivalent to 18 knots and 40 knots respectively because the trimaran is a 1 10 model the displacement and acceleration data of the heave and pitch were measured using an ultrasonic sensor an accelerometer and a posture sensor the acceleration sensor was installed at the center bow and stern of the vessel the ultrasonic sensor was installed on the carriage through a threaded connection and its position corresponded to the center of the trimaran fig 6 c when performing the model tests the position of the carriage was fixed directly above the trimaran when the trimaran moved up and down under the action of the waves the ultrasonic sensor obtained its heave data in accordance with the trimaran s up or down movement the posture sensor was installed on the bow of the vessel the installation positions of sensors are shown in fig 6 c the performance parameters including the range resolution of the sensors are listed in table 5 3 1 data processing for data processing the data on the heave displacement pitch angle and acceleration were regarded as wave data in the irregular wave experiment multiple tests were carried out the wave height pitch and heave data should be taken as the average of multiple tests note the trimaran with actively controlled appendages marked by subscript s y and without them marked by subscript s w the result of the motion is a significant value under two conditions namely 9 h s w i 1 n h s w i n 10 h s y i 1 n h s y i n 11 θ s w i 1 n θ s w i n 12 θ s y i 1 n θ s y i n where h s w h s y θ s w and θ s y represent the heave data of the bare trimaran heave data of the trimaran with actively controlled appendages pitch data of the bare trimaran and pitch data of the trimaran with actively controlled appendages respectively n is the number of model tests i 1 2 3 n on this basis the stabilization effect of the vertical motion during the model test was calculated as 13 r h c h s y h s w h s w 100 14 r p c θ s y θ s w θ s w 100 where r h c and r p c are the heave and pitch reduction rates in actively controlled conditions respectively the data from the experiment were not smooth and the burr could lead to an error in data processing when using the statistical algorithm the results will not be accuracy therefore the first priority was to smoothen the data the conventional method for this is the moving average filter and the effectiveness of the method is illustrated in fig 8 the case is 18 knots ssn4 and heave displacement fig 8 shows the moving average filter for experimental data processing fig 8 a displays the unfiltered data and fig 8 b shows the filtered data in fig 8 the smoothing result has been achieved and the smoothing method does not affect the amplitude of the heave motion the data processing requires to count the amplitude of the heave and pitch motions therefore it was necessary to obtain the crest and trough of the heave and pitch motions this step is described as follows 1 finding the position of crest and trough value to find the position of the crest and trough values in the data it is important to find the position of data s extreme points first we should differentiate the data as we can then find out the difference value of adjacent elements then we introduce the signum function sign and use it for the differences between the above mentioned adjacent elements next we continue to solve for the differences between the adjacent elements for the value obtained in the previous step after that elements greater than 0 are identified note that after solving the difference the returned data will be one less than the original data therefore the position of the crest should be added to the position noted above the matlab command is p crest find diff sign diff data 0 1 similarly the command in finding the position of the trough is p trough find diff sign diff data 0 1 2 obtaining the value of crest and trough in the analysis of step 1 the position of the crest and trough were identified then we merely needed to find the data corresponding to the position the commands were v crest data crest and v trough data trough on the basis of the description of the previous two steps the effect is shown in fig 9 which is an example of how to obtain the wave height of the motion the data are derived from a set of heave data of the model tests 3 solving the motion wave height the motion data are treated as the wave height based on step 2 and the motion wave height can be obtained through the motion wave height crest trough command 3 2 irregular waves in the model tests in the irregular wave experiment the wave spectrum was given by faulknotser 1989 15 s ζ ω 173 h s 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 where h s is the significant wave height t 1 is the wave period ω is the circular wave frequency and s ζ ω is the power spectral density the wave amplitude of the random wave can be represented as perez 2005 16 ζ t n 1 n ζ a n cos ω n t ε n where ζ t is the amplitude of random waves n is the total number of superimposed harmonics ζ a n and ε n are the amplitude and phase of n t h respectively in the model tests because the trimaran model is a scale model the wave height and period were changed based on froude s scaling law the wave height of ssn 3 and ssn 4 as used in this test are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a and b are the wave views of ssn 3 and ssn 4 respectively 4 controller design to improve the stabilization effect the actively controlled appendages were applied to the trimaran therefore the controller design was required the motion equations of the trimaran with the t foil and flap were rewritten as 17 m a 33 x 3 b 33 x 3 c 33 x 3 a 35 x 5 b 35 x 5 c 35 x 5 f r 18 i a 55 x 5 b 55 x 5 c 55 x 5 a 53 x 3 b 53 x 3 c 53 x 3 m r where f r f 3 f t f f m r m 5 m t m f for the trimaran s vertical stabilization controller design the first step was to determine the correct logic relationship between the trimaran s motion trend and the actuator s attack angle tendency the heave motion is the trimaran s centroid upward and downward motions the pitch motion includes two conditions the trimaran s bow moving upward and its stern moving downward and its bow being downward and the stern upward fig 11 shows the logical relationship between the appendages and the vessel in fig 11 the number 1 and 2 represent the heave motions and pitch motions respectively the appendages are used to produce the damping force and moment that prevent the wave force and moment acting on the trimaran in the model test the attack angle of appendages was changed based on the controller 4 1 control strategy the pitch dynamics uncoupled from heave for the controller design and the model are represented by basturk et al 2015 19 i a 55 x 5 t b 55 x 5 t c 55 x 5 t b 1 u 1 t m 5 e t eq 19 can be rewritten as 20 i a 55 x 5 t b 55 x 5 t c 55 x 5 t m 5 t b 1 u 1 t it can be seen from above eq 20 that the term relating to heave motion is removed this means that the pitch angle pitch angular velocity and pitch angle acceleration primarily relate to the wave moment for the pitch motion model of the trimaran the heave coupling is removed and the s plane controller is designed to reduce the pitch motion combined with eq 1 the heave motion with control force can be written as 21 m a 33 x 3 t b 33 x 3 t c 33 x 3 t f 3 e t b 2 u 2 t f d where f d a 35 x 5 t b 35 x 5 t c 35 x 5 t f d can be used as a disturbance term for the controller design we used the s plane controller the s plane has the advantages of higher control accuracy robustness and anti interference ability zhao et al 2019 liao et al 2017 thus the disturbance term can be suppressed by employing the s plane controller the pitch coupling amount f d can also be used as the disturbance term of the heave motion model and the s plane controller can be used to reduce the heave motion on the basis of the analysis above the rfmd k algorithm with the s plane controller is proposed and summarized in section 4 3 the core principle of the method is as follows the heave and pitch motions of the trimaran are primarily caused by the wave disturbance the controller is designed to control and change the attack angle of the appendages in order to suppress the wave disturbance as much as possible it can be seen in eqs 1 and 2 that both the wave force and moment can generate heave and pitch motions which means that both the t foil and flap have an impact on heave and pitch consequently the control input of the appendages must be uncoupled basturk et al 2015 considered the moment to produce pitch related motion the pitch coupling term in the heave motion was regarded as a disturbance term and it can be approximated that force related to the heave motion duo of the controller can suppress the disturbance fig 12 shows the description between the appendages and the wave force and moment fig 12 can be divided into two stages the first stage is the wave disturbance acting on the vessel and the second is the force and moment of appendages that inhibit the wave disturbance then the remaining wave force and moment act on the trimaran 4 2 role of cfd in the control system targeting the wave force and moment was difficult especially in an actual marine environment therefore for this stabilization investigation a cfd simulation was used to obtain the wave force and moment in recent years cfd simulations have played a key role in the design and analysis of ships in the simulation of ship motion the commercial software star ccm is more widely used for instance the related fluid dynamics phenomena of a stepped planing hull and full scale ship performance in the head sea were analyzed by means of cfd simulations de marco et al 2017 tezdogan et al 2015 the results of which proved the reliability and accuracy of the simulation in our research cfd simulations were used to assist in the calculation of forces moments and motion of the trimaran fig 13 shows the flowchart of the numerical simulation and experiment the first step was to build a 3d model of the trimaran based on the profile and parameters and then the model was analyzed using the cfd software the simulation results were compared to the experimental results and the simulation results were verified as feasible next the simulation of the trimaran with a fixed t foil and flap was performed the results showed the design and installation position of the appendages were effective in reducing motion finally the experiment was performed with the control algorithm appendix b shows the cfd calculation condition the comparison of cfd simulation and model tests in regular waves is given as an example which proves cfd simulation is feasible 4 3 rfmd k algorithm step 1 obtaining the corresponding coefficient the corresponding coefficient of force to heave velocity and moment to pitch angular velocity were obtained through the cfd simulation the correspondence coefficient or gain was not a directly proportional relationship from the perspective of control was an approximation value the condition of the model test was simulated by the cfd software the introduction and role of cfd were mentioned in section 4 2 from the cfd simulation the maximum and minimum force and moment acting on the trimaran could be solved in other words the range of force and moment acting on the trimaran could be solved by simulation simultaneously heave related and pitch related motions heave displacement heave velocity heave acceleration pitch angle pitch angular velocity and pitch angle acceleration were also solved on the basis of the analysis result in section 4 1 the heave related motion corresponded to the force and pitch related motion corresponded to the moment by maintaining the control motions within their maximum range of physical movement the gain between force to heave velocity and moment to pitch angular velocity was selected as 23 k p v m 5 max p max step 2 design of pitch channel controller the controller design was divided into two independent channels one was the heave channel and the other was the pitch channel step 2 describes the design of the pitch channel controller the pitch dynamics uncoupled from heave for the controller design and model are incorporated into eq 20 basturk et al 2015 the s plane was designed here the total control moment could be solved using the s plane controller μ 1 is written as 24 u 1 2 0 1 0 exp k p p e p v k p d e p v 1 0 1 u 1 1 and 25 b 1 k p v 26 m 5 b 1 u 1 where u 1 is the control input of the pitch controller channel k p p and k p d are the parameter of the controller e p v and e p v are the deviation of the controlled quantity and the change rate of the deviation respectively step 3 design of heave channel controller the heave motion is described in eq 21 similarly the s plane controller was used to reduce the heave motion here the total control force could be calculated for the heave dynamics of the trimaran pitch coupling was regarded as a disturbance term because the s plane controller has an anti interference capacity the disturbance term was suppressed in the model tests then using the s plane controller u 2 is written as 27 u 2 2 0 1 0 exp k h p e h v k h d e h v 1 0 1 u 2 1 and 28 b 2 k h v 29 f 3 b 2 u 2 where u 2 is the control input of the heave controller channel k h p and k h d are the parameter of the controller e h v and e h v are the deviation of the controlled quantity and the change rate of the deviation respectively step 4 solution to attack angle of appendage using the force and moment of appendages to inhibit the wave force and moment acting on the trimaran the formula is yielded as 30 f 3 f t f f 31 m 5 f t l t f f l f form eqs 30 and 31 f t and f f can be obtained as 32 f t m 5 f 3 l f l t l f 33 f f f 3 l t m 5 l t l f then the attack angles of the appendage are solved as 34 θ t f t k t m 5 f 3 l f k t l t l f 35 θ f f f k f f 3 l t m 5 k f l t l f the matrix form of eqs 34 and 35 is written as 36 θ t θ f k t k f k t l t k f l f 1 f 3 m 5 through multiple cfd simulations the range of gain is obtained after the gain has obtained the matrix is rewritten as 37 θ t θ f k t k f k t l t k f l f 1 f 3 m 5 k t k f k t l t k f l f 1 b 1 u 1 b 2 u 2 utilizing the idea of rfmd k combined with the controller the angle of attack of the accessory can be calculated in real time so that the appendages can generate control force and moment on the trimaran and achieve the goal of reducing heave and pitch motion the s plane controller with the rfmd k was utilized for the trimaran s motion stabilization control the method used the force of appendages to inhibit the wave disturbance on the basis of the data on displacement angle and acceleration using a kalman filter welch and bishop 1997 the data on heave velocity and pitch angular velocity could be estimated fig 14 shows the control system and the uncoupled block is shown in fig 15 δ f and δ m represent real time changing of forces and moments 4 4 explanation of the algorithm f t and f f could be obtained through the wave force and moment and the attack angles of appendage which were obtained according to f t and f f in real time to solve f t and f f f 3 and m 5 are required however in the actual experiment the wave force and moment were generally difficult to obtain the wave force moment heave velocity pitch angular velocity can be monitored by means of cfd simulation then the gain between the force to heave velocity and moment to pitch angular velocity could be obtained to maintain the control motions within their maximum range of physical movement the gain was selected as k h v f 3 max h max and k p v m 5 max p max k h v is the relationship between the wave force and the heave velocity and k p v is the relationship between the wave moment and the pitch angular velocity from liu et al 2019 the resultant force and moment distribution rfmd was used for the same trimaran s vertical stabilization control the method directly used the heave displacement and pitch angle as the feedback values the experimental results proved that the method was effective however the displacement indicates that motion had occurred and the velocity represents its tendency therefore for a better effect it was necessary to restrain the motion s tendency in this study the heave velocity and pitch angular velocity were used as the feedback values the velocity value could be obtained using a sensor and kalman filter this study used the data of displacement and acceleration to estimate the velocity data with the kalman filter the discrete time form of kalman filter is shown as 38 x k a k 1 x k 1 w k 1 39 z k h k x k v k where k is the discrete time index x k ℝ n is the state vector z k ℝ m is the measurement vector a k ℝ n n is the state transition matrix h k ℝ m n is the observation matrix w k ℝ n is the process noise and v k ℝ m is the measurement noise in velocity value estimation predicting the next state of the system is undertaken as follows 39 x k k 1 a k 1 x k 1 k 1 40 p k k 1 a k 1 p k 1 k 1 a k 1 t q k where p is the covariance matrix q is the process noise matrix then the process of calculating the kalman gain is 41 k k p k k 1 h t h p k k 1 h t r k where k is the gain of the kalman filter and r is the measurement noise matrix combined with the estimated and predicted value the current state value could be estimated as 42 x k k x k k 1 k k z k x k k 1 the update covariance is 43 p k k 1 k k p k k 1 in the description above the matrix a and h are defined as a 1 t 0 0 1 t 0 0 1 h 1 0 0 0 0 1 the direct output of the s plane controller is force and moment it can be understood as the current input under the size of the action of the controller u 1 and u 2 are the control input e h v and e p v are the deviation of heave velocity and pitch angular velocity s controlled quantity e h v and e p are the change rate of deviation of heave velocity and pitch angular velocity s controlled quantity prior to the model tests a mathematical simulation of the entire system was carried out multiple simulations were conducted to determine the appropriate parameters certainly the relevant controller parameters were also debugged on site the numerical values of heave and pitch of the trimaran were obtained according to the cfd simulation table 6 shows the controller s parameters 5 results and discussion 5 1 comparison with the fixed appendages fig 16 shows the condition with 18 knots ssn3 fig 16 a and b present the results of the heave and pitch comparison and the attack angle changes of the t foil and flap are shown in fig 16 c and d similarly the other conditions 18 knots ssn4 40 knots ssn3 40 knots ssn4 are shown in figs 17 19 in the case of 18 knots because the carriage requires time and distance to accelerate and decelerate the effective time of a model test is approximately 50 55 s in the case of 40 knots each valid time is approximately 20 25 s to make a wider data comparison professional data analysis software was used to superimpose the two sets of experimental data the attack angle of the flap cannot be directly observed as the trimaran s stern will generate waves when carrying out the model test please see fig 6 c only the angle of the attack curve of the flap can be obtained please see fig 16 d fig 19 d in fig 20 only the variation of the attack angle of the t foil in the model tests can be seen then quantitative calculation was performed for the irregular waves test table 7 shows the results of the trimaran s vertical stabilization effect including the trimaran with fixed appendages and actively controlled appendages under four conditions 18 knots ssn3 18 knots ssn4 40 knots ssn3 and 40 knots ssn4 moreover r h f and r p f represent the heave and pitch reduction rates of the trimaran with fixed appendages the comparison of the controlled and fixed appendages is necessary the trimaran with fixed appendages was investigated in a towing tank appendix a shows the part results of the trimaran with fixed appendages fig 21 shows the comparison of the fixed appendages and the rfmd k controlled results 5 2 comparison with the different uncoupled strategies for comparison the authors performed tests in the same trimaran with different uncoupled strategies zeng et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the uncoupled method was performed on the basis of the trimaran s mathematical model the heave reduction rates in the four conditions above were 35 13 27 63 32 47 and 29 32 and the pitch reduction rates were 48 25 36 41 41 04 and 38 65 respectively moreover liu et al 2019 used the uncoupled method of the rfmd strategy to uncouple the t foil and flap with the heave reduction rates in the four conditions above being 46 69 37 20 36 37 and 31 31 and the pitch reduction rate is 57 82 41 03 58 79 and 40 67 respectively the comparison results are shown in fig 22 a and b and indicate that the rfmd k strategy proposed in this paper has a better motion reduction effect than the rfmd and the controlled method based on the trimaran s mathematical model in most cases statistically 6 conclusions this study investigated a trimaran s heave and pitch motions reduction in the presence of irregular waves a t foil and flap were selected as the appendages for trimaran stabilization the control strategy of the rfmd k was adopted for the uncoupled appendages along with an s plane controller and the experimental results show an obvious reduction in the trimaran s heave and pitch motion however the controller was based on the collected data sensor fault must be considered in a future study a fault tolerant controller could be designed for trimaran s vertical stabilization moreover the appendages control algorithm and controller parameters must be optimized to improve the effectiveness of the stabilization during high speed sailing the actuator is not full fig 18 c and d fig 19 c and d and is mainly affected by two factors one is that the bow of a trimaran has an upward tendency while sailing which causes the controller to misjudge the value of the pitch and heave motion the other factor is the insufficient response time of the actuator at a high speed which means that the performance of the actuator is not fully utilized although the appendages will produce greater force and moment at a high speed for high speed navigation a faster response time by the actuator is required and the problem of bow upward must be solved these issues will be considered in future research finally the scaled trimaran model investigated in this article is intended to be applied to a full scale trimaran a full scale trimaran will be tested at sea after solving the c above mentioned

21223,spar type floating wind turbines exposed to marine environment experience significant vibration which is more prominent under wind wave misalignment this unavoidable vibration particularly in the sway direction affects overall performance and can induce significant damage to sensitive electro mechanical components leading to downtime for maintenance with this in view the present study aims to propose a modified spar torus combination by introducing spring and dashpot in between so that it can work as an isolator first a comprehensive mathematical model for this multi body system is developed using kane s approach with proper aero elastic and hydrodynamic simulation for this purpose 3d wind fields are generated in turbsim and the waves are simulated from pierson moskovitch spectrum considering wind wave correlation and misalignment aerodynamic loads are computed using modified blade element momentum theory while and hydrodynamic loads are generated using morison s equation using these inputs the response of the modified spar torus combination is solved which demonstrates the efficiency and advantage of the proposed vibration isolation different sea states and wind conditions are simulated replicating the actual scenario to investigate the performance envelope of the proposed controller for spar type floating wind turbines keywords floating wind turbine bem theory spar torus combinations pierson moskovitch spectrum morison s equation kane s equation 1 introduction spar type floating offshore wind turbines consist of mooring supports floating spar a long and flexible tower supporting nacelle and rotor at the top unlike onshore turbines which are exposed to turbulent wind the primary source of vibration for offshore floating turbines is the hydrodynamic load in this structural set up small vibration of spar i e tower base due to sea wave can cause an amplified response at the nacelle i e tower top it is more pronounced under wind wave misalignment which is often reflected in the side to side response of tower or nacelle this unwanted side wise vibration can cause significant damage to electro mechanical systems notably the gearbox in this context gearbox maintenance costs maximum revenue loss and downtime for any operational wind turbine therefore nacelle vibration especially in the side to side direction should be kept as minimum as possible due to this reason the research activities in the recent past have been focused on different aspects of efficient modelling analysis and design of wind turbines among them vibration control has remained an open problem for the wind turbine industry li et al 2020 have explored the effects of the yaw error and wind wave misalignment on the dynamics and power generation of floating turbines using fast their study indicates that yaw error can result in reduced power generation without adverse effects while wind wave misalignment significantly affects the dynamics of the structure kyle et al 2020 have investigated the propeller and vortex ring states of nrel 5 mw floating turbine when subjected to strong waves and low wind using cfd analysis their study has shown that negative thrust can occur in regions of high twist angles li et al 2019 have also studied the dynamics of a semi submerged offshore wind turbine subjected to turbulent wind flow to investigate the effects of wind shear turbulence intensity and coherence on the responses of the turbine structure they have noticed that increased turbulence can create violent shaking of the platform which in turn increases structural loads on the turbine significantly they have suggested the use of a partial coherence structure to ensure the safety of the wind turbine liu et al 2019 have analysed the reliability of floating wind turbine considering wind and wave loads with no misalignment between them they have observed that edgewise blade response can be considerably larger in offshore turbines compared to its onshore counterpart thereby adversely affecting the fatigue life at the blade root besides improved analysis and design of turbines vibration control also plays a significant role in performance enhancement skaree et al skaare et al 2007 have studied the effects of conventional generator torque and blade pitch control strategies on fatigue life of floating wind turbines in this context both torque and pitch control reduce loads on the turbine where torque control operates below the rated speed while pitch control works above it but there are design limitations with these strategies e g power output fluctuations and stress development in electro mechanical components horiuchi and kawahito 2001 other than these techniques several studies have been carried out in the recent past on vibration control of wind turbine structures using different passive or semi active devices lackner and rotea 2011a 2011b sun 2018 has investigated the performance of semi active tuned mass dampers for vibrations mitigation of floating turbines considering wind wave misalignment however the tuned mass damper can create adverse effects and increase the response of several components particularly under wind wave misalignment also one of the significant problems with tuned mass dampers is housing a large mass within the tower or nacelle which has limited or no space other advanced methods like rotational inertia of double tuned mass damper garrido et al 2013 magneto rheological tuned liquid column damper sarkar and chakraborty 2018 tuned mass damper inerter system marian and giaralis 2014 sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 have been extensively studied for vibration control of turbines park et al 2020 have suggested orthogonal tuned liquid column dampers inside the nacelle to control the fore aft and side to side responses of floating turbines besides these passive devices the performance of individual blade pitch control ibp and disturbance accommodating control dac strategies for floating offshore wind turbines have been investigated by namik and stol 2010 2011 their study has shown improvement of different structural performances e g platform pitching motion fatigue load on turbine blades and side to side motion of tower thereby reducing power fluctuations sarkar et al 2020 have proposed a multi resolution wavelet pitch controller for improving the dynamics of spar type offshore wind turbines their control algorithm has shown a reduction of aerodynamic loads and subsequent dynamic responses in all modes madsen et al 2020 have experimentally studied different close and open loop control strategies on the scaled model of a 10 mw turbine supported by tension leg platforms they have noticed that surge motion of the turbine governs the tension in the mooring cables at the same time negative aerodynamic damping of the controller can increase the vibration leading to higher responses in the surge which can cause increased stresses and failure of the supporting structures han and nagamune 2019 have studied platform position control in offshore wind farms to mitigate the effect of aerodynamic wakes considering disturbances in the wind and wave loading their study has shown that with the use of linear quadratic integrator control algorithm adequately designed to achieve the targeted platform positions can maximize the power output by substantially reducing the wake effects as vibration control of wind turbine is currently an active area of research new ideas and techniques are coming up very often and the industries have also embraced some of these options for further development jensen 2016 smith 2002 for example spar torus combination stc has been proposed by muliawan et al 2012 where a donut shaped wave energy converter wec is attached with the spar type floating wind turbine fwt although torus designed in this format does not help in controlling spar vibration its performance in trapping additional wave energy is impressive later other studies have investigated its effect on the structural responses and power generation in both operational and extreme sea conditions muliawan et al 2013a 2013b 2013c these studies have observed that combining torus with a spar can increase power production however it can also increase forces in mooring lines with additional bending moments in the tower causing new challenges in design against ultimate limit state and fatigue wan et al 2014 have conducted laboratory tests on possible slamming effect and green water effect of stc their studies have shown that submerging the torus in case of extreme sea conditions can reduce the forces induced in the mooring lines and also the bending moments in the tower ren et al 2020 have developed a new concept by combining wave energy converters wec in the tension leg platform tlp of a floating wind turbine dynamic responses of the combined system have been studied numerically and experimentally with a scaled model that has a fair agreement although the primary focus of these studies is on harnessing wave energy in operational sea states the use of torus to control the response has not been investigated yue et al 2020 have studied the positive effects of installing a heave plate in the spar of the floating offshore wind turbines ren et al 2015 have estimated the long term performances and fatigue life of stc using a simplified thrust model of wind loading they have also developed two different survival modes to reduce long term fatigue damage and extreme responses 1 1 motivation and problem formulation the literature review presented above clearly outlines the need for vibration control of a floating wind turbine under different operational conditions in this context spar type floating turbines have proved themselves as a viable option for deep sea wind farms availability of strong wind for longer duration in the marine environment makes them more profitable in the long run however they are exposed to a significant level of vibration due to the combined action of aero hydrodynamic loads although previous studies have proposed different strategies for vibration control it has remained an open problem in this context stc shows promising results in terms of power generation due to wave energy conversion however stc in its present form does not offer significant vibration control this motivates to investigate the design of spar type floater by modifying the torus to act as a vibration isolator thus the objectives of this study are as follows develop the concept of modified spar torus combination by introducing spring and dashpot for wave load isolation to improve the dynamics of spar type floaters this spring and dashpot in between spar and torus have the potential to isolate hydrodynamic loads from the spar thereby reducing its response significantly the energy is dissipated as the torus is allowed to vibrate in the surge i e along wind and sway i e side to side as the wave loads are higher near the surface an adequately designed torus is bound to provide significant vibration control particularly under wind wave misalignment formulate detailed mathematical model using kane s approach for a modified spar torus combination attached to the mooring cables this multi body dynamic framework helps to reduce the degrees of freedom to its minimum while modelling the highly non linear system of a floating turbine assembly demonstrate the performance of the proposed modified spar torus combination under the different operational scenario in the marine environment to examine its performance envelope particularly in sway i e side to side direction which is the main objective of this work 1 2 description of modified spar torus combination the spar torus combination muliawan et al 2012 has a light donut shaped floating buoy i e torus as a wave energy converter this combination is modified in this study where the torus is used as a floater that isolates wave energy as stated above the modified spar torus combination mstc refer fig 1 acts as a vibration absorber that primarily controls the response of a floating wind turbine in passive mode here it may be noted that the magnitude of the hydrodynamic load is maximum near the surface and decreases with depth thus torus encircling the part of the spar near the sea surface effectively isolates the incident hydrodynamic loads fig 1 shows the modified spar torus combination which consists of the following key elements a floating spar is used to support the wind turbine the dimensions of the spar depend on the size of the turbine its power rating water depth and wind profile at the site the spar is moored with the help of catenary to support the turbine a modified torus is a hollow cylindrical shaped floating buoy encircling the spar up to a sufficient depth to effectively isolate wave loads it can move in two orthogonal directions i e surge and sway relative to the spar the ballast tanks inside the spar and torus bring their centre of gravity below their centre of buoyancy to provide sufficient stability to carry a heavy wind turbine on top of it the bearing system along the outer periphery of the spar consists of flexible spring and dashpot as shown in fig 1 to connect the torus with the spar and allowing it to have relative translations in surge and sway and no rotation 2 dynamics of spar type floating wind turbine in this section the dynamics of a spar type offshore wind turbine coupled with a modified torus system is formulated using kane s approach kane and levinson 1985 it is based on the vector representation of forces for solving a multi body dynamic problem which provides significant computational advantages in this approach the offshore floating wind turbine is modelled by 22 degrees of freedom dofs whose details are given in table 1 the proposed modified torus can move in the surge and sway directions with respect to spar hence 2 dofs are considered to model this body each blade is modelled by two flapwise and one edgewise mode as they are found to be effective by most of the previous studies reported in the literature however the formulation is general and can incorporate as many modes necessary for a particular application the tower has two modes in fore aft and side to side direction since the complete system floats on water as a rigid body and free to rotate the nacelle has yaw dof besides two more dofs for generator and hub i e fast and slow moving shafts of the drivetrain thus the complete dofs of the modified spar type floating wind turbine are defined by the following vector 1 u u 1 u 9 b l a d e s u 10 u 13 t o w e r u 14 n a c e l l e u 15 u 16 d r i v e t r a i n u 17 u 22 s p a r u 23 u 24 t o r u s t besides dofs the formulation of the multi body system also demands different coordinates for the global system as well as individual components as described in table 1 the details of these coordinate systems are also marked in fig 2 the global inertial reference frame is defined by x ˆ the local coordinates used in this multi body systems are for spar a ˆ tower top b ˆ nacelle c ˆ low speed shaft d ˆ generator azimuth e ˆ and blades f k ˆ in addition to these coordinates there are separate coordinate systems used for blade coning g k ˆ pitch h k ˆ local structural twist i k ˆ and blade elements b k blade also has two more local coordinates for its deformed elements b k and aerodynamic loads a ˆ e k in this context it may be noted that each coordinate systems have three components along with three orthogonal directions which are marked by appropriate subscripts e g a 1 ˆ a ˆ 2 and a ˆ 3 for the spar in case of coordinate systems having k as subscripts it refers to blade number e g g ˆ k for k 1 2 3 for three blades with another three secondary subscripts for three directions for a particular blade as the spar blades and tower can rotate about more than one axis simultaneously the use of traditional transformation matrices are restricted henceforth small angle approximation kane and levinson 1985 is used to form euler 1 2 3 rotation matrices to establish transformation relation between these coordinate systems which makes the formulation of the matrices independent of the sequence of rotation once the dofs and coordinate systems are defined the governing equation of motion can be formulated using kane s approach derived from newton s law of motion kane s equation for holonomic multi body system can be expressed as a set of scalar equations kane and levinson 1985 2 f i f i 0 f o r i 1 2 n where n is the total number of degrees of freedom in the system for a system comprised of n n bodies with their centre of mass point c k and reference frame x k the generalised active forces for each degree of freedom are given by 3 f i k 1 n v i c k f c k ω i x k m x k in the above equation v i c k is the partial velocity at the center of mass c k while f c k is the corresponding generalized active force acting on the k t h body similarly m x k and ω i x k in the same equation represent the generalized active moment and partial angular velocity of the k t h body with respect to the reference frame x k besides generalized active forces in eq 2 generalised inertial forces are given by 4 f i k 1 n v i c k m k a c k ω i x k i k α x k ω x k i k ω x k where m k and i k are the generalized mass and moment of inertia of the k t h rigid body while a c k and α x k are the generalized linear and angular acceleration with respect to c k as per kane and levinson 1985 total linear and angular velocities of k t h body can be written as a summation of the partial velocities which are given by 5a v c k i 1 n v i c k q i v t c k 5b ω x k i 1 n ω i x k q i ω t x k in the above two equations the first expression within the parentheses on the right hand side i e v i c k q i and ω i x k q i contains the term that can be linearly superimposed to compute the total velocity while the second expression i e v t c k and ω t x k are the terms that do not follow this format kane and levinson 1985 described q i as the generalized speed which is assumed to be the first differential of u i with respect to time i e q i u i therefore partial linear and angular accelerations of the k t h body can be derived from the above equations as 6a a c k i 1 n v i c k u i d d t v i c k u i d d t v t c k 6b α x k i 1 n ω i x k u i d d t ω i x k u i d d t ω t x k as explained for linear and angular velocities in eq 5a and eq 5b linear and angular accelerations also have similar constants i e in parentheses which are shown on the right hand side of eq 6a and eq 6b once the displacement field partial velocities and partial accelerations are defined governing equation of motion can be developed in the inertial reference frame in this context it may be noted that each component present in the multi body system contribute to the generalised inertia forces thus total generalised inertia and active forces are as follows 7 f i f i s f i t w f i n a f i h u f i b 1 f i b 2 f i b 3 f i g n f i t r in this equation first subscript i correspond to the dof while second subscripts s t w n a h u g n and t r represent spar tower nacelle hub generator and torus respectively also second subscripts b 1 b 2 and b 3 in the same equation represent three blades generalised active forces acting on the system consists of external conservative and non conservative forces internal forces in the flexible bodies and reaction forces generating from the constraint relationships between the multiple bodies in the present study friction forces inside the gearbox have been neglected therefore generalized active forces are expressed as follows 8 f i f i s h y f i t r h y f i b 1 a e f i b 2 a e f i b 3 a e f i s g v f i t r g v f i t w g v f i n g v f i h g v f i b 1 g v f i b 2 g v f i b 3 g v f i y s f i g n f i b r f i t w e l f i b 1 e l f i b 2 e l f i b 3 e l f i d t e l f i t r e l f i t w d f i b 1 d f i b 2 d f i b 3 d f i d t d f i t r d where third subscripts h y a e g v y s g n b r e l and d represent hydrodynamic aerodynamic gravitational yaw generator brake elastic and damping components respectively substituting eq 7 and eq 8 into eq 2 and rearranging them in matrix form leads to the following governing equation of motion 9 m u t u f u u t above equation reveals that mass matrix m u t changes with time while the right hand side contains other components like stiffness and damping besides external forces in the following subsections derivation of each component of eq 9 for spar and torus are described derivation for the remaining components of the floating turbine system follow the same principle and hence is omitted here to avoid repetition 2 1 spar in this sub section the governing equation of motion for spar using kane s approach is demonstrated step by step which is assumed to be a rigid body the rationale behind this assumption is that the diameter of the spar is significantly more than the tower which makes it relatively stiffer the motion of the spar is derived from the tower base thus the position vector of the tower base t b with respect to reference frame x ˆ is given by 10 r t b u 17 x ˆ 1 u 18 x ˆ 3 u 19 x ˆ 2 where r t b is the position vector of the tower base which is used to locate the position of the spar now the linear velocity of the reference point t b can be expressed as 11 v t b u 17 x ˆ 1 u 18 x ˆ 3 u 19 x ˆ 2 similarly the angular velocity at the same point is given by 12 ω t b u 20 x ˆ 1 u 21 x ˆ 3 u 22 x ˆ 2 now the position vector r t b s of the center of gravity of spar i e s from the tower base is given by 13 r t b s h s h r a ˆ 2 where h s and h r are the vertical distances from the waterline as marked in fig 1 using eq 11 to eq 13 linear velocity at the center of mass of the spar s is given by 14 v s v t b ω t b r t b s in this formulation time derivatives of the displacement field along the generalized coordinate is termed as the generalized speed i e q i u i using this expression of q i and rearranging eq 11 in the format of eq 5a reveals that the terms that do not follow linear superimposition are zero i e v t t b 0 and the remaining components are given by 15 v i t b x ˆ 1 for i 17 x ˆ 3 for i 18 x ˆ 2 for i 19 similarly using eq 12 in the format of eq 5b indicates that ω t t b 0 and the remaining components are expressed as follows 16 ω i t b x ˆ 1 for i 20 x ˆ 3 for i 21 x ˆ 2 for i 22 using above two expressions for partial linear and angular velocities i e v i t b and ω i t b in their respective total velocities and substituting them in eq 14 it can be concluded that the components of the total linear velocity at the center of mass of the spar s that do not following linear superimposition are zero v t s 0 while the other components are given by 17 v i s v i t b ω i t b r t b s for i 17 22 now using the above expression partial linear acceleration can be derived thus differentiating eq 17 with respect to time leads to the following expression 18 d d t v i s ω i t b ω t b r t b s for i 20 22 moreover as v t s 0 its time derivative is also zero i e d d t v t s 0 once the components of linear accelerations are derived each term of the angular acceleration can also be derived similarly in this context eq 6b for total angular acceleration at the tower base demands differential of eq 15 and eq 16 with respect to time which are zero in this case i e d d t ω i t b 0 for i 20 22 and d d t ω t t b 0 as mentioned earlier the spar is acting as a rigid body attached to the tower base hence all linear velocities and accelerations are calculated with respect to the spar center of mass but the rotational velocities and acceleration of spar are calculated with respect to the tower base using all appropriate expressions of linear and angular velocities and accelerations in eq 4 the generalized inertia force on spar can be expressed as 19 f i s v i s m s a s ω i t b i s α t b ω t b i s ω t b v i s m s i 17 22 v i s u i i 20 22 d d t v i s u i ω i t b i s i 20 22 ω i t b u i ω t b i s ω t b where i s is polar moment of inertia of spar which can be obtained from its three orthogonal components along roll yaw and pitch axis i e subscripts r y and p in the following expression 20 i s i s r a ˆ 1 a ˆ 1 i s y a ˆ 2 a ˆ 2 i s p a ˆ 3 a ˆ 3 once the generalized inertia force of spar is derived the components of the system matrices can be obtained by rearranging eq 19 which leads to the following expressions 21a m u t s i j m s v i s v j s ω i t b i s ω j t b for i j 17 22 21b f u u t s i m s v i s i 20 22 d d t v i s u i ω i t b ω t b i s ω t b for i 17 22 finally generalized active forces acting on spar are derived for the complete equation of motion so the contribution of wave forces and moments acting on the spar is given by 22 f i s h y v i s f s h y t b ω i t b m s h y t b for i 1 24 in the above expression f s h y t b and m s h y t b represent the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting at the tower base respectively which depend on wave and motion of the spar these are expressed as follows 23a f s h y t b i 17 22 f s h y i t b u i f s h y t t b 23b m s h y t b i 17 22 m s h y i t b u i m s h y t t b where f s h y t t b and m s h y t t b are the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces and moments respectively that does not depend on the inertia of the spar finally the system matrices due to wave i e both static and dynamic acting on the spar are given by 24a m u t s h y i j v i s f s h y j t b ω i t b m s h y j t b for i j 17 22 24b f u u t s h y i v i s f s h y t t b ω i t b m s h y t t b for i 17 22 generalised active forces due to gravity on the spar are given by 25 f i s g v v i s m s g x ˆ 2 for i 17 22 where g is the acceleration due to gravity finally the system matrices due to gravitational forces on the spar are given by 26a m u t s g v i j 0 for i j 17 22 26b f u u t s g v i v i s m s g x ˆ 2 for i 17 22 2 2 modified torus system the modified torus is attached to the spar of the wind turbine with springs and dashpot the dynamics of the torus is modelled by two degrees of freedom in surge and sway denoted by u 23 and u 24 respectively only the translation of the torus in these two directions are considered following the same procedure as described in the previous subsection for the spar the kinetics of the modified torus system can be derived the position vector of the point s on the spar where the torus is connected with respect to tower base t b can be written as 27 r t b s h t r a ˆ 2 as the translation of the modified system is described in the spar coordinate system a ˆ position vector of the center of mass of torus t r from the point s is given by 28 r s t r u 23 a ˆ 1 u 24 a ˆ 3 using eq 27 and eq 28 the total linear velocity at the center of mass of the torus t r is given by 29 v t r v s v l n t r ω t b r s t r where v s is the velocity at s and v l n t r is the linear velocity of the torus in the spar coordinate system they can be derived using eq 27 and eq 28 which are given by the following expressions 30a v s v t b ω t b r t b s 30b v l n t r u 23 a ˆ 1 u 24 a ˆ 3 as mentioned in sec 2 1 assuming generalised speeds as the time derivatives of the degrees of freedom and rearranging eq 29 in the format of eq 5a indicates v t t r 0 hence the partial linear velocity of the torus given by 31 v i t r v i s ω i t b r s t r for i 17 22 a ˆ 1 for i 23 a ˆ 3 for i 24 where v i s is the partial linear velocity at s and is given by 32 v i s v i t b ω i t b r t b s for i 20 22 following the same procedure as described for spar the partial linear acceleration terms for the torus is given by 33 d d t v i t r d v i s d t d ω i t b d t r s t r ω i t b v l n t r ω t b r s t r for i 17 22 ω t b a ˆ 1 for i 23 ω t b a ˆ 3 for i 24 here it should be noted that d d t v t t r 0 as the term v t t r 0 in eq 33 in the above equation d v i s d t is the partial linear acceleration at s and is derived by differentiating eq 32 with respect to time i e 34 d d t v i s ω i t b ω t b r t b s for i 20 22 using the above equations of linear and angular velocities and accelerations in eq 4 eq 6a and eq 6b the generalized inertial forces for the modified torus is given by 35 f i t r v i t r m t r i 17 24 v i t r u i i 17 24 d v i t r d t u i so the system matrices of the torus can be obtained from the generalised inertial forces by rearranging eq 35 i e 36a m u t t r i j m t r v i t r v j t r for i j 17 24 36b f u u t t r i m t r v i t r i 17 24 d v i t r d t u i for i 17 24 similar to spar the system matrices due to gravitational forces on the torus are given by 37a m u t t r g v i j 0 for i 23 24 37b f u u t t r g v i v i t r m t r g x ˆ 2 for i 23 24 considering rayleigh s damping for the modified spar torus system respective generalised active forces are given by 38a f u u t t r e l i k t r u i for i 23 24 38b f u u t t r d i ς t r k t r π f t r u i for i 23 24 where m t r k t r ς t r f t r are the mass stiffness damping ratio and frequency in hz respectively for the modified torus system similar to spar the hydro static and hydrodynamic forces are also acting on the torus thus the generalised active forces on the modified torus system due to these loads are given by 39 f i t r h y v i t r f t r h y t r for i 17 24 in the same way as in sec 2 1 hydro static and hydrodynamic forces acting on the torus f h y t r can be written using the following expressions 40 f t r h y t r i 17 24 f t r h y i t r u i f t r h y t t r where f h y t t r in eq 40 is the wave force that does not depend on the inertia of the torus whereas the term f t r h y i t r contributes to the added mass of the system matrices therefore the system matrices due to wave loads on the torus can be obtained as 41a m u t t r h y i j v i t r f t r h y j t r for i j 1 24 41b f u u t t r h y i v i t r f t r h y t t r for i 1 24 following the same procedure for spar and torus governing equation of motion for each component can be derived in the global reference frame finally they are assembled to get the combined model of the modified spar torus system the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads are discussed in the following sections 3 external loads on floating wind turbine different external loads act on a floating wind turbine namely aerodynamic load on blades and tower hydrodynamic load on spar and torus and mooring forces arising from the anchoring cables for brevity the detailed description for these loads is not presented in this paper only the necessary details of modelling these loads are discussed below for completeness aerodynamic load in general aerodynamic lift and drag forces act on the blades and only the drag forces act on the tower in this study these forces are estimated using modified bem theory for guaranteed convergence ning 2014 the time varying wind acting on the blades are estimated using rotational sampling of the 3d turbulent wind field simulated in turbsim jonkman 2009 where the 1d flow is modelled by iec kaimal spectrum et al 2005 readers may refer sarkar and chakraborty 2018 2019 sajeer et al 2020 for further details on the aerodynamic load simulation hydrodynamic load the ocean wave profile is simulated using pearson moskowitch pm spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 which represents a developed sea state finally morison s equation is used to estimate the linear wave inertia forces and non linear viscous drag forces acting on the spar and torus it assumes viscous drag forces dominate the total drag force and the damping due to radiation is negligible as the spar and torus undergo small rotations which are cylindrical having a small diameter compared to the wavelengths of the ocean waves these assumptions are valid in the present case young 1999 sawaragi 1995 the added mass associated with spar heave motion is also taken into account further details on the hydrodynamic load simulation for spar type offshore wind turbines are provided in sarkar et al 2020 mooring loads normally chain is used for mooring of the type of floating turbine used in this study jeon et al 2013 lefebvre and collu 2012 goldschmidt and michael 2015 kim et al 2014 the mooring dynamic loads acting on the spar is computed using an open source mooring line simulation program moordyn hall 2015 it utilises lumped mass mooring cable model accounting the forces due to internal axial stiffness and damping weight buoyancy hydrodynamic forces from morison s equation and vertical spring damper forces arising from the contact with the seabed the wave kinematics on the mooring cable is neglected because the fairleads of the spar type fwt are deep below the water surface the reader may refer to the literature hall and goupee 2015 vissio et al 2015 for further details on this topic 4 numerical results discussion this section presents the numerical analysis of the proposed mstc to control the vibration of a spar type fwt aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads are simulated considering wind wave correlation and misalignment for mathematical modelling of spar type fwt the benchmark properties of nrel 5 mw wind turbine on the oc3 hywind spar jonkman 2010 is used here six different time histories spar surge u 17 and sway u 18 spar roll u 20 and pitch u 21 tower top fore aft u t f a and side to side u t s s motions under different wind speeds and wind wave misalignment angle are analysed and presented below to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mstc 4 1 properties of spar type fwt and other environmental parameters the basic properties of the benchmark turbine are shown in table 2 the blades are composed of 8 different airfoils along its length whose properties like chord length aero twist lift and drag coefficients and blade structural properties like mass per unit length and stiffness are taken from the nrel report jonkman et al 2009 the drivetrain has a gear tooth ratio of 97 with torsional stiffness and generator inertia are 867637 kn m rad and 534 kg m2 respectively the oc3 hywind spar is 120m deep with 3 mooring lines whose fundamental properties are given in table 3 along with the properties of mooring cable the proposed mstc is designed by ensuring its compatibility with the spar it is 30m deep with outer and inner diameters are 18m and 17m respectively the total mass of this system is 7 47e5kg having its center of mass at 15m below the sea level the spring stiffness and damping constant of the mstc are 144 43 kn m and 65 7 kns m respectively which are kept the same for both surge and sway degrees of freedom the steady and turbulent wind fields for different mean velocities i e 3 11 4 25 m s corresponding to cut in rated and cut out speeds at 90m hub height are simulated in turbsim as the marine environment has less turbulence compared to onshore danish wind industry association 2003 the power law exponent of 0 2 for steady wind and 10 turbulence with iec kaimal spectra have been used for wind field simulation the joint probability distribution of mean wind speed at 10m height along with significant height and peak period of the wave as presented by johannessen et al 2001 are considered here the environmental conditions used for this simulation are shown in table 4 using these parameters wave acceleration and velocities at different depths are generated from pierson moskowitch spectrum as mentioned in sec 3 five different cases of wind wave misalignment ranging from 0 o to 90 o are also considered for different marine states to study the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy fig 3 a shows the wind field generated by turbsim corresponding to rated speed with 10 turbulence fig 3b shows the time histories of simulated waves along surge corresponding to a significant wave height of 3 1 m at different depths without misalignment from this figure it may be noted that the magnitude of wave velocity is maximum near the surface which is aimed to be isolated from the floating spar using these inputs and other structural properties the responses of the combined system are obtained for performance evaluation however before investigating the efficiency of the proposed mstc the mathematical model is validated with the benchmark response 4 2 model validation the mathematical model of the floating turbine with mstc described in section 2 is developed in matlab matlab 2018 fourth order ranga kutta integration scheme is used here to solve the coupled differential equations of motion numerically a sufficiently small time step of 0 0125s has been used to retain the accuracy of the numerical integration for this purpose the dofs corresponding to the torus are assumed to be zero i e without torus and the sea state is assumed to generate 3 1m high sinusoidal waves having a period of 11sec for steady wind at the rated speed with 30 o wave wind misalignment using these conditions which make the two models i e the code developed in this study and fast identical and the inputs uniform the multi body dynamic systems are solved and the response corresponding to the six performance parameters mentioned earlier are demonstrated in fig 4 here it is worth noting that morison s equation is used in the present analysis to estimate the hydrodynamic load while fast uses potential flow theory the diameter of the spar and the ocean wavelength in this validation exercise reveal that their ratio is well below the threshold of 0 2 and hence the small body assumption is valid this in turn ensures that morison s equation can be applicable in this case sawaragi 1995 the key response parameters in fig 4 reveal that the two codes are in agreement with each other where a close match is observed between them except a few discrete locations at the initial transient stage however these occasional differences at the initial stage are small for all practical purpose thus the results in fig 4 prove the accuracy of the code developed in matlab where the fluid diffraction and radiation damping are neglected these components of the hydrodynamic damping are modelled using potential flow theory in fast however the results in fig 4 establish the fact that their effects are small thus the use of morison s equation is also justified in this case 4 3 vibration control using mstc once the model is validated it is further used for performance evaluation of the proposed modified spar torus system first the rated speed of the turbine is considered to study the dynamics of the combined system under regular operation fig 5 shows the response of spar due to steady wind and 30 wind wave misalignment this figure clearly shows the effect of mstc on the sway i e side to side response of spar the percentage reduction of peak response along surge and sway dofs are 1 09 and 49 8 respectively here it may be noted that the combined floating system acts as a rigid body which is dragged along the wind i e surge it can be observed in fig 5a which shows the response has large mean displacement along with the fundamental period of the mooring load in that direction the inset in this figure shows the transient mooring force which has a fundamental frequency of 0 001hz that dies out as the time progresses leaving the mean component of the force which is also reflected in the surge response of the spar thus the response in the surge is dominated by the mooring frequency which is superimposed by the dynamic response of very small amplitude caused by the sea waves due to this reason the response reduction in the surge direction is low on the other hand rigid body motion is absent in the sway or side to side direction and the dynamics of the spar is fully governed by the wave motion thus mstc offers better isolation of wave force which is maximum near the surface and hence significant response reduction is achieved in this direction similarly the peak response in rolling and pitching motion of the spar are observed to be reduced by 19 9 and 2 33 for steady wind these two dofs also show identical phenomenon as in case of surge and sway responses of the spar the rolling motion shows better reduction as compared to pitching due to the large mean component of the dominant mooring load that leads to rigid body motion as the spar acts like a rigid floating body that supports a tall tower a small reduction in spar motion is bound to have an amplified effect at the top of the tower i e nacelle the displacement time histories at the top of the tower in fore aft and side to side directions with and without mstc are shown in fig 6 for steady wind and in fig 7 for 10 turbulence with 30 misalignment these figures show that the response at the top of the tower is significantly reduced by the mstc system the peak responses at the top of the tower in these two directions i e fore aft and side to side are reduced by 16 68 and 41 68 for steady wind and 41 6 and 60 2 for turbulence respectively in this context it may be noted that the fore aft dof at the top of the tower receives highest amount of aerodynamic damping which increases with the level of turbulence and ultimately affects the dynamic response however even under high aerodynamic damping and rigid body motion the proposed mstc offers significant vibration control at the top of the tower which is the main objective of this study once the performance of the proposed mstc is demonstrated a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the performance under different wave wind misalignment which is shown in table 5 this table shows the response reduction in all 6 dofs for both steady and turbulent wind under different levels of misalignment from this table it can be observed that significant response reductions are obtained in sway and rolling motion of spar which ultimately affects the tower response in the side to side direction besides sway vibration control of spar tower fore aft is also reduced by 20 in the steady wind with zero misalignment moreover the performance of the controller significantly increases with the wind wave misalignment reaching more than 60 reduction for maximum misalignment this justifies the efficiency of the proposed controller to improve the response of a spar type floating wind turbine in sway motion next the performance envelope of the proposed controller ranging from the cut in to cut out speeds corresponding to different misalignment is evaluated fig 8 and fig 9 show the complete performance envelope of mstc in terms of key performance parameters under both steady and turbulent wind from these figures it can be observed that mstc offers better performance between the cut in and the rated speed i e under regular operation when the wave loads are dominant and hence mstc is more effective the peak response reduction at the tower top in fore aft is observed to reach 52 4 at cut in speed and 48 17 at cut out speed here it may be noted that the blade pitch remains unchanged during this period pitch control is activated beyond the rated speed to maintain rpm and power output this adjustment reduces aerodynamic load and hence the response in the fore aft beyond the rated speed decreases by a small amount finally the impacts of different depth of mstc is studied which are shown in fig 10 a and 10b corresponding to the steady and turbulent wind the magnitude of vibration control is observed to increase with depth as it can isolate more wave force it is found to offer maximum reduction at 30m and hence is selected for this study beyond this value the inertia force of the mstc increases compared to the magnitude of the isolated wave force and thus the reduction decreases therefore it reveals that the depth of mstc should be such that it offers maximum isolation of wave force near the surface only 5 conclusions a new concept for vibration control of a spar type floating wind turbine using modified torus is presented in this work the proposed modification isolates wave energy which ultimately affects the dynamics of spar supporting the blade tower assembly an aero servo elastic multi body dynamic model using kane s approach is developed to study the performance of the proposed system different aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading conditions ranging from cut in to cut out wind speed with corresponding wave heights considering wind wave correlations and misalignment are simulated the numerical results presented in this paper demonstrates substantial improvement of the overall response of fwt particularly in the sway direction the significant observations from this numerical analysis are highlighted below the modified torus system can be installed in a spar type fwt without affecting the main structure or adding any extra weight in the main structure to control wave induced vibrations as in case of a tuned mass damper in this context it is worth mentioning that housing a tuned mass damper within nacelle is a challenging task due to space constraints the proposed mstc being a floating mass outside the main structure has no such problem the peak response reduction of spar and tower are found to be more than 60 depending upon the wind speed turbulence significant wave heights and wind wave misalignment being a passive system the proposed controller does not need any power or real time monitoring which is an advantage in deep sea operation the increase in wind wave misalignment angle results in better performance of the mstc to control the sway response of the spar and side to side motion of the nacelle which are the main objective of this study as excessive motion in the surge or side to side direction is

21223,spar type floating wind turbines exposed to marine environment experience significant vibration which is more prominent under wind wave misalignment this unavoidable vibration particularly in the sway direction affects overall performance and can induce significant damage to sensitive electro mechanical components leading to downtime for maintenance with this in view the present study aims to propose a modified spar torus combination by introducing spring and dashpot in between so that it can work as an isolator first a comprehensive mathematical model for this multi body system is developed using kane s approach with proper aero elastic and hydrodynamic simulation for this purpose 3d wind fields are generated in turbsim and the waves are simulated from pierson moskovitch spectrum considering wind wave correlation and misalignment aerodynamic loads are computed using modified blade element momentum theory while and hydrodynamic loads are generated using morison s equation using these inputs the response of the modified spar torus combination is solved which demonstrates the efficiency and advantage of the proposed vibration isolation different sea states and wind conditions are simulated replicating the actual scenario to investigate the performance envelope of the proposed controller for spar type floating wind turbines keywords floating wind turbine bem theory spar torus combinations pierson moskovitch spectrum morison s equation kane s equation 1 introduction spar type floating offshore wind turbines consist of mooring supports floating spar a long and flexible tower supporting nacelle and rotor at the top unlike onshore turbines which are exposed to turbulent wind the primary source of vibration for offshore floating turbines is the hydrodynamic load in this structural set up small vibration of spar i e tower base due to sea wave can cause an amplified response at the nacelle i e tower top it is more pronounced under wind wave misalignment which is often reflected in the side to side response of tower or nacelle this unwanted side wise vibration can cause significant damage to electro mechanical systems notably the gearbox in this context gearbox maintenance costs maximum revenue loss and downtime for any operational wind turbine therefore nacelle vibration especially in the side to side direction should be kept as minimum as possible due to this reason the research activities in the recent past have been focused on different aspects of efficient modelling analysis and design of wind turbines among them vibration control has remained an open problem for the wind turbine industry li et al 2020 have explored the effects of the yaw error and wind wave misalignment on the dynamics and power generation of floating turbines using fast their study indicates that yaw error can result in reduced power generation without adverse effects while wind wave misalignment significantly affects the dynamics of the structure kyle et al 2020 have investigated the propeller and vortex ring states of nrel 5 mw floating turbine when subjected to strong waves and low wind using cfd analysis their study has shown that negative thrust can occur in regions of high twist angles li et al 2019 have also studied the dynamics of a semi submerged offshore wind turbine subjected to turbulent wind flow to investigate the effects of wind shear turbulence intensity and coherence on the responses of the turbine structure they have noticed that increased turbulence can create violent shaking of the platform which in turn increases structural loads on the turbine significantly they have suggested the use of a partial coherence structure to ensure the safety of the wind turbine liu et al 2019 have analysed the reliability of floating wind turbine considering wind and wave loads with no misalignment between them they have observed that edgewise blade response can be considerably larger in offshore turbines compared to its onshore counterpart thereby adversely affecting the fatigue life at the blade root besides improved analysis and design of turbines vibration control also plays a significant role in performance enhancement skaree et al skaare et al 2007 have studied the effects of conventional generator torque and blade pitch control strategies on fatigue life of floating wind turbines in this context both torque and pitch control reduce loads on the turbine where torque control operates below the rated speed while pitch control works above it but there are design limitations with these strategies e g power output fluctuations and stress development in electro mechanical components horiuchi and kawahito 2001 other than these techniques several studies have been carried out in the recent past on vibration control of wind turbine structures using different passive or semi active devices lackner and rotea 2011a 2011b sun 2018 has investigated the performance of semi active tuned mass dampers for vibrations mitigation of floating turbines considering wind wave misalignment however the tuned mass damper can create adverse effects and increase the response of several components particularly under wind wave misalignment also one of the significant problems with tuned mass dampers is housing a large mass within the tower or nacelle which has limited or no space other advanced methods like rotational inertia of double tuned mass damper garrido et al 2013 magneto rheological tuned liquid column damper sarkar and chakraborty 2018 tuned mass damper inerter system marian and giaralis 2014 sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 have been extensively studied for vibration control of turbines park et al 2020 have suggested orthogonal tuned liquid column dampers inside the nacelle to control the fore aft and side to side responses of floating turbines besides these passive devices the performance of individual blade pitch control ibp and disturbance accommodating control dac strategies for floating offshore wind turbines have been investigated by namik and stol 2010 2011 their study has shown improvement of different structural performances e g platform pitching motion fatigue load on turbine blades and side to side motion of tower thereby reducing power fluctuations sarkar et al 2020 have proposed a multi resolution wavelet pitch controller for improving the dynamics of spar type offshore wind turbines their control algorithm has shown a reduction of aerodynamic loads and subsequent dynamic responses in all modes madsen et al 2020 have experimentally studied different close and open loop control strategies on the scaled model of a 10 mw turbine supported by tension leg platforms they have noticed that surge motion of the turbine governs the tension in the mooring cables at the same time negative aerodynamic damping of the controller can increase the vibration leading to higher responses in the surge which can cause increased stresses and failure of the supporting structures han and nagamune 2019 have studied platform position control in offshore wind farms to mitigate the effect of aerodynamic wakes considering disturbances in the wind and wave loading their study has shown that with the use of linear quadratic integrator control algorithm adequately designed to achieve the targeted platform positions can maximize the power output by substantially reducing the wake effects as vibration control of wind turbine is currently an active area of research new ideas and techniques are coming up very often and the industries have also embraced some of these options for further development jensen 2016 smith 2002 for example spar torus combination stc has been proposed by muliawan et al 2012 where a donut shaped wave energy converter wec is attached with the spar type floating wind turbine fwt although torus designed in this format does not help in controlling spar vibration its performance in trapping additional wave energy is impressive later other studies have investigated its effect on the structural responses and power generation in both operational and extreme sea conditions muliawan et al 2013a 2013b 2013c these studies have observed that combining torus with a spar can increase power production however it can also increase forces in mooring lines with additional bending moments in the tower causing new challenges in design against ultimate limit state and fatigue wan et al 2014 have conducted laboratory tests on possible slamming effect and green water effect of stc their studies have shown that submerging the torus in case of extreme sea conditions can reduce the forces induced in the mooring lines and also the bending moments in the tower ren et al 2020 have developed a new concept by combining wave energy converters wec in the tension leg platform tlp of a floating wind turbine dynamic responses of the combined system have been studied numerically and experimentally with a scaled model that has a fair agreement although the primary focus of these studies is on harnessing wave energy in operational sea states the use of torus to control the response has not been investigated yue et al 2020 have studied the positive effects of installing a heave plate in the spar of the floating offshore wind turbines ren et al 2015 have estimated the long term performances and fatigue life of stc using a simplified thrust model of wind loading they have also developed two different survival modes to reduce long term fatigue damage and extreme responses 1 1 motivation and problem formulation the literature review presented above clearly outlines the need for vibration control of a floating wind turbine under different operational conditions in this context spar type floating turbines have proved themselves as a viable option for deep sea wind farms availability of strong wind for longer duration in the marine environment makes them more profitable in the long run however they are exposed to a significant level of vibration due to the combined action of aero hydrodynamic loads although previous studies have proposed different strategies for vibration control it has remained an open problem in this context stc shows promising results in terms of power generation due to wave energy conversion however stc in its present form does not offer significant vibration control this motivates to investigate the design of spar type floater by modifying the torus to act as a vibration isolator thus the objectives of this study are as follows develop the concept of modified spar torus combination by introducing spring and dashpot for wave load isolation to improve the dynamics of spar type floaters this spring and dashpot in between spar and torus have the potential to isolate hydrodynamic loads from the spar thereby reducing its response significantly the energy is dissipated as the torus is allowed to vibrate in the surge i e along wind and sway i e side to side as the wave loads are higher near the surface an adequately designed torus is bound to provide significant vibration control particularly under wind wave misalignment formulate detailed mathematical model using kane s approach for a modified spar torus combination attached to the mooring cables this multi body dynamic framework helps to reduce the degrees of freedom to its minimum while modelling the highly non linear system of a floating turbine assembly demonstrate the performance of the proposed modified spar torus combination under the different operational scenario in the marine environment to examine its performance envelope particularly in sway i e side to side direction which is the main objective of this work 1 2 description of modified spar torus combination the spar torus combination muliawan et al 2012 has a light donut shaped floating buoy i e torus as a wave energy converter this combination is modified in this study where the torus is used as a floater that isolates wave energy as stated above the modified spar torus combination mstc refer fig 1 acts as a vibration absorber that primarily controls the response of a floating wind turbine in passive mode here it may be noted that the magnitude of the hydrodynamic load is maximum near the surface and decreases with depth thus torus encircling the part of the spar near the sea surface effectively isolates the incident hydrodynamic loads fig 1 shows the modified spar torus combination which consists of the following key elements a floating spar is used to support the wind turbine the dimensions of the spar depend on the size of the turbine its power rating water depth and wind profile at the site the spar is moored with the help of catenary to support the turbine a modified torus is a hollow cylindrical shaped floating buoy encircling the spar up to a sufficient depth to effectively isolate wave loads it can move in two orthogonal directions i e surge and sway relative to the spar the ballast tanks inside the spar and torus bring their centre of gravity below their centre of buoyancy to provide sufficient stability to carry a heavy wind turbine on top of it the bearing system along the outer periphery of the spar consists of flexible spring and dashpot as shown in fig 1 to connect the torus with the spar and allowing it to have relative translations in surge and sway and no rotation 2 dynamics of spar type floating wind turbine in this section the dynamics of a spar type offshore wind turbine coupled with a modified torus system is formulated using kane s approach kane and levinson 1985 it is based on the vector representation of forces for solving a multi body dynamic problem which provides significant computational advantages in this approach the offshore floating wind turbine is modelled by 22 degrees of freedom dofs whose details are given in table 1 the proposed modified torus can move in the surge and sway directions with respect to spar hence 2 dofs are considered to model this body each blade is modelled by two flapwise and one edgewise mode as they are found to be effective by most of the previous studies reported in the literature however the formulation is general and can incorporate as many modes necessary for a particular application the tower has two modes in fore aft and side to side direction since the complete system floats on water as a rigid body and free to rotate the nacelle has yaw dof besides two more dofs for generator and hub i e fast and slow moving shafts of the drivetrain thus the complete dofs of the modified spar type floating wind turbine are defined by the following vector 1 u u 1 u 9 b l a d e s u 10 u 13 t o w e r u 14 n a c e l l e u 15 u 16 d r i v e t r a i n u 17 u 22 s p a r u 23 u 24 t o r u s t besides dofs the formulation of the multi body system also demands different coordinates for the global system as well as individual components as described in table 1 the details of these coordinate systems are also marked in fig 2 the global inertial reference frame is defined by x ˆ the local coordinates used in this multi body systems are for spar a ˆ tower top b ˆ nacelle c ˆ low speed shaft d ˆ generator azimuth e ˆ and blades f k ˆ in addition to these coordinates there are separate coordinate systems used for blade coning g k ˆ pitch h k ˆ local structural twist i k ˆ and blade elements b k blade also has two more local coordinates for its deformed elements b k and aerodynamic loads a ˆ e k in this context it may be noted that each coordinate systems have three components along with three orthogonal directions which are marked by appropriate subscripts e g a 1 ˆ a ˆ 2 and a ˆ 3 for the spar in case of coordinate systems having k as subscripts it refers to blade number e g g ˆ k for k 1 2 3 for three blades with another three secondary subscripts for three directions for a particular blade as the spar blades and tower can rotate about more than one axis simultaneously the use of traditional transformation matrices are restricted henceforth small angle approximation kane and levinson 1985 is used to form euler 1 2 3 rotation matrices to establish transformation relation between these coordinate systems which makes the formulation of the matrices independent of the sequence of rotation once the dofs and coordinate systems are defined the governing equation of motion can be formulated using kane s approach derived from newton s law of motion kane s equation for holonomic multi body system can be expressed as a set of scalar equations kane and levinson 1985 2 f i f i 0 f o r i 1 2 n where n is the total number of degrees of freedom in the system for a system comprised of n n bodies with their centre of mass point c k and reference frame x k the generalised active forces for each degree of freedom are given by 3 f i k 1 n v i c k f c k ω i x k m x k in the above equation v i c k is the partial velocity at the center of mass c k while f c k is the corresponding generalized active force acting on the k t h body similarly m x k and ω i x k in the same equation represent the generalized active moment and partial angular velocity of the k t h body with respect to the reference frame x k besides generalized active forces in eq 2 generalised inertial forces are given by 4 f i k 1 n v i c k m k a c k ω i x k i k α x k ω x k i k ω x k where m k and i k are the generalized mass and moment of inertia of the k t h rigid body while a c k and α x k are the generalized linear and angular acceleration with respect to c k as per kane and levinson 1985 total linear and angular velocities of k t h body can be written as a summation of the partial velocities which are given by 5a v c k i 1 n v i c k q i v t c k 5b ω x k i 1 n ω i x k q i ω t x k in the above two equations the first expression within the parentheses on the right hand side i e v i c k q i and ω i x k q i contains the term that can be linearly superimposed to compute the total velocity while the second expression i e v t c k and ω t x k are the terms that do not follow this format kane and levinson 1985 described q i as the generalized speed which is assumed to be the first differential of u i with respect to time i e q i u i therefore partial linear and angular accelerations of the k t h body can be derived from the above equations as 6a a c k i 1 n v i c k u i d d t v i c k u i d d t v t c k 6b α x k i 1 n ω i x k u i d d t ω i x k u i d d t ω t x k as explained for linear and angular velocities in eq 5a and eq 5b linear and angular accelerations also have similar constants i e in parentheses which are shown on the right hand side of eq 6a and eq 6b once the displacement field partial velocities and partial accelerations are defined governing equation of motion can be developed in the inertial reference frame in this context it may be noted that each component present in the multi body system contribute to the generalised inertia forces thus total generalised inertia and active forces are as follows 7 f i f i s f i t w f i n a f i h u f i b 1 f i b 2 f i b 3 f i g n f i t r in this equation first subscript i correspond to the dof while second subscripts s t w n a h u g n and t r represent spar tower nacelle hub generator and torus respectively also second subscripts b 1 b 2 and b 3 in the same equation represent three blades generalised active forces acting on the system consists of external conservative and non conservative forces internal forces in the flexible bodies and reaction forces generating from the constraint relationships between the multiple bodies in the present study friction forces inside the gearbox have been neglected therefore generalized active forces are expressed as follows 8 f i f i s h y f i t r h y f i b 1 a e f i b 2 a e f i b 3 a e f i s g v f i t r g v f i t w g v f i n g v f i h g v f i b 1 g v f i b 2 g v f i b 3 g v f i y s f i g n f i b r f i t w e l f i b 1 e l f i b 2 e l f i b 3 e l f i d t e l f i t r e l f i t w d f i b 1 d f i b 2 d f i b 3 d f i d t d f i t r d where third subscripts h y a e g v y s g n b r e l and d represent hydrodynamic aerodynamic gravitational yaw generator brake elastic and damping components respectively substituting eq 7 and eq 8 into eq 2 and rearranging them in matrix form leads to the following governing equation of motion 9 m u t u f u u t above equation reveals that mass matrix m u t changes with time while the right hand side contains other components like stiffness and damping besides external forces in the following subsections derivation of each component of eq 9 for spar and torus are described derivation for the remaining components of the floating turbine system follow the same principle and hence is omitted here to avoid repetition 2 1 spar in this sub section the governing equation of motion for spar using kane s approach is demonstrated step by step which is assumed to be a rigid body the rationale behind this assumption is that the diameter of the spar is significantly more than the tower which makes it relatively stiffer the motion of the spar is derived from the tower base thus the position vector of the tower base t b with respect to reference frame x ˆ is given by 10 r t b u 17 x ˆ 1 u 18 x ˆ 3 u 19 x ˆ 2 where r t b is the position vector of the tower base which is used to locate the position of the spar now the linear velocity of the reference point t b can be expressed as 11 v t b u 17 x ˆ 1 u 18 x ˆ 3 u 19 x ˆ 2 similarly the angular velocity at the same point is given by 12 ω t b u 20 x ˆ 1 u 21 x ˆ 3 u 22 x ˆ 2 now the position vector r t b s of the center of gravity of spar i e s from the tower base is given by 13 r t b s h s h r a ˆ 2 where h s and h r are the vertical distances from the waterline as marked in fig 1 using eq 11 to eq 13 linear velocity at the center of mass of the spar s is given by 14 v s v t b ω t b r t b s in this formulation time derivatives of the displacement field along the generalized coordinate is termed as the generalized speed i e q i u i using this expression of q i and rearranging eq 11 in the format of eq 5a reveals that the terms that do not follow linear superimposition are zero i e v t t b 0 and the remaining components are given by 15 v i t b x ˆ 1 for i 17 x ˆ 3 for i 18 x ˆ 2 for i 19 similarly using eq 12 in the format of eq 5b indicates that ω t t b 0 and the remaining components are expressed as follows 16 ω i t b x ˆ 1 for i 20 x ˆ 3 for i 21 x ˆ 2 for i 22 using above two expressions for partial linear and angular velocities i e v i t b and ω i t b in their respective total velocities and substituting them in eq 14 it can be concluded that the components of the total linear velocity at the center of mass of the spar s that do not following linear superimposition are zero v t s 0 while the other components are given by 17 v i s v i t b ω i t b r t b s for i 17 22 now using the above expression partial linear acceleration can be derived thus differentiating eq 17 with respect to time leads to the following expression 18 d d t v i s ω i t b ω t b r t b s for i 20 22 moreover as v t s 0 its time derivative is also zero i e d d t v t s 0 once the components of linear accelerations are derived each term of the angular acceleration can also be derived similarly in this context eq 6b for total angular acceleration at the tower base demands differential of eq 15 and eq 16 with respect to time which are zero in this case i e d d t ω i t b 0 for i 20 22 and d d t ω t t b 0 as mentioned earlier the spar is acting as a rigid body attached to the tower base hence all linear velocities and accelerations are calculated with respect to the spar center of mass but the rotational velocities and acceleration of spar are calculated with respect to the tower base using all appropriate expressions of linear and angular velocities and accelerations in eq 4 the generalized inertia force on spar can be expressed as 19 f i s v i s m s a s ω i t b i s α t b ω t b i s ω t b v i s m s i 17 22 v i s u i i 20 22 d d t v i s u i ω i t b i s i 20 22 ω i t b u i ω t b i s ω t b where i s is polar moment of inertia of spar which can be obtained from its three orthogonal components along roll yaw and pitch axis i e subscripts r y and p in the following expression 20 i s i s r a ˆ 1 a ˆ 1 i s y a ˆ 2 a ˆ 2 i s p a ˆ 3 a ˆ 3 once the generalized inertia force of spar is derived the components of the system matrices can be obtained by rearranging eq 19 which leads to the following expressions 21a m u t s i j m s v i s v j s ω i t b i s ω j t b for i j 17 22 21b f u u t s i m s v i s i 20 22 d d t v i s u i ω i t b ω t b i s ω t b for i 17 22 finally generalized active forces acting on spar are derived for the complete equation of motion so the contribution of wave forces and moments acting on the spar is given by 22 f i s h y v i s f s h y t b ω i t b m s h y t b for i 1 24 in the above expression f s h y t b and m s h y t b represent the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting at the tower base respectively which depend on wave and motion of the spar these are expressed as follows 23a f s h y t b i 17 22 f s h y i t b u i f s h y t t b 23b m s h y t b i 17 22 m s h y i t b u i m s h y t t b where f s h y t t b and m s h y t t b are the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces and moments respectively that does not depend on the inertia of the spar finally the system matrices due to wave i e both static and dynamic acting on the spar are given by 24a m u t s h y i j v i s f s h y j t b ω i t b m s h y j t b for i j 17 22 24b f u u t s h y i v i s f s h y t t b ω i t b m s h y t t b for i 17 22 generalised active forces due to gravity on the spar are given by 25 f i s g v v i s m s g x ˆ 2 for i 17 22 where g is the acceleration due to gravity finally the system matrices due to gravitational forces on the spar are given by 26a m u t s g v i j 0 for i j 17 22 26b f u u t s g v i v i s m s g x ˆ 2 for i 17 22 2 2 modified torus system the modified torus is attached to the spar of the wind turbine with springs and dashpot the dynamics of the torus is modelled by two degrees of freedom in surge and sway denoted by u 23 and u 24 respectively only the translation of the torus in these two directions are considered following the same procedure as described in the previous subsection for the spar the kinetics of the modified torus system can be derived the position vector of the point s on the spar where the torus is connected with respect to tower base t b can be written as 27 r t b s h t r a ˆ 2 as the translation of the modified system is described in the spar coordinate system a ˆ position vector of the center of mass of torus t r from the point s is given by 28 r s t r u 23 a ˆ 1 u 24 a ˆ 3 using eq 27 and eq 28 the total linear velocity at the center of mass of the torus t r is given by 29 v t r v s v l n t r ω t b r s t r where v s is the velocity at s and v l n t r is the linear velocity of the torus in the spar coordinate system they can be derived using eq 27 and eq 28 which are given by the following expressions 30a v s v t b ω t b r t b s 30b v l n t r u 23 a ˆ 1 u 24 a ˆ 3 as mentioned in sec 2 1 assuming generalised speeds as the time derivatives of the degrees of freedom and rearranging eq 29 in the format of eq 5a indicates v t t r 0 hence the partial linear velocity of the torus given by 31 v i t r v i s ω i t b r s t r for i 17 22 a ˆ 1 for i 23 a ˆ 3 for i 24 where v i s is the partial linear velocity at s and is given by 32 v i s v i t b ω i t b r t b s for i 20 22 following the same procedure as described for spar the partial linear acceleration terms for the torus is given by 33 d d t v i t r d v i s d t d ω i t b d t r s t r ω i t b v l n t r ω t b r s t r for i 17 22 ω t b a ˆ 1 for i 23 ω t b a ˆ 3 for i 24 here it should be noted that d d t v t t r 0 as the term v t t r 0 in eq 33 in the above equation d v i s d t is the partial linear acceleration at s and is derived by differentiating eq 32 with respect to time i e 34 d d t v i s ω i t b ω t b r t b s for i 20 22 using the above equations of linear and angular velocities and accelerations in eq 4 eq 6a and eq 6b the generalized inertial forces for the modified torus is given by 35 f i t r v i t r m t r i 17 24 v i t r u i i 17 24 d v i t r d t u i so the system matrices of the torus can be obtained from the generalised inertial forces by rearranging eq 35 i e 36a m u t t r i j m t r v i t r v j t r for i j 17 24 36b f u u t t r i m t r v i t r i 17 24 d v i t r d t u i for i 17 24 similar to spar the system matrices due to gravitational forces on the torus are given by 37a m u t t r g v i j 0 for i 23 24 37b f u u t t r g v i v i t r m t r g x ˆ 2 for i 23 24 considering rayleigh s damping for the modified spar torus system respective generalised active forces are given by 38a f u u t t r e l i k t r u i for i 23 24 38b f u u t t r d i ς t r k t r π f t r u i for i 23 24 where m t r k t r ς t r f t r are the mass stiffness damping ratio and frequency in hz respectively for the modified torus system similar to spar the hydro static and hydrodynamic forces are also acting on the torus thus the generalised active forces on the modified torus system due to these loads are given by 39 f i t r h y v i t r f t r h y t r for i 17 24 in the same way as in sec 2 1 hydro static and hydrodynamic forces acting on the torus f h y t r can be written using the following expressions 40 f t r h y t r i 17 24 f t r h y i t r u i f t r h y t t r where f h y t t r in eq 40 is the wave force that does not depend on the inertia of the torus whereas the term f t r h y i t r contributes to the added mass of the system matrices therefore the system matrices due to wave loads on the torus can be obtained as 41a m u t t r h y i j v i t r f t r h y j t r for i j 1 24 41b f u u t t r h y i v i t r f t r h y t t r for i 1 24 following the same procedure for spar and torus governing equation of motion for each component can be derived in the global reference frame finally they are assembled to get the combined model of the modified spar torus system the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads are discussed in the following sections 3 external loads on floating wind turbine different external loads act on a floating wind turbine namely aerodynamic load on blades and tower hydrodynamic load on spar and torus and mooring forces arising from the anchoring cables for brevity the detailed description for these loads is not presented in this paper only the necessary details of modelling these loads are discussed below for completeness aerodynamic load in general aerodynamic lift and drag forces act on the blades and only the drag forces act on the tower in this study these forces are estimated using modified bem theory for guaranteed convergence ning 2014 the time varying wind acting on the blades are estimated using rotational sampling of the 3d turbulent wind field simulated in turbsim jonkman 2009 where the 1d flow is modelled by iec kaimal spectrum et al 2005 readers may refer sarkar and chakraborty 2018 2019 sajeer et al 2020 for further details on the aerodynamic load simulation hydrodynamic load the ocean wave profile is simulated using pearson moskowitch pm spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 which represents a developed sea state finally morison s equation is used to estimate the linear wave inertia forces and non linear viscous drag forces acting on the spar and torus it assumes viscous drag forces dominate the total drag force and the damping due to radiation is negligible as the spar and torus undergo small rotations which are cylindrical having a small diameter compared to the wavelengths of the ocean waves these assumptions are valid in the present case young 1999 sawaragi 1995 the added mass associated with spar heave motion is also taken into account further details on the hydrodynamic load simulation for spar type offshore wind turbines are provided in sarkar et al 2020 mooring loads normally chain is used for mooring of the type of floating turbine used in this study jeon et al 2013 lefebvre and collu 2012 goldschmidt and michael 2015 kim et al 2014 the mooring dynamic loads acting on the spar is computed using an open source mooring line simulation program moordyn hall 2015 it utilises lumped mass mooring cable model accounting the forces due to internal axial stiffness and damping weight buoyancy hydrodynamic forces from morison s equation and vertical spring damper forces arising from the contact with the seabed the wave kinematics on the mooring cable is neglected because the fairleads of the spar type fwt are deep below the water surface the reader may refer to the literature hall and goupee 2015 vissio et al 2015 for further details on this topic 4 numerical results discussion this section presents the numerical analysis of the proposed

aft u t f a and side to side u t s s motions under different wind speeds and wind wave misalignment angle are analysed and presented below to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mstc 4 1 properties of spar type fwt and other environmental parameters the basic properties of the benchmark turbine are shown in table 2 the blades are composed of 8 different airfoils along its length whose properties like chord length aero twist lift and drag coefficients and blade structural properties like mass per unit length and stiffness are taken from the nrel report jonkman et al 2009 the drivetrain has a gear tooth ratio of 97 with torsional stiffness and generator inertia are 867637 kn m rad and 534 kg m2 respectively the oc3 hywind spar is 120m deep with 3 mooring lines whose fundamental properties are given in table 3 along with the properties of mooring cable the proposed mstc is designed by ensuring its compatibility with the spar it is 30m deep with outer and inner diameters are 18m and 17m respectively the total mass of this system is 7 47e5kg having its center of mass at 15m below the sea level the spring stiffness and damping constant of the mstc are 144 43 kn m and 65 7 kns m respectively which are kept the same for both surge and sway degrees of freedom the steady and turbulent wind fields for different mean velocities i e 3 11 4 25 m s corresponding to cut in rated and cut out speeds at 90m hub height are simulated in turbsim as the marine environment has less turbulence compared to onshore danish wind industry association 2003 the power law exponent of 0 2 for steady wind and 10 turbulence with iec kaimal spectra have been used for wind field simulation the joint probability distribution of mean wind speed at 10m height along with significant height and peak period of the wave as presented by johannessen et al 2001 are considered here the environmental conditions used for this simulation are shown in table 4 using these parameters wave acceleration and velocities at different depths are generated from pierson moskowitch spectrum as mentioned in sec 3 five different cases of wind wave misalignment ranging from 0 o to 90 o are also considered for different marine states to study the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy fig 3 a shows the wind field generated by turbsim corresponding to rated speed with 10 turbulence fig 3b shows the time histories of simulated waves along surge corresponding to a significant wave height of 3 1 m at different depths without misalignment from this figure it may be noted that the magnitude of wave velocity is maximum near the surface which is aimed to be isolated from the floating spar using these inputs and other structural properties the responses of the combined system are obtained for performance evaluation however before investigating the efficiency of the proposed mstc the mathematical model is validated with the benchmark response 4 2 model validation the mathematical model of the floating turbine with mstc described in section 2 is developed in matlab matlab 2018 fourth order ranga kutta integration scheme is used here to solve the coupled differential equations of motion numerically a sufficiently small time step of 0 0125s has been used to retain the accuracy of the numerical integration for this purpose the dofs corresponding to the torus are assumed to be zero i e without torus and the sea state is assumed to generate 3 1m high sinusoidal waves having a period of 11sec for steady wind at the rated speed with 30 o wave wind misalignment using these conditions which make the two models i e the code developed in this study and fast identical and the inputs uniform the multi body dynamic systems are solved and the response corresponding to the six performance parameters mentioned earlier are demonstrated in fig 4 here it is worth noting that morison s equation is used in the present analysis to estimate the hydrodynamic load while fast uses potential flow theory the diameter of the spar and the ocean wavelength in this validation exercise reveal that their ratio is well below the threshold of 0 2 and hence the small body assumption is valid this in turn ensures that morison s equation can be applicable in this case sawaragi 1995 the key response parameters in fig 4 reveal that the two codes are in agreement with each other where a close match is observed between them except a few discrete locations at the initial transient stage however these occasional differences at the initial stage are small for all practical purpose thus the results in fig 4 prove the accuracy of the code developed in matlab where the fluid diffraction and radiation damping are neglected these components of the hydrodynamic damping are modelled using potential flow theory in fast however the results in fig 4 establish the fact that their effects are small thus the use of morison s equation is also justified in this case 4 3 vibration control using mstc once the model is validated it is further used for performance evaluation of the proposed modified spar torus system first the rated speed of the turbine is considered to study the dynamics of the combined system under regular operation fig 5 shows the response of spar due to steady wind and 30 wind wave misalignment this figure clearly shows the effect of mstc on the sway i e side to side response of spar the percentage reduction of peak response along surge and sway dofs are 1 09 and 49 8 respectively here it may be noted that the combined floating system acts as a rigid body which is dragged along the wind i e surge it can be observed in fig 5a which shows the response has large mean displacement along with the fundamental period of the mooring load in that direction the inset in this figure shows the transient mooring force which has a fundamental frequency of 0 001hz that dies out as the time progresses leaving the mean component of the force which is also reflected in the surge response of the spar thus the response in the surge is dominated by the mooring frequency which is superimposed by the dynamic response of very small amplitude caused by the sea waves due to this reason the response reduction in the surge direction is low on the other hand rigid body motion is absent in the sway or side to side direction and the dynamics of the spar is fully governed by the wave motion thus mstc offers better isolation of wave force which is maximum near the surface and hence significant response reduction is achieved in this direction similarly the peak response in rolling and pitching motion of the spar are observed to be reduced by 19 9 and 2 33 for steady wind these two dofs also show identical phenomenon as in case of surge and sway responses of the spar the rolling motion shows better reduction as compared to pitching due to the large mean component of the dominant mooring load that leads to rigid body motion as the spar acts like a rigid floating body that supports a tall tower a small reduction in spar motion is bound to have an amplified effect at the top of the tower i e nacelle the displacement time histories at the top of the tower in fore aft and side to side directions with and without mstc are shown in fig 6 for steady wind and in fig 7 for 10 turbulence with 30 misalignment these figures show that the response at the top of the tower is significantly reduced by the mstc system the peak responses at the top of the tower in these two directions i e fore aft and side to side are reduced by 16 68 and 41 68 for steady wind and 41 6 and 60 2 for turbulence respectively in this context it may be noted that the fore aft dof at the top of the tower receives highest amount of aerodynamic damping which increases with the level of turbulence and ultimately affects the dynamic response however even under high aerodynamic damping and rigid body motion the proposed mstc offers significant vibration control at the top of the tower which is the main objective of this study once the performance of the proposed mstc is demonstrated a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the performance under different wave wind misalignment which is shown in table 5 this table shows the response reduction in all 6 dofs for both steady and turbulent wind under different levels of misalignment from this table it can be observed that significant response reductions are obtained in sway and rolling motion of spar which ultimately affects the tower response in the side to side direction besides sway vibration control of spar tower fore aft is also reduced by 20 in the steady wind with zero misalignment moreover the performance of the controller significantly increases with the wind wave misalignment reaching more than 60 reduction for maximum misalignment this justifies the efficiency of the proposed controller to improve the response of a spar type floating wind turbine in sway motion next the performance envelope of the proposed controller ranging from the cut in to cut out speeds corresponding to different misalignment is evaluated fig 8 and fig 9 show the complete performance envelope of mstc in terms of key performance parameters under both steady and turbulent wind from these figures it can be observed that mstc offers better performance between the cut in and the rated speed i e under regular operation when the wave loads are dominant and hence mstc is more effective the peak response reduction at the tower top in fore aft is observed to reach 52 4 at cut in speed and 48 17 at cut out speed here it may be noted that the blade pitch remains unchanged during this period pitch control is activated beyond the rated speed to maintain rpm and power output this adjustment reduces aerodynamic load and hence the response in the fore aft beyond the rated speed decreases by a small amount finally the impacts of different depth of mstc is studied which are shown in fig 10 a and 10b corresponding to the steady and turbulent wind the magnitude of vibration control is observed to increase with depth as it can isolate more wave force it is found to offer maximum reduction at 30m and hence is selected for this study beyond this value the inertia force of the mstc increases compared to the magnitude of the isolated wave force and thus the reduction decreases therefore it reveals that the depth of mstc should be such that it offers maximum isolation of wave force near the surface only 5 conclusions a new concept for vibration control of a spar type floating wind turbine using modified torus is presented in this work the proposed modification isolates wave energy which ultimately affects the dynamics of spar supporting the blade tower assembly an aero servo elastic multi body dynamic model using kane s approach is developed to study the performance of the proposed system different aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading conditions ranging from cut in to cut out wind speed with corresponding wave heights considering wind wave correlations and misalignment are simulated the numerical results presented in this paper demonstrates substantial improvement of the overall response of fwt particularly in the sway direction the significant observations from this numerical analysis are highlighted below the modified torus system can be installed in a spar type fwt without affecting the main structure or adding any extra weight in the main structure to control wave induced vibrations as in case of a tuned mass damper in this context it is worth mentioning that housing a tuned mass damper within nacelle is a challenging task due to space constraints the proposed mstc being a floating mass outside the main structure has no such problem the peak response reduction of spar and tower are found to be more than 60 depending upon the wind speed turbulence significant wave heights and wind wave misalignment being a passive system the proposed controller does not need any power or real time monitoring which is an advantage in deep sea operation the increase in wind wave misalignment angle results in better performance of the mstc to control the sway response of the spar and side to side motion of the nacelle which are the main objective of this study as excessive motion in the surge or side to side direction is detrimental for the sensitive electro mechanical components of the drivetrain overall the proposed mstc is found to be effective particularly in controlling the sway or side to side motion of the spar

21224,an electric submersible pump esp vibration analysis was performed considering different wear states and operational conditions the pumps were tested with different fluid viscosities operating points and speeds to evaluate their vibration behavior with the aim of providing characteristics for non invasive differential vibration diagnosis a specific frequency spectrum estimation method is described focusing on the extraction of frequency component vibration amplitudes used in the petroleum industry standard vibration analysis a time interval definition procedure was proposed to reduce signal amplitude losses due to variation of synchronous operating frequency the results indicate that the frequency component peak amplitudes can be more accurately identified during synchronous frequency variation by the proposed method than by typical estimation methods in this study an esp vibration differential diagnosis was achieved by analyzing relations between orders of the synchronous frequency and by distinguishing that the synchronous component amplitude rose approximately proportionally to the square of the rotating speed this differentiates unbalance fault from a bent shaft or a misalignment a correlation matrix analysis is provided to demonstrate that variation in the fluid temperature difference between the pump intake and discharge is related to the vibration amplitude variation in a pump with a vibration fault keywords vibratory behavior synchronous frequency variation differential diagnosis correlation analysis temperature influence 1 introduction electrical submersible pumps esps are the second most common artificial lifting method applied worldwide liang et al 2015 deployed in it is estimated 150 000 to 200 000 wells flatern 2015 electrical submersible pumps account for approximately 10 of the world s crude oil production takacs 2017 these systems are ideally suited to pumping high volumes at high pressure and the petroleum industry applies the method to pump petroleum at a high flow rate in offshore applications an electrical submersible pump is composed of several small diameter centrifugal stages typically 4 9 in that are mounted serially with an operational frequency range varying from 30 hz to 60 hz in a submerged esp installation a multistage centrifugal pump is coupled to a magnetic induction motor using a protector seal assembly filled with an insulating fluid that is heavier than water the electric motor is cooled by the oil well fluids that pass through the motor housing for subsea systems the output motor power may be higher than 1000 hp the structure can reach more than 40 m in length and the pump can operate in a high temperature environment pumping fluids containing abrasives minette et al 2016 the installation and intervention costs of esp based pumping systems are usually higher than those of other elevation methods particularly in the case of deep sea underwater wells ribeiro et al 2005 in addition to the high costs of installation and intervention faults in this equipment usually cause significant production losses since they typically operate in high production petroleum wells a careful evaluation of esp systems before installation is critical to prevent premature operational failure the risk of vibration problems is increased in equipment such as esp systems due to the difference between its considerable length and its small axial diameter the factory acceptance evaluation process of the esp system for fault diagnosis includes an expert vibration analysis of collected accelerometer signals during a test well operation following the recommendations found in the american petroleum institute s recommended practice document 11s8 api rp 11s8 despite the rigorous tests performed to detect possible faults esp systems still have relatively short run lives borling et al 2008 childs et al 2014 and vibration is the leading cause of failure bremmer et al 2006 durham et al 1990 yao et al 2011 the api rp 11s8 does not describe a specific method for estimating frequency component amplitudes in the vibration signals therefore technicians apply different spectrum estimation methods with different accuracies conventional methods consider the vibration signals as stationary but variation of the synchronous operating frequency has been observed in several esp facility tests with different configurations the synchronous operating frequency or simply synchronous frequency is the shaft speed which is approximately the motor s magnetic rotating field with the difference of a slip frequency that varies with the torque load randall 2010 gas interference or reservoir pressure variation are some of the causes of esp shaft speed variation a signal component frequency variation over time reduces the amplitude accuracy of the frequency spectra brandt and wiley 2010 the api rp 11s8 analysis procedure may suggest up to four different faults with the same probability of producing a symptom so the correct fault diagnosis is achieved by disassembling the equipment and performing an exhaustive evaluation of the many parts to differentiate the possible failures indicated electrical submersible pump vibration analysis studies are rare especially using multiple operating conditions and fluids in rauber et al 2013 for example a system for the detection and diagnosis of faults esp systems using a dataset composed of accelerometer sensor data examples from esp string tests labeled with only three different categories of faults normal unbalance or misalignment the data examples were labeled by visual inspection of the frequency spectra obtained from the fourier transform of the raw vibration signal the system used conventional fourier analysis which includes frequency spectrum estimation to extract the root mean square rms amplitude from frequencies from first and second orders harmonics of the shaft speed the results showed an accuracy of around 80 in boldt et al 2014 a performance analysis of automatic classifiers was presented using a dataset composed of accelerometer sensor data examples from esp string tests labeled with one of two categories normal and unbalance the study used fourier analysis to extract the amplitude from frequencies of six different orders harmonics of the shaft speed the results showed an accuracy of 98 5 in rauber et al 2017 a comparative study of classifier architectures for automatic fault diagnosis was presented using a dataset composed of accelerometer sensor data examples from esp string tests labeled with one of four categories normal unbalance misalignment and motor rubbing the study used fourier analysis to extract the frequency spectra and statistical features were computed from it the results showed an accuracy of around 80 these cited studies do not mention concerns about synchronous frequency variation or strategies to reduce amplitude loss in the frequency spectrum estimation the results of these studies indicate that the accuracy decreased with more vibration fault categories even using different advanced machine learning methods and architectures the studies have in common that the labeling process was mainly oriented by the industry standard some of the faults covered by the api rp 11s8 analysis process could be differentiated according to the relationships between synchronous frequency orders amplitudes for example following the api procedure only high vibrations at the synchronous frequency 1x indicate unbalance bent shaft and misalignment faults however usually the bent shaft and misalignment faults produce high vibrations in the 2x order synchronous frequency also adams 2010 betta et al 2002 patel and darpe 2009 scheffer and girdhar 2004 observing the relationship between frequency orders can help the differential diagnosis this study aims to investigate esp vibratory behavior looking for vibration characteristics beyond the ones observed by the industry s recommend practice api rp 11s8 that can differentiate the health condition of pumps and be useful for vibration fault detection and differential vibration diagnosis section 2 presents the experimental setup procedures and methods of vibration data acquisition following the industry standard s recommendations with two pumps of the same model but in different unknown health states seven different operating conditions five different operating speeds and two fluids of different viscosities fluid flow pressure and temperature data were also collected a frequency spectrum estimation method is proposed in section 2 3 focusing on extracting frequency component amplitudes observed in the api rp 11s8 procedure analysis and on reducing the amplitude estimation loss due to frequency variation in section 3 the esps vibration is analyzed by using the industry standard analysis on the frequency spectra estimated by the proposed method the vibration behavior is examined separately against fluid change rotating speed change and operating point change in section 3 5 a correlation analysis is performed looking for unanticipated correlations between temperature differences and vibration amplitude 2 experimental tests and methods 2 1 experimental setup the artificial lift laboratory of the industrial automation technological training center at the federal university of bahia ufba was used for the esp tests the facility was built with industrial equipment to reproduce the petroleum well field environment in a laboratory the facility is installed in the midspan of a spiral staircase in the polytechnic school with 2 5 m of free diameter and 32 m of height as shown in fig 1 a the artificial lift laboratory is supported by petrobras s a brazilian petroleum corporation and other partners through research and development projects mainly in the oil lifting field fig 1b shows a schematic diagram of the experimental configuration the esp system pumps fluid from an artificial well to a tank at the top of the building and the fluid flows back to the artificial well in a closed circuit the system was instrumented to control and collect data through a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system installed in the laboratory control room two data acquisition systems receive sensor signal data one from the accelerometers and another from all other devices the esp system s tubular production string was designed to handle output pressures of up to 1500 psi allen bradley sensors measure the oil well temperature and pressure at the pump intake and discharge and the fluid flow at the pump discharge the allen bradley temperature sensor model was 837e dc1bn1a1d4 the pressure sensor was 836e dc1er1d4 and the fluid flow sensor was 839e dc1ba1a3d4 table 1 presents information about these measurement devices the esp vibration acquisition was performed following the recommend practice document 11s8 api 2012 using 18 accelerometers orthogonally grouped in pairs as shown in fig 2 a six accelerometers were installed in each esp system equipment id numbers 1 6 in the motor 7 12 in the seal and 13 18 in the pump all accelerometers were fixed in the esp sections with a support that was designed and built for the purpose and fastened with a steel belt as shown in fig 2b the 18 accelerometers were industrial quartz shear icp model 624b11 by imi sensors with 100 mv g model sensitivity table 2 shows the accelerometers individual sensitivity from the manufacturer s accredited calibration during data processing the individual calibrated sensitivity was used the vibration signal acquisition system configuration included a computer data acquisition hardware accelerometers and data acquisition software developed by our research team the data acquisition hardware connected the accelerometers to the computer it was composed of a data acquisition chassis and five data acquisition modules installed in the chassis the chassis model was cdaq 9172 and the data acquisition modules were ni 9234 models both from national instruments ni the chassis provided measurements timing control synchronization and data transfer between input output modules and an external computer host the ni 9234 module was a four channel dynamic signal acquisition module with 24 bit resolution up to 51 2 ks s where ks is a thousand samples maximum sampling rate per channel 5 v input 102 db dynamic range and antialiasing filters this project used a 4267 ks s sampling rate a customized data acquisition software was developed in vb net language using the national instruments measurement studio the software can be used to visualize signals in real time and to store vibration signals with experiment metadata such as operating settings speed flow pressure esp components used accelerometer serial numbers and sensitivities two used baker hughes pumps were tested both 400pmxssd models series 400 type p4 with 70 stages one of the pumps came from an operational oil well and the other from the owner s storage and they were in different health conditions the pump model has a recommended flow range from 24 to 95 m3 d the best efficiency point bep at 3600 rpm operating with water is 72 m3 d with 48 efficiency with 0 22 kw power and 8 8 m head per stage at bep a set of a baker hughes components composed of a motor model fmhx 18hp 465v 25a serie 450 a seal chamber model fsb3xfer sb pfsa hl serie 400 and a gas separator model frx n ar were used in all the experiments with both pumps to compare the equipment s vibratory influence table 3 presents the geometrical details of the esp system components each pump was tested with two different viscous fluids the fluids were produced by petrobras and formulated from paraffinic petroleum mineral oils fluid samples were taken to measure the fluid with a digital viscometer an svm 3000 from anton paar to take the fluid samples the test oil well was fed with each fluid the recirculating pumping system was operated until it entered a steady state and then samples were taken tables 4 and 5 show the fluids descriptions the commercial product name specific mass and kinematic viscosity at several tested temperatures fluid 2 was a mixture because pure lubrax xp 220 is too viscous to be operated by the esp system used in the experiments the operating performance curves of the pump flow versus pressure at a specific speed were adjusted to the viscosity of the fluids used in the experiments because the manufacturer s performance curves were based on tests with water at 20 c and 3560 rpm as suggested in borges et al 2017 turzo s method takacs 2017 provided the best performance curve fitting thus this paper uses turzo s method to obtain the performance curve corrections the viscosity at 50 c was used to correct the manufacturer s performance curves because it was the average pump intake temperature observed during tests under steady state conditions as observed by the industry standard and methods for correcting operating performance curves to perform the experiments each pump was installed in the test well and tested operating with each fluid seven different operational points and five different rotational speeds were applied resulting in 70 different experimental tests per pump with each fluid a total of 140 experiments the rotating speeds were 2400 2700 3000 3300 and 3600 rpm 40 45 50 55 and 60 hz the operating points were derived from the viscosity corrected pump performance curves the minimum recommended flow min best efficiency point bep maximum recommended flow max and four additional intermediate points 1 min 2 50 of the bep flow 3 66 of the bep flow 4 83 of the bep flow 5 bep 6 117 of the bep flow 7 max in each test the pumping system was started at the preset speed and the flow rate was adjusted by the discharge valve so that the system reached the operating flow point to be tested after the system entered a steady state data collection from the measurement sensors was started finally after 160 seconds of steady state testing the data collection was terminated and the test procedures were restarted 2 2 esp vibration analysis in the api rp 11s8 document which includes considerations and definitions of vibration in esp systems the potential sources of vibration are listed for example as mass unbalance of materials misalignment of rotating components flow disturbance from turbulence and cavitation journal bearing rotation oil whirl and mechanical rubbing this document also presents relations between vibration frequencies to probable causes these vibration frequencies are orders of the synchronous frequency x rpm which is approximately the rotation speed for example in the api rp 11s8 document vibrations at 2x frequency twice the synchronous frequency are related to bent shaft fault and misalignment fault as probable causes in another example vibrations at 1 2x frequency half the synchronous frequency are related to mechanical rub fault and bearing rotating fault as probable causes severe vibration can decrease the esp system s run life as with any rotating machinery for all esp components the api recommends a maximum vibration velocity of 0 156 in s peak amplitude for each synchronous frequency 1x rpm and 0 100 in s peak amplitude for all other frequency components measured in the chassis of the equipment this limit must be applied for operation in the manufacturer s recommended ranges of flow pressure and speed operation at critical speeds is not recommended so the vibration limit analysis must account for this possibility resonance occurs when the vibration frequency matches a natural frequency of the support system amplifying the vibration a critical speed is one that causes this phenomenon there are some cases of critical speeds found in the range of operation speeds recommended by the manufacturer castillo et al 2019 minette et al 2016 usually the vibration increases proportionally to the operating speed a critical speed is a possibility when there is a sudden increase in the vibration amplitude at a specific speed followed by a drastic reduction at a higher speed 2 3 frequency spectrum estimation typically the vibration frequency spectrum estimation of rotating machines operating at a fixed speed considers the vibration signals to be stationary in this way the linear spectrum estimator is used with the highest signal length acquired this ensures the highest possible frequency resolution to guarantee the maximum distinction between vibration phenomena the linear spectrum estimator is created by applying the discrete fourier transform dft to the signal multiplied by a window function of the analyst s choice however synchronous operating frequency variation was observed in esp experiments in different experimental configurations and laboratories the variation may be caused by for example gas interference or variations in reservoir level whatever the cause signal frequency variation may reduce the amplitude accuracy of the frequency spectra brandt 2011 the signal frequency variation observed in the experiments is not easy to detect and is small relative to transient signals but it is enough to reduce the amplitude accuracy as will be demonstrated in the results section to deal with signal frequency variation this paper proposes to reduce the measurement time window to the minimum necessary to identify signal components the reduction of the time window reduces the spectral frequency resolution resulting in possible difficulties in identifying signal components in this case the necessary minimum frequency resolution must be estimated to find the minimum time window spectral frequency resolution is a consequence of the frequency increment and the use of time window functions the frequency increment is the distance between two frequency values in the frequency spectrum which is δ f 1 t so it depends only on the measurement time window t the use of time window functions offers better frequency amplitude representation but causes an energy distribution of the peak amplitude by the size of the window s main lobe thus two closed signal frequency components may superpose each other the minimum frequency resolution needed to distinguish all api rp 11s8 frequency components was estimated using equation 1 1 f r m i n δ x m i n f o m i n 4 l m where δ x m i n is the minimum difference between api rp 118 synchronous frequency orders x f o m i n is the minimum operating frequency tested l m is the width of the main lobe of the window function used and four is a scalar used to guarantee a minimum distance of two free frequency increments on both sides of each api rp 118 frequency order the minimum time window needed is 2 t m i n 1 f r m i n in this study the minimum operating frequency was 40 hz and the hanning window was used which has a main lobe width of two the closest api rp 11s8 frequency orders are 0 48x and 0 5x and its respective minimum difference is 0 02 from equations 1 and 2 an estimate of a 10 second minimum time interval was obtained with the minimum time interval t m i n determined the accelerometer signals were processed according to the schematic diagram shown in fig 3 to obtain their frequency spectra in the data processing first the signals are converted from volt units v to acceleration units m s2 according to the individual calibrated sensitivity of each accelerometer as shown in table 2 and then converted from the metric system to the imperial system which is the system used by the api rp 11s8 the direct current dc voltage level was removed by subtracting the mean of each signal the trapezoidal integration was used to convert acceleration units to velocity units in s as the industry recommended practice uses velocity units to evaluate the vibration a butterworth iir high pass filter of order two with a cut off of 10 hz was applied pre and post integration to eliminate low frequency anomalies common to the integration process the truncation required to convert the signal into a finite length causes a leakage effect which leads to an amplitude error in the frequency spectrum the signals were processed with the hanning window to reduce the leakage effect the hanning window balances noise injection and reduced amplitude inaccuracy the hanning window has a main lobe of two frequency increments which was used to calculate the minimum time window above the coefficients of a hanning window are 3 w n 0 5 1 cos 2 π n n 0 n n 1 where n is the length of the window and n is the index of each coefficient the hanning windowed signal was then the multiplication of the samples x n of sampled signal x with the coefficients of the hanning window 4 x w n w n x n for the spectral content of the signals the dft was calculated for each signal by 5 x k 1 n n 0 n 1 x w n e i 2 π k n n 0 k n 1 where x w n are samples of a hanning windowed signal with n samples and x k are the dft bins of x n where k are indexes of the dft bins and i is the imaginary number the discrete frequencies in the dft are 6 f k k δ f the computation of dft is efficiently carried out by an fast fourier transform fft algorithm oppenheim 1999 in computing the frequency spectrum the single sided spectrum is adopted as is shown in the following formula 7 x s s k 2 x k 0 k n 2 1 the windowing process removes energy from the signal proportional to the sum of the window function coefficients used and to compensate for this is necessary to use a w as a scalar amplitude correction factor brandt 2011 8 a w n n o n 1 w n which for the hanning window is precisely two then the final spectrum is 9 x w k a w x s s k for the peak amplitude extraction of the api rp 11s8 frequency orders the algorithm first identifies the synchronous frequency by looking for the highest peak amplitude in a 10 range around the equipment s operating speed with the range accounting for motor frequency slip with the synchronous frequency the peaks of the api rp 11s8 orders are identified by searching for the highest peak amplitude within a range determined by twice the frequency increment around the synchronous frequency multiplied by the values of the api rp 11s8 orders i e 1x 2x 0 42x to 0 48x 2 4 spectrogram the spectrogram is typically obtained by applying a fixed length moving window to the time varying data sequence before computing the spectrum which is the short time fourier transform its time window length is chosen by considering the trade off between the time and frequency resolutions obtainable lee and han 1998 in this study the typical process to generate spectrograms was applied to the raw accelerometer signal using five times the samples of the sampling rate 4267 x 5 as the window size 5 seconds and an overlap of 200 samples between windows 2 5 correlation analysis correlation analysis is a method for measuring the covariance of two random variables in a matched dataset covariance is typically expressed as the correlation coefficient of two variables x and y a correlation coefficient is a unitless number that varies from 1 to 1 the sign of the correlation coefficient shows if the correlation is positive or negative and the magnitude shows the correlation force between x and y de lima et al 2009 a negative coefficient indicates that as one variable increases the other decreases a positive coefficient indicates that as one variable increases the other also increases pearson s linear correlation coefficient one of the most frequently used linear correlation coefficients was used here pearson s linear correlation coefficient p x y is defined as 10 p x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y y 2 where x i and y i are samples of x and y indexed with i x i 1 n x i n and y i 1 n y i n the correlation matrix of two variables is the matrix of correlation coefficients for each pairwise variable combination 11 r p x x p x y p y x p y y since x and y are always directly correlated to themselves the diagonal entries resolve to one 12 r 1 p x y p y x 1 in this study a correlation matrix was created using the seven sample values of variables from the experiments with seven different operating points but at the same speed of 3600 rpm the variables used in the matrix are well intake fluid temperature well discharge fluid temperature intake discharge temperature difference z axis accelerometer 1x order peak vibration amplitude at the top of the pump and well fluid flow discharge 3 results and discussion in section 3 1 the amplitude accuracy of the frequency spectrum estimation method is compared to the typical method applied to the quasi stationary vibration signals acquired in the experiments in section 3 2 the vibration of the pumps is analyzed using the industry standard process which leads to various possible diagnostics sections 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 present the search for vibration patterns beyond the typical esp vibration analysis to provide a non invasive fault differential diagnosis in section 3 3 the vibration behavior at different accelerometer positions and in the tests with different fluids is analyzed in section 3 4 the vibration behavior in tests at different speeds is analyzed finally in section 3 5 the vibration behavior in tests of different operating points is analyzed 3 1 the frequency spectrum of the time domain vibration signals time domain signal stationarity is essential to the accuracy of frequency spectrum estimation so spectrograms were used to evaluate the behavior of signal components in time before performing the main analyses fig 4 shows spectrograms of 160 second signals from the z axis accelerometer on top of pumps 1 and 2 operating with fluid 1 at 3600 rpm in the bep the highest magnitude is in yellow and shows the synchronous frequency vibration of the 160 second accelerometer signal the synchronous frequency of pump 1 varied from 56 45 hz to 56 35 hz and that of pump 2 varied from 56 75 hz to 56 65 hz the slight frequency variation observed shown in fig 4a and b is probably due to fluid temperature and viscosity variation during the data collection this change in frequency may be relatively small but it reduces the amplitude accuracy of a high resolution frequency spectrum which may impair a vibration analysis based on peak limits as shown in section 2 3 equation 1 and equation 2 were used to obtain an estimate of a 10 second minimum time interval to identify api rp 11s8 frequency orders and to minimize frequency variation over time fig 5 shows the frequency spectra obtained from a 160 second time signal and a 10 second time signal from the z axis accelerometer fixed on top of pumps 1 and 2 operating with fluid 1 at 3600 rpm at the bep the figure shows that api rp 11s8 synchronous operating frequency x orders were correctly identified by the described method of frequency spectra estimation and amplitude extraction using both time window intervals fig 5a is the frequency spectrum of the 160 second time signal from pump 1 the 1x amplitude peak of which was 0 05 in s the corresponding peak in the 10 second time signal was 0 08 in s figs 5c 60 higher in the frequency spectra from pump 2 the 160 second time signal 1x peak was 0 140 in s fig 5b which was below the api rp 11s8 limit but when using the 10 second time window the evaluated 1x peak amplitude was 0 313 in s figs 5d 120 higher this reveals that the vibration in this pump was above the api rp 11s8 limit the other api rp 11s8 frequency orders showed similar differences in amplitude using the shorter time signal the results show that the minimum time signal interval presents a greater amplitude accuracy thus this was the time signal interval chosen for vibration analysis in all experiments 3 2 api rp 11s8 vibration diagnosis of the pumps table 6 shows the vibration peaks of each api rp 11s8 synchronous frequency order during the two pump experiments at 3600 rpm at the bep with fluid 1 pump 1 did not show amplitudes above the vibration limits in any accelerometer the highest vibration was 0 101 in s which was detected by the z axis accelerometer at the middle of the pump in the 1x order pump 2 presented several 1x order peaks above the vibration limit shown in bold in table 6 especially at the pump top pump with a maximum of 0 313 in s this 1x order vibration is associated with the following causes according to api rp 11s8 1 mass unbalance hydraulic unbalance or a decentralized rotor 2 a bent shaft 3 a misaligned coupling or shaft bearing or both the api rp 11s8 analysis method indicates these three possible diagnostics which may not necessarily occur simultaneously each may involve faults in several internal pump components which need to be individually inspected for a more precise fault diagnostic however the three diagnostic hypotheses may be further differentiated by analyzing the relationships between the synchronous frequency order amplitudes usually the bent shaft and misalignment diagnostics produce similar high vibrations in the 2x order also and a high level of axial vibration adams 2010 betta et al 2002 patel and darpe 2009 scheffer and girdhar 2004 in the case of the experiments performed the axial vibration was not acquired but as observed in table 6 the pump 2 2x amplitude peak was much smaller than the 1x amplitude peak although there is a higher possibility of an unbalance fault diagnosis the 2x amplitude higher peak at the base of pump 2 and the 1x amplitude higher peak at the top suggest different diagnoses that is why a better method is needed to differentiate other vibration behavior characteristics as described below 3 3 vibration at components and fluid change fig 6 and fig 7 show the frequency spectra of the accelerometer signals from the esp system s main equipment motor seal and pump collected at 3600 rpm at the bep fig 6a and b are spectra from signals collected during the pump 1 experiments operating with fluid 1 and fig 6c and d are from experiments with fluid 2 fig 7a and b are spectra from signals collected during the pump 2 experiments operating with fluid 1 and fig 7c and d are from experiments with fluid 2 these figures show the vibration peak distribution of all esp components to allow evaluation of the vibration distribution between components and the influence of the fluid in the pump 1 experiments with fluid 1 the highest peak was 0 135 in s from the 1x order of the accelerometer 11 signal fig 6a which was collected from the seal top at z axis the second highest peak was 0 097 in s from the 1x order on the y axis at the same location fig 6b these two peaks were below the vibration limit however given that the vibration amplitude of neighboring locations exhibited a decreasing behavior the high peaks at the top of the seal suggest a possible problem in the coupling between the pump and the seal at the seal top location the 2x order peak was 0 040 in s which is about a third of the 1x order peak at the same location this proportion suggests a bent shaft or angular misalignment faults in the coupling between the pump and the seal adams 2010 patel and darpe 2009 however the vibration amplitude is below the api rp 11s8 vibration limit the highest peak 1x order of esp for pump 1 operating with fluid 2 was 0 155 in s registered by accelerometer 11 fig 6c located on the seal at the top z axis and the second highest 1x order peak was 0 152 in s registered on the y axis at the same location fig 6d the overall vibration distribution was similar to the experiment with fluid 1 except it showed a 14 higher vibration on the seal top z axis which may indicate that the higher viscosity of fluid 2 increased the vibration in the experiment with pump 2 and fluid 1 the 1x order highest peak was 0 326 in s registered by accelerometer 11 fig 7a which was located on the seal top z axis this reinforces the indication observed in the pump 1 tests using the same seal that there may be a problem in the coupling between the pump and the seal the second highest peak of the 1x order was 0 313 in s registered by accelerometer 17 which was located on the pump top z axis fig 7a given that this vibration peak was far from the seal its cause is in the pump itself the highest 1x order peak during the experiment using pump 2 and fluid 2 was 0 187 in s registered by accelerometer 11 fig 7c which was located on the seal top z axis the second highest 1x order peak was 0 186 in s registered by accelerometer 17 which was located on the pump top z axis fig 7c the overall vibration distribution was similar to the experiment with fluid 1 but with a 41 lower vibration which may indicate that the higher fluid 2 viscosity reduced the vibration cause the overall vibration amplitudes at the motor and seal components measured by accelerometers 1 12 were different between tests using pump 1 and pump 2 although the components were the same in both assemblies the motor and seal vibrations were higher when operating with pump 2 than with pump 1 which may indicate that these vibration results are primarily a consequence of the pump s operational condition comparing the results using the less viscous fluid fluid 1 with the results using the more viscous fluid fluid 2 on average there was an increase in the pump 1 peaks on the other way operation with a more viscous fluid caused a reduction in the vibration peaks of pump 2 the results suggest that in the good condition pump 1 an increase in fluid viscosity amplified the vibration perhaps causing some unbalance due to greater torsional deformation in the esp shafts on the other hand a more viscous fluid may have attenuated the excessive vibration in the faulty pump perhaps acting as a damper of its fault 3 4 speed variation behavior fig 8 a and fig 8b show the 1x order vibration peak amplitude and its respective frequency on the pump top z axis accelerometer in the pump 1 and pump 2 experiments operating at five different rotational speeds at the bep with fluids 1 and 2 an amplified vibration amplitude response was observed in the esp between 45 hz and 50 hz with pump 1 using both fluids fig 8a which indicates a resonance condition in pump 1 resonance conditions with esp systems have previously been identified within the manufacturer s operating speed range minette et al 2016 also an amplified vibration amplitude response in the esp was observed between 50 hz and 55 hz with pump 2 but only with fluid 2 fig 8b a possible resonance condition in pump 2 influenced by the properties of fluid 2 needs to be further examined although the two pumps were identical models they were in different states of wear the wear state can affect the frequency response of the system which explains the different resonance condition possibilities the vibration amplitude of pump 2 at the highest synchronous frequency with both fluids was not associated with a resonance condition and was above the industry s recommendation of 0 156 in s fig 8b the vibration amplitude of pump 1 showed a general tendency to increase in proportion to the increase in the synchronous frequency the vibration amplitude of pump 2 also showed a general tendency to increase in proportion to the increase in the synchronous frequency but above the vibration amplitudes of pump 1 one of the most common problems that causes vibration is unbalance as described in adams 2010 randall 2016 and scheffer and girdhar 2004 the unbalance vibration amplitude varies proportionally to the square of the rotating speed giving the unbalanced mass centrifugal force f m ω 2 r where m is the unbalanced mass ω is the angular velocity and r is the distance from the unbalanced mass to the center of rotation is proportional to the square of the rotating speed some degree of unbalance is expected in rotating machines due to material and manufacturing imperfections however when the vibration is beyond a limit the unbalance becomes a problem with the pump 2 vibration peak amplitude above the recommended limit in the 1x order the industry recommended practice indicates unbalance bent shaft or misalignment as probable causes either simultaneous or not however given the increase in vibration amplitude associated with the increase in synchronous operating frequency the unbalance vibration diagnosis is more likely 3 5 flow and pressure variation behavior fig 9 a and fig 9b show the vibration peak amplitudes of 1x order at the pump top z axis accelerometer on pumps 1 and 2 during seven operating points tests at the 3600 rpm speed 60 hz pumping fluids 1 and 2 fig 9a shows that varying the operating point had little influence on the vibration amplitude at pump 1 regardless of the fluid used in contrast fig 9b shows considerable variation in the vibration amplitude with pump 2 and the variation curve seems to be without tendency as the shapes of the diffusers and impellers in pump 2 may have been modified due to wear with fluid dynamic consequences it is not possible to associate a specific physical phenomenon to the great vibration peak variation shown in fig 9b the variation does not seem related only to the changes in the operating point and the curve is similar using fluids 1 and 2 correlation matrices were generated as described in section 2 5 to investigate possible additional effects influencing the pump 2 amplitudes at several operating points fig 10 shows correlations between pairs of variables measured during pump 2 experiments operating at 3600 rpm the well intake fluid temperature tin the well discharge fluid temperature tdis the intake discharge temperature difference tdif the z axis accelerometer 1x order peak vibration amplitude at the pump top 1x peak and the well fluid flow discharge qdis fig 10 also shows the histograms of the variables the matrix diagonal and scatter plots of the variable pairs the slopes of the least squares reference lines in the scatter plots are equal to the correlation coefficients in the fig 10 the 0 17 correlation value between the well intake temperature tin and the 1x order peak amplitude indicates that there was no significant influence between the intake temperature variation and the pump vibration s peak amplitude the 0 85 correlation value between the well intake temperature and its discharge temperature tdis is high and was expected because well intake temperatures influence the discharge temperatures the 0 36 correlation value between the well discharge temperature and the 1x order peak amplitude indicates that the well discharge temperature had a more significant influence on the 1x order peak amplitude than the intake temperature the 0 95 correlation value between the intake discharge temperature difference tdif and the 1x order vibration peak amplitude is higher than any other correlation this may indicate that the vibration amplitude variation when the operating point was varied is more related to the fluid temperature difference between the pump intake and discharge than other variables neither the intake temperature nor the discharge temperature alone showed such a high correlation with vibration fig 11 a and fig 11b show the z axis accelerometer 1x order vibration peak amplitudes at the top of pumps 1 and 2 together with the oil well s intake and discharge fluid temperature difference by operating point at 3600 rpm fig 11a shows that the 1x order vibration amplitude of pump 1 did not vary while there was substantial fluid temperature difference variation fig 11b shows that the 1x order vibration amplitude of pump 2 was significantly correlated to the fluid temperature difference fig 12 a and fig 12b show the same relationships in the fluid 2 experiments the increased intake discharge temperature difference in the faulty pump tests was expected because an additional part of the energy given to the fluid is transformed into heat due to the reduced efficiency of used pumps it is well known that fluid temperature may significantly influence viscosity and may also affect the stiffness of pump components however both may not affect vibration in the same way since pump 1 does not present vibration above the industry standard limit and does not present much amplitude variation under fluid temperature difference variation while pump 2 shows this characteristic may be seen as another fault symptom in pump 2 and that fault appears to be strongly influenced by the temperature difference between the intake and discharge the temperature difference in the pump extremes can cause a difference in fluid density sufficient to create an axial unbalance but to this axial unbalance affect pump 2 only his shaft could be with reduced stiffness this characteristic may reinforce the diagnostic hypothesis that this pump has unbalance and the hypothesis that it has reduced stiffness in the shaft this high correlation between temperature difference and 1x order vibration peak amplitude may also be used as complementary information to help in the differential diagnosis of vibration faults 4 conclusions in this paper an experimental investigation of the vibration behavior of two esps in different wear states under different operating conditions was presented the experiments followed industry recommendations using an artificial lift test oil well and viscous fluids to reflect field operational conditions the pumps were tested with two different viscous fluids seven different operating points flow versus pressure and five different speeds to evaluate their vibration behavior a frequency spectrum estimation method was described focusing on extracting the vibration amplitude from frequency components used in api rp 11s8 analysis and minimizing the amplitude loss in signals with frequency variation the experimental results indicated that the synchronous frequency varied during the experiments and the api rp 11s8 frequency components were effectively identified by the frequency estimation method with more accurate peak amplitudes than those obtained using a typical method the results of the industry recommended vibration analysis indicated that a faulty pump exceeded the vibration limit by more than double at the synchronous frequency 1x according to the recommended practice three possible faults not necessarily co occurring may be suggested mass unbalance bent shaft and misalignment the api rp 11s8 vibration analysis does not indicate a non invasive method for diagnostic differentiation regardless of the standard industrial analysis the relationship of peak vibrations between orders of the synchronous frequency indicated a greater likelihood of unbalance the vibration behavior analysis with fluid change indicated that the fluid s viscosity had a more significant influence in the pump that showed higher vibration decreasing the amplitude the pump that was in good condition with low vibration showed slightly vibration amplitude increase with the more viscous fluid but remained far from the vibration limit the high vibration pump showed less vibration amplitude when operating with the more viscous fluid but remained above the vibration limit which may indicate that the viscosity acted as a damper to the vibration cause the vibration behavior analysis at different operating points showed no significant amplitude variation in the pump that was in good condition and high amplitude variation in the faulty pump exploratory analysis using a correlation matrix indicated that the vibration amplitude in the faulty pump was highly correlated to the fluid temperature difference between the well s intake and discharge while the discharge temperature and intake temperature alone showed lower correlations with the vibration amplitude although the increased intake discharge temperature difference in the pump tests was expected because an additional part of the energy given to the fluid is transformed into heat due to the reduced efficiency of used pumps the high correlation between temperature difference and 1x order vibration peak amplitude can be applied as complementary information during vibration diagnosis the vibration behavior analysis of different speeds demonstrated that the faulty pump presented a vibration amplitude increase approximately proportional to the square of the speed which is correlated to an unbalance fault this characteristic may also be used for esp differential diagnosis from the other api rp 11s8 fault options involving similar spectra such as misalignment or a bent shaft in future

21224,an electric submersible pump esp vibration analysis was performed considering different wear states and operational conditions the pumps were tested with different fluid viscosities operating points and speeds to evaluate their vibration behavior with the aim of providing characteristics for non invasive differential vibration diagnosis a specific frequency spectrum estimation method is described focusing on the extraction of frequency component vibration amplitudes used in the petroleum industry standard vibration analysis a time interval definition procedure was proposed to reduce signal amplitude losses due to variation of synchronous operating frequency the results indicate that the frequency component peak amplitudes can be more accurately identified during synchronous frequency variation by the proposed method than by typical estimation methods in this study an esp vibration differential diagnosis was achieved by analyzing relations between orders of the synchronous frequency and by distinguishing that the synchronous component amplitude rose approximately proportionally to the square of the rotating speed this differentiates unbalance fault from a bent shaft or a misalignment a correlation matrix analysis is provided to demonstrate that variation in the fluid temperature difference between the pump intake and discharge is related to the vibration amplitude variation in a pump with a vibration fault keywords vibratory behavior synchronous frequency variation differential diagnosis correlation analysis temperature influence 1 introduction electrical submersible pumps esps are the second most common artificial lifting method applied worldwide liang et al 2015 deployed in it is estimated 150 000 to 200 000 wells flatern 2015 electrical submersible pumps account for approximately 10 of the world s crude oil production takacs 2017 these systems are ideally suited to pumping high volumes at high pressure and the petroleum industry applies the method to pump petroleum at a high flow rate in offshore applications an electrical submersible pump is composed of several small diameter centrifugal stages typically 4 9 in that are mounted serially with an operational frequency range varying from 30 hz to 60 hz in a submerged esp installation a multistage centrifugal pump is coupled to a magnetic induction motor using a protector seal assembly filled with an insulating fluid that is heavier than water the electric motor is cooled by the oil well fluids that pass through the motor housing for subsea systems the output motor power may be higher than 1000 hp the structure can reach more than 40 m in length and the pump can operate in a high temperature environment pumping fluids containing abrasives minette et al 2016 the installation and intervention costs of esp based pumping systems are usually higher than those of other elevation methods particularly in the case of deep sea underwater wells ribeiro et al 2005 in addition to the high costs of installation and intervention faults in this equipment usually cause significant production losses since they typically operate in high production petroleum wells a careful evaluation of esp systems before installation is critical to prevent premature operational failure the risk of vibration problems is increased in equipment such as esp systems due to the difference between its considerable length and its small axial diameter the factory acceptance evaluation process of the esp system for fault diagnosis includes an expert vibration analysis of collected accelerometer signals during a test well operation following the recommendations found in the american petroleum institute s recommended practice document 11s8 api rp 11s8 despite the rigorous tests performed to detect possible faults esp systems still have relatively short run lives borling et al 2008 childs et al 2014 and vibration is the leading cause of failure bremmer et al 2006 durham et al 1990 yao et al 2011 the api rp 11s8 does not describe a specific method for estimating frequency component amplitudes in the vibration signals therefore technicians apply different spectrum estimation methods with different accuracies conventional methods consider the vibration signals as stationary but variation of the synchronous operating frequency has been observed in several esp facility tests with different configurations the synchronous operating frequency or simply synchronous frequency is the shaft speed which is approximately the motor s magnetic rotating field with the difference of a slip frequency that varies with the torque load randall 2010 gas interference or reservoir pressure variation are some of the causes of esp shaft speed variation a signal component frequency variation over time reduces the amplitude accuracy of the frequency spectra brandt and wiley 2010 the api rp 11s8 analysis procedure may suggest up to four different faults with the same probability of producing a symptom so the correct fault diagnosis is achieved by disassembling the equipment and performing an exhaustive evaluation of the many parts to differentiate the possible failures indicated electrical submersible pump vibration analysis studies are rare especially using multiple operating conditions and fluids in rauber et al 2013 for example a system for the detection and diagnosis of faults esp systems using a dataset composed of accelerometer sensor data examples from esp string tests labeled with only three different categories of faults normal unbalance or misalignment the data examples were labeled by visual inspection of the frequency spectra obtained from the fourier transform of the raw vibration signal the system used conventional fourier analysis which includes frequency spectrum estimation to extract the root mean square rms amplitude from frequencies from first and second orders harmonics of the shaft speed the results showed an accuracy of around 80 in boldt et al 2014 a performance analysis of automatic classifiers was presented using a dataset composed of accelerometer sensor data examples from esp string tests labeled with one of two categories normal and unbalance the study used fourier analysis to extract the amplitude from frequencies of six different orders harmonics of the shaft speed the results showed an accuracy of 98 5 in rauber et al 2017 a comparative study of classifier architectures for automatic fault diagnosis was presented using a dataset composed of accelerometer sensor data examples from esp string tests labeled with one of four categories normal unbalance misalignment and motor rubbing the study used fourier analysis to extract the frequency spectra and statistical features were computed from it the results showed an accuracy of around 80 these cited studies do not mention concerns about synchronous frequency variation or strategies to reduce amplitude loss in the frequency spectrum estimation the results of these studies indicate that the accuracy decreased with more vibration fault categories even using different advanced machine learning methods and architectures the studies have in common that the labeling process was mainly oriented by the industry standard some of the faults covered by the api rp 11s8 analysis process could be differentiated according to the relationships between synchronous frequency orders amplitudes for example following the api procedure only high vibrations at the synchronous frequency 1x indicate unbalance bent shaft and misalignment faults however usually the bent shaft and misalignment faults produce high vibrations in the 2x order synchronous frequency also adams 2010 betta et al 2002 patel and darpe 2009 scheffer and girdhar 2004 observing the relationship between frequency orders can help the differential diagnosis this study aims to investigate esp vibratory behavior looking for vibration characteristics beyond the ones observed by the industry s recommend practice api rp 11s8 that can differentiate the health condition of pumps and be useful for vibration fault detection and differential vibration diagnosis section 2 presents the experimental setup procedures and methods of vibration data acquisition following the industry standard s recommendations with two pumps of the same model but in different unknown health states seven different operating conditions five different operating speeds and two fluids of different viscosities fluid flow pressure and temperature data were also collected a frequency spectrum estimation method is proposed in section 2 3 focusing on extracting frequency component amplitudes observed in the api rp 11s8 procedure analysis and on reducing the amplitude estimation loss due to frequency variation in section 3 the esps vibration is analyzed by using the industry standard analysis on the frequency spectra estimated by the proposed method the vibration behavior is examined separately against fluid change rotating speed change and operating point change in section 3 5 a correlation analysis is performed looking for unanticipated correlations between temperature differences and vibration amplitude 2 experimental tests and methods 2 1 experimental setup the artificial lift laboratory of the industrial automation technological training center at the federal university of bahia ufba was used for the esp tests the facility was built with industrial equipment to reproduce the petroleum well field environment in a laboratory the facility is installed in the midspan of a spiral staircase in the polytechnic school with 2 5 m of free diameter and 32 m of height as shown in fig 1 a the artificial lift laboratory is supported by petrobras s a brazilian petroleum corporation and other partners through research and development projects mainly in the oil lifting field fig 1b shows a schematic diagram of the experimental configuration the esp system pumps fluid from an artificial well to a tank at the top of the building and the fluid flows back to the artificial well in a closed circuit the system was instrumented to control and collect data through a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system installed in the laboratory control room two data acquisition systems receive sensor signal data one from the accelerometers and another from all other devices the esp system s tubular production string was designed to handle output pressures of up to 1500 psi allen bradley sensors measure the oil well temperature and pressure at the pump intake and discharge and the fluid flow at the pump discharge the allen bradley temperature sensor model was 837e dc1bn1a1d4 the pressure sensor was 836e dc1er1d4 and the fluid flow sensor was 839e dc1ba1a3d4 table 1 presents information about these measurement devices the esp vibration acquisition was performed following the recommend practice document 11s8 api 2012 using 18 accelerometers orthogonally grouped in pairs as shown in fig 2 a six accelerometers were installed in each esp system equipment id numbers 1 6 in the motor 7 12 in the seal and 13 18 in the pump all accelerometers were fixed in the esp sections with a support that was designed and built for the purpose and fastened with a steel belt as shown in fig 2b the 18 accelerometers were industrial quartz shear icp model 624b11 by imi sensors with 100 mv g model sensitivity table 2 shows the accelerometers individual sensitivity from the manufacturer s accredited calibration during data processing the individual calibrated sensitivity was used the vibration signal acquisition system configuration included a computer data acquisition hardware accelerometers and data acquisition software developed by our research team the data acquisition hardware connected the accelerometers to the computer it was composed of a data acquisition chassis and five data acquisition modules installed in the chassis the chassis model was cdaq 9172 and the data acquisition modules were ni 9234 models both from national instruments ni the chassis provided measurements timing control synchronization and data transfer between input output modules and an external computer host the ni 9234 module was a four channel dynamic signal acquisition module with 24 bit resolution up to 51 2 ks s where ks is a thousand samples maximum sampling rate per channel 5 v input 102 db dynamic range and antialiasing filters this project used a 4267 ks s sampling rate a customized data acquisition software was developed in vb net language using the national instruments measurement studio the software can be used to visualize signals in real time and to store vibration signals with experiment metadata such as operating settings speed flow pressure esp components used accelerometer serial numbers and sensitivities two used baker hughes pumps were tested both 400pmxssd models series 400 type p4 with 70 stages one of the pumps came from an operational oil well and the other from the owner s storage and they were in different health conditions the pump model has a recommended flow range from 24 to 95 m3 d the best efficiency point bep at 3600 rpm operating with water is 72 m3 d with 48 efficiency with 0 22 kw power and 8 8 m head per stage at bep a set of a baker hughes components composed of a motor model fmhx 18hp 465v 25a serie 450 a seal chamber model fsb3xfer sb pfsa hl serie 400 and a gas separator model frx n ar were used in all the experiments with both pumps to compare the equipment s vibratory influence table 3 presents the geometrical details of the esp system components each pump was tested with two different viscous fluids the fluids were produced by petrobras and formulated from paraffinic petroleum mineral oils fluid samples were taken to measure the fluid with a digital viscometer an svm 3000 from anton paar to take the fluid samples the test oil well was fed with each fluid the recirculating pumping system was operated until it entered a steady state and then samples were taken tables 4 and 5 show the fluids descriptions the commercial product name specific mass and kinematic viscosity at several tested temperatures fluid 2 was a mixture because pure lubrax xp 220 is too viscous to be operated by the esp system used in the experiments the operating performance curves of the pump flow versus pressure at a specific speed were adjusted to the viscosity of the fluids used in the experiments because the manufacturer s performance curves were based on tests with water at 20 c and 3560 rpm as suggested in borges et al 2017 turzo s method takacs 2017 provided the best performance curve fitting thus this paper uses turzo s method to obtain the performance curve corrections the viscosity at 50 c was used to correct the manufacturer s performance curves because it was the average pump intake temperature observed during tests under steady state conditions as observed by the industry standard and methods for correcting operating performance curves to perform the experiments each pump was installed in the test well and tested operating with each fluid seven different operational points and five different rotational speeds were applied resulting in 70 different experimental tests per pump with each fluid a total of 140 experiments the rotating speeds were 2400 2700 3000 3300 and 3600 rpm 40 45 50 55 and 60 hz the operating points were derived from the viscosity corrected pump performance curves the minimum recommended flow min best efficiency point bep maximum recommended flow max and four additional intermediate points 1 min 2 50 of the bep flow 3 66 of the bep flow 4 83 of the bep flow 5 bep 6 117 of the bep flow 7 max in each test the pumping system was started at the preset speed and the flow rate was adjusted by the discharge valve so that the system reached the operating flow point to be tested after the system entered a steady state data collection from the measurement sensors was started finally after 160 seconds of steady state testing the data collection was terminated and the test procedures were restarted 2 2 esp vibration analysis in the api rp 11s8 document which includes considerations and definitions of vibration in esp systems the potential sources of vibration are listed for example as mass unbalance of materials misalignment of rotating components flow disturbance from turbulence and cavitation journal bearing rotation oil whirl and mechanical rubbing this document also presents relations between vibration frequencies to probable causes these vibration frequencies are orders of the synchronous frequency x rpm which is approximately the rotation speed for example in the api rp 11s8 document vibrations at 2x frequency twice the synchronous frequency are related to bent shaft fault and misalignment fault as probable causes in another example vibrations at 1 2x frequency half the synchronous frequency are related to mechanical rub fault and bearing rotating fault as probable causes severe vibration can decrease the esp system s run life as with any rotating machinery for all esp components the api recommends a maximum vibration velocity of 0 156 in s peak amplitude for each synchronous frequency 1x rpm and 0 100 in s peak amplitude for all other frequency components measured in the chassis of the equipment this limit must be applied for operation in the manufacturer s recommended ranges of flow pressure and speed operation at critical speeds is not recommended so the vibration limit analysis must account for this possibility resonance occurs when the vibration frequency matches a natural frequency of the support system amplifying the vibration a critical speed is one that causes this phenomenon there are some cases of critical speeds found in the range of operation speeds recommended by the manufacturer castillo et al 2019 minette et al 2016 usually the vibration increases proportionally to the operating speed a critical speed is a possibility when there is a sudden increase in the vibration amplitude at a specific speed followed by a drastic reduction at a higher speed 2 3 frequency spectrum estimation typically the vibration frequency spectrum estimation of rotating machines operating at a fixed speed considers the vibration signals to be stationary in this way the linear spectrum estimator is used with the highest signal length acquired this ensures the highest possible frequency resolution to guarantee the maximum distinction between vibration phenomena the linear spectrum estimator is created by applying the discrete fourier transform dft to the signal multiplied by a window function of the analyst s choice however synchronous operating frequency variation was observed in esp experiments in different experimental configurations and laboratories the variation may be caused by for example gas interference or variations in reservoir level whatever the cause signal frequency variation may reduce the amplitude accuracy of the frequency spectra brandt 2011 the signal frequency variation observed in the experiments is not easy to detect and is small relative to transient signals but it is enough to reduce the amplitude accuracy as will be demonstrated in the results section to deal with signal frequency variation this paper proposes to reduce the measurement time window to the minimum necessary to identify signal components the reduction of the time window reduces the spectral frequency resolution resulting in possible difficulties in identifying signal components in this case the necessary minimum frequency resolution must be estimated to find the minimum time window spectral frequency resolution is a consequence of the frequency increment and the use of time window functions the frequency increment is the distance between two frequency values in the frequency spectrum which is δ f 1 t so it depends only on the measurement time window t the use of time window functions offers better frequency amplitude representation but causes an energy distribution of the peak amplitude by the size of the window s main lobe thus two closed signal frequency components may superpose each other the minimum frequency resolution needed to distinguish all api rp 11s8 frequency components was estimated using equation 1 1 f r m i n δ x m i n f o m i n 4 l m where δ x m i n is the minimum difference between api rp 118 synchronous frequency orders x f o m i n is the minimum operating frequency tested l m is the width of the main lobe of the window function used and four is a scalar used to guarantee a minimum distance of two free frequency increments on both sides of each api rp 118 frequency order the minimum time window needed is 2 t m i n 1 f r m i n in this study the minimum operating frequency was 40 hz and the hanning window was used which has a main lobe width of two the closest api rp 11s8 frequency orders are 0 48x and 0 5x and its respective minimum difference is 0 02 from equations 1 and 2 an estimate of a 10 second minimum time interval was obtained with the minimum time interval t m i n determined the accelerometer signals were processed according to the schematic diagram shown in fig 3 to obtain their frequency spectra in the data processing first the signals are converted from volt units v to acceleration units m s2 according to the individual calibrated sensitivity of each accelerometer as shown in table 2 and then converted from the metric system to the imperial system which is the system used by the api rp 11s8 the direct current dc voltage level was removed by subtracting the mean of each signal the trapezoidal integration was used to convert acceleration units to velocity units in s as the industry recommended practice uses velocity units to evaluate the vibration a butterworth iir high pass filter of order two with a cut off of 10 hz was applied pre and post integration to eliminate low frequency anomalies common to the integration process the truncation required to convert the signal into a finite length causes a leakage effect which leads to an amplitude error in the frequency spectrum the signals were processed with the hanning window to reduce the leakage effect the hanning window balances noise injection and reduced amplitude inaccuracy the hanning window has a main lobe of two frequency increments which was used to calculate the minimum time window above the coefficients of a hanning window are 3 w n 0 5 1 cos 2 π n n 0 n n 1 where n is the length of the window and n is the index of each coefficient the hanning windowed signal was then the multiplication of the samples x n of sampled signal x with the coefficients of the hanning window 4 x w n w n x n for the spectral content of the signals the dft was calculated for each signal by 5 x k 1 n n 0 n 1 x w n e i 2 π k n n 0 k n 1 where x w n are samples of a hanning windowed signal with n samples and x k are the dft bins of x n where k are indexes of the dft bins and i is the imaginary number the discrete frequencies in the dft are 6 f k k δ f the computation of dft is efficiently carried out by an fast fourier transform fft algorithm oppenheim 1999 in computing the frequency spectrum the single sided spectrum is adopted as is shown in the following formula 7 x s s k 2 x k 0 k n 2 1 the windowing process removes energy from the signal proportional to the sum of the window function coefficients used and to compensate for this is necessary to use a w as a scalar amplitude correction factor brandt 2011 8 a w n n o n 1 w n which for the hanning window is precisely two then the final spectrum is 9 x w k a w x s s k for the peak amplitude extraction of the api rp 11s8 frequency orders the algorithm first identifies the synchronous frequency by looking for the highest peak amplitude in a 10 range around the equipment s operating speed with the range accounting for motor frequency slip with the synchronous frequency the peaks of the api rp 11s8 orders are identified by searching for the highest peak amplitude within a range determined by twice the frequency increment around the synchronous frequency multiplied by the values of the api rp 11s8 orders i e 1x 2x 0 42x to 0 48x 2 4 spectrogram the spectrogram is typically obtained by applying a fixed length moving window to the time varying data sequence before computing the spectrum which is the short time fourier transform its time window length is chosen by considering the trade off between the time and frequency resolutions obtainable lee and han 1998 in this study the typical process to generate spectrograms was applied to the raw accelerometer signal using five times the samples of the sampling rate 4267 x 5 as the window size 5 seconds and an overlap of 200 samples between windows 2 5 correlation analysis correlation analysis is a method for measuring the covariance of two random variables in a matched dataset covariance is typically expressed as the correlation coefficient of two variables x and y a correlation coefficient is a unitless number that varies from 1 to 1 the sign of the correlation coefficient shows if the correlation is positive or negative and the magnitude shows the correlation force between x and y de lima et al 2009 a negative coefficient indicates that as one variable increases the other decreases a positive coefficient indicates that as one variable increases the other also increases pearson s linear correlation coefficient one of the most frequently used linear correlation coefficients was used here pearson s linear correlation coefficient p x y is defined as 10 p x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y y 2 where x i and y i are samples of x and y indexed with i x i 1 n x i n and y i 1 n y i n the correlation matrix of two variables is the matrix of correlation coefficients for each pairwise variable combination 11 r p x x p x y p y x p y y since x and y are always directly correlated to themselves the diagonal entries resolve to one 12 r 1 p x y p y x 1 in this study a correlation matrix was created using the seven sample values of variables from the experiments with seven different operating points but at the same speed of 3600 rpm the variables used in the matrix are well intake fluid temperature well discharge fluid temperature intake discharge temperature difference z axis accelerometer 1x order peak vibration amplitude at the top of the pump and well fluid flow discharge 3 results and discussion in section 3 1 the amplitude accuracy of the frequency spectrum estimation method is compared to the typical method applied to the quasi stationary vibration signals acquired in the experiments in section 3 2 the vibration of the pumps is analyzed using the industry standard process which leads to various possible diagnostics sections 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 present the search for vibration patterns beyond the typical esp vibration analysis to provide a non invasive fault differential diagnosis in section 3 3 the vibration behavior at different accelerometer positions and in the tests with different fluids is analyzed in section 3 4 the vibration behavior in tests at different speeds is analyzed finally in section 3 5 the vibration behavior in tests of different operating points is analyzed 3 1 the frequency spectrum of the time domain vibration signals time domain signal stationarity is essential to the accuracy of frequency spectrum estimation so spectrograms were used to evaluate the behavior of signal components in time before performing the main analyses fig 4 shows spectrograms of 160 second signals from the z axis accelerometer on top of pumps 1 and 2 operating with fluid 1 at 3600 rpm in the bep the highest magnitude is in yellow and shows the synchronous frequency vibration of the 160 second accelerometer signal the synchronous frequency of pump 1 varied from 56 45 hz to 56 35 hz and that of pump 2 varied from 56 75 hz to 56 65 hz the slight frequency variation observed shown in fig 4a and b is probably due to fluid temperature and viscosity variation during the data collection this change in frequency may be relatively small but it reduces the amplitude accuracy of a high resolution frequency spectrum which may impair a vibration analysis based on peak limits as shown in section 2 3 equation 1 and equation 2 were used to obtain an estimate of a 10 second minimum time interval to identify api rp 11s8 frequency orders and to minimize frequency variation over time fig 5 shows the frequency spectra obtained from a 160 second time signal and a 10 second time signal from the z axis accelerometer fixed on top of pumps 1 and 2 operating with fluid 1 at 3600 rpm at the bep the figure shows that api rp 11s8 synchronous operating frequency x orders were correctly identified by the described method of frequency spectra estimation and amplitude extraction using both time window intervals fig 5a is the frequency spectrum of the 160 second time signal from pump 1 the 1x amplitude peak of which was 0 05 in s the corresponding peak in the 10 second time signal was 0 08 in s figs 5c 60 higher in the frequency spectra from pump 2 the 160 second time signal 1x peak was 0 140 in s fig 5b which was below the api rp 11s8 limit but when using the 10 second time window the evaluated 1x peak amplitude was 0 313 in s figs 5d 120 higher this reveals that the vibration in this pump was above the api rp 11s8 limit the other api rp 11s8 frequency orders showed similar differences in amplitude using the shorter time signal the results show that the minimum time signal interval presents a greater amplitude accuracy thus this was the time signal interval chosen for vibration analysis in all experiments 3 2 api rp 11s8 vibration diagnosis of the pumps table 6 shows the vibration peaks of each api rp 11s8 synchronous frequency order during the two pump experiments at 3600 rpm at the bep with fluid 1 pump 1 did not show amplitudes above the vibration limits in any accelerometer the highest vibration was 0 101 in s which was detected by the z axis accelerometer at the middle of the pump in the 1x order pump 2 presented several 1x order peaks above the vibration limit shown in bold in table 6 especially at the pump top pump with a maximum of 0 313 in s this 1x order vibration is associated with the following causes according to api rp 11s8 1 mass unbalance hydraulic unbalance or a decentralized rotor 2 a bent shaft 3 a misaligned coupling or shaft bearing or both the api rp 11s8 analysis method indicates these three possible diagnostics which may not necessarily occur simultaneously each may involve faults in several internal pump components which need to be individually inspected for a more precise fault diagnostic however the three diagnostic hypotheses may be further differentiated by analyzing the relationships between the synchronous frequency order amplitudes usually the bent shaft and misalignment diagnostics produce similar high vibrations in the 2x order also and a high level of axial vibration adams 2010 betta et al 2002 patel and darpe 2009 scheffer and girdhar 2004 in the case of the experiments performed the axial vibration was not acquired but as observed in table 6 the pump 2 2x amplitude peak was much smaller than the 1x amplitude peak although there is a higher possibility of an unbalance fault diagnosis the 2x amplitude higher peak at the base of pump 2 and the 1x amplitude higher peak at the top suggest different diagnoses that is why a better method is needed to differentiate other vibration behavior characteristics as described below 3 3 vibration at components and fluid change fig 6 and fig 7 show the frequency spectra of the accelerometer signals from the esp system s main equipment motor seal and pump collected at 3600 rpm at the bep fig 6a and b are spectra from signals collected during the pump 1 experiments operating with fluid 1 and fig 6c and d are from experiments with fluid 2 fig 7a and b are spectra from signals collected during the pump 2 experiments operating with fluid 1 and fig 7c and d are from experiments with fluid 2 these figures show the vibration peak distribution of all esp components to allow evaluation of the vibration distribution between components and the influence of the fluid in the pump 1 experiments with fluid 1 the highest peak was 0 135 in s from the 1x order of the accelerometer 11 signal fig 6a which was collected from the seal top at z axis the second highest peak was 0 097 in s from the 1x order on the y axis at the same location fig 6b these two peaks were below the vibration limit however given that the vibration amplitude of neighboring locations exhibited a decreasing behavior the high peaks at the top of the seal suggest a possible problem in the coupling between the pump and the seal at the seal top location the 2x order peak was 0 040 in s which is about a third of the 1x order peak at the same location this proportion suggests a bent shaft or angular misalignment faults in the coupling between the pump and the seal adams 2010 patel and darpe 2009 however the vibration amplitude is below the api rp 11s8 vibration limit the highest peak 1x order of esp for pump 1 operating with fluid 2 was 0 155 in s registered by accelerometer 11 fig 6c located on the seal at the top z axis and the second highest 1x order peak was 0 152 in s registered on the y axis at the same location fig 6d the overall vibration distribution was similar to the experiment with fluid 1 except it showed a 14 higher vibration on the seal top z axis which may indicate that the higher viscosity of fluid 2 increased the vibration in the experiment with pump 2 and fluid 1 the 1x order highest peak was 0 326 in s registered by accelerometer 11 fig 7a which was located on the seal top z axis this reinforces the indication observed in the pump 1 tests using the same seal that there may be a problem in the coupling between the pump and the seal the second highest peak of the 1x order was 0 313 in s registered by accelerometer 17 which was located on the pump top z axis fig 7a given that this vibration peak was far from the seal its cause is in the pump itself the highest 1x order peak during the experiment using pump 2 and fluid 2 was 0 187 in s registered by accelerometer 11 fig 7c which was located on the seal top z axis the second highest 1x order peak was 0 186 in s registered by accelerometer 17 which was located on the pump top z axis fig 7c the overall vibration distribution was similar to the experiment with fluid 1 but with a 41 lower vibration which may indicate that the higher fluid 2 viscosity reduced the vibration cause the overall vibration amplitudes at the motor and seal components measured by accelerometers 1 12 were different between tests using pump 1 and pump 2 although the components were the same in both assemblies the motor and seal vibrations were higher when operating with pump 2 than with pump 1 which may indicate that these vibration results are primarily a consequence of the pump s operational condition comparing the results using the less viscous fluid fluid 1 with the results using the more viscous fluid fluid 2 on average there was an increase in the pump 1 peaks on the other way operation with a more viscous fluid caused a reduction in the vibration peaks of pump 2 the results suggest that in the good condition pump 1 an increase in fluid viscosity amplified the vibration perhaps causing some unbalance due to greater torsional deformation in the esp shafts on the other hand a more viscous fluid may have attenuated the excessive vibration in the faulty pump perhaps acting as a damper of its fault 3 4 speed variation behavior fig 8 a and fig 8b show the 1x order vibration peak amplitude and its respective frequency on the pump top z axis accelerometer in the pump 1 and pump 2 experiments operating at five different rotational speeds at the bep with fluids 1 and 2 an amplified vibration amplitude response was observed in the esp between 45 hz and 50 hz with pump 1 using both fluids fig 8a which indicates a resonance condition in pump 1 resonance conditions with esp systems have previously been identified within the manufacturer s operating speed range minette et al 2016 also an amplified vibration amplitude response in the esp was observed between 50 hz and 55 hz with pump 2 but only with fluid 2 fig 8b a possible resonance condition in pump 2 influenced by the properties of fluid 2 needs to be further examined although the two pumps were identical models they were in different states of wear the wear state can affect the frequency response of the system which explains the different resonance condition possibilities the vibration amplitude of pump 2 at the highest synchronous frequency with both fluids was not associated with a resonance condition and was above the industry s recommendation of 0 156 in s fig 8b the vibration amplitude of pump 1 showed a general tendency to increase in proportion to the increase in the synchronous frequency the vibration amplitude of pump 2 also showed a general tendency to increase in proportion to the increase in the synchronous frequency but above the vibration amplitudes of pump 1 one of the most common problems that causes vibration is unbalance as described in adams 2010 randall 2016 and scheffer and girdhar 2004 the unbalance vibration amplitude varies proportionally to the square of the rotating speed giving the unbalanced mass centrifugal force f m ω 2 r where m is the unbalanced mass ω is the angular velocity and r is the distance from the unbalanced mass to the center of rotation is proportional to the square of the rotating speed some degree of unbalance is expected in rotating machines due to material and manufacturing imperfections however when the vibration is beyond a limit the unbalance becomes a problem with the pump 2 vibration peak amplitude above the recommended limit in the 1x order the industry recommended practice indicates unbalance bent shaft or misalignment as probable causes either simultaneous or not however given the increase in vibration amplitude associated with the increase in synchronous operating frequency the unbalance vibration diagnosis is more likely 3 5 flow and pressure variation behavior fig 9 a and fig 9b show the vibration peak amplitudes of 1x order at the pump top z axis accelerometer on pumps 1 and 2 during seven operating points tests at the 3600 rpm speed 60 hz pumping fluids 1 and 2 fig 9a shows that varying the operating point had little influence on the vibration amplitude at pump 1 regardless of the fluid used in contrast fig 9b shows considerable variation in the vibration amplitude with pump 2 and the variation curve seems to be without tendency as the shapes of the diffusers and impellers in pump 2 may have been modified due to wear with fluid dynamic consequences it is not possible to associate a specific physical phenomenon to the great vibration peak variation shown in fig 9b the variation does not seem related only to the changes in the operating point and the curve is similar using fluids 1 and 2 correlation matrices were generated as described in section 2 5 to investigate possible additional effects influencing the pump 2 amplitudes at several operating points fig 10 shows correlations between pairs of variables measured during pump 2 experiments operating at 3600 rpm the well intake fluid temperature tin the well discharge fluid temperature tdis the intake discharge temperature difference tdif the z axis accelerometer 1x order peak vibration amplitude at the pump top 1x peak and the well fluid flow discharge qdis fig 10 also shows the histograms of the variables the matrix diagonal and scatter plots of the variable pairs the slopes of the least squares reference lines in the scatter plots are equal to the correlation coefficients in the fig 10 the 0 17 correlation value between the well intake temperature tin and the 1x order peak amplitude indicates that there was no significant influence between the intake temperature variation and the pump vibration s peak amplitude the 0 85 correlation value between the well intake temperature and its discharge temperature tdis is high and was expected because well intake temperatures influence the discharge temperatures the 0 36 correlation value between the well discharge temperature and the 1x order peak amplitude indicates that the well discharge temperature had a more significant influence on the 1x order peak amplitude than the intake temperature the 0 95 correlation value between the intake discharge temperature difference tdif and the 1x order vibration peak amplitude is higher than any other correlation this may indicate that the vibration amplitude variation when the operating point was varied is more related to the fluid temperature difference between the pump intake and discharge than other variables neither the intake temperature nor the discharge temperature alone showed such a high correlation with vibration fig 11 a and fig 11b show the z axis accelerometer 1x order vibration peak amplitudes at the top of pumps 1 and 2 together with the oil well s intake and discharge fluid temperature difference by operating point at 3600 rpm fig 11a shows that the 1x order vibration amplitude of pump 1 did not vary while there was substantial fluid temperature difference variation fig 11b shows that the 1x order vibration amplitude of pump 2 was significantly correlated to the fluid temperature difference fig 12 a and fig 12b show the same relationships in the fluid 2 experiments the increased intake discharge temperature difference in the faulty pump tests was expected because an additional part of the energy given to the fluid is transformed into heat due to the reduced efficiency of used pumps it is well known that fluid temperature may significantly influence viscosity and may also affect the stiffness of pump components however both may not affect vibration in the same way since pump 1 does not present vibration above the industry standard limit and does not present much amplitude variation under fluid temperature difference variation while pump 2 shows this characteristic may be seen as another fault symptom in pump 2 and that fault appears to be strongly influenced by the temperature difference between the intake and discharge the temperature difference in the pump extremes can cause a difference in fluid density sufficient to create an axial unbalance but to this axial unbalance affect pump 2 only his shaft could be with reduced stiffness this characteristic may reinforce the diagnostic hypothesis that this pump has unbalance and the hypothesis that it has reduced stiffness in the shaft this high correlation between temperature difference and 1x order vibration peak amplitude may also be used as complementary information to help in the differential diagnosis of vibration faults 4 conclusions in this paper an experimental investigation of the vibration behavior of two esps in different wear states under different operating conditions was presented the experiments followed industry recommendations using an artificial lift test oil well and viscous fluids to reflect field operational conditions the pumps were tested with two different viscous fluids seven different operating points flow versus pressure and five different speeds to evaluate their vibration behavior a frequency spectrum estimation method was described focusing on extracting the vibration amplitude from frequency components used in api rp 11s8 analysis and minimizing the amplitude loss in signals with frequency variation the experimental results indicated that the synchronous frequency varied during the experiments and the api rp 11s8 frequency components were effectively identified by the frequency estimation method with more accurate peak amplitudes than those obtained using a typical method the results of the industry recommended vibration analysis indicated that a faulty pump exceeded the vibration limit by more than double at the synchronous frequency 1x according to the recommended practice three possible faults not necessarily co occurring may be suggested mass unbalance bent shaft and misalignment the api rp 11s8 vibration analysis does not indicate a non invasive method for diagnostic differentiation regardless of the standard industrial analysis the relationship of peak vibrations between orders of the synchronous frequency indicated a greater likelihood of unbalance the vibration behavior analysis with fluid change indicated that the fluid s viscosity had a more significant influence in the pump that showed higher vibration decreasing the amplitude the pump that was in good condition with low vibration showed slightly vibration amplitude increase with the more viscous fluid but remained far from the vibration limit the high vibration pump showed less vibration amplitude when operating with the more viscous fluid but remained above the vibration limit which may indicate that the viscosity acted as a damper to the vibration cause the vibration behavior analysis at different operating points showed no significant amplitude variation in the pump that was in good condition and high amplitude variation in the faulty pump exploratory analysis using a correlation matrix indicated that the vibration amplitude in the faulty pump was highly correlated to the fluid temperature difference between the well s intake and discharge while the discharge temperature and intake temperature alone showed lower correlations with the vibration amplitude although the increased intake discharge temperature difference in the pump tests was expected because an additional part of the energy given to the fluid is transformed into heat due to the reduced efficiency of used pumps the high correlation between temperature difference and 1x order vibration peak amplitude can be applied as complementary information during vibration diagnosis the vibration behavior analysis of different speeds demonstrated that the faulty pump presented a vibration amplitude increase approximately proportional to the square of the speed which is correlated to an unbalance fault this characteristic may also be used for esp differential diagnosis from the other api rp 11s8 fault options involving similar spectra such as misalignment or a bent shaft in future research it is planned to use more accelerometers including axial accelerometers to manipulate fluid temperature and to cause controlled faults in the pumps credit authorship contribution statement
