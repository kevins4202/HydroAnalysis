17305,home water purification systems hwpss are utilized worldwide to obtain clean drinking water however the reliability of hwpss in providing safe water is unknown or not well proven in this study the occurrences of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in tap water effluents and filters of hwpss were investigated in twenty six houses and one laboratory the levels of antibiotics and args were between less than the limit of detection lod and 7 9 ng l and between less than lod and 3 45 105 copies l respectively in tap water hwpss with fresh filters had a high efficiency in removing antibiotics and args with removal rates of 91 92 and 0 46 2 43 log respectively however after long term operation e g more than three months some hwpss had low removal rates of antibiotics and args 3 79 and 0 03 0 15 log respectively and some hwpss released antibiotics and args into the effluents leading to higher levels of antibiotics and args in the effluents than those in the influents biofilms were observed on many filters of the investigated hwpss args were detected on the filters with relative abundances the ratio of the abundance of args to the abundance of 16s rrna of 2 56 10 8 2 89 10 2 high throughput sequencing analysis showed that proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla and alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant classes the abundances of cyanobacteria patescibacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were significantly positively correlated with the abundances of args microbial growth and enrichment commonly observed in hwpss can accelerate the exposure risk posed by antibiotics and args to the consumers of water from these appliances graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes antibiotics home water purification systems biofilm drinking water 1 introduction extensive use of antibiotics results in a considerable quantity of them and or their metabolites entering water environment cacace et al 2019 luo et al 2011 ying et al 2017 antibiotic contamination can promote the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args which can allow pathogens to resist antibiotics and thus prevent disinfection bengtsson palme et al 2017 recently the occurrence of antibiotics and args in drinking water sources drinking water treatment plants dwtps and distribution systems has attracted serious concern dias et al 2020 fernando et al 2016 hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the concentrations of antibiotics were 13 9 76 6 ng l and 20 6 188 1 ng l in drinking water sources of five urban regions and four townships respectively feng et al 2020 in some river waters the total concentrations of antibiotics were up to several thousand ng l azanu et al 2018 böger et al 2021 sun et al 2020 reported that the total concentrations of seventeen antibiotics were 8 6 47 6 and 3 4 29 7 ng l at the inlets and outlets of reservoirs nine species of antibiotics were detected in tap waters with concentrations of 0 1 4 6 ng l huang et al 2019 args have been widely detected in tap waters and drinking water distribution systems one hundred and eighty one arg subtypes belonging to 16 arg types were detected in the tap waters of twenty five cities worldwide with an abundance ranging from 2 8 10 2 to 4 2 10 1 copies of arg per cell ma et al 2017 four dominant classes of args tetracycline macrolide β lactam and fluoroquinolone were detected at an abundance of approximately 104 copies l in some tap waters in brazil dias et al 2020 su et al 2018 found that the levels of args in source waters effluents of dwtps and tap waters were 1 83 109 3 51 109 1 18 107 1 89 108 and 1 48 109 2 27 109 copies l respectively in another study enrichment of args was 6 4 109 2 folds higher in tap waters in comparison with treated waters from dwtps xu et al 2016 this indicates that although args can be removed in dwtps they proliferate in subsequent water distribution systems the proliferation of args in water distribution systems is mainly caused by biofilms which are locations for microbial reproduction and spread biofilms on activated carbon ac filtration systems in dwtps were found to increase the abundance of args from 76 to 150 copies l xu et al 2016 and from 1 15 to 1 82 105 copies l su et al 2018 thus the presence of biofilms presents a great challenge in the control of arg pollution in tap waters to obtain clean water a terminal treatment facility for tap water i e a home water purification system hwps or called a point of use facility was widely applied hwpss often have good performance in terms of reduction of turbidity hardness heavy metals or bacteria depending on the treatment units used korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 shirasaki et al 2017 in a one year study a public water purification system which was sequentially composed of two ac cartridges and a boiler removed 40 60 of trihalomethanes 57 5 83 6 of haloacetic acids and 100 of haloacetaldehydes from drinking water wang et al 2019 however the controlling effect of hwpss on antibiotics and args has not been reported so far generally hwpss are sequentially composed of a series of ac cartridges membrane treatment units e g ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro and sterilization units ac cartridges and membrane treatment units are ideal places for biofilm growth elevated microbial contaminant levels occur in water purification systems after their long term use lin et al 2020 the biofilms in hwpss are likely locations for the enrichment of antibiotics via adsorption and args via bacterial growth and reproduction and they pose a serious health risk in houses or public places however the effect of hwpss on the accumulation of antibiotics and args remains unknown therefore it is crucial to investigate the fate of antibiotics and args in hwpss this study investigates the levels of antibiotics and args before and after use of hwpss in local houses and a laboratory the microbial community present in the biofilms of hwpss were also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials azithromycin 97 0

discussion 3 1 performance of hwpss in the investigated houses the tap water in houses in tianjin is transported from the yangtze river in southern china through a south to north water diversion project the tap water from the investigated houses are produced from different dwtps with similar treatment processes coagulation flocculation filtration and disinfection the age of building floor number household size operating time and configuration of the twenty six investigated hwpss are listed in table 1 the investigated families who live in or near the downtown of tianjin volunteered to participate in this survey all the families have a stable middle income the prices of the studied hwpss varied from 100 to 4000 usd as people travelled to work no or only a few family members were at home during daytime in most of the investigated houses and most hwpss were used only while cooking in the morning and evening except in j3 u n4 r n5 r and j7 r where the hwpss were only used in the evening the effluents from hwpss were used for cooking and drinking directly or after being boiled in j1 r j5 r j6 r j7 r n2 u n10 r and x1 r the effluent was also used for washing and bathing only the hwps from x1 r had an alarm to indicate the need for replacing the filter when the output of treated water exceeded 1000 l the treatment of a low quantity of water using hwpss on a daily basis with long term operation e g greater than three months without updating filters is common the disinfection process in the dwtps are chlorination naclo and subsequent chloramination thus the chlorine residual in tap waters is mainly in the form of combined chlorine as shown in table 1 the total chlorine residual of the tap waters mainly combined chlorine was in the range of 0 02 1 60 mg l as cl2 and trace levels of free chlorine around the lod of 0 02 mg l most of the hwpss removed 66 100 of total chlorine residual from the tap waters except j1 r which did not remove total chlorine residual at all the levels of toc in the tap waters were 3 46 7 74 mg c l except at n1 u where it was 1 76 mg c l the variations in toc in the tap waters is due to the different treatment efficiencies of the dwtps and the conditions of the distribution pipes the removal rates of toc varied in different houses the average removal rate of toc was 31 0 3 n1 u had a relatively high removal rate of 90 j4 c j8 r and n4 r increased the levels of toc in the effluents there were six residents in j4 c and j8 r and thus the quantity of water treated by the hwpss should be relatively higher than that in the other houses in n4 r the pipes in the building were used for about 16 years the values of suva254 which is calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by the toc concentration and indicates the content of aromatic structures present in dissolved organic matter in the influents and effluents of the hwpss were 0 18 0 99 and 0 02 7 22 l mg m respectively the removal rates of suva254 in most of the hwpss were 13 96 except at j1 r n1 u n2 u and n6 u where suva254 in the effluents increased by 0 17 6 47 fold spearman correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between building age floor number household size operating time toc levels and suva254 values the levels of toc did not correlate with any of these factors p 0 05 the values of suva254 showed a significantly positive correlation with building age r 0 526 p 0 05 and household size r 0 396 p 0 05 3 2 fate of antibiotics in hwpss of the investigated houses twelve antibiotics were detected in the influents and effluents of hwpss fig 1 the total levels of sulfonamides sulfamerazine sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole quinolones norfloxacin ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin tetracyclines tetracycline oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline and macrolides azithromycin erythromycin and roxithromycin in the tap waters were 2 4 7 4 3 9 5 9 1 7 7 7 and 4 5 26 4 ng l respectively the detection frequencies of sulfonamides quinolones tetracyclines and macrolides were 65 85 23 62 19 50 and 62 92 respectively roxithromycin had a high detection frequency of 92 and a relatively high concentration of 0 1 7 9 ng l average 1 1 0 1 ng l roxithromycin was also frequently detected in source waters and urban water supply systems with concentrations of 1 4 27 2 ng l bu et al 2013 luo et al 2011 sun et al 2020 an average concentration of 0 8 ng l was reported in tap waters huang et al 2019 in europe and canada clarithromycin was the most abundant macrolide göbel et al 2005 miao et al 2004 the total levels of sulfonamides quinolones tetracyclines and macrolides in the effluents of hwpss were 1 8 13 2 3 3 4 4 0 9 5 2 and 5 2 18 6 ng l respectively roxithromycin had the highest levels in the effluents in the range of 0 1 1 8 ng l average 0 80 0 1 ng l followed by sulfamethoxazole 0 1 2 7 ng l average 0 6 0 1 ng l hwpss had the highest removal efficiency for tetracycline removal rates were 78 100 average 95 3 followed by chlortetracycline removal rates were 35 100 average 84 1 the levels of sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin in the effluents of hwpss increased on average by 0 73 and 0 66 fold respectively the removal efficiencies of different hwpss varied widely the hwps of j3 u where only one person lives and uses the hwps only in the evening for drinking and sporadically for cooking had a high removal efficiency of total antibiotics an average removal rate of 86 2 notably although this hwps was used without changing filters for 12 months the total quantity of water treated by it was low and the filters were relatively fresh j7 r had the lowest removal rate of antibiotics average removal rate of 3 0 0 2 the total antibiotic levels in the effluents of j5 r j6 r j8 r d1 c and n9 u significantly increased by 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 97 and 0 52 folds respectively as previously mentioned there were six residents in j8 r and thus the production of treated water by the hwps was high the hwps of n9 u was used the most frequently three times a day and the filters were not replaced for three years long term or relatively high production of treated water could be related to the increase in antibiotics another interesting phenomenon was that hwpss with an ro unit did not show a higher performance in term of removing antibiotics the average removal rates of hwpss with ro for toc antibiotics and args were 28 0 11 and 0 36 log respectively whereas the average removal rates of hwpss with uf as the major purification unit were 41 52 and 0 35 log respectively this is probably because of the low performance of ro in blocking low molecular weight pollutants such as antibiotics or the poor quality of ro available in the market 3 3 fate of args in hwpss of the investigated houses as shown in fig 2 eight args were detected in the influents tap waters and effluents of hwpss including sulfonamide args sul1 and sul2 quinolone args qnrs and qnrd tetracycline args tetc and tetg and macrolide args erma and ermb the detection frequencies of these eight args ranged from 92 to 100 the abundances of sulfonamide args 1 00 105 5 10 105 copies l were higher than those of the other args one of the sulfonamide args sul1 was the most abundant at 1 38 101 3 45 105 copies l average 1 96 104 copies l followed by qnrd average 1 09 104 copies l sulfonamide args are prevalent in treated waters from dwtps liu et al 2018 the sulfonamide args sul1 and sul2 have also been widely detected in bacteria from tap water with abundances of 3 98 105 and 6 31 104 copies l respectively hao et al 2019 in another study chloramphenicol sulfonamide and macrolide args were detected in tap water and chloramphenicol args were the dominant species approximately 107 108 copies l su et al 2018 the total abundances of args in the effluents of hwpss were 2 21 105 9 67 105 copies l the macrolide arg erma between lod and 5 73 105 copies l detection frequency 88 and qnrd between lod and 5 06 105 copies l detection frequency 62 were predominant in the effluents some of the investigated hwpss showed the log removal rates of total args of 0 24 2 91 log however after hwpss of n4 r n5 r n8 r and x2 r in which the filters were not replaced for 8 12 months the abundances of eight args increased by 0 44 2 81 log 0 16 3 08 log 2 28 3 53 log and 2 64 3 38 log respectively the four hwpss were significantly enriched in args of macrolide tetracycline quinolone and sulfonamide by 0 36 0 96 log 0 46 0 81 log 0 33 0 76 log and 0 09 0 20 log respectively 3 4 variation of antibiotics and args in the laboratory hwps the laboratory hwps was operated for six months water samples were collected after one week three months and six months the removal rates of total chlorine residual slightly decreased with time from 85 to 69 fig s3a c in the supplementary file simultaneously the removal rates of toc significantly decreased from 60 at one week to 20 31 at six months fig s3 d f azithromycin erythromycin and roxithromycin were chosen for measurement because of their relatively high detection frequencies and levels in local tap waters as shown in fig 3 a c the concentrations of the three macrolides in the tap waters were 0 3 1 2 ng l 0 1 0 4 ng l and lod 1 0 ng l after one week three months and six months respectively after one week of operation the total removal rates of the three antibiotics were 91 92 fig 3d pp and gac were the dominant purification filters contributing 29 64 and 9 60 of the total removal of the antibiotics respectively cac uf and pgac contributed 4 8 1 22 and 2 14 to the total removal of antibiotics respectively after three months the total removal rates of the antibiotics decreased to 64 74 fig 3e pp was still the highest contributor to the removal of antibiotics accounting for 44 85 whereas cac and gac contributed 6 66 and 7 8 respectively the reduction of antibiotics through uf and pgac was not significant which was possibly because the concentrations of antibiotics were too low to be accurately detected in the two units after six months fig 3f the levels of azithromycin and erythromycin in the effluent was close to those in the influent the level of roxithromycin even increased by 75 in the effluent in comparison to that in tap water this indicates that roxithromycin was enriched in the filters after six months and the filters subsequently released roxithromycin to water 16s rrna int1 and macrolide args erma and ermb sulfonamide args sul1 and sul2 tetracycline args tetc and tetg and quinolone args qnrd and qnrs were detected in the influents and effluents fig 4 the abundances of total args 16s rrna and int1 in the influents were 3 23 102 4 19 104 1 07 105 4 75 106 and 4 24 4 23 102 copies l respectively the arg sul1 had the highest abundance of 2 54 102 3 58 104 copies l among all eight args tetc was under the lod in the influent and effluent after one week of operation after one week the removal rates of total args 16s rrna and int1 were 0 75 log 0 43 log and 1 22 log respectively the abundances of erma tetg qnrs and qnrd were lod in the effluent of the laboratory hwps pp gac cac uf and pgac removed args with removal rates of 0 07 0 47 log 0 01 1 37 log 0 03 0 20 log 0 07 1 63 log and 0 04 1 75 log respectively of the five filters gac had the highest removal rate of 0 33 log for total args followed by pgac 0 19 log and pp 0 10 log after three months of operation the abundances of 16s rrna int1 and most args except sul2 in the effluent were generally higher than those in the influent the log increase rates of args averaged 0 18 log the abundances of 16s rrna and int1 increased by 0 36 log and 1 11 log the abundances of erma ermb qnrs and int1 in the effluent of pp were 0 02 0 79 log higher than those in tap water uf increased the abundance of total args by 0 28 log followed by cac 0 21 log and gac 0 20 log pp and pgac decreased the abundance of total args by 0 26 and 0 24 log respectively after six months of operation the abundances of total args 16s rrna and int1 in the effluent increased by 1 68 1 53 and 0 97 log respectively the abundances of erma sul2 tetc tetg qnrs and qnrd were lower than the lod in the tap water but were detected in the effluent after pp the abundances of total args 16s rrna and int1 increased by 0 77 log 0 74 log and 0 90 log respectively cac increased the abundances of total args 16s rrna and int1 by 1 97 log 1 27 log and 0 91 log respectively gac uf and pgac removed total args by 0 63 log 0 23 log and 0 11 log respectively the increase in args caused by the laboratory hwps after a long term operation three and six months agreed with the results of hwpss of the investigated houses n4 r n5 r n8 r and x2 r long term operation can result in the growth of biofilm which serves as an ideal place for the proliferation of microorganism and thereby arg proliferation in the filters 3 5 args in biofilms of hwpss five filters from the laboratory hwps and eleven filters including three pp three gac one cac two uf and two pgac from hwpss of the investigated houses x4 r n6 u n9 u and n10 r were collected biofilm formation was observed on the surface of some filters or cartridges i e cac from x4 r and pp gac cac uf and pgac from the laboratory fig 5 a the protein contents of pp gac cac uf and pgac of the laboratory hwps were 25 36 11 64 25 67 138 89 and 9 66 mg g respectively uf had the highest amount of biomass possibly due to the high blocking efficiency of uf membranes the relative abundances of all eight args were detected in these filters figs 5b and c the relative abundance was calculated by dividing the abundance of args copies l with the abundance of 16s rrna copies l on the five filters of the laboratory hwps tetg had the highest relative abundance of 2 28 10 5 9 84 10 3 followed by sul1 7 38 10 4 2 81 10 3 fig 5b the uf of the laboratory hwps had the highest relative abundance of args 1 34 10 6 2 47 10 3 it has been previously reported that the uf membrane of a hospital dialysis system had a higher abundance of args compared to tap water dias et al 2020 for the hwpss of the investigated houses tetc had the highest relative abundance 6 62 10 6 2 89 10 2 on the collected filters followed by sul1 8 58 10 4 4 73 10 3 fig 5c the gac from n10 r had the highest relative abundance of args 1 99 10 5 2 89 10 2 bacteria with args possibly proliferated on the biofilm and were detached leading to the increase of args in the effluents of hwpss mges e g int1 which have been confirmed to accelerate the proliferation of args via horizontal gene transfer gyles and boerlin 2014 may be another contributor to the increase in arg the relative abundance of int1 in the filters was in the range of 2 56 10 8 1 13 10 5 pearson analysis showed that the abundances of total args erma ermb sul1 sul2 tetc tetg and qnrd all had significantly positive correlations with the abundance of int1 r 0 918 0 963 p 0 05 table s4 in the supplementary file this indicates that args could have a high transfer capacity among the same or different species of bacteria in the biofilms of hwpss wang et al 2020 3 6 bacterial community on biofilms bacterial community on the biofilm samples from the hwpss of the laboratory and houses x4 r n6 u n9 u and n10 r were analyzed a total of 1098 otus were detected in the biofilm samples from the laboratory the diversity indices of the biofilm on pp gac cac uf and pgac of the laboratory hwps were 3 373 3 943 4 287 3 027 and 3 320 shannon index respectively and 0 082 0 046 0 032 0 125 and 0 130 simpson index respectively this indicates that the microbial diversity of the biofilm on cac was the highest the biofilm from the five filters of the laboratory hwps shared 152 otus fig 6 a as shown in fig 6b triplicate samples from one biofilm sample were marked with the same name and symbols the symbols of the triplicate samples were relatively clustered together suggesting that microbial communities in the triplicate samples were very similar weighted fast unique fraction metric principal coordinates analysis unifrac pcoa showed that the microbial communities on the laboratory filters could be classified into group i pp group ii gac cac and pgac and group iii uf fig 6b bacterial communities of biofilms from the hwpss of different houses x4 r n6 u n9 u and n10 r were highly diverse the bacterial community on the biofilm samples had a total of 2759 otus and only shared 91 otus fig 6c weighted fast unifrac pcoa analysis fig 6d also showed that the bacterial communities on the biofilm samples from the hwpss of different houses were very different from each other based on the taxonomic classification information of otus of all samples 31 phyla were identified proteobacteria 36 90 acidobacteria 1 16 chloroflexi 3 11 and bacteroidetes 1 19 were the dominant phyla fig 7 a the abundance of proteobacteria on the ufs from the laboratory and houses was 70 79 average 74 which was higher than on the other filters the cacs from the laboratory and houses had a relatively high abundance of acidobacteria 7 16 at the class level fig 7b alphaproteobacteria 22 77 and gammaproteobacteria 2 33 were predominant on the biofilm the abundance of alphaproteobacteria on the ufs from the laboratory and houses 55 76 was higher than that on pp gac cac and pgac proteobacteria was often detected as a dominant group of bacteria in both tap water and biofilm samples of water supply pipes or network accounting for 62 88 zhang et al 2019 and 40 97 sun et al 2014 wolf baca and piekarska 2020 of all phyla detected respectively alphaproteobacteria was the predominant proteobacteria on the biofilm from the pipes of tap water chao et al 2015 in a hospital dialysis unit proteobacteria and acidobacteria were the dominant phyla in tap water and gammaproteobacteria 65 and bradyrhizobium 7 were the dominant class and genus respectively on the uf membrane dias et al 2020 a correlation analysis was conducted between microbial species and args to understand which microbes drive the formation of args wang et al 2020 at the phylum level the abundances of cyanobacteria patescibacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria exhibited significantly positive correlations with arg abundances on the biofilms of hwpss from the laboratory and houses fig 7c suggesting that these phyla probably carry args in addition nitrospirae and actinobacteria were significantly negatively correlated with arg levels but these phyla probably impacted the abundance and diversity of args and mges in the filters wang et al 2020 at the class level fig 7d the abundances of args showed significant positive correlations with melainabacteria belongs to cyanobacteria parcubacteria belongs to patescibacteria and alphaproteobacteria belongs to proteobacteria previous studies have shown that proteobacteria can carry args jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the abundances of proteobacteria gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes exhibited significantly positive correlations with arg abundances at the phylum level in yangtze river wang et al 2020 the abundances of sul1 and ermb significantly correlated with firmicutes and actinobacteria respectively which is consistent with a previous study on three reservoirs in spain huerta et al 2013 the fate of args in drinking water systems are more complicated than that of antibiotics free and intracellular args can be inactivated naturally or by reactions with disinfectants e g chlorine and chloramines jin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however intracellular args can be released from antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and spread between different microbial species through horizontal gene transfer in the presence of low levels of disinfectants gillings and stokes 2012 ramsden et al 2010 it has been reported that the final disinfection e g chlorination step in dwtps enhances the relative abundance of free args in the treated water xu et al 2016 through a one year survey it was found that the amount of arb with resistance to tetracycline sulfamethoxazole clindamycin and norfloxacin increased likely by biofilm detachment in a drinking water distribution system zhang et al 2019 biofilms that inevitably form in distribution pipes and subsequent water purification systems filter material surfaces when water flows through them pose a risk of the proliferation of microorganisms and args 4 conclusions the levels of antibiotics and args were between lod and 7 9 ng l and between lod and 3 45 105 copies l respectively in tap waters hwpss with fresh filters efficiently removed antibiotics and args with removal rates of 91 92 and 0 46 2 43 log respectively low daily water purification requirements combined with long term operations without changing filters was a common problem in most of the hwpss used in houses as a result hwpss had low removal rates of antibiotics and args 3 79 and 0 03 0 15 log respectively and some even increased the levels of antibiotics and args in the effluents args were detected in filters with relative abundances the ratio of the abundance of args to the abundance of 16s rrna of 2 56 10 8 2 89 10 2 biofilms were observed in many hwps filters proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla and alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the predominant classes the abundances of cyanobacteria patescibacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were significantly positively correlated with the abundances of args biofilm serves as an ideal place for the adsorption of antibiotics microbial proliferation and arg proliferation and thus can increase the amount of antibiotics and args in the effluents of hwpss

17305,home water purification systems hwpss are utilized worldwide to obtain clean drinking water however the reliability of hwpss in providing safe water is unknown or not well proven in this study the occurrences of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in tap water effluents and filters of hwpss were investigated in twenty six houses and one laboratory the levels of antibiotics and args were between less than the limit of detection lod and 7 9 ng l and between less than lod and 3 45 105 copies l respectively in tap water hwpss with fresh filters had a high efficiency in removing antibiotics and args with removal rates of 91 92 and 0 46 2 43 log respectively however after long term operation e g more than three months some hwpss had low removal rates of antibiotics and args 3 79 and 0 03 0 15 log respectively and some hwpss released antibiotics and args into the effluents leading to higher levels of antibiotics and args in the effluents than those in the influents biofilms were observed on many filters of the investigated hwpss args were detected on the filters with relative abundances the ratio of the abundance of args to the abundance of 16s rrna of 2 56 10 8 2 89 10 2 high throughput sequencing analysis showed that proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla and alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant classes the abundances of cyanobacteria patescibacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were significantly positively correlated with the abundances of args microbial growth and enrichment commonly

to resist antibiotics and thus prevent disinfection bengtsson palme et al 2017 recently the occurrence of antibiotics and args in drinking water sources drinking water treatment plants dwtps and distribution systems has attracted serious concern dias et al 2020 fernando et al 2016 hou et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the concentrations of antibiotics were 13 9 76 6 ng l and 20 6 188 1 ng l in drinking water sources of five urban regions and four townships respectively feng et al 2020 in some river waters the total concentrations of antibiotics were up to several thousand ng l azanu et al 2018 böger et al 2021 sun et al 2020 reported that the total concentrations of seventeen antibiotics were 8 6 47 6 and 3 4 29 7 ng l at the inlets and outlets of reservoirs nine species of antibiotics were detected in tap waters with concentrations of 0 1 4 6 ng l huang et al 2019 args have been widely detected in tap waters and drinking water distribution systems one hundred and eighty one arg subtypes belonging to 16 arg types were detected in the tap waters of twenty five cities worldwide with an abundance ranging from 2 8 10 2 to 4 2 10 1 copies of arg per cell ma et al 2017 four dominant classes of args tetracycline macrolide β lactam and fluoroquinolone were detected at an abundance of approximately 104 copies l in some tap waters in brazil dias et al 2020 su et al 2018 found that the levels of args in source waters effluents of dwtps and tap waters were 1 83 109 3 51 109 1 18 107 1 89 108 and 1 48 109 2 27 109 copies l respectively in another study enrichment of args was 6 4 109 2 folds higher in tap waters in comparison with treated waters from dwtps xu et al 2016 this indicates that although args can be removed in dwtps they proliferate in subsequent water distribution systems the proliferation of args in water distribution systems is mainly caused by biofilms which are locations for microbial reproduction and spread biofilms on activated carbon ac filtration systems in dwtps were found to increase the abundance of args from 76 to 150 copies l xu et al 2016 and from 1 15 to 1 82 105 copies l su et al 2018 thus the presence of biofilms presents a great challenge in the control of arg pollution in tap waters to obtain clean water a terminal treatment facility for tap water i e a home water purification system hwps or called a point of use facility was widely applied hwpss often have good performance in terms of reduction of turbidity hardness heavy metals or bacteria depending on the treatment units used korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 shirasaki et al 2017 in a one year study a public water purification system which was sequentially composed of two ac cartridges and a boiler removed 40 60 of trihalomethanes 57 5 83 6 of haloacetic acids and 100 of haloacetaldehydes from drinking water wang et al 2019 however the controlling effect of hwpss on antibiotics and args has not been reported so far generally hwpss are sequentially composed of a series of ac cartridges membrane treatment units e g ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro and sterilization units ac cartridges and membrane treatment units are ideal places for biofilm growth elevated microbial contaminant levels occur in water purification systems after their long term use lin et al 2020 the biofilms in hwpss are likely locations for the enrichment of antibiotics via adsorption and args via bacterial growth and reproduction and they pose a serious health risk in houses or public places however the effect of hwpss on the accumulation of antibiotics and args remains unknown therefore it is crucial to investigate the fate of antibiotics and args in hwpss this study investigates the levels of antibiotics and args before and after use of hwpss in local houses and a laboratory the microbial community present in the biofilms of hwpss were also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials azithromycin 97 0

discussion 3 1 performance of hwpss in the investigated houses the tap water in houses in tianjin is transported from the yangtze river in southern china through a south to north water diversion project the tap water from the investigated houses are produced from different dwtps with similar treatment processes coagulation flocculation filtration and disinfection the age of building floor number household size operating time and configuration of the twenty six investigated hwpss are listed in table 1 the investigated families who live in or near the downtown of tianjin volunteered to participate in this survey all the families have a stable middle income the prices of the studied hwpss varied from 100 to 4000 usd as people travelled to work no or only a few family members were at home during daytime in most of the investigated houses and most hwpss were used only while cooking in the morning and evening except in j3 u n4 r n5 r and j7 r where the hwpss were only used in the evening the effluents from hwpss were used for cooking and drinking directly or after being boiled in j1 r j5 r j6 r j7 r n2 u n10 r and x1 r the effluent was also used for washing and bathing only the hwps from x1 r had an alarm to indicate the need for replacing the filter when the output of treated water exceeded 1000 l the treatment of a low quantity of water using hwpss on a daily basis with long term operation e g greater than three months without updating filters is common the disinfection process in the dwtps are chlorination naclo and subsequent chloramination thus the chlorine residual in tap waters is mainly in the form of combined chlorine as shown in table 1 the total chlorine residual of the tap waters mainly combined chlorine was in the range of 0 02 1 60 mg l as cl2 and trace levels of free chlorine around the lod of 0 02 mg l most of the hwpss removed 66 100 of total chlorine residual from the tap waters except j1 r which did not remove total chlorine residual at all the levels of toc in the tap waters were 3 46 7 74 mg c l except at n1 u where it was 1 76 mg c l the variations in toc in the tap waters is due to the different treatment efficiencies of the dwtps and the conditions of the distribution pipes the removal rates of toc varied in different houses the average removal rate of toc was 31 0 3 n1 u had a relatively high removal rate of 90 j4 c j8 r and n4 r increased the levels of toc in the effluents there were six residents in j4 c and j8 r and thus the quantity of water treated by the hwpss should be relatively higher than that in the other houses in n4 r the pipes in the building were used for about 16 years the values of suva254 which is calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by the toc concentration and indicates the content of aromatic structures present in dissolved organic matter in the influents and effluents of the hwpss were 0 18 0 99 and 0 02 7 22 l mg m respectively the removal rates of suva254 in most of the hwpss were 13 96 except at j1 r n1 u n2 u and n6 u where suva254 in the effluents increased by 0 17 6 47 fold spearman correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between building age floor number household size operating time toc levels and suva254 values the levels of toc did not correlate with any of these factors p 0 05 the values of suva254 showed a significantly positive correlation with building age r 0 526 p 0 05 and household size r 0 396 p 0 05 3 2 fate of antibiotics in hwpss of the investigated houses twelve antibiotics were detected in the influents and effluents of hwpss fig 1 the total levels of sulfonamides sulfamerazine sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole quinolones norfloxacin ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin tetracyclines tetracycline oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline and macrolides azithromycin erythromycin and roxithromycin in the tap waters were 2 4 7 4 3 9 5 9 1 7 7 7 and 4 5 26 4 ng l respectively the detection frequencies of sulfonamides quinolones tetracyclines and macrolides were 65 85 23 62 19 50 and 62 92 respectively roxithromycin had a high detection frequency of 92 and a relatively high concentration of 0 1 7 9 ng l average 1 1 0 1 ng l roxithromycin was also frequently detected in source waters and urban water supply systems with concentrations of 1 4 27 2 ng l bu et al 2013 luo et al 2011 sun et al 2020 an average concentration of 0 8 ng l was reported in tap waters huang et al 2019 in europe and canada clarithromycin was the most abundant macrolide göbel et al 2005 miao et al 2004 the total levels of sulfonamides quinolones tetracyclines and macrolides in the effluents of hwpss were 1 8 13 2 3 3 4 4 0 9 5 2 and 5 2 18 6 ng l respectively roxithromycin had the highest levels in the effluents in the range of 0 1 1 8 ng l average 0 80 0 1 ng l followed by sulfamethoxazole 0 1 2 7 ng l average 0 6 0 1 ng l hwpss had the highest removal efficiency for tetracycline removal rates were 78 100 average 95 3 followed by chlortetracycline removal rates were 35 100 average 84 1 the levels of sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin in the effluents of hwpss increased on average by 0 73 and 0 66 fold respectively the removal efficiencies of different hwpss varied widely the hwps of j3 u where only one person lives and uses the hwps only in the evening for drinking and sporadically for cooking had a high removal efficiency of total antibiotics an average removal rate of 86 2 notably although this hwps was used without changing filters for 12 months the total quantity of water treated by it was low and the filters were relatively fresh j7 r had the lowest removal rate of antibiotics average removal rate of 3 0 0 2 the total antibiotic levels in the effluents of j5 r j6 r j8 r d1 c and n9 u significantly increased by 1 4 1 1 1 0 0 97 and 0 52 folds respectively as previously mentioned there were six residents in j8 r and thus the production of treated water by the hwps was high the hwps of n9 u was used the most frequently three times a day and the filters were not replaced for three years long term or relatively high production of treated water could be related to the increase in antibiotics another interesting phenomenon was that hwpss with an ro unit did not show a higher performance in term of removing antibiotics the average removal rates of hwpss with ro for toc antibiotics and args were 28 0 11 and 0 36 log respectively whereas the average removal rates of hwpss with uf as the major purification unit were 41 52 and 0 35 log respectively this is probably because of the low performance of ro in blocking low molecular weight pollutants such as antibiotics or the poor quality of ro available in the market 3 3 fate of args in hwpss of the investigated houses as shown in fig 2 eight args were detected in the influents tap waters and effluents of hwpss including sulfonamide args sul1 and sul2 quinolone args qnrs and qnrd tetracycline args tetc and tetg and macrolide args erma and ermb the detection frequencies of these eight args ranged from 92 to 100 the abundances of sulfonamide args 1 00 105 5 10 105 copies l were higher than those of the other args one of the sulfonamide args sul1 was the most abundant at 1 38 101 3 45 105 copies l average 1 96 104 copies l followed by qnrd average 1 09 104 copies l sulfonamide args are prevalent in treated waters from dwtps liu et al 2018 the sulfonamide args sul1 and sul2 have also been widely detected in bacteria from tap water with abundances of 3 98 105 and 6 31 104 copies l respectively hao et al 2019 in another study chloramphenicol sulfonamide and macrolide args were detected in tap water and chloramphenicol args were the dominant species approximately 107 108 copies l su et al 2018 the total abundances of args in the effluents of hwpss were 2 21 105 9 67 105 copies l the macrolide arg erma between lod and 5 73 105 copies l detection frequency 88 and qnrd between lod and 5 06 105 copies l detection frequency 62 were predominant in the effluents some of the investigated hwpss showed the log removal rates of total args of 0 24 2 91 log however after hwpss of n4 r n5 r n8 r and x2 r in which the filters were not replaced for 8 12 months the abundances of eight args increased by 0 44 2 81 log 0 16 3 08 log 2 28 3 53 log and 2 64 3 38 log respectively the four hwpss were significantly enriched in args of macrolide tetracycline quinolone and sulfonamide by 0 36 0 96 log 0 46 0 81 log 0 33 0 76 log and 0 09 0 20 log respectively 3 4 variation of antibiotics and args in the laboratory hwps the laboratory hwps was operated for six months water samples were collected after one week three months and six months the removal rates of total chlorine residual slightly decreased with time from 85 to 69 fig s3a c in the supplementary file simultaneously the removal rates of toc significantly decreased from 60 at one week to 20 31 at six months fig s3 d f azithromycin erythromycin and roxithromycin were chosen for measurement because of their relatively high detection frequencies and levels in local tap waters as shown in fig 3 a c the concentrations of the three macrolides in the tap waters were 0 3 1 2 ng l 0 1 0 4 ng l and lod 1 0 ng l after one week three months and six months respectively after one week of operation the total removal rates of the three antibiotics were 91 92 fig 3d pp and gac were the dominant purification filters contributing 29 64 and 9 60 of the total removal of the antibiotics respectively cac uf and pgac contributed 4 8 1 22 and 2 14 to the total removal of antibiotics respectively after three months the total removal rates of the antibiotics decreased to 64 74 fig 3e pp was still the highest contributor to the removal of antibiotics accounting for 44 85 whereas cac and gac contributed 6 66 and 7 8 respectively the reduction of antibiotics through uf and pgac was not significant which was possibly because the concentrations of antibiotics were too low to be accurately detected in the two units after six months fig 3f the levels of azithromycin and erythromycin in the effluent was close to those in the influent the level of roxithromycin even increased by 75 in the effluent in comparison to that in tap water this indicates that roxithromycin was enriched in the filters after six months and the filters subsequently released roxithromycin to water 16s rrna int1 and macrolide args erma and ermb sulfonamide args sul1 and sul2 tetracycline args tetc and tetg and quinolone args qnrd and qnrs were detected in the influents and effluents fig 4 the abundances of total args 16s rrna and int1 in the influents were 3 23 102 4 19 104 1 07 105 4 75 106 and 4 24 4 23 102 copies l respectively the arg sul1 had the highest abundance of 2 54 102 3 58 104 copies l among all eight args tetc was under the lod in the influent and effluent after one week of operation after one week the removal rates of total args 16s rrna and int1 were 0 75 log 0 43 log and 1 22 log respectively the abundances of erma tetg qnrs and qnrd were lod in the effluent of the laboratory hwps pp gac cac uf and pgac removed args with removal rates of 0 07 0 47 log 0 01 1 37 log 0 03 0 20 log 0 07 1 63 log and 0 04 1 75 log respectively of the five filters gac had the highest removal rate of 0 33 log for total args followed by pgac 0 19 log and pp 0 10 log after three months of operation the abundances of 16s rrna int1 and most args except sul2 in the effluent were generally higher than those in the influent the log increase rates of args averaged 0 18 log the abundances of 16s rrna and int1 increased by 0 36 log and 1 11 log the abundances of erma ermb qnrs and int1 in the effluent of pp were 0 02 0 79 log higher than those in tap water uf increased the abundance of total args by 0 28 log followed by cac 0 21 log and gac 0 20 log pp and pgac decreased the abundance of total args by 0 26 and 0 24 log respectively after six months of operation the abundances of total args 16s rrna and int1 in the effluent increased by 1 68 1 53 and 0 97 log respectively the abundances of erma sul2 tetc tetg qnrs

in args caused by the laboratory hwps after a long term operation three and six months agreed with the results of hwpss of the investigated houses n4 r n5 r n8 r and x2 r long term operation can result in the growth of biofilm which serves as an ideal place for the proliferation of microorganism and thereby arg proliferation in the filters 3 5 args in biofilms of hwpss five filters from the

in these filters figs 5b and c the relative abundance was calculated by dividing the abundance of args copies l with the abundance of 16s rrna copies l on the five filters of the laboratory hwps tetg

bacterial communities on the biofilm samples from the hwpss of different houses were very different from each other based on the taxonomic classification information of otus of all samples 31 phyla were identified proteobacteria 36 90 acidobacteria 1 16 chloroflexi 3 11 and bacteroidetes 1 19 were the dominant phyla fig 7 a the abundance of proteobacteria on the ufs from the laboratory and

alphaproteobacteria 22 77 and gammaproteobacteria 2 33 were predominant on the biofilm the abundance of alphaproteobacteria on the ufs from the laboratory and houses 55 76 was higher than that on pp gac cac and pgac proteobacteria was often detected as a dominant group of bacteria in both tap water and biofilm samples of water supply pipes or network accounting for 62 88 zhang et al 2019 and 40

hospital dialysis unit proteobacteria and acidobacteria were the dominant phyla in tap water and gammaproteobacteria 65 and bradyrhizobium 7 were the dominant class and genus respectively on the uf membrane dias et al 2020 a correlation analysis was conducted between microbial species and args to understand which microbes drive the formation of args wang et al 2020 at the phylum level the abundances of cyanobacteria patescibacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria exhibited significantly positive correlations with arg abundances on the biofilms of hwpss from the laboratory and houses fig 7c suggesting that these phyla probably carry args in addition nitrospirae and actinobacteria were significantly negatively correlated with arg levels but these phyla probably impacted the abundance and diversity of args and mges in the filters wang et al 2020 at the class level fig 7d the abundances of args showed significant positive correlations with melainabacteria belongs to cyanobacteria parcubacteria belongs to patescibacteria and alphaproteobacteria belongs to proteobacteria previous studies have shown that proteobacteria can carry args jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the abundances of proteobacteria gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes exhibited significantly positive correlations with arg abundances at the phylum level in yangtze river wang et al 2020 the abundances of sul1 and ermb significantly correlated with firmicutes and actinobacteria respectively which is consistent with a previous study on three reservoirs in spain huerta et al 2013 the fate of args in drinking water systems are more complicated than that of antibiotics free and intracellular args can be inactivated naturally or by reactions with disinfectants e g chlorine and chloramines jin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however intracellular args can be released from antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and spread between different microbial species through horizontal gene transfer in the presence of low levels of disinfectants gillings and stokes 2012 ramsden et al 2010 it has been reported that the final disinfection e g chlorination step in dwtps enhances the relative abundance of free args in the treated water xu et al 2016 through a one year survey it was found that the amount of arb with resistance to tetracycline sulfamethoxazole clindamycin and norfloxacin increased likely by biofilm detachment in a drinking water distribution system zhang et al 2019 biofilms that inevitably form in distribution pipes and subsequent water purification systems filter material surfaces when water flows through them pose a risk of the proliferation of microorganisms and args 4 conclusions the levels of antibiotics and args were between lod and 7 9 ng l and between lod and 3 45 105 copies l respectively in tap waters hwpss with fresh filters efficiently removed antibiotics and args with removal rates of 91 92 and 0 46 2 43 log respectively low daily water purification requirements combined with long term operations without changing filters was a common problem in most of the hwpss used in houses as a result hwpss had low removal rates of antibiotics and args 3 79 and 0 03 0 15 log respectively and some even increased the levels of antibiotics and args in the effluents args were detected in filters with relative abundances the ratio of the abundance of args to the abundance of 16s rrna of 2 56 10 8 2 89 10 2 biofilms were observed in many hwps filters proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla and alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the predominant classes the abundances of cyanobacteria patescibacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were significantly positively correlated with the abundances of args biofilm serves as an ideal place for the adsorption of antibiotics microbial proliferation and arg proliferation and thus can increase the amount of antibiotics and args in the effluents of hwpss

17306,despite numerous studies on microplastics mps little attention has been paid to the dissolved organic substances leached from mps and their environmental fate in this study we explored the copper binding characteristics of mp derived dissolved organic matter mp dom leached from several mp types including commercial polypropylene polyvinylchloride and expanded polystyrene under dark and uv irradiation conditions the copper binding affinity of mp dom was examined using fluorescence quenching method based on different fluorophores identified via the excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac the heterogeneous distribution of binding sites across the functional groups of mp dom was further elucidated by utilizing two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir phenol protein like fluorescence prevailed in all mp dom samples whereas humic like fluorescence was more pronounced in the irradiated mp dom for all tested plastic types two plastic derived fluorescent components c2 and c3 exhibited substantial fluorescence quenching with increasing copper concentrations the calculated stability constants showed larger differences between the two leaching conditions than between the three mp types with higher log km values for the uv irradiated 4 08 5 36 than dark treated mp dom 1 05 3 60 the binding constants were comparable to those of natural organic matter with aquatic terrestrial origins the 2d cos results further revealed that the oxygen containing structures in mp dom generated by uv irradiation might be responsible for the higher binding affinity of the irradiated mp dom this is the first study demonstrating the environmental reactivity of mp dom towards metal binding highlighting the importance of leaching conditions for the metal binding behavior of mp dom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics dissolved organic matter copper binding fluorescence quenching eem parafac two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 1 introduction owing to the massive production of plastic and its incorrect disposal micro sized plastic particles so called

aspects eerkes medrano et al 2015 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 recent studies have revealed that mps can release a substantial amount of dissolved organic substances so called mp derived dissolved organic matter mp dom when they are in contact with water lee et al 2020c romera castillo et al 2018 mp dom comprises multiple organic compounds such as additives and various chain scission products from the main polymers including bisphenol phthalates and styrene as monomer of ps plastics gewert et al 2018 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 in aquatic systems mps may undergo a series of weathering processes including turbulence by wave and or exposure to uv light which can facilitate the release of mp dom into their surroundings potthoff et al 2017 of the weathering processes that affect the release of mp dom uv irradiation can be considered as a strong driver for the production of mp dom from plastic particles lee et al 2020c potthoff et al 2017 it was previously reported that mp dom leached under uv irradiation contained more abundance of oxygen containing groups e g carboxylic and or phenolic groups and more pronounced humic like fluorescence compared to those under dark condition galgani et al 2018 lee et al 2020b although the specific features of mp dom depended on the plastic type and leaching conditions galgani et al 2018 lee et al 2020b furthermore recent literature has shown that mp dom could have observable environmental reactivities at levels similar to natural organic matter nom in terms of their tendency to adsorb onto minerals and disinfection byproduct precursors lee and hur 2020 lee et al 2020c the interaction of dom with trace metals is considered to be a critical factor in determining the fate mobility and toxicity of metals in aqueous systems de polo and scrimshaw 2012 santore et al 2001 under the chemistry of fixed solution the extent of metal binding is heavily impacted by the chemical composition and structures of dom numerous studies have shown that carboxylic and phenolic groups in dom serve as effective binding sites ligands for metals croué et al 2003 shi et al 2016 as fluorescence spectroscopy is a fast highly sensitive and cost effective measurement technique the metal binding property of dom has been frequently studied using the fluorescence quenching method fqm wang et al 2015 wu et al 2004 in the fqm a 1 1 metal ligand complex is assumed hays et al 2004 ryan and weber 1982 and the binding constants are estimated by applying the ryan weber model or the stern volmer equation the metal binding dcharacteristics of dom can be further examined with respect to the heterogeneous distribution of binding sites in bulk dom for example metal binding affinities of different fluorophores within bulk dom have been estimated by applying the fqm on different components identified using the parallel factor analysis parafac model on the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem song et al 2017a xu et al 2013a yamashita and jaffé 2008 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos has been coupled with fluorescence spectroscopy hur and lee 2011 lee et al 2020a or fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir huang et al 2018 li et al 2017 to further investigate the complex interactions between metals and dom fluorescence spectroscopy has been long used to determine the distributions of different fluorophores in dom samples brogi et al 2020 coble 1996 the peak locations and intensities of detected fluorophores have been associated with different chemical composition and molecular sizes yang et al 2015 ftir can offer the information on relative abundances of basic functional groups contained in dom samples both tools have gained popularity for easily exploring the variations of dom characteristics due to their preferred merits such as fast measurements low cost and minimal sample treatment in particular they have been widely employed to examine the interactions between dom and metals huang et al 2018 plaza et al 2006 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the two methods are complementary to each other for dom characterization in that ftir is a qualitative method but can reveal non fluorescent structures while fluorescence spectroscopy gives the quantitative estimation of specific fluorescent components previous studies have revealed that mp dom has fluorescence properties as well as complex functional groups lee and hur 2020 lee et al 2020c this feature is similar to nom in the context whether mp dom behaves similar to nom in its interactions with trace metals in the environment is an interesting and challenging question of environmental significance no previous study has examined the interactions between mp dom and trace metals furthermore the information regarding the interaction of mp dom with metals is essential for understanding the fate and transport of metals in mps polluted environments where the release of mp dom from plastic particles is likely to occur thus this study specifically aimed to 1 characterize mp dom obtained under two different leaching conditions dark and uv irradiation and from three plastic types pp pvc and eps via measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc fluorescence eem and ftir analyses 2 explore the binding behaviors of different fluorescent components within bulk mp dom towards copper 3

materials and methods 2 1 preparation for mp dom samples 2 1 1 microplastics in this study polypropylene pp polyvinylchloride pvc and expanded polystyrene eps were selected as representative plastic types commercial plastics were purchased in sheet form 1 mm in thickness for pp and pvc and as beads 1 mm in diameter for eps from a local market in seoul south korea plastics were cut into pieces of approximately 1 mm 1 mm and the cut pieces were sufficiently washed with distilled water to remove any impurities that might have been introduced during the cutting process 2 1 2 leaching experiments leaching experiments were conducted for 14 days with an artificial freshwater solution containing 5 0 g l plastic pieces under two different experimental conditions i e dark and uv irradiation the added plastic dose i e 5 g l was determined based on the ranges used in other similar studies lee and hur 2020 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 as the main goal of this study was to characterize the metal binding properties of mp dom the mp doses were intentionally set at a relatively higher level compared to those typically observed in natural environments alimi et al 2018 chae and an 2018 the total number of mp pieces was additionally estimated by taking into account the average weight of one piece which was 1 316 pieces for pp 649 pieces for pvc and 48 387 pieces for eps table s1 the leaching solution consisted of nahco3 96 mg l caso4 47 4 mg l mgso4 7h2o 122 86 mg l and kcl 4 mg l which mimics the ion composition of typical freshwater majedi et al 2014 the mp pieces were added to the artificial freshwater solution 1 l in a sterilized amber glass bottle before the solution was placed on a shaker at 150 rpm during the 14 days of leaching in the dark for the uv irradiation setup the mp containing freshwater solution was transferred into a quartz tube that was previously autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the tube was placed in the center of a closed cabinet equipped with six 8 w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as a light source lee et al 2020c a stirrer was placed at the bottom of the quartz tube to maintain continuous mixing throughout the leaching period at the end of leaching the mixing solution was filtered through pre ashed whatman gf f filters to obtain the mp dom samples for this step a glass vacuum filtration device was used to avoid contact with extraneous plastic materials as representative nom materials for comparison suwanee river fulvic acid srfa and elliott soil humic acid esha were purchased from the international humic substances society the nom stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 mg of the powder in 1 l of milli q water which resulted in concentrations of 6 4 mg c l for srfa and 4 5 mg c l for esha 2 2 determination of copper complexing capacities and stability constants prior to the copper binding experiments the mp dom and nom solutions were diluted such that the three types of mp dom samples i e pp pvc and eps dom had identical doc concentration i e 0 25 mg c l which was the same as the concentration of pp dom fig s1 copper was used as a representative metal in this study because it has been previously studied for metal dom interactions thus the results can be easily compared with those of previous studies hu et al 2017 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the copper stock solutions were prepared by dissolving different amounts of cu no3 2 in milli q water to obtain copper concentrations of 0 2 1 0 and 5 0 mm the dom solutions either mp dom or nom were transferred into polytetrafluorethylene ptfe vials 20 ml the copper stock solutions were then spiked into the dom containing vials to obtain final copper concentrations varying from 5 to 200 μm hur and lee 2011 lee and hur 2017 the total volume was kept the same 20 ml the vials were then placed on a shaker at 150 rpm and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min as significant dom leaching was not observed from the ptfe vial containing only the copper solution it was considered as a blank fig s2b fluorescence quenching models such as the ryan weber model and the modified stern volmer equation have been widely applied to calculate the parameters related to the metal binding behavior of dom guo et al 2019 hur and lee 2011 although the models have the inherent limitation of not being able to fully characterize metal dom interactions which arises from the simple assumption of 1 1 complexation they are still popular owing to the advantages of easy and fast measurements in this study we adopted the modified stern volmer equation as a fluorescence quenching model where nonlinear fluorescence responses to metal binding are considered to estimate the relative portions of unquenched fluorophores da silva et al 1998 hays et al 2004 the model parameters related to binding affinity and relative abundance of binding sites were calculated based on the following equation 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f f0 f and cm refer to the measured fluorescence intensity the initial fluorescence intensity the fraction of the fluorophores participating in binding and cu2 concentration respectively the conditional stability constant km was estimated from the slope of f0 f0 f against 1 cm 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 doc and ftir spectroscopy the doc concentrations of the samples were determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu l series tocchp japan the samples for doc analyses were collected in pre combusted 40 ml glass vials they were acidified with 1 m hcl solution to a ph of 2 0 to minimize biodegradation and were stored at 4 c until measurement ftir spectroscopy nicolet is10 thermo scientific usa was used to identify the functional groups present in the mp dom samples the detailed procedure for ftir analysis is available in other reports chen et al 2018 lee et al 2020c in brief 10 ml of a filtered mp dom sample was mixed with 100 mg of kbr powder sigma aldrich ftir grade and freeze dried for further analysis as a blank clean kbr pellets were prepared by drying at 105 c for 2 h the scanned wavenumber range was between 650 and 4000 cm 1 each ftir spectrum was corrected for baseline shifts and smoothed using origin 9 0 software 12 points savitzky golay method the ftir peak intensities were normalized by the summed intensities of all the observed peaks yang et al 2015 2 3 2 fluorescence eem measurements and parafac modeling fluorescence eem spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan the scan was run at an emission wavelength em from 280 to 550 nm with steps of 1 nm the excitation wavelengths ex for the emission scan were varied in the range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increment of 5 nm the excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 10 nm the fluorescence response to milli q water was taken into account as a blank to obtain the final eem data of dom samples through subtraction the fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units r u using the intensity of the integrated raman peak at 350 nm em lawaetz and stedmon 2009 parafac modeling was performed using matlab 7 0 mathworks natick ma usa along with the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 the number of independent fluorescent dom fdom components was determined using split half validation of the eem results obtained from copper binding experiment and the percentage of the explained variance 95 2 the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax of the identified fdom components were adopted to represent the relative quantities of the individual components in this study the eem data of nom samples were also incorporated into the modeling to directly compare mp dom and nom samples 2 3 3 2d cos 2d cos was applied to identify sequential changes occurring in the ftir spectra of mp dom caused by the addition of copper as an external perturbation typically the procedure generates two types of two dimensional maps called synchronous and asynchronous maps which were obtained using an open access software 2d shige version 1 3 https sites google com site shigemorita home 2dshige in the synchronous map auto peaks which appear on the diagonal line indicate spectral changes due to the addition of copper and their locations cross peaks located off the diagonal line represent simultaneous changes of the variables occurring at two different locations i e x and y axis positive cross peaks imply that the changes occur in the same direction for the two variables whereas negative cross peaks imply that the changes are in opposite directions on the other hand cross peaks in the asynchronous map provide information on the sequence of changes the interpretation is entirely based on noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 according to the rule if the signs of cross peaks positive or negative are the same in both types of maps the signal change on the x axis precedes that on the y axis whereas the order of the sequence is reversed if the signs of peaks on the two maps are opposite the mathematical expressions for the 2d cos and map generation are described elsewhere noda 2016 park et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic characteristics of mp doms 3 1 1 functional groups the mps used in this study presented distinct features in the ftir spectra for the individual plastic types with the appearance of four peaks for pp designated as peaks a c d and g five peaks for pvc designated as peaks a e f g and j and six peaks for eps designated as peaks a b f g h and i fig 1 a and table s2 some of the peaks originate from carbon chains consisting of repeating ch units which correspond to peaks a and c for pp peaks a and e for pvc and peaks b and g for eps peaks have also been observed in other plastic types such as polyethylene pe and pp in a previous study jung et al 2018 in this study pp and eps types were well discriminated by the exclusive presence of peaks d and g for pp and peaks a and f for eps no chlorine related peak was observed in the pvc particles in the present study although a few prior studies reported the presence of a unique peak for pvc noda et al 2007 verleye et al 2001 for the mp dom samples the peaks of ch bands were observed in the ftir spectra as a common plastic proxy e g peaks a a or b independent of the plastic types and leaching conditions similar observations were previously reported for mp dom derived from pe and pp polymer materials lee et al 2020c additionally new peaks were identified from the mp dom samples which were not observed in the mp particles for example peaks c and d which are related to additives emerged in the spectra of the dark treated pvc dom while peak d which represents the monomers of eps appeared in the leached dom from eps plastic under dark conditions fig 1b for the uv treated mp dom samples additional features were observed with the appearance of peaks b and g for pvc dom and peaks c and e for eps dom fig 1c no oxygen containing functional groups was found for the irradiated pp dom unique peaks of the uv irradiated mp dom samples have been reported for other oxidized polymers gugumus 1999 lucki and rånby 1979 which suggested that the new peaks might be associated with oxygen containing compounds generated by photo oxidation via uv irradiation table s2 the ftir results of the irradiated mp dom are in line with those from a previous study employing mass spectroscopy that provided molecular evidence of the release of polymer fragments with oxidized end groups into the aqueous phase from pet and eps plastics after exposure to uv light gewert et al 2018 3 1 2 concentration of leached doc under dark conditions the released doc concentrations per gram of pvc or eps were more than two fold higher than that from pp 0 140 0 003 mg c g pvc and 0 130 0 003 mg c g eps versus 0 050 0 002 mg c g pp fig 1d the results suggested that the amounts of leached doc might be highly dependent on the plastic type pvc and eps plastics contain a relatively high content of additives than pp and the additives can be leached to a greater extent by close contact with the aqueous phase than the main plastic structures such as polymers hermabessiere et al 2017 jang et al 2017 the leached amounts of mp dom per plastic mass were much greater for the uv irradiated samples than those for the dark treated samples for example after 14 days of irradiation the doc concentration per mass of eps dom was more than 80 times higher than that under dark conditions which implies that uv irradiation could play a role in changing plastic surfaces into structures vulnerable to dissolution gardette et al 2013 in this study the high leaching tendency of mp dom upon uv stimulation was more pronounced for eps than for pp and pvc with leached concentrations of 11 08 0 14 0 20 0 003 and 0 89 0 004 mg c g respectively at the end of the uv irradiation the structural instability of eps under uv irradiation was also reported in a previous study song et al 2017b in which a significant difference was observed in the number of fragmented plastic particles with and without 6 month long exposure to uv light 12 152 3 276 particles per pellet under light versus 4 220 33 particles per pellet in the dark similar to the doc concentration per added mass the leached quantities of mp dom per number of plastic pieces also showed clear differences among the different plastic types fig 1e for example under dark conditions the doc concentration per number of pvc pieces was nearly 100 times higher than that of eps this trend agrees well with a previous report suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 showing that the amount of released additives per surface area of pvc in the dark was nearly ten times greater than that released by ps this result is noteworthy considering the current situation in which many soil sediment environments are polluted with pvc plastics van cauwenberghe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 thus it is expected that a substantial amount of dom could be leached from pvc in such environments in addition large differences in the piece number normalized doc concentrations of mp dom were found between the two different leaching conditions fig 1e 3 1 3 fluorescence eems the fluorescence eems of the mp dom samples are shown in fig 2 the samples were obtained from the leaching solutions at 5 g mp l as all samples were diluted to the same doc concentration i e 0 25 mg c l they were comparable to one another on the same scale no fluorescence peak was detected for the control sample i e the artificial freshwater solution without mps fig s2a which indicated that the observed fluorescence peaks originated solely from the plastics added to the artificial freshwater solution regardless of the plastic type prominent peaks appeared in the phenol protein like fluorescence region which are typically defined as peak b 225 280 305 nm and peak t 225 280 350 nm ex em coble 1996 of the eem for the dark treated mp dom figs 2a c the peak b may represent phenol like substances carstea et al 2016 ou et al 2014 while the peak t is typically related to bio labile properties its presence in the eems is in line with a previous study which reported that a substantial portion approximately 60 of the dom leached from plastics was degraded in less than 5 days under microbial incubation romera castillo et al 2018 the dark treated mp dom samples exhibited additional peaks in the humic like fluorescence region from 260 to 310 nm ex and 405 nm em except for pp the humic like fluorescence was more pronounced for the uv irradiated samples suggesting that the fluorescence might be associated with photo induced structures figs 2d and f for example the humic like peak intensity at 295 405 nm ex em was higher for the eps dom obtained under uv irradiation 0 037 r u compared to that in the dark 0 011 r u in contrast the phenol protein like peak at 250 309 nm ex em showed a lower intensity for the irradiated mp dom than the dark treated counterparts e g 0 070 versus 0 001 r u for eps dom which can be attributed to photolytic degradation the photo labile property of protein like fluorophores has been previously reported for aquatic nom phong and hur 2015 changes in the eem spectra upon the addition of copper were compared for three different plastic types under dark and uv irradiation conditions fig 2a f versus 2g to 2l fluorescence quenching by copper addition was observed for all mp dom similarly to the nom samples which suggested that electronic structural changes occurred in mp dom via the formation of complexes with copper plaza et al 2006 however the quenching behavior was not the same for all mp dom samples indicating that the degree of quenching and the associated structures may depend upon the plastic type and the leaching conditions eem alone is not capable of characterizing the interactions of independent fluorophores with copper as the apparent eem peaks may consist of multiple fluorescent components thus it is necessary to track fluorescence quenching of independent fluorescent components identified from eem parafac 3 2 copper binding characteristics of different fluorescent components 3 2 1 fluorescent components identified by parafac modeling the parafac modeling revealed that the three component model best describes the copper inducing variations in the fluorescence features of the mp dom samples with the core consistency of 95 3 fig 3 and table s3 component 1 c1 peaked at 265 325 463 nm ex em components 2 c2 and 3 c3 exhibited maxima at 250 325 324 nm ex em and 295 250 411 nm ex em respectively the peak locations of c2 and c3 were consistent with those of the previous eem spectra of the mp dom under dark and uv irradiation conditions these fluorescent components are analogous to those typically found in natural aquatic systems brogi et al 2020 kothawala et al 2014 as well as those obtained from the leaching of plastic materials lee et al 2020b table s3 c1 can be assigned to a terrestrial humic like component which roughly represents the fluorescence feature of the nom materials used in this study 3 2 2 fluorescence quenching behavior of different fluorescent components the quenching trend of each fdom component upon the addition of copper is shown in fig s3 for the same plastic type the quenching curves differed greatly depending on the fdom component the plastic types i e pp pvc and eps and the leaching conditions i e dark and uv irradiation in the dark treated mp dom the two plastic derived components c2 and c3 showed obvious fluorescence quenching upon the addition of copper while negligible quenching was observed for c1 fig s3 even the same fdom component showed different degrees of fluorescence quenching depending on the plastic type fig s3 for example for the dark treated mp dom the extent of quenching in phenol protein like c2 reached a reduction of up to 48 6 3 6 for eps and 48 3 2 7 for pvc while it was only 28 5 1 2 for pp however the extent of quenching of the pp dom in which no humic like fluorescence peak was shown was more pronounced under uv irradiation versus dark conditions reduction of up to 68 9 2 7 for c2 the metal addition induced quenching for the phenol protein like component in dom has been previously reported in many studies hu et al 2017 hur and lee 2011 this result strongly implies that the phenol protein like component contains structures that are actively involved in copper binding irrespective of the plastic type on the other hand the extent of quenching in the plastic derived humic component c3 was more pronounced for the pvc dom and eps dom under uv irradiation than under dark conditions eps dom 69 2 7 8 under uv irradiation versus 61 0 1 4 in the dark pvc dom 67 7 0 1 versus 54 4 4 3 fig s3 the greater extent of fluorescence quenching of the humic like component in the irradiated mp dom may be associated with the presence of more acidic functional groups in the mp dom obtained under uv irradiation than under dark conditions this explanation is supported by a previous study that used mass spectroscopy in which oxygen containing groups such as carboxylate were detected in the leached solution from uv irradiated plastics gewert et al 2018 in the same context previous studies using nom have shown that aromatic structures and acidic functional groups are responsible for strong copper binding plaza et al 2006 slight increase and or fluctuation of some components in the quenching curves fig s3 can be ascribed to the changes of quantum yields as a result of structural modification of fluorescent molecules caused by high levels of copper yamashita and jaffé 2008 nom samples i e srfa and esha showed clear fluorescence quenching in c1 but negligible quenching in c2 and c3 the maximum extent of c1 quenching was 44 7 0 6 for srfa and 83 7 0 4 for esha interestingly c2 was clearly quenched by copper addition to mp dom but not for the nom samples this result suggests that the c2 component may have completely different structures between mp dom and nom in terms of copper binding even though it has identical spectral features 3 2 3 comparison of copper binding parameters for different fluorescent components to explore differences in the binding properties of different fluorescent components and different mp dom samples the copper binding parameters were calculated using the best fit of the modified stern volmer equation based on the fmax values of the individual components exhibiting quenching behaviors table 1 and fig 4 the fluorescent components included in the model fittings were c1 from srfa and esha c2 in the mp dom samples from pp pvc eps in the dark and pp obtained under uv irradiation and c3 from eps dom and pvc dom obtained under both dark and uv irradiation conditions the results for the copper binding parameter of the fluorescent components are listed in table 1 with statistical significance p 0 01 a range of binding constants or stability constants was observed for the same fluorescent component among the different mp dom samples table 1 for example the log km values of the c2 component in the dark treated mp dom samples ranged from 1 05 0 01 to 3 09 0 08 with variations depending on the plastic type independent of the plastic type and the fluorescent component the uv irradiated mp dom exhibited higher stability constants than the dark treated counterparts as shown by the log km values of c3 ranging from 4 82 0 72 to 5 36 0 77 for the former versus from 1 97 0 03 to 3 60 0 05 for the latter table 1 for the pp dom the log km values of c2 were 4 08 0 25 and 2 62 0 09 for uv irradiation and dark conditions respectively this result can be ascribed to the previous observation regarding the presence of oxygen containing functional groups in irradiated mp dom interestingly the calculated stability constants of the c3 component in the mp dom samples were comparable to or even greater than those of similar fluorescence peaks previously reported for aquatic terrestrial nom ranging from 3 97 to 5 39 hur and lee 2011 lee and hur 2017 xu et al 2013a 2013b for the nom samples in the present study the humic like component c1 exhibited significant model parameters and the stability constants were similar to those of c3 in the irradiated mp dom table 1 these results suggest that dissolved organic substances from the photochemical breakdown of plastics can interact with metals strongly enough to alter the fate and transport of metals in natural and engineered systems which can be comparable to the effect of nom on metal transport in contrast to the stability constants there was no consistent trend of the f values between the irradiated and the dark treated samples table 1 however the photo induced humic like component c3 exhibited lower f values compared to phenol protein like c2 for both eps and pvc dom the results suggested that the fraction of the participating binding sites might be more affected by variations in fdom components than the leaching conditions for mp dom in fact interaction of metals with the surface of mp particles has also been studied in recent years guan et al 2020 turner and holmes 2015 in the studies it was found that biofilm development on mp surfaces could enhance the metal adsorption via alteration of the physical and chemical properties of the mps surfaces in a way to enrich carboxyl amino and phenyl oh groups guan et al 2020 however regardless of the biofilm formation mp particles exhibited a much lower adsorption tendency than natural particles such as suspended sediment guan et al 2020 the result of the previous study is in stark contrast to the comparable copper binding affinity of mp dom especially irradiated mp dom to those of nom in this study table 1 3 3 change in ftir spectra with copper addition 2d coir analysis to obtain further information regarding the sequential changes in the functional groups of mp dom with the addition of copper 2d cos was performed with a series of ftir spectra obtained with varying amounts of added copper to examine the effect of the leaching conditions on changes in the ftir spectra the 2d cos was explored only for pvc and eps dom regardless of the plastic type and the leaching conditions all ftir peaks identified in the original mp dom samples were observed after the addition of copper with varying intensities the spectral changes on copper addition are presented in fig s4 the extent of changes in the peak intensities differed depending on the peak locations and sample types fig s4 on the diagonal lines of the synchronous maps figs 5 a d several distinctive peaks were observed including peaks a c d and f for the dark treated pvc dom peaks d f and i for the dark treated eps dom peaks a b f and g for the irradiated pvc dom and peaks b c d and i for the irradiated eps dom the signs of the cross peaks were positive in all synchronous maps indicating that the spectral changes associated with copper binding occurred in the same direction in addition the asynchronous map revealed information concerning the sequential changes in the ftir spectra in response to increasing copper concentrations for the dark treated pvc dom two positive signed peaks were identified at the locations x axis y axis of peaks c f and d f the peak locations corresponded to the same positive region in the synchronous map figs 5e h and table s4 according to noda s rules hur and lee 2011 noda et al 2000 the features can be interpreted as the binding affinity for copper increasing of carboxylates in additives peak c bisphenol a bpa peak d ch bends peak f under the same rules the sequential changes of the dark treated eps dom occurred in the order of aromatic ch peak i aromatic ring peak f c c peak d ch2 bend peak g these results suggest that leached additives from plastic have stronger binding affinities for copper than other leached structures and that aromatic ring structures of plastics are more active in binding copper than the common plastic structures related to ch2 bend for the irradiated mp dom one positively and one negatively signed cross peaks were found in the asynchronous map of the pvc dom at the x y locations corresponding to peaks b f and a b respectively for the irradiated eps dom there was one positively signed peak at c i and two negatively signed cross peaks at b i and d i according to noda s rules the features can lead to the following sequential orders of peak b c o f ch bend a ch stretch for pvc dom and peak c c o i aromatic ch d c c b ch stretch for eps dom from the results the oxidized structures of mp dom revealed their priority in the sequence of copper binding over the additives and polymer derived substances irrespective of the plastic type the general trend of the binding preferences in different functional groups agrees with those previously reported for nom for example oxygen containing structures of nom such as carboxylic group have revealed a stronger binding affinity for copper compared to other functional groups based on the same analytic method chen et al 2015 hu et al 2019 huang et al 2018 furthermore from the perspective of the environmental reactivity of mp dom it is worth noting a recent study demonstrated stronger interaction of oxidized structures in irradiated mp dom with mineral surfaces which was also revealed by utilizing 2d cos based on ftir spectra lee and hur 2020 3 4 environmental implications and future studies this study demonstrated the capability of plastic derived dom to bind copper via the fqm a range of binding constants were found among the different fluorescent components identified within the bulk mp dom samples 2d cos combined with ftir spectra provided further insights into the heterogeneous distribution of copper binding sites within bulk mp dom as well as the sequence in sites with higher affinity considering the massive production of plastics that might result in a substantial amount of mp dom released into natural ecosystems this information is essential for understanding the fate and transport of metals in mp polluted environments the environmental fate of metals might be altered by interacting with the previously overlooked mp dom under such circumstances and the information on metal binding with nom alone may be misleading to fully understand the fate and transport of metals in such environments for example there might be competition between nom and mp dom for binding metals in mp polluted environments as this study used copper as a model metal further metal binding experiments using other trace metals are recommended to extend and generalize the findings of this work the extent of the interaction can be strongly affected by several factors such as leaching conditions plastic types and amounts of additives contained in mps the presented results demonstrated that the interactions between copper and plastic derived dom especially irradiated mp dom could be as strong as those with nom thus a tool to distinguish between naturally occurring and plastic derived dom in natural environments is required to properly identify the environmental impacts e g interactions with metals of plastic derived dom because of its similar environmental behavior as nom for example although the c3 revealed a distinctive for the mp dom produced under uv irradiation in this study this fluorescence feature overlapped with those from common aquatic nom hampering the clear distinction of dom with mp origins from those that originate naturally 4 conclusions this is the first report to demonstrate the metal binding ability of plastic derived dom the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 this study demonstrated the interactions between plastic derived dom and copper via the fqm the eem parafac identified two specific fluorescent components from mp dom leached under dark and uv irradiation conditions the two plastic derived components phenol protein like c2 and photo induced humic like c3 showed clear fluorescence quenching behaviors with increasing copper concentrations 2 mp dom exhibited a high binding affinity towards copper for eps and pvc plastics the stability constants or log km were higher for the uv irradiated than the dark treated mp dom the results highlight the impact of the leaching conditions on the metal binding behavior of mp dom 3 2d cos combined with ftir revealed preferential binding affinities for copper among different functional groups in mp dom additives and aromatic ring structures in mp dom interacted with copper more strongly than polymer associated structures in the dark treated mp dom whereas oxygen containing functional groups were found to be the most preferred structures for copper binding among all the structures identified from the ftir of the uv irradiated mp dom 4 the estimated binding constants of mp dom were comparable to those of the aquatic terrestrial nom this finding implies that the interaction of plastic derived dom with trace metals should be taken into account to fully understand the fate and consequences of

17306,despite numerous studies on microplastics mps little attention has been paid to the dissolved organic substances leached from mps and their environmental fate in this study we explored the copper binding characteristics of mp derived dissolved organic matter mp dom leached from several mp types including commercial polypropylene polyvinylchloride and expanded polystyrene under dark and uv irradiation conditions the copper binding affinity of mp dom was examined using fluorescence quenching method based on different fluorophores identified via the excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac the heterogeneous distribution of binding sites across the functional groups of mp dom was further elucidated by utilizing two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir phenol protein like fluorescence prevailed in all mp dom samples whereas humic like fluorescence was more pronounced in the irradiated mp dom for all tested plastic types two plastic derived fluorescent components c2 and c3 exhibited substantial fluorescence quenching with increasing copper concentrations the calculated stability constants showed larger differences between the two leaching conditions than between the three mp types with higher log km values for the uv irradiated 4 08 5 36 than dark treated mp dom 1 05 3 60 the binding constants were comparable to those of natural organic matter with aquatic terrestrial origins the 2d cos results further revealed that the oxygen containing structures in mp dom generated by uv irradiation might be responsible for the higher binding affinity of the irradiated mp dom this is the first study demonstrating the environmental reactivity of mp dom towards metal binding highlighting the importance of leaching conditions for the metal binding behavior of mp dom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics dissolved organic matter copper binding

microplastics mps pose a great risk to aquatic ecosystems he et al 2018 syberg et al 2015 many studies have investigated the occurrence and fate of mps in aquatic terrestrial environments from various aspects eerkes medrano et al 2015 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 recent studies have revealed that mps can release a substantial amount of dissolved organic substances so called mp derived dissolved organic matter mp dom when they are in contact with water lee et al 2020c romera castillo et al 2018 mp dom comprises multiple organic compounds such as additives and various chain scission products from the main polymers including bisphenol phthalates and styrene as monomer of ps plastics gewert et al 2018 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 in aquatic systems mps may undergo a series of weathering processes including turbulence by wave and or exposure to uv light which can facilitate the release of mp dom into their surroundings potthoff et al 2017 of the weathering processes that affect the release of mp dom uv irradiation can be considered as a strong driver for the production of mp dom from plastic particles lee et al 2020c potthoff et al 2017 it was previously reported that mp dom leached under uv irradiation contained more abundance of oxygen containing groups e g carboxylic and or phenolic groups and more pronounced humic like fluorescence compared to those under dark condition galgani et al 2018 lee et al 2020b although the specific features of mp dom depended on the plastic type and leaching conditions galgani et al 2018 lee et al 2020b furthermore recent literature has shown that mp dom could have observable environmental reactivities at levels similar to natural organic matter nom in terms of their tendency to adsorb onto minerals and disinfection byproduct precursors lee and hur 2020 lee et al 2020c the interaction of dom with trace metals is considered to be a critical factor in determining the fate mobility and toxicity of metals in aqueous systems de polo and scrimshaw 2012 santore et al 2001 under the chemistry of fixed solution the extent of metal binding is heavily impacted by the chemical composition and structures of dom numerous studies have shown that carboxylic and phenolic groups in dom serve as effective binding sites ligands for metals croué et al 2003 shi et al 2016 as fluorescence spectroscopy is a fast highly sensitive and cost effective measurement technique the metal binding property of dom has been frequently studied using the fluorescence quenching method fqm wang et al 2015 wu et al 2004 in the fqm a 1 1 metal ligand complex is assumed hays et al 2004 ryan and weber 1982 and the binding constants are estimated by applying the ryan weber model or the stern volmer equation the metal binding dcharacteristics of dom can be further examined with respect to the heterogeneous distribution of binding sites in bulk dom for example metal binding affinities of different fluorophores within bulk dom have been estimated by applying the fqm on different components identified using the parallel factor analysis parafac model on the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem song et al 2017a xu et al 2013a yamashita and jaffé 2008 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos has been coupled with fluorescence spectroscopy hur and lee 2011 lee et al 2020a or fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir huang et al 2018 li et al 2017 to further investigate the complex interactions between metals and dom fluorescence spectroscopy has been long used to determine the distributions of different fluorophores in dom samples brogi et al 2020 coble 1996 the peak locations and intensities of detected fluorophores have been associated with different chemical composition and molecular sizes yang et al 2015 ftir can offer the information on relative abundances of basic functional groups contained in dom samples both tools have gained popularity for easily exploring the variations of dom characteristics due to their preferred merits such as fast measurements low cost and minimal sample treatment in particular they have been widely employed to examine the interactions between dom and metals huang et al 2018 plaza et al 2006 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the two methods are complementary to each other for dom characterization in that ftir is a qualitative method but can reveal non fluorescent structures while fluorescence spectroscopy gives the quantitative estimation of specific fluorescent components previous studies have revealed that mp dom has fluorescence properties as well as complex functional groups lee and hur 2020 lee et al 2020c this feature is similar to nom in the context whether mp dom behaves similar to nom in its interactions with trace metals in the environment is an interesting and challenging question of environmental significance no previous study has examined the interactions between mp dom and trace metals furthermore the information regarding the interaction of mp dom with metals is essential for understanding the fate and transport of metals in mps polluted environments where the release of mp dom from plastic particles is likely to occur thus this study specifically aimed to 1 characterize mp dom obtained under two different leaching conditions dark and uv irradiation and from three plastic types pp pvc and eps via measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc fluorescence eem and ftir analyses 2 explore the binding behaviors of different fluorescent components within bulk mp dom towards copper 3 apply 2d cos to elucidate the potentially complex interactions involving various functional groups and 4 compare the binding stability constants of mp dom with those of aquatic terrestrial nom 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation for mp dom samples 2 1 1 microplastics in this study polypropylene pp polyvinylchloride pvc and expanded polystyrene eps were selected as representative plastic types commercial plastics were purchased in sheet form 1 mm in thickness for pp and pvc and as beads 1 mm in diameter for eps from a local market in seoul south korea plastics were cut into pieces of approximately 1 mm 1 mm and the cut pieces were sufficiently washed with distilled water to remove any impurities that might have been introduced during the cutting process 2 1 2 leaching experiments leaching experiments were conducted for 14 days with an artificial freshwater solution containing 5 0 g l plastic pieces under two different experimental conditions i e dark and uv irradiation the added plastic dose i e 5 g l was determined based on the ranges used in other similar studies lee and hur 2020 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 as the main goal of this study was to characterize the metal binding properties of mp dom the mp doses were intentionally set at a relatively higher level compared to those typically observed in natural environments alimi et al 2018 chae and an 2018 the total number of mp pieces was additionally estimated by taking into account the average weight of one piece which was 1 316 pieces for pp 649 pieces for pvc and 48 387 pieces for eps table s1 the leaching solution consisted of nahco3 96 mg l caso4 47 4 mg l mgso4 7h2o 122 86 mg l and kcl 4 mg l which mimics the ion composition of typical freshwater majedi et al 2014 the mp pieces were added to the artificial freshwater solution 1 l in a sterilized amber glass bottle before the solution was placed on a shaker at 150 rpm during the 14 days of leaching in the dark for the uv irradiation setup the mp containing freshwater solution was transferred into a quartz tube that was previously autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the tube was placed in the center of a closed cabinet equipped with six 8 w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as a light source lee et al 2020c a stirrer was placed at the bottom of the quartz tube to maintain continuous mixing throughout the leaching period at the end of leaching the mixing solution was filtered through pre ashed whatman gf f filters to obtain the mp dom samples for this step a glass vacuum filtration device was used to avoid contact with extraneous plastic materials as representative nom materials for comparison suwanee river fulvic acid srfa and elliott soil humic acid esha were purchased from the international humic substances society the nom stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 mg of the powder in 1 l of milli q water which resulted in concentrations of 6 4 mg c l for srfa and 4 5 mg c l for esha 2 2 determination of copper complexing capacities and stability constants prior to the copper binding experiments the mp dom and nom solutions were diluted such that the three types of mp dom samples i e pp pvc and eps dom had identical doc concentration i e 0 25 mg c l which was the same as the concentration of pp dom fig s1 copper was used as a representative metal in this study because it has been previously studied for metal dom interactions thus the results can be easily compared with those of previous studies hu et al 2017 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the copper stock solutions were prepared by dissolving different amounts of cu no3 2 in milli q water to obtain copper concentrations of 0 2 1 0 and 5 0 mm the dom solutions either mp dom or nom were transferred into polytetrafluorethylene ptfe vials 20 ml the copper stock solutions were then spiked into the dom containing vials to obtain final copper concentrations varying from 5 to 200 μm hur and lee 2011 lee and hur 2017 the total volume was kept the same 20 ml the vials were then placed on a shaker at 150 rpm and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min as significant dom leaching was not observed from the ptfe vial containing only the copper solution it was considered as a blank fig s2b fluorescence quenching models such as the ryan weber model and the modified stern volmer equation have been widely applied to calculate the parameters related to the metal binding behavior of dom guo et al 2019 hur and lee 2011 although the models have the inherent limitation of not being able to fully characterize metal dom interactions which arises from the simple assumption of 1 1 complexation they are still popular owing to the advantages of easy and fast measurements in this study we adopted the modified stern volmer equation as a fluorescence quenching model where nonlinear fluorescence responses to metal binding are considered to estimate the relative portions of unquenched fluorophores da silva et al 1998 hays et al 2004 the model parameters related to binding affinity and relative abundance of binding sites were calculated based on the following equation 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f f0 f and cm refer to the measured fluorescence intensity the initial fluorescence intensity the fraction of the fluorophores participating in binding and cu2 concentration respectively the conditional stability constant km was estimated from the slope of f0 f0 f against 1 cm 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 doc and ftir spectroscopy the doc concentrations of the samples were determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu l series tocchp japan the samples for doc analyses were collected in pre combusted 40 ml glass vials they were acidified with 1 m hcl solution to a ph of 2 0 to minimize biodegradation and were stored at 4 c until measurement ftir spectroscopy nicolet is10 thermo scientific usa was used to identify the functional groups present in the mp dom samples the detailed procedure for ftir analysis is available in other reports chen et al 2018 lee et al 2020c in brief 10 ml of a filtered mp dom sample was mixed with 100 mg of kbr powder sigma aldrich ftir grade and freeze dried for further analysis as a blank clean kbr pellets were prepared by drying at 105 c for 2 h the scanned wavenumber range was between 650 and 4000 cm 1 each ftir spectrum was corrected for baseline shifts and smoothed using origin 9 0 software 12 points savitzky golay method the ftir peak intensities were normalized by the summed intensities of all the observed peaks yang et al 2015 2 3 2 fluorescence eem measurements and parafac modeling fluorescence eem spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan the scan was run at an emission wavelength em from 280 to 550 nm with steps of 1 nm the excitation wavelengths ex for the emission scan were varied in the range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increment of 5 nm the excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 10 nm the fluorescence response to milli q water was taken into account as a blank to obtain the final eem data of dom samples through subtraction the fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units r u using the intensity of the integrated raman peak at 350 nm em lawaetz and stedmon 2009 parafac modeling was performed using matlab 7 0 mathworks natick ma usa along with the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 the number of independent fluorescent dom fdom components was determined using split half validation of the eem results obtained from copper binding experiment and the percentage of the explained variance 95 2 the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax of the identified fdom components were adopted to represent the relative quantities of the individual components in this study the eem data of nom samples were also incorporated into the modeling to directly compare mp dom and nom samples 2 3 3 2d cos 2d cos was applied to identify sequential changes occurring in the ftir spectra of mp dom caused by the addition of copper as an external perturbation typically the procedure generates two types of two dimensional maps called synchronous and asynchronous maps which were obtained using an open access software 2d shige version 1 3 https sites google com site shigemorita home 2dshige in the synchronous map auto peaks which appear on the diagonal line indicate spectral changes due to the addition of copper and their locations cross peaks located off the diagonal line represent simultaneous changes of the variables occurring at two different locations i e x and y axis positive cross peaks imply that the changes occur in the same direction for the two variables whereas negative cross peaks imply that the changes are in opposite directions on the other hand cross peaks in the asynchronous map provide information on the sequence of changes the interpretation is entirely based on noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 according to the rule if the signs of cross peaks positive or negative are the same in both types of maps the signal change on the x axis precedes that on the y axis whereas the order of the sequence is reversed if the signs of peaks on the two maps are opposite the mathematical expressions for the 2d cos and map generation are described elsewhere noda 2016 park et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic characteristics of mp doms 3 1 1 functional groups the mps used in this study presented distinct features in the ftir spectra for the individual plastic types with the appearance of four peaks for pp designated as peaks a c d and g five peaks for pvc designated as peaks a e f g and j and six peaks for eps designated as peaks a b f g h and i fig 1 a and table s2 some of the peaks originate from carbon chains consisting of repeating ch units which correspond to peaks a and c for pp peaks a and e for pvc and peaks b and g for eps peaks have also been observed in other plastic types such as polyethylene pe and pp in a previous study jung et al 2018 in this study pp and eps types were well discriminated by the exclusive presence of peaks d and g for pp and peaks a and f for eps no chlorine related peak was observed in the pvc particles in the present study although a few prior studies reported the presence of a unique peak for pvc noda et al 2007 verleye et al 2001 for the mp dom samples the peaks of ch bands were observed in the ftir spectra as a common plastic proxy e g peaks a a or b independent of the plastic types and leaching conditions similar observations were previously reported for mp dom derived from pe and pp polymer materials lee et al 2020c additionally new peaks were identified from the mp dom samples which were not observed in the mp particles for example peaks c and d which are related to additives emerged in the spectra of the dark treated pvc dom while peak d which represents the monomers of eps appeared in the leached dom from eps plastic under dark conditions fig 1b for the uv treated mp dom samples additional features were observed with the appearance of peaks b and g for pvc dom and peaks c and e for eps dom fig 1c no oxygen containing functional groups was found for the irradiated pp dom unique peaks of the uv irradiated mp dom samples have been reported for other oxidized polymers gugumus 1999 lucki and rånby 1979 which suggested that the new peaks might be associated with oxygen containing compounds generated by photo oxidation via uv irradiation table s2 the ftir results of the irradiated mp dom are in line with those from a previous study employing mass spectroscopy that provided molecular evidence of the release of polymer fragments with oxidized end groups into the aqueous phase from pet and eps plastics after exposure to uv light gewert et al 2018 3 1 2 concentration of leached doc under dark conditions the released doc concentrations per gram of pvc or eps were more than two fold higher than that from pp 0 140 0 003 mg c g pvc and 0 130 0 003 mg c g eps versus 0 050 0 002 mg c g pp fig 1d the results suggested that the amounts of leached doc might be highly dependent on the plastic type pvc and eps plastics contain a relatively high content of additives than pp and the additives can be leached to a greater extent by close contact with the aqueous phase than the main plastic structures such as polymers hermabessiere et al 2017 jang et al 2017 the leached amounts of mp dom per plastic mass were much greater for the uv irradiated samples than those for the dark treated samples for example after 14 days of irradiation the doc concentration per mass of eps dom was more than 80 times higher than that under dark conditions which implies that uv irradiation could play a role in changing plastic surfaces into structures vulnerable to dissolution gardette et al 2013 in this study the high leaching tendency of mp dom upon uv stimulation was more pronounced for eps than for pp and pvc with leached concentrations of 11 08 0 14 0 20 0 003 and 0 89 0 004 mg c g respectively at the end of the uv irradiation the structural instability of eps under uv irradiation was also reported in a previous study song et al 2017b in which a significant difference was observed in the number of fragmented plastic particles with and without 6 month long exposure to uv light 12 152 3 276 particles per pellet under light versus 4 220 33 particles per pellet in the dark similar to the doc concentration per added mass the leached quantities of mp dom per number of plastic pieces also showed clear differences among the different plastic types fig 1e for example under dark conditions the doc concentration per number of pvc pieces was nearly 100 times higher than that of eps this trend agrees well with a previous report suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 showing that the amount of released additives per surface area of pvc in the dark was nearly ten times greater than that released by ps this result is noteworthy considering the current situation in which many soil sediment environments are polluted with pvc plastics van cauwenberghe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 thus it is expected that a substantial amount of dom could be leached from pvc in such environments in addition large differences in the piece number normalized doc concentrations of mp dom were found between the two different leaching conditions fig 1e 3 1 3 fluorescence eems the fluorescence eems of the mp dom samples are shown in fig 2 the samples were obtained from the leaching solutions at 5 g mp l as all samples were diluted to the same doc concentration i e 0 25 mg c l they were comparable to one another on the same scale no fluorescence peak was detected for the control sample i e the artificial freshwater solution without mps fig s2a which indicated that the observed fluorescence peaks originated solely from the plastics added to the artificial freshwater solution regardless of the plastic type prominent peaks appeared in the phenol protein like fluorescence region which are typically defined as peak b 225 280 305 nm and peak t 225 280 350 nm ex em coble 1996 of the eem for the dark treated mp dom figs 2a c the peak b may represent phenol like substances carstea et al 2016 ou et al 2014 while the peak t is typically related to bio labile properties its presence in the eems is in line with a previous study which reported that a substantial portion approximately 60 of the dom leached from plastics was degraded in less than 5 days under microbial incubation romera castillo et al 2018 the dark treated mp dom samples exhibited additional peaks in the humic like fluorescence region from 260 to 310 nm ex and 405 nm em except for pp the humic like fluorescence was more pronounced for the uv irradiated samples suggesting that the fluorescence might be associated with photo induced structures figs 2d and f for example the humic like peak intensity at 295 405 nm ex em was higher for the eps dom obtained under uv irradiation 0 037 r u compared to that in the dark 0 011 r u in contrast the phenol protein like peak at 250 309 nm ex em showed a lower intensity for the irradiated mp dom than the dark treated counterparts e g 0 070 versus 0 001 r u for eps dom which can be attributed to photolytic degradation the photo labile property of protein like fluorophores has been previously reported for aquatic nom phong and hur 2015 changes in the eem spectra upon the addition of copper were compared for three different plastic types under dark and uv irradiation conditions fig 2a f versus 2g to 2l fluorescence quenching by copper addition was observed for all mp dom similarly to the nom samples which suggested that electronic structural changes occurred in mp dom via the formation of complexes with copper plaza et al 2006 however the quenching behavior was not the same for all mp dom samples indicating that the degree of quenching and the associated structures may depend upon the plastic type and the leaching conditions eem alone is not capable of characterizing the interactions of independent fluorophores with copper as the apparent eem peaks may consist of multiple fluorescent components thus it is necessary to track fluorescence quenching of independent fluorescent components identified from eem parafac 3 2 copper binding characteristics of different fluorescent components 3 2 1 fluorescent components identified by parafac modeling the parafac modeling revealed that the three component model best describes the copper inducing variations in the fluorescence features of the mp dom samples with the core consistency of 95 3 fig 3 and table s3 component 1 c1 peaked at 265 325 463 nm ex em components 2 c2 and 3 c3 exhibited maxima at 250 325 324 nm ex em and 295 250 411 nm ex em respectively the peak locations of c2 and c3 were consistent with those of the previous eem spectra of the mp dom under dark and uv irradiation conditions these fluorescent components are analogous to those typically found in natural aquatic systems brogi et al 2020 kothawala et al 2014 as well as those obtained from the leaching of plastic materials lee et al 2020b table s3 c1 can be assigned to a terrestrial humic like component which roughly represents the fluorescence feature of the nom materials used in this study 3 2 2 fluorescence quenching behavior of different fluorescent components the quenching trend of each fdom component upon the addition of copper is shown in fig s3 for the same plastic type the quenching curves differed greatly depending on the fdom component the plastic types i e pp pvc and eps and the leaching conditions i e dark and uv irradiation in the dark treated mp dom the two plastic derived components c2 and c3 showed obvious fluorescence quenching upon the addition of copper while negligible quenching was observed for c1 fig s3 even the same fdom component showed different degrees of fluorescence quenching depending on the plastic type fig s3 for example for the dark treated mp dom the extent of quenching in phenol protein like c2 reached a reduction of up to 48 6 3 6 for eps and 48 3 2 7 for pvc while it was only 28 5 1 2 for pp however the extent of quenching of the pp dom in which no humic like fluorescence peak was shown was more pronounced under uv irradiation versus dark conditions reduction of up to 68 9 2 7 for c2 the metal addition induced quenching for the phenol protein like component in dom has been previously reported in many studies hu et al 2017 hur and lee 2011 this result strongly implies that the phenol protein like component contains structures that are actively involved in copper binding irrespective of the plastic type on the other hand the extent of quenching in the plastic derived humic component c3 was more pronounced for the pvc dom and eps dom under uv irradiation than under dark conditions eps dom 69 2 7 8 under uv irradiation versus 61 0 1 4 in the dark pvc dom 67 7 0 1 versus 54 4 4 3 fig s3 the greater extent of fluorescence quenching of the humic like component in the irradiated mp dom may be associated with the presence of more acidic functional groups in the mp dom obtained under uv irradiation than under dark conditions this explanation is supported by a previous study that used mass spectroscopy in which oxygen containing groups such as carboxylate were detected in the leached solution from uv irradiated plastics gewert et al 2018 in the same context previous studies using nom have shown that aromatic structures and acidic functional groups are responsible for strong copper binding plaza et al 2006 slight increase and or fluctuation of some components in the quenching curves fig s3 can be ascribed to the changes of quantum yields as a result of structural modification of fluorescent molecules caused by high levels of copper yamashita and jaffé 2008 nom samples i e srfa and esha showed clear fluorescence quenching in c1 but negligible quenching in c2 and c3 the maximum extent of c1 quenching was 44 7 0 6 for srfa and 83 7 0 4 for esha interestingly c2 was clearly quenched by copper addition to mp dom but not for the nom samples this result suggests that the c2 component may have completely different structures between mp dom and nom in terms of copper binding even though it has identical spectral features 3 2 3 comparison of copper binding parameters for different fluorescent components to explore differences in the binding properties of different fluorescent components and different mp dom samples the copper binding parameters were calculated using the best fit of the modified stern volmer equation based on the fmax values of the individual components exhibiting quenching behaviors table 1 and fig 4 the fluorescent components included in the model fittings were c1 from srfa and esha c2 in the mp dom samples from pp pvc eps in the dark and pp obtained under uv irradiation and c3 from eps dom and pvc dom obtained under both dark and uv irradiation conditions the results for the copper binding parameter of the fluorescent components are listed in table 1 with statistical significance p 0 01 a range of binding constants or stability constants was observed for the same fluorescent component among the different mp dom samples table 1 for example the log km values of the c2 component in the dark treated mp dom samples ranged from 1 05 0 01 to 3 09 0 08 with variations depending on the plastic type independent of the plastic type and the fluorescent component the uv irradiated mp dom exhibited higher stability constants than the dark treated counterparts as shown by the log km values of c3 ranging from 4 82 0 72 to 5 36 0 77 for the former versus from 1 97 0 03 to 3 60 0 05 for the latter table 1 for the pp dom the log km values of c2 were 4 08 0 25 and 2 62 0 09 for uv irradiation and dark conditions respectively this result can be ascribed to the previous observation regarding the presence of oxygen containing functional groups in irradiated mp dom interestingly the calculated stability constants of the c3 component in the mp dom samples were comparable to or even greater than those of similar fluorescence peaks previously reported for aquatic terrestrial nom ranging from 3 97 to 5 39 hur and lee 2011 lee and hur 2017 xu et al 2013a 2013b for the nom samples in the present study the humic like component c1 exhibited significant model parameters and the stability constants were similar to those of c3 in the irradiated mp dom table 1 these results suggest that dissolved organic substances from the photochemical breakdown of plastics can interact with metals strongly enough to alter the fate and transport of metals in natural and engineered systems which can be comparable to the effect of nom on metal transport in contrast to the stability constants there was no consistent trend of the f values between the irradiated and the dark treated samples table 1 however the photo induced humic like component c3 exhibited lower f values compared to phenol protein like c2 for both eps and pvc dom the results suggested that the fraction of the participating binding sites might be more affected by variations in fdom components than the leaching conditions for mp dom in fact interaction of metals with the surface of mp particles has also been studied in recent years guan et al 2020 turner and holmes 2015 in the studies it was found that biofilm development on mp surfaces could enhance the metal adsorption via alteration of the physical and chemical properties of the mps surfaces in a way to enrich carboxyl amino and phenyl oh groups guan et al 2020 however regardless of the biofilm formation mp particles exhibited a much lower adsorption tendency than natural particles such as suspended sediment guan et al 2020 the result of the previous study is in stark contrast to the comparable copper binding affinity of mp dom especially irradiated mp dom to those of nom in this study table 1 3 3 change in ftir spectra with copper addition 2d coir analysis to obtain further information regarding the sequential changes in the functional groups of mp dom with the addition of copper 2d cos was performed with a series of ftir spectra obtained with varying amounts of added copper to examine the effect of the leaching conditions on changes in the ftir spectra the 2d cos was explored only for pvc and eps dom regardless of the plastic type and the leaching conditions all ftir peaks identified in the original mp dom samples were observed after the addition of copper with varying intensities the spectral changes on copper addition are presented in fig s4 the extent of changes in the peak intensities differed depending on the peak locations and sample types fig s4 on the diagonal lines of the synchronous maps figs 5 a d several distinctive peaks were observed including peaks a c d and f for the dark treated pvc dom peaks d f and i for the dark treated eps dom peaks a b f and g for the irradiated pvc dom and peaks b c d and i for the irradiated eps dom the signs of the cross peaks were positive in all synchronous maps indicating that the spectral changes associated with copper binding occurred in the same direction in addition the asynchronous map revealed information concerning the sequential changes in the ftir spectra in response to increasing copper concentrations for the dark treated pvc dom two positive signed peaks were identified at the locations x axis y axis of peaks c f and d f the peak locations corresponded to the same positive region in the synchronous map figs 5e h and table s4 according to noda s rules hur and lee 2011 noda et al 2000 the features can be interpreted as the binding affinity for copper increasing of carboxylates in additives peak c bisphenol a bpa peak d ch bends peak f under the same rules the sequential changes of the dark treated eps dom occurred in the order of aromatic ch peak i aromatic ring peak f c c peak d ch2 bend peak g these results suggest that leached additives from plastic have stronger binding affinities for copper than other leached structures and that aromatic ring structures of plastics are more active in binding copper than the common plastic structures related to ch2 bend for the irradiated mp dom one positively and one negatively signed cross peaks were found in the asynchronous map of the pvc dom at the x y locations corresponding to peaks b f and a b respectively for the irradiated eps dom there was one positively signed peak at c i and two negatively signed cross peaks at b i and d i according to noda s rules the features can lead to the following sequential orders of peak b c o f ch bend a ch stretch for pvc dom and peak c c o i aromatic ch d c c b ch stretch for eps dom from the results the oxidized structures of mp dom revealed their priority in the sequence of copper binding over the additives and polymer derived substances irrespective of the plastic type the general trend of the binding preferences in different functional groups agrees with those previously reported for nom for example oxygen containing structures of nom such as carboxylic group have revealed a stronger binding affinity for copper compared to other functional groups based on the same analytic method chen et al 2015 hu et al 2019 huang et al 2018 furthermore from the perspective of the environmental reactivity of mp dom it is worth noting a recent study demonstrated stronger interaction of oxidized structures in irradiated mp dom with mineral surfaces which was also revealed by utilizing 2d cos based on ftir spectra lee and hur 2020 3 4 environmental implications and future studies this study demonstrated the capability of plastic derived dom to bind copper via the fqm a range of binding constants were found among the different fluorescent components identified within the bulk mp dom samples 2d cos combined with ftir spectra provided further insights into the heterogeneous distribution of copper binding sites within bulk mp dom as well as the sequence in sites with higher affinity considering the massive production of plastics that might result in a substantial amount of mp dom released into natural ecosystems this information is essential for understanding the fate and transport of metals in mp polluted environments the environmental fate of metals might be altered by interacting with the previously overlooked mp dom under such circumstances and the information on metal binding with nom alone may be misleading to fully understand the fate and transport of metals in such environments for example there might be competition between nom and mp dom for binding metals in mp polluted environments as this study used copper as a model metal further metal binding experiments using other trace metals are recommended to extend and generalize the findings of this work the extent of the interaction can be strongly affected by several factors such as leaching conditions plastic types and amounts of additives contained in mps the presented results demonstrated that the interactions between copper and plastic derived dom especially irradiated mp dom could be as strong as those with nom thus a tool to distinguish between naturally occurring and plastic derived dom in natural environments is required to properly identify the environmental impacts e g interactions with metals of plastic derived dom because of its similar environmental behavior as nom for example although the c3 revealed a distinctive for the mp dom produced under uv irradiation in this study this fluorescence feature overlapped with those from common aquatic nom hampering the clear distinction of dom with mp origins from those that originate naturally 4 conclusions this is the first report to demonstrate the metal binding ability of plastic derived dom the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 this study demonstrated the interactions between plastic derived dom and copper via the fqm the eem parafac identified two specific fluorescent components from mp dom leached under dark and uv irradiation conditions the two plastic derived components phenol protein like c2 and photo induced humic like c3 showed clear fluorescence quenching behaviors with increasing copper concentrations 2 mp dom exhibited a high binding affinity towards copper for eps and pvc plastics the stability constants or log km were higher for the uv irradiated than the dark treated mp dom the results highlight the impact of the leaching conditions on the metal binding behavior of mp dom 3 2d cos combined with ftir revealed preferential binding affinities for copper among different functional groups in mp dom additives and aromatic ring structures in mp dom interacted with copper more strongly than polymer associated structures in the dark treated mp dom whereas oxygen containing functional groups were found to be the most preferred structures for copper binding among all the structures identified from the ftir of the uv irradiated mp dom 4 the estimated binding constants of mp dom were comparable to those of the aquatic terrestrial nom this finding implies that the interaction of plastic derived dom with trace metals should be taken into account to fully understand the fate and consequences of metals in mp polluted environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

17307,microbe mediated transformation of dissolved organic matter dom contributes substantially to the carbon dynamics and energy flow of aquatic ecosystems yet the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities in response to diverse dom sources are scarcely known here we supplied four distinct sources of dom algae derived macrophyte derived sewage derived and soil derived to the same bacterial community to track the effects of these dom sources on the carbon processing and successional dynamics of bacterial communities although by the end of the incubation the proportion of bio degraded dom was significantly lower in the soil derived dom treatment than for the other sources rapid initial metabolism of protein like and aliphatic compounds and increasing aromaticity and humification degree of dom during the incubation period were observed for all sources the role of stochastic processes in governing the community assembly decreased substantially from 61 4 on the first day to 16 7 at the end of the incubation moreover stronger deterministic selection and lower temporal turnover rate were observed for the soil derived than the other dom sources indicating stronger environmental filtering by the more aromatic dom significant correlations were also observed between the humification index hix of dom and bacterial community diversities co occurrence patterns habitat niche breadths and the contribution of deterministic ecological processes in addition we demonstrated that taxa with different abundance patterns all play crucial but different roles in the response to dom variation our results indicate the importance of dom aromaticity as a predictor of the outcome of different dom sources on bacterial community dynamics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter different sources bacterial community successional dynamics ecological processes aromaticity 1 introduction microbes play crucial roles in regulating biogeochemical systems banerjee et al 2018 jiao et al 2010 the microbe mediated transformation of dissolved organic matter dom is essential to the carbon dynamics and energy flow of aquatic ecosystems lapierre et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 in terms of trophic transfer greenhouse gas emissions and water quality changes bai et al 2017 repeta et al 2016 this process is partly influenced by the physicochemical conditions in the water column such as temperature inorganic nutrient levels and ultraviolet uv radiation intensity goldberg et al 2017 perez and sommaruga 2007 but is also dependent on the inherent quality of dom showing variations in bioavailability and reactivity guillemette et al 2016 hur et al 2011 judd et al 2006 perez and sommaruga 2006 the bioavailability of dom is primarily determined by its chemical composition and molecular size berggren and del giorgio 2015 berggren et al 2010 which varies with its sources murphy et al 2008 song et al 2019 spencer et al 2014 generally dom in aquatic ecosystems comprises terrestrial dom from soil runoff allochthonous sources and autochthonous sources derived from exudates of aquatic primary producers including herbaceous plants and phytoplankton stedmon et al 2007 cyanobacteria forming blooms facilitated by lake eutrophication and climate warming can release large amounts of dom zhang et al 2009 additionally with increasing intensity of human activities dom of anthropogenic origin such as discharge of sewage and industrial effluents has also become an increasingly important contributor of dom chen and hur 2015 liu et al 2020 autochthonous dom usually enriched in protein and labile polysaccharides is considered more biolabile whereas terrestrial dom composed of more humic substances and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose is more recalcitrant to bacterial degradation guillemette et al 2016 perez and sommaruga 2006 furthermore bacterial degradation of dom in aquatic ecosystems occurs along a reactivity continuum asmala et al 2018 where the most biolabile fractions are consumed first followed by the semi labile fractions while the recalcitrant pools are persistent in aquatic ecosystems bai et al 2017 for instance several studies found that a portion of riverine terrestrial dom is biolabile in the short term being degraded within estuaries before it reaches off shore waters sipler et al 2017 therefore the interactions between dom and bacterial communities may depend on the time scale of the biogeochemical reactions in the receiving aquatic ecosystems however despite intensive studies examining the association between bacterial communities and dom composition amaral et al 2016 melo et al 2020 osterholz et al 2016 little is known about how dom sources affect microbial successional dynamics at different states of degradation disentangling the mechanisms underlying the temporal dynamics of ecological communities is a central topic in community ecology and is also critical for the prediction of the responses of biodiversity ecological functions and services to environmental changes dini andreote et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 it is generally accepted that the assembly of the microbial community is driven by both deterministic niche related theory and stochastic processes including diversification selection dispersal and ecological drift guo et al 2018 zhou and ning 2017 thus in the context of successional trajectories knowledge about the linkages between the relative importance of different ecological processes and the changes in dom composition is required moreover bacterial species of different abundance patterns i e abundant and rare species may react differently to environmental changes and contribute unevenly to community variations jiao et al 2017 liang et al 2020 specifically rare species have been considered to be substantial contributors to the temporal variability of community structures lynch and neufeld 2015 the roles of abundant and rare species in response to different sources of dom however need to be further elucidated to fully understand the temporal dynamics of bacterial community assembly we supplied four distinct sources of dom algae derived macrophyte derived sewage derived and soil derived to the same microbial community to track the effects of dom sources on the carbon processing and successional dynamics of bacterial communities dom chemical composition using optical and molecular measurements bacterial abundance and community composition using high throughput sequencing were characterized during the incubations the objectives were to 1 explore the temporal patterns of bacterial degradation of dom from different sources 2 examine the divergences of the bacterial communities including abundant and rare subcommunities fed by distinct dom sources at different stages of degradation 3 reveal how differences in dom composition cause shifts in the ecological processes underlying the community assembly we hypothesized that dom source induced environmental filtering imposed to bacterial communities increases as succession proceeds due to decreasing resource bioavailability being faster for the more aromatic dom sources 2 material and methods 2 1 collection of dom sources and experimental set up information about the collection of solutions from four sources algae macrophyte sewage and soil

using milli q water for the preparation of the inoculum bacterial abundances of the gf d filtrates of the four dom source solutions were firstly accessed by flow cytometry the four gf d filtrates were then mixed following a 1 1 1 1 ratio of bacterial abundances to cover the species pool degrading the four sources of dom the inoculum was finally concentrated to 5 107 cells ml the experiment was conducted in october 2018 in which the same inoculum was exposed to four different media derived artificially from the dom sources each medium was distributed among two sets of 100 ml brown glass

lozupone and knight 2005 and visualized using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds two way analysis of variance two way anova together with tukey s post hoc test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance with adonis function were performed to examine differences in alpha diversity and community composition among experimental treatments and over time the temporal turnover rate of

similarities and logarithmic temporal distance using the following equation ln s s constant w ln t where s s is the pairwise similarity in the community t is the time interval and w is a measure of the rate of species turnover liang et al 2020 similarity percentage simper analysis was performed to assess which subcommunity primarily contributed to the community dissimilarity over time using the

legendre 2009 habitat niche breadth was estimated as the average of levins niche breadth values of all members occurring in one community where lower values were expected to indicate metabolically

off between more deterministic 50 and more stochastic 50 assemblies using the nst package in r we calculated tnst for different groups of samples classified according to incubation time and dom sources accordingly bray curtis based raup crick rcbray metrics acting as a supplement to examine whether communities were stochastically or deterministically assembled chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2013 were also obtained using this package partial mantel tests were performed to examine the linkage between raup crick rcbray metrics with changes in incubation time and hix of dom 2 9 other statistical analyses principal component analysis pca was conducted based on the parameters related to the dom optical and molecular compositions to examine the temporal changes in dom composition spearman rank correlation analysis was also performed on the relative abundance of specific taxa and assigned formulae identified by ft icr ms to explore the coherence between bacterial species and dom molecular signatures all mentioned statistical analyses were carried out using r v3 6 3 3 results 3 1 variations of dom characteristics and bacterial abundance during the first day of incubation

0 01 mg l and 23 6 1 3 from initial 15 3 0 2 mg l respectively followed by relatively slow processing fig 1 a doc concentrations in the corresponding control samples were relatively stable and experienced a decline after 7 days likely due to colonization of residual or atmospheric bacteria accordingly within one day bacterial abundances increased by more than 50 in the algae and macrophyte derived dom treatments and 75 in sewage derived dom treatments from initially 1 106 cells ml and approximately 25 in the soil derived dom treatment fig 1b bacterial abundances in the four treatments declined subsequently from day 2 to day 7 and reached a relatively stationary phase after day 7 fig 1b for all treatments the humification index hix increased after incubation most pronouncedly for the soil derived dom treatment fig 1c additionally the spectral slope s 275 295 decreased substantially for the treatments with algae macrophyte and sewage derived dom fig s2 showing an increasing dom

associated with predominately terrestrial sources shutova et al 2014 the component c2 shares spectral properties common to microbial humic like substances cawley et al 2012 the components c3 and c5 include tryptophan like fluorophores stedmon and markager 2005 and the components c4 and c6 represent tyrosine like fluorophores murphy et al 2011 in the beginning of the experiment the protein like components c3 c6 were predominant in the algae macrophyte and sewage samples and the humic like components c1 c2 dominated the soil sample fig 1 fig s3 in all treatments the protein like components experienced a notable decline during the experiment in comparison to the controls most conspicuously during the first day as for molecular composition the number of assigned molecules for the soil derived dom was notably higher than the other sources table s1 notable decreases of the abundance weighted proportions of formulae categorized as sugar like compounds peptides and aliphatics as well as increasing proportions of polycyclic and condensed aromatic polyphenolic and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds at the end of the experiment were observed for all four treatments table s1 fig 2 a in the pca analysis all four treatments tended to become more aromatic over time with decreasing pc1 scores and the dom compositions of the bio degraded samples of the algae macrophyte and sewage sources became more similar to the soil derived dom composition table s1 fig 2a 3 2 successions of bacterial community composition and alpha diversity the subsampled dataset 29 500 reads per sample consisted of 1209 500 reads and 3049 asvs twenty two asvs 0 72 representing 36 27 of all reads were abundant taxa at and persistent in all samples 165 asvs 5 41 contributing 41 47 of all reads were conditionally rare and abundant taxa crat 2861 asvs 93 93 containing 22 13 of all reads were rare taxa rt and only one asv was moderate taxa mt at belonged to the phyla of proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria cyanobacteria chloroplast and bacteroidetes after one day of incubation gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes became the most dominant bacteria from day 1 to day 28 the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria gradually decreased while the relative abundances of alphaproteobacteria planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and actinobacteria increased fig 2b in all four experimental treatments the analyzed alpha diversities of both the whole and the rt communities decreased within one day which was followed by a sequent increase from day 1 to day 28 table s2 table s3 these differences were significant both over time and among the four different dom source treatments table s4 the effect of dom sources was primarily due to the divergence of the soil derived dom treatment tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 which exhibited the highest species richness and evenness table s2 overall from day 1 to day 28 the alpha diversities of the whole at rt and crat communities were positively related to time hix and the relative abundances of humic like components c1 c2 and molecules classified as condensed aromatic compounds and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds fig s4 additionally the number of indicators was significantly higher in the soil derived dom 241 asvs than in the algae 8 asvs macrophyte 5 asvs and sewage 25 asvs treatments 3 3 beta diversity and temporal turnover rate of bacterial communities taxonomic beta diversity of all taxa at rt and crat differed significantly over time and among the four dom source treatments fig 3 a table s5 adonis s p 0 01 specifically the nmds1 and nmds2 values of the samples during day 1 and day 28 were linearly significantly related to incubation time r2 0 81 p 0 01 and hix r2 0 48 p 0 01 n 12 3 replicates the temporal turnover rates based on taxonomic diversity were all significantly lower in the soil derived dom treatment than in the other treatments being most pronounced for the at and crat subcommunities fig 3b the dissimilarities and temporal turnover rates of bacterial communities based on phylogenetic distance were substantially lower than for taxonomic diversity fig s5 likely reflecting that the short experimental period 28 days was not sufficient to allow distinct phylogenetic differentiations moreover temporal changes in community composition were highest within the first day day 0 day 1 compared with other periods day 1 day 7 day 7 day 28 in all experimental treatments fig 3c changes in community composition during day 0 day 7 were mainly attributed to changes in the at subcommunity while the contribution of the crat subcommunity to the changes was highest during day 7 day 28 fig 3c 3 4 co occurrence networks of bacterial communities the correlation based network was composed of 622 nodes asvs and 2582 edges correlations fig 4 alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobia were the main clades in the network fig 4a some asvs belonging to the same clade tended to co occur and formed modular structures fig 4a c for instance module 2 and module 4 mainly consisted of alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria respectively fig 4a c this finding indicates that taxonomic relatedness plays a crucial role in determining network modular structure negative correlations 19 0 were mainly observed between gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes keystone taxa for maintaining the structure and function of bacterial communities were identified based on high mean degree high closeness centrality and low betweenness centrality banerjee et al 2018 the top fifteen keystone taxa belonged to alphaproteobacteria 5 crat and 3 rt gammaproteobacteria 3 at and 2 rt and bacteroidetes 2 crat and included the genera of acinetobacter reyranella and pedobacter table s6 eigengene analysis was performed to calculate eigengenes of large modules number of nodes 30 in different groups of samples fig 4d the module based eigengenes of module 2 module 4 and module 5 were only significantly different over time anova p 0 05 fig 4d suggesting that members of these modules mainly showed temporal variation however module 1 displayed significant differences over time and among the dom treatments while module based eigengenes of module 3 and module 6 were only significantly different among treatments and these differences were largely caused by the differences between the soil derived dom treatment and the other treatments on day 7 and day 28 fig 4d 3 5 associations between bacterial taxa and dom composition modules in the network may represent niche partitioning and functioning differentiation in the bacterial communities rottjers and faust 2018 we found that module 1 3 and module 6 clustered together fig s6 and overall showed positive correlations with highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and polyphenolic compounds fig 5 as well as humic like components and hix fig s4 in contrast module 4 was characterized by positive correlations with aliphatics and protein like components fig 5 fig s5 the relative abundances of identified keystone taxa were also positively related to more aromatic compounds except for the five gammaproteobacteria keystone asvs fig s7 the associations between the molecules and the relative abundances of the top five indicators of the different dom source treatments also reflected the effect of more aromatic and humic like niches related to the soil derived dom fig s7 3 6 ecological processes shaping bacterial community structures the value of tnst representing the relative importance of stochastic processes in governing taxonomic community structure decreased substantially from day 1 61 4 to day 7 40 6 and day 28 16 7 and was most pronounced in the crat subcommunities fig 6 a this coincided with the variation of raup crickbray in the whole community which had a negative value closer to zero on day 1 and positive values closer to 1 on day 7 and day 28 fig 6b these results indicate increased importance of deterministic selection in governing the taxonomic community structure and more dissimilar communities over time moreover the raup crickbray metric was significantly correlated with changes in incubation time partial mantel s correlation 0 52 p 0 001 and hix partial mantel s correlation 0 27 p 0 01 n 12 3 replicates deterministic processes dominated the assembly of the whole community in all treatments tnst 40 and the relative importance of stochastic processes was lowest in the soil derived treatment tnst 16 0 the tnst value was overall lower in the crat subcommunity compared with at and rt the values of habitat niche breadths of all taxa and rt were significantly higher on day 1 and day 7 than on day 28 and were significantly lower in the soil derived dom treatment than in the other treatments on day 7 and day 28 fig 6c tukey s post hoc test p 0 001 indicating more habitat specialists in the soil derived dom treatment on day 7 and day 28 jiao et al 2020 the habitat niche breadths of rt and crat were negatively correlated with the incubation time and the proportion of microbial humic like c2 fig s4 4 discussion our study showed that dom sources influenced the time dependent successional patterns of bacterial community diversity and composition and the influence was highly associated with aromaticity of the dom we further revealed that dom source induced deterministic selection of bacterial communities differs at different degradation stages with community assembly processes shifting from more stochastic to more deterministic processes over time finally we observed that taxa with different abundance patterns showed different reactive strategies but all contained keystone species in response to the variation of dom during the experiment 4 1 temporal patterns of bacterial degradation of dom from different sources we demonstrated that the availability of different dom sources i e the proportion of the bio consumed fraction is inherently related to dom composition specifically the abundances of protein like components sugar like molecules or aliphatics relative to humic like components and polyphenolic compounds although the overall amount of bio consumed dom differed among sources similar temporal variation patterns were observed for all dom sources during the experiment fig 1 fig 2 the greatest changes in fluorescence protein like components within the first day coincided with the greatest changes in doc concentration across all sources followed by relatively stable and slow processing fig 1 this agrees with previous incubation experiments and suggests that highly bio labile protein like sugar like and aliphatic compounds are involved in microbial metabolism and material cycles in the short term bai et al 2017 d andrilli et al 2019 guillemette et al 2013 sipler et al 2017 however the proportion of biodegradable doc in natural ecosystems can be lower than we observed since enriched dom derived from various specific sources was used in the experiment vonk et al 2015 importantly the initial structure of the bacterial community can play a crucial role in transforming dom over time logue et al 2016 therefore to examine the effect of dom sources on bacterial carbon processing and community dynamics we incubated all cultures with the same bacterial community covering the species pool degrading all four types of dom we further found that the bacterial processing of dom contributed to increasing the aromaticity and humification degree of dom across all sources fig 2 the shifts in doc concentration and dom composition over time coincided with the compositional changes in bacterial communities highly biolabile dom boosted the bacterial abundance within the first day while bacterial alpha diversity decreased due to the prevalence of gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes across all sources these members have also been reported to respond to enrichment of other types of dom such as diatom derived dom landa et al 2014 grass dom d andrilli et al 2019 and virus induced dom from picocyanobacteria zhao et al 2019 demonstrating that these types of bacteria react rapidly to biolabile dom for instance gammaproteobacteria are capable of utilizing amino acids extracellular polysacharides and proteins blanchet et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 and bacteroidetes are able to decompose hydrolytic cellulose starch polysaccharides and carbohydrate bauer et al 2006 following rapid consumption of highly biolabile dom bacterial abundances decreased close to the initial level on day 7 by contrast bacterial diversity indices increased gradually from day 1 to day 28 across all sources indicating that less bacteria but more taxa participated in degrading less biolabile and more aromatic dom molecules accordingly bacteria that are competitive under resource poor and aromatics rich conditions including alphaproteobacteria planctomycetes and actinobacteria li et al 2020 liu et al 2019 co occurred in the network fig 4 while we provide evidences for overall substrate preferences of different bacterial taxa facilitating better understanding of changes of bacterial communities in responses to resource heterogeneity and environmental changes we also acknowledge that our experiment occurred in a relatively closed environment where the changes of bacterial community composition were highly influenced by the initial inoculum considering that natural ecosystems receive species pools from other sources and systems the responses of bacterial community composition to dom is likely more complex in nature 4 2 effects of dom sources on the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities we further revealed a notably decreased stochasticity ratio with incubation time fig 6 supporting our hypothesis that the dom source induced deterministic selection of bacterial community assemblages increases as succession proceeds our results concur with macroecological theory stating that stochasticity of community assembly increases with elevated resource supply chase 2003 in our study at the early stage of degradation within the first day a fraction of dom was readily available in all treatments which reduced competitive pressures as reflected by exponential increase of the bacterial abundances and dominance of stochasticity dini andreote et al 2015 as succession proceeded the ratio of aromatic and less biolabile dom increased causing resource depletion and limitation which manifested in the deterministic selection becoming progressively more important accordingly we found substantial divergences of habitat niche breadths and bacterial co occurrence patterns between the soil derived dom treatment and the other treatments on day 7 and day 28 but not on day 1 it is noteworthy that we manipulated the physicochemical conditions e g temperature and nutrient supply in all treatments to ensure that the deterministic selection could be mainly ascribed to the effect of dom sources but in reality extreme physicochemical conditions may also alter the impact of resource properties on community assembly processes dini andreote et al 2015 the community assembly mechanisms have been thought to drive the relationships between microbial community and function curtis et al 2013 for instance increasing selection stress that drive the community assembly to a determinism stage will result in selection of efficient bacteria to handle the resources available whereas high level of stochasticity decreases the function of microbial communities by increasing the proportion of non functional taxa zhang et al 2019 our results thus imply that excessive enrichment of biolabile substrate for bacteria such as eutrophication induced algal bloom or sewage input may cause instability in the aquatic microbial ecosystem functioning though further studies are needed to elucidate this intrinsic mechanism significant differences in the direction or magnitude of the effect of dom sources were observed for bacterial diversity community composition and niche partitioning the soil derived dom treatment had the highest alpha diversity but the lowest taxonomic temporal turnover rate and habitat niche breadths as well as distinct co occurrence patterns of species groups positive correlations between bacterial richness and evenness with the number of molecules in the dom pool have been documented recently muscarella et al 2019 this may partly explain why soil derived dom had the highest bacterial alpha diversity of the four dom sources since a significantly greater number of molecules provide more niches for species finke and snyder 2008 on the other hand soil derived dom are more humic like and aromatic than algae macrophyte and sewage derived dom more recalcitrant compounds may require enzymatic activities or transport systems at varying levels of complexity and thus be more selective favoring species equipped with specific metabolic capabilities and more habitat specialists with narrow niche breadths landa et al 2014 more recalcitrant compounds can also explain the lower temporal turnover rate in the soil derived dom treatment since the bacterial community structure tends to stabilize more quickly under the pressure of stronger selection coinciding with more similar community structures on day 7 and day 28 in the soil derived dom treatment fig 3 moreover the lowest value of the stochasticity ratio occurring in the soil derived dom treatment further supports that the less bioavailable compounds with a higher aromaticity and humification degree tend to be more selective for community assemblages it is noteworthy that although the sewage derived dom is an anthropogenic source compared with the autochthonous sources derived from algae and macrophytes all of these three sources were dominated by the protein like compounds and had similar temporal turnover rates habitat niche breadths and co occurrence patterns of species suggesting a central role of dom degradability in shaping bacterial community assemblages in previous studies investigating the effect of environmental selection induced determinism on bacterial communities substrate quantity has often been in focus jiao et al 2020 and our study showed that dom quality is also of crucial importance and needs to be considered when searching for the relationships between environmental filtering and bacterial community structures correlations between dom molecules and bacterial taxa describing the coherence between bacterial species and dom molecular signatures can be used to infer bacterial metabolic preferences and transformation of dom muscarella et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 in a network species groups clustering in the same module are considered to share similar niches and perform similar functions rottjers and faust 2018 while keystone nodes are commonly considered as initiating components of networks that could drive community composition and function banerjee et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 we found that the module based eigengenes of module 1 3 and module 6 which increased over time or were the highest in the soil derived dom treatment showed strong positive correlations with more aromatic compounds fig 5 a similar correlation was also observed for the habitat specialists in the soil derived dom treatment and most keystone species except those belonging to gammaproteobacteria providing further evidence of the directional effect of increasing aromatic dom on bacterial co occurrence patterns metabolic profiles and ecosystem functioning additionally few correlations with aliphatics were detected maybe due to the rapid metabolism of these materials zhao et al 2019 4 3 different responses among bacterial taxa with different abundance patterns the time dependent successional patterns in community diversity and composition of at rt and crat were significantly affected by dom sources but different reactive strategies were also detected among taxa with different abundance patterns the prevalence of at in the experimental treatments at the early stage of dom degradation suggests that at were cosmopolitan taxa and precursors reacting rapidly to complex compounds langenheder and szekely 2011 rt represented the majority of asvs 93 9 and mainly contributed to the changes in alpha diversity especially species richness phylogenetic diversity and habitat niche breadths over the course of the experiment it is generally recognized that the rare biosphere with high species diversity has an important influence on the ability of a community to stabilize and maintain ecosystem function by acting as a functional cache or resource pool for responding to disturbance events jousset et al 2017 lynch and neufeld 2015 our study further showed that the highest proportion of all reads 41 5 belonged to few crat asvs 5 4 we also found that the contribution of the crat subcommunity to the temporal changes in community composition was highest during day 7 day 28 supporting the concept that rare species can serve as an active seed bank and pool of metabolic potential that can become dominant under favorable conditions lynch and neufeld 2015 moreover an overall lower taxonomic stochasticity ratio was observed for crat than for at and rt indicating a stronger deterministic selection imposing on members of the crat subcommunity these results and those of previous studies demonstrate that rare bacteria occasionally becoming very abundant are important contributors to the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community in response to environmental changes nyirabuhoro et al 2020 shade et al 2014 importantly the keystone species identified in the network analysis including both at rt and crat suggest that taxa with different abundance patterns all played crucial roles in responding to the variation of dom thereby emphasizing the necessity of considering variations of species with distinct abundances especially in the rare biosphere to be able to better understand bacterial community dynamics in response to environmental changes at different spatiotemporal scales moreover although rt have been generally considered to contribute little to the carbon flow due to their much lower biomass compared with that of at pedros alio 2012 our study highlights the important contribution of rare conditionally rare taxa to the carbon flow of ecosystems especially the refractory carbon 5 conclusion our results revealed that the influence of dom sources on time dependent successions of the bacterial community was highly related to aromaticity of the dom which acts as an indicator of the temporal succession of dom composition and bioavailability moreover community assembly processes shifted from high stochasticity to high determinism as succession proceeded indicating that deterministic selection was induced by more aromatic dom we thus propose that dom aromaticity can be an efficient predictor in comparisons of the selective strength of dom sources composition on bacterial community dynamics in addition we demonstrated that taxa with different abundance patterns all play crucial but different roles in the response to dom variation and emphasized the importance of rare bacteria under refractory dom conditions our findings expand the knowledge of the interactions between microbes and dom from the perspective of temporal dynamics considering the complexity of nature environments the responses of microbial community structures and metabolic profiles to mixtures of different dom sources need to be further explored declaration of competing

17307,microbe mediated transformation of dissolved organic matter dom contributes substantially to the carbon dynamics and energy flow of aquatic ecosystems yet the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities in response to diverse dom sources are scarcely known here we supplied four distinct sources of dom algae derived macrophyte derived sewage derived and soil derived to the same bacterial community to track the effects of these dom sources on the carbon processing and successional dynamics of bacterial communities although by the end of the incubation the proportion of bio degraded dom was significantly lower in the soil derived dom treatment than for the other sources rapid initial metabolism of protein like and aliphatic compounds and increasing aromaticity and humification degree of dom during the incubation period were observed for all sources the role of stochastic processes in governing the community assembly decreased substantially from 61 4 on the first day to 16 7 at the end of the incubation moreover stronger deterministic selection and lower temporal turnover rate were observed for the soil derived than the other dom sources indicating stronger environmental filtering by the more aromatic dom significant correlations were also observed between the humification index hix of dom and bacterial community diversities co occurrence patterns habitat niche breadths and the contribution of deterministic ecological processes in addition we demonstrated that taxa with different abundance patterns all play crucial but different roles in the response to dom variation our results indicate the importance of dom aromaticity as a predictor of the outcome of different dom sources on bacterial community dynamics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter different sources bacterial community successional dynamics ecological processes aromaticity 1 introduction microbes play crucial roles in regulating biogeochemical systems banerjee et al 2018 jiao et al 2010 the microbe mediated transformation of dissolved organic matter dom is essential to the carbon dynamics and energy flow of aquatic ecosystems lapierre et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 in terms of trophic transfer greenhouse gas emissions and water quality changes bai et al 2017 repeta et al 2016 this process is partly influenced by the physicochemical conditions in the water column such as temperature inorganic nutrient levels and ultraviolet uv radiation intensity goldberg et al 2017 perez and sommaruga 2007 but is also dependent on the inherent quality of dom showing variations in bioavailability and reactivity guillemette et al 2016 hur et al 2011 judd et al 2006 perez and sommaruga 2006 the bioavailability of dom is primarily determined by its chemical composition and molecular size berggren and del giorgio 2015 berggren et al 2010 which varies with its sources murphy et al 2008 song et al 2019 spencer et al 2014 generally dom in aquatic ecosystems comprises terrestrial dom from soil runoff allochthonous sources and autochthonous sources derived from exudates of aquatic primary producers including herbaceous plants and phytoplankton stedmon et al 2007 cyanobacteria forming blooms facilitated by lake eutrophication and climate warming can release large amounts of dom zhang et al 2009 additionally with increasing intensity of human activities dom of anthropogenic origin such as discharge of sewage and industrial effluents has also become an increasingly important contributor of dom chen and hur 2015 liu et al 2020 autochthonous dom usually enriched in protein and labile polysaccharides is considered more biolabile whereas terrestrial dom composed of more humic substances and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose is more recalcitrant to bacterial degradation guillemette et al 2016 perez and sommaruga 2006 furthermore bacterial degradation of dom in aquatic ecosystems occurs along a reactivity continuum asmala et al 2018 where the most biolabile fractions are consumed first followed by the semi labile fractions while the recalcitrant pools are persistent in aquatic ecosystems bai et al 2017 for instance several studies found that a portion of riverine terrestrial dom is biolabile in the short term being degraded within estuaries before it reaches off shore waters sipler et al 2017 therefore the interactions between dom and bacterial communities may depend on the time scale of the biogeochemical reactions in the receiving aquatic ecosystems however despite intensive studies examining the association between bacterial communities and dom composition amaral et al 2016 melo et al 2020 osterholz et al 2016 little is known about how dom sources affect microbial successional dynamics at different states of degradation disentangling the mechanisms underlying the temporal dynamics of ecological communities is a central topic in community ecology and is also critical for the prediction of the responses of biodiversity ecological functions and services to environmental changes dini andreote et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 it is generally accepted that the assembly of the microbial community is driven by both deterministic niche related theory and stochastic processes including diversification selection dispersal and ecological drift guo et al 2018 zhou and ning 2017 thus in the context of successional trajectories knowledge about the linkages between the relative importance of different ecological processes and the changes in dom composition is required moreover bacterial species of different abundance patterns i e abundant and rare species may react differently to environmental changes and contribute unevenly to community variations jiao et al 2017 liang et al 2020 specifically rare species have been considered to be substantial contributors to the temporal variability of community structures lynch and neufeld 2015 the roles of abundant and rare species in response to different sources of dom however need to be further elucidated to fully understand the temporal dynamics of bacterial community assembly we supplied four distinct sources of dom algae derived macrophyte derived sewage derived and soil derived to the same microbial community to track the effects of dom sources on the carbon processing and successional dynamics of bacterial communities dom chemical composition using optical and molecular measurements bacterial abundance and community composition using high throughput sequencing were characterized during the incubations the objectives were to 1 explore the temporal patterns of bacterial degradation of dom from different sources 2 examine the divergences of the bacterial communities including abundant and rare subcommunities fed by distinct dom sources at different stages of degradation 3 reveal how differences in dom composition cause shifts in the ecological processes underlying the community assembly we hypothesized that dom source induced environmental filtering imposed to bacterial communities increases as succession proceeds due to decreasing resource bioavailability being faster for the more aromatic dom sources 2 material and methods 2 1 collection of dom sources and experimental set up information about the collection of solutions from four sources algae macrophyte sewage and soil derived is provided in the supplementary material solutions were subjected to stepwise filtration in filters with a pore size ranging from 150 to 50 nylon net down to 2 7 whatman gf d and 0 22 μm millipore membrane the media were prepared from the 0 22 μm filtrates of the four sources by diluting them to 15 mg dissolved organic carbon doc per liter to sufficiently track temporal changes in dom using milli q water for the preparation of the inoculum bacterial abundances of the gf d filtrates of the four dom source solutions were firstly accessed by flow cytometry the four gf d filtrates were then mixed following a 1 1 1 1 ratio of bacterial abundances to cover the species pool degrading the four sources of dom the inoculum was finally concentrated to 5 107 cells ml the experiment was conducted in october 2018 in which the same inoculum was exposed to four different media derived artificially from the dom sources each medium was distributed among two sets of 100 ml brown glass bottles one set of bottles only received 100 ml medium and served as control of dom biodegradation the other set of bottles received 100 ml medium and 2 ml inoculum final concentration 1 106 cells ml

lozupone and knight 2005 and visualized using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds two way analysis of variance two way anova together with tukey s post hoc test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance with adonis function were performed to examine differences in alpha diversity and community composition among experimental treatments and over time the temporal turnover rate of

constructed by calculating pairwise spearman rank correlations spearman s rho asvs were selected by occurrence frequency in all samples 20 to simplify the dataset valid co occurrences with rho 0 7 and adjusted p value 0 05 were incorporated into networks network properties calculation module detection and visualization were conducted using the interactive platform gephi webatlas paris france eigengene analysis langfelder and horvath 2007 is a useful tool to study the links between modules a highly interacted group of asvs and dom related parameters for network modules eigengene values of modules were calculated using the wgcna r package langfelder and horvath 2008 to reveal how bacterial members of each module associated with dom molecular composition spearman s rho was calculated between module based eigengenes and the relative abundances of individual molecular formulae with occurrence frequency 30 of all 12 samples 10 007 formulae drake et al 2019 kellerman et al 2014 since no replicates were measured for ft icr ms module based eigengenes were calculated as the mean values of three replicates spearman s rho was then visualized in a heatmap and a van krevelen diagram kim et al 2003 for each module and only formulae with spearman s rho 0 4 were presented in the van krevelen diagram to simply the plot 2 8 null model analysis the taxonomic normalized stochasticity ratio tnst developed by ning et al 2019 was calculated based on bray curtis distance and used to estimate the ecological stochasticity i e the relative importance of stochastic processes with 50 as the cut off between more deterministic 50 and more stochastic 50 assemblies using the nst package in r we calculated tnst for different groups of samples classified according to incubation time and dom sources accordingly bray curtis based raup crick rcbray metrics acting as a supplement to examine whether communities were stochastically or deterministically assembled chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2013 were also obtained using this package partial mantel tests were performed to examine the linkage between raup crick rcbray metrics with changes in incubation time and hix of dom 2 9 other statistical analyses principal component analysis pca was conducted based on the parameters related to the dom optical and molecular compositions to examine the temporal changes in dom composition spearman rank correlation analysis was also performed on the relative abundance of specific taxa and assigned formulae identified by ft icr ms to explore the coherence between bacterial species and dom molecular signatures all mentioned statistical analyses were carried out using r v3 6 3 3 results 3 1 variations of dom characteristics and bacterial abundance during the first day of incubation doc concentrations in the treatments with algae macrophyte sewage and soil derived dom decreased by 78 4 1 6 from initial 12 6 0 5 mg l 91 3 0 5 from initial 17 3 0 04 mg l 72 9 1 0 from initial 21 8 0 01 mg l and 23 6 1 3 from initial 15 3 0 2 mg l respectively followed by relatively slow processing fig 1 a doc concentrations in the corresponding control samples were relatively stable and experienced a decline after 7 days likely due to colonization of residual or atmospheric bacteria accordingly within one day bacterial abundances increased by more than 50 in the algae and macrophyte derived dom treatments and 75 in sewage derived dom treatments from initially 1 106 cells ml and approximately 25 in the soil derived dom treatment fig 1b bacterial abundances in the four treatments declined subsequently from day 2 to day 7 and reached a relatively stationary phase after day 7 fig 1b for all treatments the humification index hix increased after incubation most pronouncedly for the soil derived dom treatment fig 1c additionally the spectral slope s 275 295 decreased substantially for the treatments with algae macrophyte and sewage derived dom fig s2 showing an increasing dom molecular weight parafac analysis identified six fluorescent components fig s1 according to published models in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 the component c1 is humic like dom which is associated with predominately terrestrial sources shutova et al 2014 the component c2 shares spectral properties common to microbial humic like substances cawley et al 2012 the components c3 and c5 include tryptophan like fluorophores stedmon and markager 2005 and the components c4 and c6 represent tyrosine like fluorophores murphy et al 2011 in the beginning of the experiment the protein like components c3 c6 were predominant in the algae macrophyte and sewage samples and the humic like components c1 c2 dominated the soil sample fig 1 fig s3 in all treatments the protein like components experienced a notable decline during the experiment in comparison to the controls most conspicuously during the first day as for molecular composition the number of assigned molecules for the soil derived dom was notably higher than the other sources table s1 notable decreases of the abundance weighted proportions of formulae categorized as sugar like compounds peptides and aliphatics as well as increasing proportions of polycyclic and condensed aromatic polyphenolic and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds at the end of the experiment were observed for all four treatments table s1 fig 2 a in the pca analysis all four treatments tended to become more aromatic over time with decreasing pc1 scores and the dom compositions of the bio degraded samples of the algae macrophyte and sewage sources became more similar to the soil derived dom composition table s1 fig 2a 3 2 successions of bacterial community composition and alpha diversity the subsampled dataset 29 500 reads per sample consisted of 1209 500 reads and 3049 asvs twenty two asvs 0 72 representing 36 27 of all reads were abundant taxa at and persistent in all samples 165 asvs 5 41 contributing 41 47 of all reads were conditionally rare and abundant taxa crat 2861 asvs 93 93 containing 22 13 of all reads were rare taxa rt and only one asv was moderate taxa mt at belonged to the phyla of proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria cyanobacteria chloroplast and bacteroidetes after one day of incubation gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes became the most dominant bacteria from day 1 to day 28 the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria gradually decreased while the relative abundances of alphaproteobacteria planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and actinobacteria increased fig 2b in all four experimental treatments the analyzed alpha diversities of both the whole and the rt communities decreased within one day which was followed by a sequent increase from day 1 to day 28 table s2 table s3 these differences were significant both over time and among the four different dom source treatments table s4 the effect of dom sources was primarily due to the divergence of the soil derived dom treatment tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 which exhibited the highest species richness and evenness table s2 overall from day 1 to day 28 the alpha diversities of the whole at rt and crat communities were positively related to time hix and the relative abundances of humic like components c1 c2 and molecules classified as condensed aromatic compounds and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds fig s4 additionally the number of indicators was significantly higher in the soil derived dom 241 asvs than in the algae 8 asvs macrophyte 5 asvs and sewage 25 asvs treatments 3 3 beta diversity and temporal turnover rate of bacterial communities taxonomic beta diversity of all taxa at rt and crat differed significantly over time and among the four dom source treatments fig 3 a table s5 adonis s p 0 01 specifically the nmds1 and nmds2 values of the samples during day 1 and day 28 were linearly significantly related to incubation time r2 0 81 p 0 01 and hix r2 0 48 p 0 01 n 12 3 replicates the temporal turnover rates based on taxonomic diversity were all significantly lower in the soil derived dom treatment than in the other treatments being most pronounced for the at and crat subcommunities fig 3b the dissimilarities and temporal turnover rates of bacterial communities based on phylogenetic distance were substantially lower than for taxonomic diversity fig s5 likely reflecting that the short experimental period 28 days was not sufficient to allow distinct phylogenetic differentiations moreover temporal changes in community composition were highest within the first day day 0 day 1 compared with other periods day 1 day 7 day 7 day 28 in all experimental treatments fig 3c changes in community composition during day 0 day 7 were mainly attributed to changes in the at subcommunity while the contribution of the crat subcommunity to the changes was highest during day 7 day 28 fig 3c 3 4 co occurrence networks of bacterial communities the correlation based network was composed of 622 nodes asvs and 2582 edges correlations fig 4 alphaproteobacteria bacteroidetes gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobia were the main clades in the network fig 4a some asvs belonging to the same clade tended to co occur and formed modular structures fig 4a c for instance module 2 and module 4 mainly consisted of alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria respectively fig 4a c this finding indicates that taxonomic relatedness plays a crucial role in determining network modular structure negative correlations 19 0 were mainly observed between gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes keystone taxa for maintaining the structure and function of bacterial communities were identified based on high mean degree high closeness centrality and low betweenness centrality banerjee et al 2018 the top fifteen keystone taxa belonged to alphaproteobacteria 5 crat and 3 rt gammaproteobacteria 3 at and 2 rt and bacteroidetes 2 crat and included the genera of acinetobacter reyranella and pedobacter table s6 eigengene analysis was performed to calculate eigengenes of large modules number of nodes 30 in different groups of samples fig 4d the module based eigengenes of module 2 module 4 and module 5 were only significantly different over time anova p 0 05 fig 4d suggesting that members of these modules mainly showed temporal variation however module 1 displayed significant differences over time and among the dom treatments while module based eigengenes of module 3 and module 6 were only significantly different among treatments and these differences were largely caused by the differences between the soil derived dom treatment and the other treatments on day 7 and day 28 fig 4d 3 5 associations between bacterial taxa and dom composition modules in the network may represent niche partitioning and functioning differentiation in the bacterial communities rottjers and faust 2018 we found that module 1 3 and module 6 clustered together fig s6 and overall showed positive correlations with highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and polyphenolic compounds fig 5 as well as humic like components and hix fig s4 in contrast module 4 was characterized by positive correlations with aliphatics and protein like components fig 5 fig s5 the relative abundances of identified keystone taxa were also positively related to more aromatic compounds except for the five gammaproteobacteria keystone asvs fig s7 the associations between the molecules and the relative abundances of the top five indicators of the different dom source treatments also reflected the effect of more aromatic and humic like niches related to the soil derived dom fig s7 3 6 ecological processes shaping bacterial community structures the value of tnst representing the relative importance of stochastic processes in governing taxonomic community structure decreased substantially from day 1 61 4 to day 7 40 6 and day 28 16 7 and was most pronounced in the crat subcommunities fig 6 a this coincided with the variation of raup crickbray in the whole community which had a negative value closer to zero on day 1 and positive values closer to 1 on day 7 and day 28 fig 6b these results indicate increased importance of deterministic selection in governing the taxonomic community structure and more dissimilar communities over time moreover the raup crickbray metric was significantly correlated with changes in incubation time partial mantel s correlation 0 52 p 0 001 and hix partial mantel s correlation 0 27 p 0 01 n 12 3 replicates deterministic processes dominated the assembly of the whole community in all treatments tnst 40 and the relative importance of stochastic processes was lowest in the soil derived treatment tnst 16 0 the tnst value was overall lower in the crat subcommunity compared with at and rt the values of habitat niche breadths of all taxa and rt were significantly higher on day 1 and day 7 than on day 28 and were significantly lower in the soil derived dom treatment than in the other treatments on day 7 and day 28 fig 6c tukey s post hoc test p 0 001 indicating more habitat specialists in the soil derived dom treatment on day 7 and day 28 jiao et al 2020 the habitat niche breadths of rt and crat were negatively correlated with the incubation time and the proportion of microbial humic like c2 fig s4 4 discussion our study showed that dom sources influenced the time dependent successional patterns of bacterial community diversity and composition and the influence was highly associated with aromaticity of the dom we further revealed that dom source induced deterministic selection of bacterial communities differs at different degradation stages with community assembly processes shifting from more stochastic to more deterministic processes over time finally we observed that taxa with different abundance patterns showed different reactive strategies but all contained keystone species in response to the variation of dom during the experiment 4 1 temporal patterns of bacterial degradation of dom from different sources we demonstrated that the availability of different dom sources i e the proportion of the bio consumed fraction is inherently related to dom composition specifically the abundances of protein like components sugar like molecules or aliphatics relative to humic like components and polyphenolic compounds although the overall amount of bio consumed dom differed among sources similar temporal variation patterns were observed for all dom sources during the experiment fig 1 fig 2 the greatest changes in fluorescence protein like components within the first day coincided with the greatest changes in doc concentration across all sources followed by relatively stable and slow processing fig 1 this agrees with previous incubation experiments and suggests that highly bio labile protein like sugar like and aliphatic compounds are involved in microbial metabolism and material cycles in the short term bai et al 2017 d andrilli et al 2019 guillemette et al 2013 sipler et al 2017 however the proportion of biodegradable doc in natural ecosystems can be lower than we observed since enriched dom derived from various specific sources was used in the experiment vonk et al 2015 importantly the initial structure of the bacterial community can play a crucial role in transforming dom over time logue et al 2016 therefore to examine the effect of dom sources on bacterial carbon processing and community dynamics we incubated all cultures with the same bacterial community covering the species pool degrading all four types of dom we further found that the bacterial processing of dom contributed to increasing the aromaticity and humification degree of dom across all sources fig 2 the shifts in doc concentration and dom composition over time coincided with the compositional changes in bacterial communities highly biolabile dom boosted the bacterial abundance within the first day while bacterial alpha diversity decreased due to the prevalence of gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes across all sources these members have also been reported to respond to enrichment of other types of dom such as diatom derived dom landa et al 2014 grass dom d andrilli et al 2019 and virus induced dom from picocyanobacteria zhao et al 2019 demonstrating that these types of bacteria react rapidly to biolabile dom for instance gammaproteobacteria are capable of utilizing amino acids extracellular polysacharides and proteins blanchet et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 and bacteroidetes are able to decompose hydrolytic cellulose starch polysaccharides and carbohydrate bauer et al 2006 following rapid consumption of highly biolabile dom bacterial abundances decreased close to the initial level on day 7 by contrast bacterial diversity indices increased gradually from day 1 to day 28 across all sources indicating that less bacteria but more taxa participated in degrading less biolabile and more aromatic dom molecules accordingly bacteria that are competitive under resource poor and aromatics rich conditions including alphaproteobacteria planctomycetes and actinobacteria li et al 2020 liu et al 2019 co occurred in the network fig 4 while we provide evidences for overall substrate preferences of different bacterial taxa facilitating better understanding of changes of bacterial communities in responses to resource heterogeneity and environmental changes we also acknowledge that our experiment occurred in a relatively closed environment where the changes of bacterial community composition were highly influenced by the initial inoculum considering that natural ecosystems receive species pools from other sources and systems the responses of bacterial community composition to dom is likely more complex in nature 4 2 effects of dom sources on the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities we further revealed a notably decreased stochasticity ratio with incubation time fig 6 supporting our hypothesis that the dom source induced deterministic selection of bacterial community assemblages increases as succession proceeds our results concur with macroecological theory stating that stochasticity of community assembly increases with elevated resource supply chase 2003 in our study at the early stage of degradation within the first day a fraction of dom was readily available in all treatments which reduced competitive pressures as reflected by exponential increase of the bacterial abundances and dominance of stochasticity dini andreote et al 2015 as succession proceeded the ratio of aromatic and less biolabile dom increased causing resource depletion and limitation which manifested in the deterministic selection becoming progressively more important accordingly we found substantial divergences of habitat niche breadths and bacterial co occurrence patterns between the soil derived dom treatment and the other treatments on day 7 and day 28 but not on day 1 it is noteworthy that we manipulated the physicochemical conditions e g temperature and nutrient supply in all treatments to ensure that the deterministic selection could be mainly ascribed to the effect of dom sources but in reality extreme physicochemical conditions may also alter the impact of resource properties on community assembly processes dini andreote et al 2015 the community assembly mechanisms have been thought to drive the relationships between microbial community and function curtis et al 2013 for instance increasing selection stress that drive the community assembly to a determinism stage will result in selection of efficient bacteria to handle the resources available whereas high level of stochasticity decreases the function of microbial communities by increasing the proportion of non functional taxa zhang et al 2019 our results thus imply that excessive enrichment of biolabile substrate for bacteria such as eutrophication induced algal bloom or sewage input may cause instability in the aquatic microbial ecosystem functioning though further studies are needed to elucidate this intrinsic mechanism significant differences in the direction or magnitude of the effect of dom sources were observed for bacterial diversity community composition and niche partitioning the soil derived dom treatment had the highest alpha diversity but the lowest taxonomic temporal turnover rate and habitat niche breadths as well as distinct co occurrence patterns of species groups positive correlations between bacterial richness and evenness with the number of molecules in the dom pool have been documented recently muscarella et al 2019 this may partly explain why soil derived dom had the highest bacterial alpha diversity of the four dom sources since a significantly greater number of molecules provide more niches for species finke and snyder 2008 on the other hand soil derived dom are more humic like and aromatic than algae macrophyte and sewage derived dom more recalcitrant compounds may require enzymatic activities or transport systems at varying levels of complexity and thus be more selective favoring species equipped with specific metabolic capabilities and more habitat specialists with narrow niche breadths landa et al 2014 more recalcitrant compounds can also explain the lower temporal turnover rate in the soil derived dom treatment since the bacterial community structure tends to stabilize more quickly under the pressure of stronger selection coinciding with more similar community structures on day 7 and day 28 in the soil derived dom treatment fig 3 moreover the lowest value of the stochasticity ratio occurring in the soil derived dom treatment further supports that the less bioavailable compounds with a higher aromaticity and humification degree tend to be more selective for community assemblages it is noteworthy that although the sewage derived dom is an anthropogenic source compared with the autochthonous sources derived from algae and macrophytes all of these three sources were dominated by the protein like compounds and had similar temporal turnover rates habitat niche breadths and co occurrence patterns of species suggesting a central role of dom degradability in shaping bacterial community assemblages in previous studies investigating the effect of environmental selection induced determinism on bacterial communities substrate quantity has often been in focus jiao et al 2020 and our study showed that dom quality is also of crucial importance and needs to be considered when searching for the relationships between environmental filtering and bacterial community structures correlations between dom molecules and bacterial taxa describing the coherence between bacterial species and dom molecular signatures can be used to infer bacterial metabolic preferences and transformation of dom muscarella et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 in a network species groups clustering in the same module are considered to share similar niches and perform similar functions rottjers and faust 2018 while keystone nodes are commonly considered as initiating components of networks that could drive community composition and function banerjee et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 we found that the module based eigengenes of module 1 3 and module 6 which increased over time or were the highest in the soil derived dom treatment showed strong positive correlations with more aromatic compounds fig 5 a similar correlation was also observed for the habitat specialists in the soil derived dom treatment and most keystone species except those belonging to gammaproteobacteria providing further evidence of the directional effect of increasing aromatic dom on bacterial co occurrence patterns metabolic profiles and ecosystem functioning additionally few correlations with aliphatics were detected maybe due to the rapid metabolism of these materials zhao et al 2019 4 3 different responses among bacterial taxa with different abundance patterns the time dependent successional patterns in community diversity and composition of at rt and crat were significantly affected by dom sources but different reactive strategies were also detected among taxa with different abundance patterns the prevalence of at in the experimental treatments at the early stage of dom degradation suggests that at were cosmopolitan taxa and precursors reacting rapidly to complex compounds langenheder and szekely 2011 rt represented the majority of asvs 93 9 and mainly contributed to the changes in alpha diversity especially species richness phylogenetic diversity and habitat niche breadths over the course of the experiment it is generally recognized that the rare biosphere with high species diversity has an important influence on the ability of a community to stabilize and maintain ecosystem function by acting as a functional cache or resource pool for responding to disturbance events jousset et al 2017 lynch and neufeld 2015 our study further showed that the highest proportion of all reads 41 5 belonged to few crat asvs 5 4 we also found that the contribution of the crat subcommunity to the temporal changes in community composition was highest during day 7 day 28 supporting the concept that rare species can serve as an active seed bank and pool of metabolic potential that can become dominant under favorable conditions lynch and neufeld 2015 moreover an overall lower taxonomic stochasticity ratio was observed for crat than for at and rt indicating a stronger deterministic selection imposing on members of the crat subcommunity these results and those of previous studies demonstrate that rare bacteria occasionally becoming very abundant are important contributors to the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community in response to environmental changes nyirabuhoro et al 2020 shade et al 2014 importantly the keystone species identified in the network analysis including both at rt and crat suggest that taxa with different abundance patterns all played crucial roles in responding to the variation of dom thereby emphasizing the necessity of considering variations of species with distinct abundances especially in the rare biosphere to be able to better understand bacterial community dynamics in response to environmental changes at different spatiotemporal scales moreover although rt have been generally considered to contribute little to the carbon flow due to their much lower biomass compared with that of at pedros alio 2012 our study highlights the important contribution of rare conditionally rare taxa to the carbon flow of ecosystems especially the refractory carbon 5 conclusion our results revealed that the influence of dom sources on time dependent successions of the bacterial community was highly related to aromaticity of the dom which acts as an indicator of the temporal succession of dom composition and bioavailability moreover community assembly processes shifted from high stochasticity to high determinism as succession proceeded indicating that deterministic selection was induced by more aromatic dom we thus propose that dom aromaticity can be an efficient predictor in comparisons of the selective strength of dom sources composition on bacterial community dynamics in addition we demonstrated that taxa with different abundance patterns all play crucial but different roles in the response to dom variation and emphasized the importance of rare bacteria under refractory dom conditions our findings expand the knowledge of the interactions between microbes and dom from the perspective of temporal dynamics considering the complexity of nature environments the responses of microbial community structures and metabolic profiles to mixtures of different dom sources need to be further explored declaration of competing

17308,advanced oxidation processes aop based on nonradicals have attracted growing attentions because nonradical systems require much less oxidants and have low susceptibility to radical scavengers herein a novel fenton like system that utilizes nonradicals was explored it was derived from g c3n4 mgo activated h2o2 and can reduce the h2o2 stoichiometry from 0 94 0 18 to 0 03 sulfamethoxazole smx a widely used sulfonamide was used as the model pollutant to evaluate the efficacy of the system it was observed for the first time that organic pollutants can be degraded with singlet oxygen 1o2 through a nonradical pathway in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system the reduced h2o2 consumption was the net result of continuously recycled h2o2 from the reactions between h2o2 and g c3n4 mgo based on experimental results and theoretical calculations the synthesis of g c3n4 and mgo forms a n mg bond with strong ability to absorb electrons and the electron transfer of h2o2 to n mg bonding is accelerated activation of h2o2 to generate 1o2 experimental data showed that organic pollutants can be degraded rapidly over a wide ph range findings of this study point to a cyclical but stable fenton like system with reduced h2o2 requirement for cost effective remediation and treatment of organic pollutants and toxic wastes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords singlet oxygen g c3n4 mgo h2o2 sulfamethoxazole degradation mechanism 1 introduction fenton reactions are among the most effective and most widely used advanced oxidation processes aop because of its versatility and capability against organic pollutants through the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh from h2o2 yin et al 2019 however applications of fenton reactions are limited by their narrow ph range easy to produce secondary pollution and so on yang et al 2018 to address these shortcomings fenton like catalytic systems and electrofenton systems were prepared by transition metals fe ni and others and metal oxides fe3o4 mn3o4 etc which have been extensively investigated deng et al 2020 el kateb et al 2019 ganiyu et al 2018 xu and wang 2012 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 in fact the mechanisms of fenton like reactions are the same as those of traditional fenton reactions which are attributed to the generation of oh radical pathway yang et al 2019 it is generally accepted that radicals possess high redox ability but some problems still arise in the practical applications of these fenton like reactions based on radical pathway oh is unstable in the water environment due to the existence of anions produces poor catalytic durability and dependence on external energy input xu and wang 2012 zhu et al 2018 yin et al 2019 to overcome these disadvantages an efficient economical and environmentally friendly fenton like system is desired for the treatment of organic pollutants the nonradical oxidation pathway reportedly requires only a small amount of oxidant is less sensitive to environmental factors and is highly selective to electron rich organic pollutants which can reduce the amount of side products ahn et al 2016 jawad et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 different from the radical process that relies on electron exchange in bulk solution the nonradical oxidation pathway depends on the electron charge transfer that occurs on the surface of the catalyst which can be broadly categorized into singlet oxygen 1o2 electron transfer mediation and surface activation complex duan et al 2018a jawad et al 2020 the 1o2 based pathway is popular because of its strong resistance to popular scavengers and background substances in water matrix jawad et al 2020 most studies have focused on the activation of peroxymonosulfate or peroxydisulfate to produce 1o2 in carbon catalysts such as graphene song et al 2019 graphite carbonitride fan et al 2019 and carbon nanotubes yun et al 2018 graphite carbon nitride g c3n4 has been used widely due to its excellent chemical stability and facile preparation huo et al 2019 ma et al 2019a suryawanshi et al 2012 in addition with its unique electronic properties and n vacancy ability the six nitrogen lone pairs of g c3n4 can be used as electron donors to reduce the leaching of metal ions thus it is easy to form the metal containing complexes with a controllable structure li et al 2018 the above characteristics inspired researchers to apply g c3n4 to the study of fenton like reactions ma et al 2019a commonly g c3n4 combines with metal oxides such as fe3o4 zno mn3o4 and ceo2 to prepare high performance catalytic materials for practical applications chen et al 2020 guan et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 ma et al 2019b however considering the high cost and the risk of secondary pollution of the above metals the use of the low cost non toxic and environmentally friendly alkali metal oxide mgo doped g c3n4 to prepare catalysts has attracted attention many previous studies explained the mechanisms underlying g c3n4 mgo catalytic degradation of pollutants only within the radical pathway for example two research groups have reported the use of g c3n4 mgo as fenton like catalysts to degrade organic pollutants ge et al 2018 ramacharyulu et al 2018 so far almost no researches have been conducted on the use of g c3n4 mgo to catalyze h2o2 through nonradical pathways for the degradation of organic compounds in an advanced oxidation process in the present study g c3n4 mgo was synthesized via a two step calcination method and utilized as a catalyst for h2o2 activation sulfamethoxazole smx was used as the model pollutant to investigate the degradation mechanism in a nonradical pathway because it is a common antibiotic pollutant in the environment transmission electron microscopy tem selected area electron diffraction saed scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds were used to study the surface characteristics of the catalytic materials and the changes in the content of the main elements the products were characterized by x ray photoelectron microscopy xps and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir which were used to prove the presence of co and n mg bonding in the catalytic material and the important role of this binding in the fenton like reaction system furthermore the effects of g c3n4 mgo dose the concentration of h2o2 and initial ph on smx degradation were investigated subsequently the main reactive oxygen species ros was identified by chemical quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr trapping measurements

degradation experiments to facilitate comparative analysis and discussion five other kinds of control samples including h2o2 mgoh2o2 g c3n4 h2o2 g c3n4 mgoh2o2 g c3n4 mgo were prepared to explore the effects of different parameter conditions on the degradation rate of smx the h2o2 gradient concentrations were 0 03 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 5 similarly settings the ph gradient levels were 5 7 8 9 and 10 adjustment was performed by using 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and 0 1 mol l 1 hcl solutions the initial concentrations of smx and degradable materials were 20 mg l 1 and 0 2 g l 1 respectively in the presence of nacl na2co3 na2so4 nano3 and na3po4 the effects of ions on smx degradation were investigated and the effect of natural organic compounds such as humic acid ha on the degradation of smx were studied all experiments were performed in a 100 ml conical bottle at room temperature 25 2 c and constant pressure all experiments were performed in triplicates and the average value with standard deviation error bar was obtained 2 5 analytical methods smx and metabolite concentrations at the end of degradation were measured by a hplc agilent 1260 infinityⅱ usa the mobile phase consisted of water solvent

nm the amount of h2o2 in the solution was determined by iodination method to investigate the role that ros played in smx degradation different scavengers were used to quench specific ros nan3 was introduced as an 1o2 scavenger tba was introduced as an oh scavenger tempol was introduced as an effective scavenger of o2 the qualitative analysis was measured by esr jes fa200 jeol co japan spectroscopy using dmpo as spin trap agent identification and the quantification of the major degradation products of smx by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms the gradient elution method was adopted and the mobile phase consisted of formic acid solution 1 and acetonitrile the flow rate was 0 2 ml min 1 the injection volume was 10 μl and the total elution time was 8 min for each sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure of g c3n4 mgo the changes of microstructure morphology and element contents of g c3n4 mgo before and after the reaction were investigated by tem saed sem and eds fig 1 a demonstrates that there are a number of nanoparticles on the g c3n4 sheets mainly due to the nucleation of mgo particles on the surface of the g c3n4 nanosheets fig 1b was obtained by the saed which shows bright circled rings indicating that mgo is in a polycrystalline state in sample fig 1c and d mainly shows the changes of the g c3n4 mgo before and after the reaction the composite with irregularly shrunken sheet structures appeared on the surface and mgo nanoparticles were randomly distributed on the flake like g c3n4 before the reaction after the reaction the number of mgo nanoparticles on the surface of c3n4mgo decreased fig 1d the uniform distribution of c n o and mg elements in the g c3n4 mgo composite was shown in the elemental mapping images the signals of mg and o elements were stronger than those of c and n elements which can be attributed to the high content of mgo in the complex fig 1e the changes of the distribution of mg and o elements in the eds element map fig 1f and the change of the content of each element in table s2 proved that mgo in the composites played a positive role in smx degradation the detailed structure of g c3n4 mgo was investigated by xrd spectroscopy fig 2 a shows the xrd curves of four samples of mgo g c3n4 g c3n4 mgo and g c3n4 mgo after 5 h of reaction for g c3n4 two distinct peaks existed at the diffraction peaks θ 27 4 and 13 0 the former corresponded to the 002 plane showing the interlayer stacking of the aromatic system plane whereas the latter s peak at 13 0 was attributed to the tris triazine units corresponding to the 100 plane diarmand khalilabad et al 2019 for mgo two characteristic peaks were displayed at θ 42 9 and 62 3 corresponding to the 002 and 220 planes respectively xu et al 2017 the characteristic peaks from g c3n4 and mgo can be observed on the g c3n4 mgo complex which indicated that the prepared complex still retains the structural characteristics of mgo and g c3n4 but the two characteristic peaks θ 42 9 and 62 3 from mgo gradually weakened and disappeared after 5 h of reaction possibly indicating that the mgo in g c3n4 mgo was involved in the degradation of smx in the system xps analysis was used to study the surface chemical composition of g c3n4 mgo the chemical state of elements and the interaction between mgo and g c3n4 as shown in fig 2b four characteristic peaks of mg 1 s n 1 s o 1 s and c 1 s existed in the xps spectrum the high resolution spectrum for c 1 s fig 2c displays peaks at 284 8 and 286 3 ev which belonged to sp2 bonds carbon and formed co bond between g c3n4 and mgo hu et al 2015 ramacharyulu et al 2018 the high resolution n1s xps spectrum fig 2d showed three characteristic peaks the peaks at 398 3 399 3 and 400 05 ev were ascribed to cn c tertiary nitrogen n c 3 and amino functional groups cn h in the g c3n4 mgo respectively notably the peak at 397 2 ev corresponded to the mg n bonding ge et al 2018 t li et al 2020 a new peak at 533 ev in the o1s xps spectrum fig 2e showed co bonding the peak at 1304 1 ev in mg 1 s xps spectrum fig 2f was ascribed to mg n bonding the characteristic peaks of c and n elements in g c3n4 mgo remained unchanged after 5 h of reaction whereas the characteristic peaks of mg and o elements became weaker combined with the above xps spectral analysis the results showed that mgo interacted with g c3n4 through the relevant coordination bonds of mg n and co and these two bonds played a certain role in smx degradation reaction 3 2 degradation performance by g c3n4 mgoh2o2 to demonstrate that g c3n4 mgo composites can be used as efficient catalysts various control experiments were performed on smx degradation reaction in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system as shown in fig 3 a when only g c3n4 mgo composite or h2o2 was present almost no obvious degradation was observed indicating that the adsorption and degradation ability of g c3n4 mgo and the oxidation of h2o2 individually could be negligible nearly no degradation of smx occurred in the presence of 0 1 g l 1 g c3n4 h2o2 or 0 1 g l 1 mgoh2o2 the degradation of smx induced by the two catalyst components alone could be negligible in addition when the physical mixture 0 05 g l 1 g c3n4 and 0 05 g l 1 mgo was added to the same system no apparent promotion was observed indicating that the mixture of g c3n4 and mgo had low reactivity for h2o2 activation expectedly the rapidly degradation of smx was observed in the system of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 and almost 92 3 of smx was removed within 3 h thereby showing that the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system possessed a high ability to degrade smx this finding may be attributed to the coordination between mgo and g c3n4 in the composite catalyst which contributed to the formation of more ros for smx degradation ge et al 2018 sun et al 2019b as shown in fig 3b the best smx degradation was observed when the initial concentration of h2o2 was 0 03 the consumed volume of h2o2 was significantly lower than in most ordinary fenton reactions cheng et al 2018 deng and englehardt 2006 with the increase of h2o2 concentration in the system the degradation efficiency of smx decreased which may be due to that excessive h2o2 become the scavenger of oh bergendahl and thies 2004 or the coupling reactions occur between h2o2 and o2 which reduces the amount of 1o2 thus reducing the degradation efficiency minero et al 2005 compared with other reported fenton like systems to highlight the advantages of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system the result of which was listed in table s3 it could be seen that the traditional fenton reaction consumed a lot of h2o2 0 94 0 02 bokare and choi 2014 and the h2o2 consumption of other fenton like systems was about 50 mm 0 18 0 01 huang et al 2020a ma et al 2018 sun et al 2018 while the dosage of catalyst 0 2 g l 1 and h2o2 0 03 was thimbleful in this g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system noteworthily it will be produced cyclically and maintain a certain concentration after the first addition of h2o2 and the ph value of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system is near neutral which is suitable for sewage treatment in most environments in addition the impact of exogenous substances nacl na2co3 na2so4 nano3 na3po4 and natural organic compounds on smx degradation was investigated as shown in fig s1 cl co3 2 and po4 3 had little effect on the degradation of smx at concentrations less than 10 mm 3 3 degradation under different ph value mg2 leakage in general the ph is a critical factor for the degradation of pollutants from aqueous solutions because solution ph can affect the protonation process of the surface functional groups of various removers song et al 2015 as shown in fig 3c the effect of different ph levels on the degradation of smx in a g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system was studied the degradation efficiency of smx in 3 h increased slightly from 65 5 to 92 3 with increasing initial ph from 5 0 to 8 0 when ph continued to increase the degradation efficiency of smx decreased to 66 4 the smx degradation rate was the best at ph 8 the above phenomenon may be due to the fact that h2o2 is a binary weak acid at room temperature eq 1 2 as follows 1 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 k a 1 h ho 2 h 2 o 2 1 55 10 12 2 ho 2 h o 2 2 k a 2 h o 2 2 ho 2 1 10 25 obviously with increasing ph level more ho2 emerged in the system which benefitted the production of 1o2 section 3 5 resulting in an increase in degradation efficiency petigara et al 2002 zou et al 2017b with continued increase in the ph value of the solution the concentration of oh increased and a large number of oh interacted with g c3n4 mgo to form stable negatively charged compounds thereby inducing the inaction of the materials zhao et al 2013 accompanied by the degradation of smx bits of mg2 leaked out from g c3n4 mgo but did not generate secondary contamination as shown in fig 3d the results were consistent with the corresponding changes in the element composition and chemical state of the previous tem sem eds and xps parts 3 4 ftir spectra change the change of functional groups of g c3n4 mgo during the degradation of smx was studied by ftir as shown in fig 4 the spectra of h2o2 g c3n4 mgo and g c3n4 mgoh2o2 were analyzed in the spectrum of g c3n4 mgo a broad characteristic absorption peak was observed in 3192 3095 cm 1 which was caused by the stretching vibration of nh groups in primary and secondary amines xu et al 2017 the vibration absorption peak at 2160 cm 1 was related to the cyano group cn or cumulative double bond groups ncn ramacharyulu et al 2018 the absorption peak at 1470 cm 1 was attributed to the bending vibration of mg oh 2 niu et al 2006 the absorption peak at 1396 cm 1 was caused by the stretching mode of aromatic cn heterocycles xu et al 2017 the vibration peak in the range of 800 835 cm 1 was related to the characteristic breathing mode of triazine polymers su et al 2014 in addition the peak at 862 cm 1 was caused by mg o mg vibration kadari et al 2016 zou et al 2016 many absorption peaks existed in the spectrum of g c3n4 mgo system after the introduction of h2o2 in the range of 3250 3690 cm 1 the intensity of the absorption peak increased obviously which was caused by the tensile vibration of the hydrogen bond this phenomenon was probably related to the presence of singly coordinated hydroxides on the surface of mg oh 2 kwon and park 2009 notably the absorption peaks at 1680 1474 1399 and 1179 cm 1 were enhanced and shifted to varying degrees compared with those without h2o2 due to the synergism effects between the nitrogen containing radicals in g c3n4 mgo and the oh generated from h2o2 zou et al 2017a 3 5 degradation mechanism the generated ros plays important roles in smx degradation in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system the h2o2 acted as an oxidant to g c3n4 mgo based on the stable concentration during the reaction with the rapid degradation of smx fig 5 a this process can be illustrated as follows eqs 3 and 4 wu et al 2019 3 mgo h2o2 mgo2 h2o 4 mgo2 2h2o mg oh 2 h2o2 to explore the dominant species of ros in smx degradation a series of quenching experiments using different scavengers was conducted figs 5b d without adding scavengers more than 92 3 of sms was degraded within 3 h overall the smx degradation efficiencies were obviously affected when nan3 and tba were added as scavengers on the one hand nan3 at 1 mm concentration resulted in a 48 2 decrease of smx compared with the result when no scavenger was used this finding suggested that 1o2 was the most significant ros involved in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system moreover based on esr spectroscopy using dmpo as a spin trapper three characteristic peaks with relative intensity of 1 1 1 corresponding to tempol 1o2 were evidently captured verifying the unquestionable formation of 1o2 fig 5e bokare and choi 2015 on the other hand approximately 35 5 degradation of smx was induced by oh typical fourfold peaks consisting of a quartet with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 with hyperfine coupling of ah an 1 49 m t were achieved and these were the characteristic signals of dmpo oh adducts fig 5f fang et al 2013 liu and wang 2014 a small quantity of ros o2 possibly existed in the reactive system unfortunately the presence of o2 was not detected in the esr spectrogram therefore the contribution of ros in smx degradation was in the following order 1o2 oh o2 the o2 likely acted as an intermediator or a precursor for the transformation of main ros jiang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 based on the characterization of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 and the analysis of esr results the evolution mechanism of 1o2 nonradical pathway and oh radical pathway in smx degradation by g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system was proposed in fig 6 the radical pathway was found in similar reactive systems in previous studies mao and jiang 2019 wu et al 2019 2020 however the significant ros of 1o2 was investigated in g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system for the first time singlet oxygen nonradical oxidation pathway can reduce the number of side products during the degradation of pollutants which was attributed to its strong selectivity for electron rich organic pollutants ahn et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 radical scavengers or competitive organic inorganic components had little effect on degradation by singlet oxidation process and required only a small quantity of oxidant duan et al 2018b jawad et al 2020 six nitrogen lone pairs of electrons can be used as electron donors due to the fact that g c3n4 itself contains the electron rich structure of the heptazine ring of pyridine nitrogen group li et al 2020 the electron transfer ability improved during the synthesis of g c3n4 and mgo the n mg bond in g c3n4 mgo that has strong electron absorption ability was conducive to the adsorption of h2o2 and promoted the electron transfer and activation of h2o2 to generate 1o2 eq 5 jiang et al 2020 in addition h2o2 generated an intermediate o2 o2 further combined with h2o molecules to generate 1o2 eq 6 sun et al 2019a as follows 5 h2o2 ho2 1o2 h2o oh 6 2 o2 2h2o 1o2 h2o2 2oh 7 h 2 o 2 h e oh h 2 o although a relatively small amount of oh radicals can be produced by transferring electrons directly to h2o2 through electron rich functional groups in g c3n4 mgo eq 7 jiang et al 2020 oh also play a certain role in the degradation of smx through radical pathways therefore both nonradical and radical pathways contribute to the degradation of smx in g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system 3 6 degradation pathway of smx by g c3n4 mgoh2o2 the mechanism of smx degradation was studied by uhplc ms ms determination of the intermediate products formed in the process of smx degradation twenty seven putative intermediate products were found among which 7 11 13 14 18 19 and 20 were newly detected intermediate products the structural formulas of these 27 products are shown in table s4 and fig s2 combined with the detected intermediates and previous descriptions four different pathways for the degradation of smx by g c3n4 mgo were proposed the degradation pathways included cleavage oxidation hydroxylation and demethylation fig 7 usually the chemical bonds on three different sites β γ and δ cleavage of smx are more easily broken when smx was degraded boreen et al 2004 kim et al 2017 in pathway a the 1o2 oh and other ros attacked the above three sites and the bond cleavage produced different types of primary cycle products smx generated product 8 ion at 172 m z and product 27 by β cleavage and product 8 was identified as sulfonamide in the γ cleavage sulfonamide bond the products included an isoxazole ring and aminophenyl sulfonyl structure products 10 and 23 the preference for sulfonamide bond cleavage was theoretically explained by song et al 2014 products 9 and 24 were produced by the δ cleavage of smx which was consistent with the study of huang et al 2020 product 9 was oxidized to product 7 whereas products 7 10 and 23 were converted to single chain compounds products 19 20 and 21 through a series of oxidation reactions until degradation ultimately occurred in pathway b the c c bond on the nitrogen containing a pentagonal ring of smx was oxidized to form product 1 product 1 generated a variety of small organic compounds by breaking bonds between carbon nitrogen and oxygen finally all the small organic matters were mineralized into inorganic ions carbon dioxide and water ray et al 2018 in pathway c 1o2 oh and other ros attacked the amino group nh 2 and the c c bond on the nitrogen containing pentagonal ring in the benzene ring of smx to produce product 2 ion at 273m z this finding was consistent with the study of gong and chu 2016 finally products 18 and 17 were formed by oxidation reactions demethylation was also one of the smx degradation pathways smx was demethylated to form product 3 followed by deamination to form product 4 and finally the s n bond was broken to form products 12 and 26 in pathway d among all intermediates produced in the system some toxic products were detected such as cyclic side products of smx which may imply a possible burden to the public health however the primary and secondary cyclic intermediates could be completely decomposed into biodegradable side products then completely detoxified in the solution ganiyu et al 2018 the combination of aliphatic short chain carboxylic acid side products did not cause the accumulation of individual toxicity which have been reported in other studies on degradation of pesticides antibiotics or dyes thi xuan huong et al 2016 2017 therefore the fenton like g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system can reduce the content of antibiotics such as smx in aquatic environment and effectively degrade toxic pollutants into non toxic compounds in a word this work provides a new idea for g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system to degrade smx which can effectively reduce the consumption of h2o2 4 conclusion the g c3n4 mgo composites obtained through a facile two step calcination process were used as effective catalysts to degrade the antibiotic smx the degradation experiment indicated that g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system has efficient ability to degrade smx the singlet oxygen generated in the system was the key factor for smx degradation in addition according to the uhplc ms ms analysis of degradation intermediates four parallel pathways of smx degradation were proposed the g c3n4 mgo composites have great potential in the remediation of organic polluted wastewater due to their cost effectiveness environmental friendliness and easy preparation and will be widely utilized in the future declaration of competing interest

17308,advanced oxidation processes aop based on nonradicals have attracted growing attentions because nonradical systems require much less oxidants and have low susceptibility to radical scavengers herein a novel fenton like system that utilizes nonradicals was explored it was derived from g c3n4 mgo activated h2o2 and can reduce the h2o2 stoichiometry from 0 94 0 18 to 0 03 sulfamethoxazole smx a widely used sulfonamide was used as the model pollutant to evaluate the efficacy of the system it was observed for the first time that organic pollutants can be degraded with singlet oxygen 1o2 through a nonradical pathway in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system the reduced h2o2 consumption was the net result of continuously recycled h2o2 from the reactions between h2o2 and g c3n4 mgo based on experimental results and theoretical calculations the synthesis of g c3n4 and mgo forms a n mg bond with strong ability to absorb electrons and the electron transfer of h2o2 to n mg bonding is accelerated activation of h2o2 to generate 1o2 experimental data showed that organic pollutants can be degraded rapidly over a wide ph range findings of this study point to a cyclical but stable fenton like system with reduced h2o2 requirement for cost effective remediation and treatment of organic pollutants and toxic wastes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords singlet oxygen g c3n4 mgo h2o2 sulfamethoxazole degradation mechanism 1 introduction fenton reactions are among the most effective and most widely used advanced oxidation processes aop because of its versatility and capability against organic pollutants through the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh from h2o2 yin et al 2019 however applications of fenton reactions are limited by their narrow ph range easy to produce secondary pollution and so on yang et al 2018 to address these shortcomings fenton like catalytic systems and electrofenton systems were prepared by transition metals fe ni and others and metal oxides fe3o4 mn3o4 etc which have been extensively investigated deng et al 2020 el kateb et al 2019 ganiyu et al 2018 xu and wang 2012 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 in fact the mechanisms of fenton like reactions are the same as those of traditional fenton reactions which are attributed to the generation of oh radical pathway yang et al 2019 it is generally accepted that radicals possess high redox ability but some problems still arise in the practical applications of these fenton like reactions based on radical pathway oh is unstable in the water environment due to the existence of anions produces poor catalytic durability and dependence on external energy input xu and wang 2012 zhu et al 2018 yin et al 2019 to overcome these disadvantages an efficient economical and environmentally friendly fenton like system is desired for the treatment of organic pollutants the nonradical oxidation pathway reportedly requires only a small amount of oxidant is less sensitive to environmental factors and is highly selective to electron rich organic pollutants which can reduce the amount of side products ahn et al 2016 jawad et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 different from the radical process that relies on electron exchange in bulk solution the nonradical oxidation pathway depends on the electron charge transfer that occurs on the surface of the catalyst which can be broadly categorized into singlet oxygen 1o2 electron transfer mediation and surface activation complex duan et al 2018a jawad et al 2020 the 1o2 based pathway is popular because of its strong resistance to popular scavengers and background substances in water matrix jawad et al 2020 most studies have focused on the activation of peroxymonosulfate or peroxydisulfate to produce 1o2 in carbon catalysts such as graphene song et al 2019 graphite carbonitride fan et al 2019 and carbon nanotubes yun et al 2018 graphite carbon nitride g c3n4 has been used widely due to its excellent chemical stability and facile preparation huo et al 2019 ma et al 2019a suryawanshi et al 2012 in addition with its unique electronic properties and n vacancy ability the six nitrogen lone pairs of g c3n4 can be used as electron donors to reduce the leaching of metal ions thus it is easy to form the metal containing complexes with a controllable structure li et al 2018 the above characteristics inspired researchers to apply g c3n4 to the study of fenton like reactions ma et al 2019a commonly g c3n4 combines with metal oxides such as fe3o4 zno mn3o4 and ceo2 to prepare high performance catalytic materials for practical applications chen et al 2020 guan et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 ma et al 2019b however considering the high cost and the risk of secondary pollution of the above metals the use of the low cost non toxic and environmentally friendly alkali metal oxide mgo doped g c3n4 to prepare catalysts has attracted attention many previous studies explained the mechanisms underlying g c3n4 mgo catalytic degradation of pollutants only within the radical pathway for example two research groups have reported the use of g c3n4 mgo as fenton like catalysts to degrade organic pollutants ge et al 2018 ramacharyulu et al 2018 so far almost no researches have been conducted on the use of g c3n4 mgo to catalyze h2o2 through nonradical pathways for the degradation of organic compounds in an advanced oxidation process in the present study g c3n4 mgo was synthesized via a two step calcination method and utilized as a catalyst for h2o2 activation sulfamethoxazole smx was used as the model pollutant to investigate the degradation mechanism in a nonradical pathway because it is a common antibiotic pollutant in the environment transmission electron microscopy tem selected area electron diffraction saed scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds were used to study the surface characteristics of the catalytic materials and the changes in the content of the main elements the products were characterized by x ray photoelectron microscopy xps and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir which were used to prove the presence of co and n mg bonding in the catalytic material and the important role of this binding in the fenton like reaction system furthermore the effects of g c3n4 mgo dose the concentration of h2o2 and initial ph on smx degradation were investigated subsequently the main reactive oxygen species ros was identified by chemical quenching experiments and electron spin resonance esr trapping measurements based on spintronics in the reaction process finally the intermediate products and degradation pathway of smx were studied by uhplc ms ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfamethoxazole smx cas

certain amount of melamine was calcined at 550 c for 2 h to produce g c3n4 then a mixture of 1 00 g of g c3n4 and 2 43 g of basic magnesium carbonate pentahydrate was evenly ground to a fine powder in a mortar and further calcined at 450 c for 2 h to yield g c3n4 mgo composites for comparison single phase mgo was obtained by calcining basic magnesium carbonate pentahydrate alone 2 3

degradation experiments to facilitate comparative analysis and discussion five other kinds of control samples including h2o2 mgoh2o2 g c3n4 h2o2 g c3n4 mgoh2o2 g c3n4 mgo were prepared to explore the

nacl na2co3 na2so4 nano3 and na3po4 the effects of ions on smx degradation were investigated and the effect of natural organic compounds such as humic acid ha on the degradation of smx were studied all experiments were performed in a 100 ml conical bottle at room temperature 25 2 c and constant pressure all experiments were performed in triplicates and the average value with standard deviation

ms the gradient elution method was adopted and the mobile phase consisted of formic acid solution 1 and acetonitrile the flow rate was 0 2 ml min 1 the injection volume was 10 μl and the total elution time was 8 min for each sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure of g c3n4 mgo the changes of microstructure morphology and element contents of g c3n4 mgo before and after the reaction were investigated by tem saed sem and eds fig 1 a demonstrates that there are a number of nanoparticles on the g c3n4 sheets mainly due to the nucleation of mgo particles on the surface of the g c3n4 nanosheets fig 1b was obtained by the saed which shows bright circled rings indicating that mgo is in a polycrystalline state in sample fig 1c and d mainly shows the changes of the g c3n4 mgo before and after the reaction the composite with irregularly shrunken sheet structures appeared on the surface and mgo nanoparticles were randomly distributed on the flake like g c3n4 before the reaction after the reaction the number of mgo nanoparticles on the surface of c3n4mgo decreased fig 1d the uniform distribution of c n o and mg elements in the g c3n4 mgo composite was shown in the elemental mapping images the signals of mg and o elements were stronger than those of c and n elements which can be attributed to the high content of mgo in the complex fig 1e the changes of the distribution of mg and o elements in the eds element map fig 1f and the change of the content of each element in table s2 proved that mgo in the composites played a positive role in smx degradation the detailed structure of g c3n4 mgo was investigated by xrd spectroscopy fig 2 a shows the xrd curves of four samples of mgo g c3n4 g c3n4 mgo and g c3n4 mgo after 5 h of reaction for g c3n4 two distinct peaks existed at the diffraction peaks θ 27 4 and 13 0 the former corresponded to the 002 plane showing the interlayer stacking of the aromatic system plane whereas the latter s peak at 13 0 was attributed to the tris triazine units corresponding to the 100 plane diarmand khalilabad et al 2019 for mgo two characteristic peaks were displayed at θ 42 9 and 62 3 corresponding to the 002 and 220 planes respectively xu et al 2017 the characteristic peaks from g c3n4 and mgo can be observed on the g c3n4 mgo complex which indicated that the prepared complex still retains the structural characteristics of mgo and g c3n4 but the two characteristic peaks θ 42 9 and 62 3 from mgo gradually weakened and disappeared after 5 h of reaction possibly indicating that the mgo in g c3n4 mgo was involved in the degradation of smx in the system xps analysis was used to study the surface chemical composition of g c3n4 mgo the chemical state of elements and the interaction between mgo and g c3n4 as shown in fig 2b four characteristic peaks of mg 1 s n 1 s o 1 s and c 1 s existed in the xps spectrum the high resolution spectrum for c 1 s fig 2c displays peaks at 284 8 and 286 3 ev which belonged to sp2 bonds carbon and formed co bond between g c3n4 and mgo hu et al 2015 ramacharyulu et al 2018 the high resolution n1s xps spectrum fig 2d showed three characteristic peaks the peaks at 398 3 399 3 and 400 05 ev were ascribed to cn c tertiary nitrogen n c 3 and amino functional groups cn h in the g c3n4 mgo respectively notably the peak at 397 2 ev corresponded to the mg n bonding ge et al 2018 t li et al 2020 a new peak at 533 ev in the o1s xps spectrum fig 2e showed co bonding the peak at 1304 1 ev in mg 1 s xps spectrum fig 2f was ascribed to mg n bonding the characteristic peaks of c and n elements in g c3n4 mgo remained unchanged after 5 h of reaction whereas the characteristic peaks of mg and o elements became weaker combined with the above xps spectral analysis the results showed that mgo interacted with g c3n4 through the relevant coordination bonds of mg n and co and these two bonds played a certain role in smx degradation reaction 3 2 degradation performance by g c3n4 mgoh2o2 to demonstrate that g c3n4 mgo composites can be used as efficient catalysts various control experiments were performed on smx degradation reaction in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system as shown in fig 3 a when only g c3n4 mgo composite or h2o2 was present almost no obvious degradation was observed indicating that the adsorption and degradation ability of g c3n4 mgo and the oxidation of h2o2 individually could be negligible nearly no degradation of smx occurred in the presence of 0 1 g l 1 g c3n4 h2o2 or 0 1 g l 1 mgoh2o2 the degradation of smx induced by the two catalyst components alone could be negligible in addition when the physical mixture 0 05 g l 1 g c3n4 and 0 05 g l 1 mgo was added to the same system no apparent promotion was observed indicating that the mixture of g c3n4 and mgo had low reactivity for h2o2 activation expectedly the rapidly degradation of smx was observed in the system of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 and almost 92 3 of smx was removed within 3 h thereby showing that the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system possessed a high ability to degrade smx this finding may be attributed to the coordination between mgo and g c3n4 in the composite catalyst which contributed to the formation of more ros for smx degradation ge et al 2018 sun et al 2019b as shown in fig 3b the best smx degradation was observed when the initial concentration of h2o2 was 0 03 the consumed volume of h2o2 was significantly lower than in most ordinary fenton reactions cheng et al 2018 deng and englehardt 2006 with the increase of h2o2 concentration in the system the degradation efficiency of smx decreased which may be due to that excessive h2o2 become the scavenger of oh bergendahl and thies 2004 or the coupling reactions occur between h2o2 and o2 which reduces the amount of 1o2 thus reducing the degradation efficiency minero et al 2005 compared with other reported fenton like systems to highlight the advantages of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system the result of which was listed in table s3 it could be seen that the traditional fenton reaction consumed a lot of h2o2 0 94 0 02 bokare and choi 2014 and the h2o2 consumption of other fenton like systems was about 50 mm 0 18 0 01 huang et al 2020a ma et al 2018 sun et al 2018 while the dosage of catalyst 0 2 g l 1 and h2o2 0 03 was thimbleful in this g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system noteworthily it will be produced cyclically and maintain a certain concentration after the first addition of h2o2 and the ph value of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system is near neutral which is suitable for sewage treatment in most environments in addition the impact of exogenous substances nacl na2co3 na2so4 nano3 na3po4 and natural organic compounds on smx degradation was investigated as shown in fig s1 cl co3 2 and po4 3 had little effect on the degradation of smx at concentrations less than 10 mm 3 3 degradation under different ph value mg2 leakage in general the ph is a critical factor for the degradation of pollutants from aqueous solutions because solution ph can affect the protonation process of the surface functional groups of various removers song et al 2015 as shown in fig 3c the effect of different ph levels on the degradation of smx in a g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system was studied the degradation efficiency of smx in 3 h increased slightly from 65 5 to 92 3 with increasing initial ph from 5 0 to 8 0 when ph continued to increase the degradation efficiency of smx decreased to 66 4 the smx degradation rate was the best at ph 8 the above phenomenon may be due to the fact that h2o2 is a binary weak acid at room temperature eq 1 2 as follows 1 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 k a 1 h ho 2 h 2 o 2 1 55 10 12 2 ho 2 h o 2 2 k a 2 h o 2 2 ho 2 1 10 25 obviously with increasing ph level more ho2 emerged in the system which benefitted the production of 1o2 section 3 5 resulting in an increase in degradation efficiency petigara et al 2002 zou et al 2017b with continued increase in the ph value of the solution the concentration of oh increased and a large number of oh interacted with g c3n4 mgo to form stable negatively charged compounds thereby inducing the inaction of the materials zhao et al 2013 accompanied by the degradation of smx bits of mg2 leaked out from g c3n4 mgo but did not generate secondary contamination as shown in fig 3d the results were consistent with the corresponding changes in the element composition and chemical state of the previous tem sem eds and xps parts 3 4 ftir spectra change the change of functional groups of g c3n4 mgo during the degradation of smx was studied by ftir as shown in fig 4 the spectra of h2o2 g c3n4 mgo and g c3n4 mgoh2o2 were analyzed in the spectrum of g c3n4 mgo a broad characteristic absorption peak was observed in 3192 3095 cm 1 which was caused by the stretching vibration of nh groups in primary and secondary amines xu et al 2017 the vibration absorption peak at 2160 cm 1 was related to the cyano group cn or cumulative double bond groups ncn ramacharyulu et al 2018 the absorption peak at 1470 cm 1 was attributed to the bending vibration of mg oh 2 niu et al 2006 the absorption peak at 1396 cm 1 was caused by the stretching mode of aromatic cn heterocycles xu et al 2017 the vibration peak in the range of 800 835 cm 1 was related to the characteristic breathing mode of triazine polymers su et al 2014 in addition the peak at 862 cm 1 was caused by mg o mg vibration kadari et al 2016 zou et al 2016 many absorption peaks existed in the spectrum of g c3n4 mgo system after the introduction of h2o2 in the range of 3250 3690 cm 1 the intensity of the absorption peak increased obviously which was caused by the tensile vibration of the hydrogen bond this phenomenon was probably related to the presence of singly coordinated hydroxides on the surface of mg oh 2 kwon and park 2009 notably the absorption peaks at 1680 1474 1399 and 1179 cm 1 were enhanced and shifted to varying degrees compared with those without h2o2 due to the synergism effects between the nitrogen containing radicals in g c3n4 mgo and the oh generated from h2o2 zou et al 2017a 3 5 degradation mechanism the generated ros plays important roles in smx degradation in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system the h2o2 acted as an oxidant to g c3n4 mgo based on the stable concentration during the reaction with the rapid degradation of smx fig 5 a this process can be illustrated as follows eqs 3 and 4 wu et al 2019 3 mgo h2o2 mgo2 h2o 4 mgo2 2h2o mg oh 2 h2o2 to explore the dominant species of ros in smx degradation a series of quenching experiments using different scavengers was conducted figs 5b d without adding scavengers more than 92 3 of sms was degraded within 3 h overall the smx degradation efficiencies were obviously affected when nan3 and tba were added as scavengers on the one hand nan3 at 1 mm concentration resulted in a 48 2 decrease of smx compared with the result when no scavenger was used this finding suggested that 1o2 was the most significant ros involved in the g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system moreover based on esr spectroscopy using dmpo as a spin trapper three characteristic peaks with relative intensity of 1 1 1 corresponding to tempol 1o2 were evidently captured verifying the unquestionable formation of 1o2 fig 5e bokare and choi 2015 on the other hand approximately 35 5 degradation of smx was induced by oh typical fourfold peaks consisting of a quartet with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 with hyperfine coupling of ah an 1 49 m t were achieved and these were the characteristic signals of dmpo oh adducts fig 5f fang et al 2013 liu and wang 2014 a small quantity of ros o2 possibly existed in the reactive system unfortunately the presence of o2 was not detected in the esr spectrogram therefore the contribution of ros in smx degradation was in the following order 1o2 oh o2 the o2 likely acted as an intermediator or a precursor for the transformation of main ros jiang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 based on the characterization of g c3n4 mgoh2o2 and the analysis of esr results the evolution mechanism of 1o2 nonradical pathway and oh radical pathway in smx degradation by g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system was proposed in fig 6 the radical pathway was found in similar reactive systems in previous studies mao and jiang 2019 wu et al 2019 2020 however the significant ros of 1o2 was investigated in g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system for the first time singlet oxygen nonradical oxidation pathway can reduce the number of side products during the degradation of pollutants which was attributed to its strong selectivity for electron rich organic pollutants ahn et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 radical scavengers or competitive organic inorganic components had little effect on degradation by singlet oxidation process and required only a small quantity of oxidant duan et al 2018b jawad et al 2020 six nitrogen lone pairs of electrons can be used as electron donors due to the fact that g c3n4 itself contains the electron rich structure of the heptazine ring of pyridine nitrogen group li et al 2020 the electron transfer ability improved during the synthesis of g c3n4 and mgo the n mg bond in g c3n4 mgo that has strong electron absorption ability was conducive to the adsorption of h2o2 and promoted the electron transfer and activation of h2o2 to generate 1o2 eq 5 jiang et al 2020 in addition h2o2 generated an intermediate o2 o2 further combined with h2o molecules to generate 1o2 eq 6 sun et al 2019a as follows 5 h2o2 ho2 1o2 h2o oh 6 2 o2 2h2o 1o2 h2o2 2oh 7 h 2 o 2 h e oh h 2 o although a relatively small amount of oh radicals can be produced by transferring electrons directly to h2o2 through electron rich functional groups in g c3n4 mgo eq 7 jiang et al 2020 oh also play a certain role in the degradation of smx through radical pathways therefore both nonradical and radical pathways contribute to the degradation of smx in g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system 3 6 degradation pathway of smx by g c3n4 mgoh2o2 the mechanism of smx degradation was studied by uhplc ms ms determination of the intermediate products formed in the process of smx degradation twenty seven putative intermediate products were found among which 7 11 13 14 18 19 and 20 were newly detected intermediate products the structural formulas of these 27 products are shown in table s4 and fig s2 combined with the detected intermediates and previous descriptions four different pathways for the degradation of smx by g c3n4 mgo were proposed the degradation pathways included cleavage oxidation hydroxylation and demethylation fig 7 usually the chemical bonds on three different sites β γ and δ cleavage of smx are more easily broken when smx was degraded boreen et al 2004 kim et al 2017 in pathway a the 1o2 oh and other ros attacked the above three sites and the bond cleavage produced different types of primary cycle products smx generated product 8 ion at 172 m z and product 27 by β cleavage and product 8 was identified as sulfonamide in the γ cleavage sulfonamide bond the products included an isoxazole ring and aminophenyl sulfonyl structure products 10 and 23 the preference for sulfonamide bond cleavage was theoretically explained by song et al 2014 products 9 and 24 were produced by the δ cleavage of smx which was consistent with the study of huang et al 2020 product 9 was oxidized to product 7 whereas products 7 10 and 23 were converted to single chain compounds products 19 20 and 21 through a series of oxidation reactions until degradation ultimately occurred in pathway b the c c bond on the nitrogen containing a pentagonal ring of smx was oxidized to form product 1 product 1 generated a variety of small organic compounds by breaking bonds between carbon nitrogen and oxygen finally all the small organic matters were mineralized into inorganic ions carbon dioxide and water ray et al 2018 in pathway c 1o2 oh and other ros attacked the amino group nh 2 and the c c bond on the nitrogen containing pentagonal ring in the benzene ring of smx to produce product 2 ion at 273m z this finding was consistent with the study of gong and chu 2016 finally products 18 and 17 were formed by oxidation reactions demethylation was also one of the smx degradation pathways smx was demethylated to form product 3 followed by deamination to form product 4 and finally the s n bond was broken to form products 12 and 26 in pathway d among all intermediates produced in the system some toxic products were detected such as cyclic side products of smx which may imply a possible burden to the public health however the primary and secondary cyclic intermediates could be completely decomposed into biodegradable side products then completely detoxified in the solution ganiyu et al 2018 the combination of aliphatic short chain carboxylic acid side products did not cause the accumulation of individual toxicity which have been reported in other studies on degradation of pesticides antibiotics or dyes thi xuan huong et al 2016 2017 therefore the fenton like g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system can reduce the content of antibiotics such as smx in aquatic environment and effectively degrade toxic pollutants into non toxic compounds in a word this work provides a new idea for g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system to degrade smx which can effectively reduce the consumption of h2o2 4 conclusion the g c3n4 mgo composites obtained through a facile two step calcination process were used as effective catalysts to degrade the antibiotic smx the degradation experiment indicated that g c3n4 mgoh2o2 system has efficient ability to degrade smx the singlet oxygen generated in the system was the key factor for smx degradation in addition according to the uhplc ms ms analysis of degradation intermediates four parallel pathways of smx degradation were proposed the g c3n4 mgo composites have great potential in the remediation of organic polluted wastewater due to their cost effectiveness environmental friendliness and easy preparation and will be widely utilized in the future declaration of competing interest

17309,determining robust values for the air water or napl water interfacial adsorption coefficient kia is key to characterizing and modeling pfas transport and fate in several environmental systems direct high resolution measurements of surfactant adsorption at the fluid fluid interface were aggregated from the literature this data set was used to examine the accuracy and applicability of γ and kia measurements determined for three pfas from transport experiments and surface tension data the transport measured γ and kia data were observed to be fully consistent with the directly measured data specifically γ values for the two methods were entirely coincident in the region of overlapping concentrations which spanned 4 orders of magnitude furthermore the two data sets adhered to an identical γ c profile these results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy of the transport measured values γ and kia values determined from the application of the gibbs adsorption equation to measured surface tension data were fully consistent with the directly measured and transport measured data sets demonstrating their applicability for representing pfas transport in environmental systems the directly measured data were used to examine the concentration dependency of kia values absent the potential confounding effects associated with the use of surface tension or transport measured data the directly measured data clearly demonstrate that kia attains a constant maximum limit at lower concentrations two separate analyses of the transport measured data both produced observations of constant kia values at lower concentrations consistent with the directly measured data these outcomes are discussed in terms of surface activities relative surface coverages and critical concentrations keywords pfos pfoa perfluoroalkyl substances transport leaching retention 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are now recognized as emerging contaminants of critical concern due to their widespread presence and long term persistence in the environment e g ahrens 2011 cousins et al 2016 xiao 2017 hatton et al 2018 brusseau et al 2020 as such there is great interest in characterizing and modeling their transport and fate in environmental systems most pfas have a propensity for adsorbing at interfaces numerous studies have been conducted for example to investigate pfas interactions at aqueous solid interfaces more recently adsorption of pfas at fluid fluid particularly air water interfaces has become a focus of research as discussed by brusseau 2019a there are at least four major scenarios for which fluid fluid interfacial adsorption may be critically important for the transport and fate of pfas in the environment recent research has demonstrated that soils are a primary reservoir of pfas e g anderson et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020 and has illustrated the potential for pfas contaminated soil to serve as a source of groundwater contamination e g xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 dauchy et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 guo et al 2020 the results of miscible displacement transport experiments mathematical modeling and chemometric analysis have confirmed the significance of air water interfacial adsorption for pfas transport in unsaturated porous media brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 brusseau 2019b 2020 brusseau et al 2019a guo et al 2020 lyu and brusseau 2020 lyu et al 2020 yan et al 2020 li et al 2021 pfas and organic immiscible liquids napl may co exist in some source zones e g moody et al 2003 mcguire et al 2014 and adsorption at napl water interfaces may affect the migration of pfas in such cases mckenzie et al 2016 brusseau 2018 brusseau et al 2019a for a third scenario water droplets and hydrated aerosols in the atmosphere provide air water interface that may serve as retention domains for pfas e g rontu and vaida 2007 mcmurdo et al 2008 psillakis et al 2009 reth et al 2011 which may be significant considering that certain pfas undergo extensive atmospheric transport e g simcik 2005 prevedouros et al 2006 ahrens et al 2011 rauert et al 2018 finally air water interfaces are relevant in several treatment and remediation processes e g vecitis et al 2008 meng et al 2014 dai et al 2019 all of these scenarios require knowledge of the interfacial adsorption behavior of pfas for accurate characterization modeling and design determining robust values for the air water or napl water interfacial adsorption coefficient kia is key to characterizing and modeling pfas transport and fate in these environmental systems therefore there is great interest in the measurement of kia values and in their functional dependency on system conditions of particular concern is the determination of kia values that are representative of the dynamic conditions relevant to transport in the environment the standard method for determining kia values is to measure surface interfacial tension as a function of aqueous concentration and to apply the gibbs adsorption equation this method is a convenient and easily accessible approach for characterizing fluid fluid interfacial adsorption and determining kia values a critical question to address is if this approach produces kia values that are applicable to pfas transport in dynamic environmental systems another issue of particular import for pfas transport in the environment is the concentration dependency of kia values given that environmentally relevant concentrations span many orders of magnitude lyu et al 2018 presented the first comparison of transport measured and surface tension based kia values and examination of their concentration dependency the present study represents an in depth follow up investigation of these issues the objectives of this study are three fold transport experiments and surface tension measurements both produce indirect determinations of fluid fluid interfacial adsorption and associated kia values hence the first objective is to examine the robustness of these methods through a comparison to data generated by direct measurements of fluid fluid interfacial adsorption the results of multiple studies that have used advanced high resolution methods to directly measure adsorbed quantities of surfactant at air water and napl water interfaces are aggregated from the literature to generate a gold standard reference data set this data set provides a robust benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of measurements based on transport experiments surface tension measurements and other methods it also provides a direct means of examining the concentration dependency of kia values for the second objective the largest set of kia data obtained to date from miscible displacement transport experiments is aggregated and analyzed to determine their robustness and concentration dependency a potential source of uncertainty in determining kia values from transport experiments is the need to quantify the magnitude of air water or napl water interface novel approaches are employed herein that minimize or eliminate this potential uncertainty the third objective entails examining the robustness of kia values determined from surface tension data and their relevancy for transport conditions by comparing them to directly measured and transport based values application of the gibbs equation to surface tension data is often accompanied by an assumption of a specific isotherm model which introduces a source of uncertainty an alternative approach is used herein that eliminates the need for isotherm model specification and the associated uncertainty in total this study provides the first comprehensive investigation of the accuracy and robustness of kia values relevant for pfas transport in environmental systems 2 theory the amount of pfas or any substance adsorbed at a fluid fluid interface often referred to as surface excess is defined as γ mol cm2 the relationship between surface excess and the bulk solution concentration c mol cm3 defines the kia 1 k ia γ c where kia has units of cm the gibbs adsorption equation provides a thermodynamically based relationship between surface tension and surface excess 2 γ 1 xrt γ l n c c xrt γ c where γ is the surface or interfacial tension dyn cm or mn m t is temperature k r is the universal gas constant dyne cm mol k and x in simplified terms is a coefficient equal to 1 for systems with nonionic surfactants or ionic surfactants with excess electrolyte in solution and equal to 2 for systems with ionic surfactants without excess electrolyte e g deionized water combining eqs 1 and 2 produces 3 k i a 1 xrt c γ l n c 1 xrt γ c eqs 2 and 3 are greatly significant in that their application allows the determination of γ and kia values respectively from measured surface interfacial tension data for convenience γ and kia values determined in this manner will be referred to henceforth as st gibbs values it is important to note that such values are thermodynamic based measurements derived albeit indirectly from measured surface or interfacial tensions it is widely accepted standard practice in surfactant and surface science fields to apply the gibbs equation to measured surface interfacial tension data to determine surface excess as noted in the introduction a critical question to address is if γ and kia values determined from st gibbs are applicable for the transport of pfas in dynamic environmental systems the first step in such an assessment is to consider and review the inherent validity of γ and kia values determined with st gibbs questions regarding the validity of st gibbs measurements are fundamentally a question of the validity of the gibbs equation or more accurately as will be discussed below its application numerous investigators have demonstrated via detailed treatments that the gibbs adsorption equation is based on rigorous thermodynamic principles e g davies and rideal 1961 defay et al 1966 chattoraj and birdi 1984 this work continues as illustrated by a recent treatment that demonstrated via thermodynamic principles that both zero volume and finite volume assumptions for the gibbs dividing surface produce identical results for the gibbs adsorption equation confirming the thermodynamic generality and rigor of the equation radke 2015 hence there is no question of the inherent validity of the gibbs adsorption equation in and of itself therefore questions of its validity are in reality questions of its application particularly with respect to the use of surface interfacial tension data to determine γ and thus kia the quest to demonstrate experimentally the validity of the gibbs adsorption equation and its application has been ongoing for decades the gold standard approach is to employ an experimental method that can directly measure the amount of adsorbate present at the fluid fluid interface and then to compare the independently measured adsorption isotherm to the one determined from st gibbs numerous methods have been employed to successfully accomplish this including physical collection of the surface excess using microtome or bubble generation systems radiotracer measurement optical methods various spectroscopic methods and neutron reflectometry davies and rideal 1961 and defay et al 1966 provide overviews of the many initial attempts conducted in the early mid 1900 s to use independent measurements to validate application of the gibbs equation many of the earliest attempts employed physical means such as microtomes or bubble generation to physically collect the surface excess for subsequent quantification for example good correspondence was observed between surface excess measured with a microtome method versus st gibbs snavely et al 1962 several investigators have used radiolabeled surfactants to provide direct quantification of the surface excess and shown consistency with st gibbs e g tajima et al 1970 muramatsu et al 1973 more recently neutron reflectometry has become a standard method for the direct measurement of adsorbed surfactant at air water interfaces many of the applications of neutron reflectometry nr for direct measurement of surfactant adsorption at the air water interface have used pfas as the test surfactant simister et al 1992 and downes et al 1995 both reported that γmax values measured directly with nr compared well to those determined with st gibbs for nh4 pfoa an et al 1996 used nr to measure isotherms for cs pfoa na pfoa and h pfoa in the absence and presence of excess electrolyte these directly measured isotherms were compared to those determined with st gibbs they showed that the presence of impurities in solution caused a disparity between the two sets of isotherms for the system without excess electrolyte however the isotherms matched well when the impurities were removed they also matched well for the isotherms measured in solutions containing excess electrolyte the addition of which ameliorates the impacts of impurities downer eastoe et al reported similar results for na perfluorononanoate pfna and na 9 h perfluorononanoate in a series of papers downer et al 1999a observed that isotherms determined with st gibbs deviated from those measured with nr and attributed this disparity to the presence of impurities this was confirmed in follow up studies wherein it was reported that the two sets of isotherms matched well when all sources of impurities were removed downer et al 1999b eastoe et al 2000 similarly the st gibbs based isotherm matched very well to the isotherm measured directly with nr for nh4 pfna sekine et al 2004 in addition to the results reported in the preceding paragraph for the anionic perfluoroalkyls pfoa and pfna consistency between nr measured and st gibbs measured isotherms has been demonstrated for other pfas these include anionic dual chain polyfluoroalkyl sulfosuccinates downer et al 1999b eastoe et al 2000 nonionic perfluoroalkyl triethyleneoxide methyl ethers eastoe et al 2001 nonionic fluorinated ethylene oxides richards et al 2003 eastoe et al 2006 and a nonionic fluorotelomer dupont et al 2003 consistency between nr and st gibbs isotherms has also been reported for a range of hydrocarbon surfactants including anionics cationics nonionics and zwitterionics e g lu et al 1993 hines et al 1997 nave et al 2000 malec et al 2004 used horizontal touch voltammetry htv and brewster angle microscopy as two independent methods to directly measure the air water interfacial adsorption isotherm for a nonionic hydrocarbon surfactant c8tempo the isotherm determined from st gibbs compared very well to the two directly measured isotherms this is shown in the reproduced data presented in fig 1 it is noted that the langmuir isotherm provides an excellent fit to the measured data sets over the entire concentration range in summary it is indisputable that the gibbs adsorption equation is fundamentally valid furthermore the research highlighted above in addition to other works has conclusively demonstrated that application of the gibbs adsorption equation to surface interfacial tension data produces correct measurements of surface excess validating the standard approach hence any discrepancies observed when employing this approach are not an issue of the inherent validity of the gibbs equation itself or its fundamental application but rather the result of experimental limitations related to impurities measurement error or other issues e g an et al 1996 mukherjee et al 2013 martínez balbuena et al 2017 as a corollary kia values determined from st gibbs must therefore also be valid in principle it is particularly noteworthy that many of the experiment based demonstrations of validity discussed above employed various pfas hence there is no readily apparent reason that γ and kia values determined from st gibbs should not be valid in general for the adsorption of pfas at air water or napl water interfaces the relevant question then becomes if such values are applicable for the dynamic conditions of pfas transport in environmental systems 3 methods 3 1 data sets published transport and surface tension data sets are used for this study brusseau and colleagues reported the first pfas kia values determined from unsaturated flow miscible displacement transport experiments lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a brusseau 2020 lyu and brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 the raw data were reprocessed and aggregated as described in the supplemental information si file section si 1 two recent studies of pfoa transport in unsaturated sand conducted by another research group lyu et al 2020 li et al 2021 are available for comparison to the work of brusseau and colleagues these are described in section si 1 of the si surface tension data sets are also reported in the source studies additional pfoa surface tension measurements were conducted for this study as described in the si si 2 several studies reporting direct measurements of the adsorption of surfactants at the air water and napl water interfaces were retrieved from the literature these are listed in table si 1 in the si file transport measured data are presented for three pfas pfoa pfos apmo and for one hydrocarbon surfactant sddbs note that both air water and napl water data are available for pfos from the study of brusseau et al 2019a with decane as the napl directly measured data are presented for three pfas pfoa pfna c6f13peo and for several common hydrocarbon surfactants including sds the acronyms are defined in table si 2 in the si 3 2 miscible displacement transport data analysis the retardation factor r for aqueous phase transport of an adsorbing solute under water unsaturated conditions is defined as e g kim et al 1997 brusseau et al 2007 4 r 1 k d ρ b θ w k ia a ia θ w where kd is the solid phase sorption coefficient cm3 g ρb is porous medium bulk density g cm3 θw is volumetric water content and aia is the specific air water or napl water interfacial area cm2 cm3 note that the latter term represents the amount of fluid fluid interfacial area normalized by the volume of the porous medium the r in eq 4 comprises contributions from all sources of retention the contribution associated with adsorption at the fluid fluid interface is 5 k ia 0 k ia a ia θ w where kia 0 is the nondimensional term representing the magnitude of fluid fluid interface retention which can be considered a normalized kia details of how r and kia 0 are quantified from the breakthrough curves generated from transport experiments are provided in the si section si 1 the description of how measured surface tension data are used in conjunction with the gibbs equation to determine γ and kia values is also provided in the si section si 2 discussion of potential sources of uncertainty for determination of the measurements is provided in relevant sections of the si and in section 4 3 of the results and discussion 4 results and discussion 4 1 data comparisons and concentration scaling γ and kia values measured for multiple pfas and hydrocarbon surfactants in different ionic strength solutions are compared in this study as a function of aqueous concentrations the relevant concentrations for such comparisons are not the actual values but rather the concentrations relative to the respective surface activities of each surfactant solution system hence the aqueous concentrations are scaled to account for the differences in surface activities of the different systems one approach for scaling is to normalize the concentration by a reference concentration such as the critical micelle concentration cmc this approach has been used to scale both surface tension and surface excess data comprising different surfactants and different ionic strengths compositions e g matuura et al 1962 hill et al 2018 other reference concentrations can also be used such as the inflection point of the surface tension curves the point of maximum change in slope which is a critical reference point brusseau 2019a for example the inflection point concentrations are approximately 3 3 10 6 m 3 3 10 5 m and 7 3 10 5 m for pfos pfoa and apmo respectively another approach based on mean ionic activity has been used to scale systems comprising different ionic strengths e g miyajima et al 1980 fainerman et al 2002 for example gurkov et al 2005 used this approach to scale surface coverages calculated from surface tension data for different surfactants including both air water and napl water systems the concept of scaling to match surface activities is illustrated with two sets of surface tension data one reported by lunkenheimer et al 2015 for the c6 c11 series of na perfluorocarboxylic acids and the other set reported by brusseau and van glubt 2019 for na pfoa in different ionic strength solutions see figure si 1 in the si the c6 c11 data exhibit typical behavior wherein the pfas with the longest chain has the greatest surface activity and the surface activities decrease in sequence by chain length for the remaining pfas figure si 1a the surface activity of pfoa is observed to be greater for higher ionic strength as expected figure si 1b these data can be scaled as described above to account for the observed differences in surface activities the data scaled by the respective cmcs are presented in figure si 2a the net result of scaling is that all 9 curves collapse into one master curve this standard scaling procedure produces non dimensional units for the normalized concentrations this can be limiting in cases for which actual concentration units are desired the data scaled by mean ionic activity are presented in figure si 2b it is observed that this scaling approach produces a master curve for all of the pfoa c8 data including the different ionic strengths however this approach does not scale the different pfas a novel scaling method is introduced in this study wherein concentrations are standardized to match the surface activity of a selected common or representative surfactant pfoa is selected for the purposes of this study for the example of pfoa pfos and apmo the net result of applying the alternative scaling with respect to pfoa is that the concentrations for pfos and apmo are in effect multiplied by a scaling factor sf of 10 and 0 45 respectively based on their respective inflection point reference values noted above this produces scaled pfos and apmo aqueous concentrations equivalent to those of pfoa in terms of concordant surface activities this scaling factor can be thought of as the relative surface activity strength of a given surfactant compared to that of pfoa for example pfos can be considered to have a 10 times greater surface activity than pfoa for a given non scaled concentration this approach allows the use of actual concentration units rather than normalized units it is critical to note that this scaling procedure does not change the inherent nature of the individual data sets it only translates the curves along the x axis to facilitate direct comparison specifically the curve is translated rightward for sf 1 and leftward for sf 1 thus the actual nature of the relationships e g the γ c and γ c profiles is preserved application of this approach to the data sets presented in figure si 1 is shown in figure si 2c all data sets collapse into one master curve the respective scaling factors are reported in the figure caption scaled with respect to pfoa it is observed that the scaling factors are larger than 1 for the pfas with greater activities longer chains and less than 1 for those with weaker activities shorter chains similarly the scaling factors are greater than 1 for the two non zero ionic strength data sets 4 2 direct measurements of surfactant adsorption at the fluid fluid interface several methods have been used to directly measure the adsorbed quantity of surfactant at the fluid fluid interface γ as previously discussed data sets collected from the literature for pfoa pfna c6f13peo and 7 hydrocarbon surfactants are presented in fig 2a the specific data sets used in the figure along with the respective γmax and scaling factors are reported in table si 1 the measurements of γ were extended to sufficient concentrations to attain maximum values therefore the γmax values used for normalizing γ were determined directly from the measured data as noted above the concentration scaling does not alter the γ c profiles of the individual data sets to illustrate the γ c data for sds and sdbs plotted with actual unscaled concentrations are reported in fig 2b comparison of figs 2a and 2b shows identical overall γ c profiles irrespective of scaling or no scaling together these observations indicate that the normalization and scaling procedure did not introduce bias or uncertainty to the analysis the striking observation for fig 2a is the consistency of all of the data sets the measured data span more than 4 5 orders of magnitude in aqueous concentration of particular import the measurements span from 100 down to 0 6 relative surface coverage γ γmax in total the data represent 11 different direct measurement methods notably data reported for sds comprise 6 different measurement methods also of note is that three data sets are reported for napl water systems and that the data sets include measurements for solutions with ionic strengths of 0 1 0 01 and 0 these factors increase the degree of difficulty for and broaden the applicability of the comparative assessment one important point to address is the equilibrium conditions of the measurements neutron reflectometry is considered to provide equilibrium measures of surface excess e g eastoe et al 2000 2003 this has been confirmed for example by comparison of nr measured isotherms to those measured by drop volume tensiometry e g downer et al 1999b eastoe et al 2000 2001 2006 nave et al 2000 dupont et al 2003 the use of which ensures equilibrium is attained e g downer et al 1999a eastoe et al 2000 2001 as noted above 6 measurement methods were reported for sds the isotherms measured for sds by the five other methods are consistent with the nr measured isotherm this indicates that the surface excesses measured by these other methods also represent equilibrium conditions it is critical to recognize that most of these measurements were obtained with advanced high resolution methods designed to directly characterize soft matter surfaces and interfaces these include the htv bam vsfs niciss irras and nr methods the other methods represent ingenious approaches for the physical collection microtome bubble generation emulsion formation or direct measurement radiotracer of surface excess as such these data represent the most accurate and robust direct measurements of surfactant adsorption at fluid fluid interfaces available this data set serves as a gold standard benchmark to which to compare measurements obtained with other methods measured kia values can be determined from the data presented in fig 2 by application of eq 1 normalized kia values determined for the entire data set presented in fig 2a are shown in fig 3 a the non scaled data set for air water interfacial adsorption of sds and sdbs determined from the data presented in fig 2b is shown in fig 3b the kia c functions are similar for scaled and non scaled data consistent with the adsorption isotherms to our knowledge these data represent the first reported kia values obtained from direct high resolution measurements of surfactant adsorption at air water and napl water interfaces it is clearly evident that the kia values asymptotically approach and eventually attain constant values at lower aqueous concentrations the slope of the curve begins to decrease at a concentration 10 4 m and attains constancy at 10 5 m after which it remains constant for more than 1 5 orders of magnitude change in concentration these results clearly demonstrate that kia values for surfactant absorption at fluid fluid interfaces are subject to a maximum upper limit at lower concentrations 4 3 transport measured γ and kia values uncertainty analysis example arrival fronts for transport of pfoa pfos and apmo in the sand under unsaturated conditions are shown in figure si 3 the magnitude of retardation is observed to be greatest for pfos the pfas with the longest chain and greatest surface activity whereas apmo which has the shortest chain and weakest surface activity has the lowest magnitude of retardation the contribution of solid phase sorption to retardation is relatively low for all three pfas in addition the magnitude of aia is similar for all three experiments because similar water saturations were used hence the observed significant differences in retardation are due to the relative magnitudes of air water interfacial adsorption i e kia among the three pfas there are four primary sources of uncertainty in the determination of kia and γ values from transport experiments the first two comprise measurement uncertainty associated with the transport experiments and the data analysis methods used to determine retardation factors these two sources are discussed in sections si 3 and si 4 respectively of the si in summary the methods used are demonstrably robust the third source of uncertainty entails quantifying the contribution of solid phase sorption for the determination of kia 0 with eq 4 specification of aia for determination of kia from eq 5 is the fourth source of uncertainty this latter step can be problematic in some cases particularly for porous media that have not been sufficiently characterized inaccurate characterization of kd and or aia can be a source of uncertainty in generating representative kia and γ values from transport experiments these potential constraints are mitigated in this study through the use of highly characterized media the transport data used for this study were generated from experiments employing commercially available natural well sorted quartz sand several advantages accrue to using such a porous medium first this type of sand has been used in many transport studies conducted by numerous investigators and as such it serves as a reference natural porous medium second our prior studies have shown that the sand has a very low magnitude of solid phase sorption for the select pfas used in the transport experiments in addition this sorption has been well characterized and quantified with both transport and batch isotherm experiments van glubt et al 2021 as a result the second term on the r h s of eq 4 is both minor and well quantified which means there is minimal associated uncertainty another primary advantage of using the selected sand is that it is likely that more measurements of fluid fluid interfacial areas have been reported for this particular medium than for any other porous medium this provides a significant degree of certainty in determining relevant aia values for use in eq 5 in addition this medium has an appreciable magnitude of air water interfacial area for the conditions of the experiments the actual air water interfacial areas range from 3800 to 7500 cm2 depending on the volume of the column employed these large magnitudes provide great sensitivity to adsorption at the air water interface thereby enhancing the determination of robust kia values multiple methods are available to measure aia including various interfacial tracer techniques e g kim et al 1997 anwar et al 2000 schaefer et al 2000 brusseau et al 2007 2008 araujo et al 2015 zhong et al 2016 a gas absorption chemical reaction method lyu et al 2017 and high resolution x ray microtomography xmt brusseau et al 2006 2007 araujo and brusseau 2019 2020 these methods have been used in multiple studies to measure aia values for the sand used in this study measured values for the water saturations 65 relevant to the transport experiments are presented in table si 3 inspection of table si 3 reveals that the measured fluid fluid interfacial areas range from 30 to 100 cm 1 the smallest values are those measured by xmt a recent study demonstrated that xmt imaging provides very accurate and reproducible measurements of aia including for the sand used in the present study araujo and brusseau 2020 aia values measured with xmt can therefore be considered as benchmark baseline values for the sand however it is critical to note that the xmt values are smaller than actual transport relevant values due to the fact that the xmt method does not measure interfacial area associated with microscopic surface roughness brusseau et al 2007 2008 interfacial tracer tests do characterize the contribution of microscopic surface roughness to fluid fluid interfacial areas e g kim et al 1999 schaefer et al 2000 brusseau et al 2007 2008 jiang et al 2020 interfacial areas measured with aqueous phase interfacial tracer tests are anticipated to be the most relevant for pfas transport scenarios given the similarity of the experiment systems brusseau 2019b 2020 the tracer based aia values measured for saturations of 0 65 are in the range of 70 to 100 cm 1 the most relevant is the 87 cm 1 value obtained for an air water system with the miscible displacement tracer method row 3 in table 1 the mean of the 6 tracer test aia measurements rows 3 8 is 85 cm 1 9 7 95 ci which is close to the prior noted value the uncertainty in aia is 11 based on the 95 ci determined for the different interfacial tracer test measurements interestingly this value is very similar to the 9 measurement uncertainty reported by el ouni et al 2021 for the aqueous miscible displacement interfacial tracer method considering the existence of multiple consistent independent aia measurements for the sand it can be concluded that there is a relatively high degree of confidence in the aia values employed and concomitantly that there is a correspondingly low degree of uncertainty in the determination of γ and kia values from the transport experiments the measurement uncertainty for θw 1 contributes minimally to γ and kia uncertainty an additional transport measured data set is obtained from experiments conducted for the transport of sddbs in an unsaturated glass bead medium el ouni et al 2021 air water interfacial areas have been measured for this medium with high resolution xmt araujo and brusseau 2020 prior work has demonstrated that these glass beads do not have measurable surface roughness araujo and brusseau 2019 therefore the aia values measured by xmt can be used in eq 5 to determine kia for the transport experiments these values have minimal uncertainty given the availability of the xmt measured aia values the γ values measured from the miscible displacement transport experiments are presented in fig 4 the relatively high degree of certainty associated with the column measured data is illustrated in multiple ways first γ values were measured for pfoa in 7 separate transport experiments for the data point labeled in the figure and the 95 ci is within the size of the data symbol of particular note these experiments not only included replicate tests but also tests conducted under different conditions water content pore water velocity solution conditions second the measurement uncertainty for these values due to uncertainty in determination of aia 11 as noted above is equivalent to 1 3 larger than the size of the data symbols third the γ value determined from the independent pfoa transport study of li et al 2021 is consistent with the values determined from lyu et al 2018 fourth the values determined for air water and napl water systems are consistent for pfos finally in aggregate the transport measured data span relative surface coverages from 100 to 0 01 all of the values are approximately coincident along an identical γ c profile illustrating great consistency amongst the data sets 4 4 comparison of transport measured γ and kia values to directly measured values the transport measured γ data from fig 4 are combined with the directly measured data from fig 2a and presented in fig 5 some of the direct measured data sets reported in fig 2a are not included to reduce clutter together data are presented for a total of five pfas with three column measured data sets pfoa pfos apmo and three directly measured data sets pfoa pfna c6f13peo the measured data span approximately 6 5 orders of magnitude in aqueous concentration critically the transport measured data are observed to be fully consistent with the directly measured data specifically γ values for the two methods are entirely coincident in the region of overlapping concentrations which spans 4 orders of magnitude furthermore the two data sets adhere to an identical γ c profile the great consistency among γ data sets measured with different methods by different investigators for different surfactants is quite remarkable these results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy of the transport measured values the concentration dependency of the column measured kia data can be examined now that they have been determined to be robust kia values measured from the transport experiments are presented in fig 6 the kias clearly attain constant values at lower concentrations furthermore these constant values are maintained over 2 orders of magnitude these results clearly demonstrate that transport measured kias are subject to maximum limiting values at lower aqueous concentrations this is fully consistent with the results obtained for the direct measurement methods fig 3 4 5 alternative analysis of the concentration dependency of kia 0 and kia the determination of kia values from transport experiments is generally faced with potential uncertainty due to the need to specify the air water interfacial area however perspicacious use of eqs 4 and 5 provides a means to eliminate this uncertainty when examining the condition dependency of kia inspection of eq 5 shows that kia 0 is a function of kia aia and θw notably the values of aia and θw remain constant for experiments conducted with the same porous medium and water content thus experiments conducted in this manner allow one to investigate the influence of system variables specifically on kia without the need to specify aia for the present study the concentration dependency of kia 0 and thus kia is investigated by examining the results of transport experiments conducted with different input concentrations for the same medium and water content even though the kia values measured from the transport experiments were demonstrated to be robust in the preceding section this alternative analysis is conducted to provide an additional independent means of investigation to compare amongst the three pfas the kia 0 values are normalized by dividing by a reference kia 0 a standard reference value would be the maximum kia 0 value for each pfas however it is not desirable to make assumptions about maximum values for this analysis given the focus is on determining the concentration dependency hence an arbitrary reference is selected of kia 0 c 1 i e the respective value of kia 0 measured for each pfas at the input concentration of 1 mg l the set of kia 0 values for each pfas is scaled by the respective kia 0 c 1 for that particular pfas importantly this normalization procedure preserves the respective profiles of the individual kia 0 c functions for each pfas the aqueous concentration is not scaled for this analysis the normalized kia 0 values as a function of aqueous concentration are presented in fig 7 the kia 0 values asymptotically approach maximum values which are attained at concentrations of approximately 0 1 to 1 mg l there is some variability between the three pfas due to non scaling of the concentrations pfos is observed to exhibit a sharper slope than pfoa whereas apmo exhibits a much more moderate slope both consistent with the respective differences in surface activities as noted previously these data represent experiments that were conducted with the same porous medium and similar water contents hence these results demonstrate that kia values determined from the transport experiments exhibit asymptotic approaches to maximum values for these three pfas this conclusion is determined without the need to specify aia and therefore is not subject to any uncertainty in that regard the results of this analysis are consistent with the prior analyses 4 6 comparison of direct transport and st gibbs measurements γ and kia values determined by applying the gibbs adsorption equation to measured surface tension data for pfoa are presented in figs 4 6 inspection of fig 5 reveals that the st gibbs values are fully consistent with the data obtained by the direct measurement methods this illustrates the consistency of st gibbs and direct measured data discussed in the theory section as noted therein the consistency of the two data sets demonstrates the validity of applying the gibbs equation to surface interfacial tension data to determine γ and kia inspection of figs 4 6 shows that the st gibbs data are consistent with the transport measured data this is further examined by comparing the full set of transport measured kia values to st gibbs determined values in fig 8 excellent correspondence is exhibited among the large number of measurements 41 total this data set comprises kia values determined for solutions of 4 different ionic strengths 1 5 5 10 and 30 mm two ionic compositions nacl and cacl2 different phs 5 8 and for tests conducted with different water saturations ranging from 0 4 0 86 and mean pore water velocities and for three pfas hence the data span a wide range of conditions these results demonstrate that the gibbs adsorption equation can be applied to measured surface interfacial tension data to determine kia values that are representative for transport conditions specific kia values determined from nr direct measurements the transport experiments and from st gibbs can be compared for further assessment of consistency this is done for pfoa in 0 01 m nacl at an aqueous concentration of 10 μg l any such assessment should account for measurement uncertainty for each of the methods nr measurements have a reported uncertainty of 5 see the relevant references cited for the nr data the uncertainty associated with the surface tension measurements and the transport experiments is discussed in section si 2 of the si and section 4 3 respectively the following kia values are determined nr 0 0032 0 0030 0 0034 transport 0 0033 0 0028 0 0038 and st gibbs 0 0032 0 0024 0 0040 the comparison reveals that the mean values for all three are essentially identical as a result of this consistency predicted retardation factors calculated using either the nr or st gibbs kia values match the measured r values obtained from the transport experiments data not shown the kia values measured for pfoa with the three methods as a function of concentration are compared in figure si 4 with no normalization or scaling applied it is observed that the kia c profiles for all three measurements are coincident within the measurement uncertainty the results are consistent with the original comparison reported by lyu et al 2018 inspection of fig 5 shows that the langmuir isotherm provides an excellent match to all of the measured data it is notable that the isotherm was fit only to the pfoa data obtained from the direct nr measurements none of the transport measured data st gibbs data or the other directly measured data were used for the isotherm fitting this further supports the consistency of the data sets it also demonstrates that the langmuir isotherm is appropriate for describing these data over an extremely large 6 5 log aqueous concentration range and 4 log range in measured interfacial adsorption the isotherm represents both the linear adsorption observed at lower concentrations as the langmuir isotherm reduces to the henry linear isotherm at low concentrations while also representing the attainment of maximum interfacial adsorption at high concentrations 4 7 surface coverage and critical concentrations the directly measured γ data can be used to characterize relative surface coverage γ γmax for fluid fluid interfacial adsorption inspection of figs 2 4 and 5 shows that the surface coverages for all 5 pfas and all 8 hydrocarbon surfactants in different ionic strength solutions and including both air water and napl water systems collapse to one master curve upon scaling as noted above this illustrates the concurrence of fluid fluid interfacial adsorption behavior amongst the various systems in terms of relative surface coverage hence surface coverage can be considered a controlling discriminant for surfactant behavior with equivalence and correlation to surface activity the normalized kia is compared to the surface coverage in fig 9 the concentration at which kia approaches 95 of the maximum corresponds to approximately 10 surface coverage hence the region wherein kia is essentially constant and for which the measured adsorption isotherm is effectively linear has surface coverages of 10 similar results are obtained using the directly measured sds sdbs data figure si 5 the expectation of linear fluid fluid interfacial adsorption at very low surface coverages is widely established in surfactant and surface science e g chang and franses 1995 eastoe and dalton 2000 berg 2010 danov and kralchevsky 2012 romsted 2014 tadros 2015 lang and liu 2016 aveyard 2019 this is often referred to as henry s adsorption such ideal linear behavior is consistent with coverages that are sufficiently low such that lateral interactions amongst adsorbed monomers is minimal and the total occupied area is small relative to the total interfacial area the linear isotherm and constant kia observed at low concentrations for the directly measured data and the transport measured data are consistent with ideal conditions at low surface coverage the specific concentration at which the onset of linear adsorption and constant kia will be observed for any given surfactant will depend on the surface activity of that particular surfactant and when the degree of surface coverage becomes sufficiently low such that adsorption becomes ideal in terms of a readily measurable property such as the surface tension function figure si 6 shows that pfoa surface tension begins to decrease significantly in the range of 10 surface coverage this is consistent with the results reported for ctab by mukherjee et al 2013 the critical surface coverage for surface tension reduction is consistent with that for the attainment of kia constancy these results highlight an important point concerning the adsorption behavior of surfactants at fluid fluid interfaces with regards to concentration related effects it is not the actual concentration that is of import but rather the concentration with respect to the surface activity and degree of surface coverage under the extant conditions one may define a set of concentration regimes based on correlation of the ranges of pfas concentrations observed in environmental systems of interest to transport phenomenon of import for the example of pfas adsorption at fluid fluid interfaces the critical concentrations at which kia values approach their maximum are likely to be higher than measured concentrations at many but not all sites as noted by brusseau 2019a the critical concentrations may be lower than measured concentrations for example at some afff source zones this approach can be applied to other transport phenomena of relevance to pfas fate in the environment 5 conclusion direct high resolution measurements of surfactant adsorption at the air water and napl water interface were aggregated from the literature these data represent the most accurate and robust measurements of γ and kia values that exist to date this data set provides a gold standard benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of measurements based on transport experiments surface tension measurements and other methods it is anticipated that this data set will be useful for future development and testing of methods for measurement and estimation of pfas adsorption at fluid fluid interfaces the largest data set to date of γ and kia values measured from transport experiments was compiled from several miscible displacement studies investigating the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media although the need to specify aia can be an impediment to accurate determination of kia values from transport experiments the use of highly characterized media with robust measures of aia minimized this issue for the present study γ and kia values determined from the transport measured data were observed to be fully consistent with the directly measured data these results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy of the transport measured values this in turn validates the efficacy of the methods used for the transport experiments and the values used for aia γ and kia values determined from the application of the gibbs equation to measured surface tension data were fully consistent with the directly measured and transport measured data the directly measured data were used to examine the concentration dependency of kia values which clearly demonstrated that kia attains a constant maximum value at lower concentrations two separate analyses of the transport measured data both produced observations of constant kia values at lower concentrations consistent with the directly measured data the critical concentration at which adsorption is effectively linear and kia approaches its maximum depends on the relative surface coverage which is a function of the surface activity of the particular pfas under the extant conditions the importance of evaluating concentrations in terms of surface activities and surface coverage and the concept of defining critical concentrations in reference to pfas transport phenomena of interest was discussed the outcomes of this study should be of relevance to the characterization and modeling of pfas transport and fate in multiple environmental systems the results of this study elucidate the fundamental concentration dependency behavior for pfas fluid fluid interfacial adsorption however the actual magnitudes and significance of interfacial adsorption particularly for field systems are a function of a number of factors and other processes as described in prior studies e g brusseau 2018 2019b 2020 brusseau and

17309,determining robust values for the air water or napl water interfacial adsorption coefficient kia is key to characterizing and modeling pfas transport and fate in several environmental systems direct high resolution measurements of surfactant adsorption at the fluid fluid interface were aggregated from the literature this data set was used to examine the accuracy and applicability of γ and kia measurements determined for three pfas from transport experiments and surface tension data the transport measured γ and kia data were observed to be fully consistent with the directly measured data specifically γ values for the two methods were entirely coincident in the region of overlapping concentrations which spanned 4 orders of magnitude furthermore the two data sets adhered to an identical γ c profile these results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy of the transport measured values γ and kia values determined from the application of the gibbs adsorption equation to measured surface tension data were fully consistent with the directly measured and transport measured data sets demonstrating their applicability for representing pfas transport in environmental systems the directly measured data were used to examine the concentration dependency of kia values absent the potential confounding effects associated with the use of surface tension or transport measured data

certain pfas undergo extensive atmospheric transport e g simcik 2005 prevedouros et al 2006 ahrens et al 2011 rauert et al 2018 finally air water interfaces are relevant in several treatment and remediation processes e g vecitis et al 2008 meng et al 2014 dai et al 2019 all of these scenarios require knowledge of the interfacial adsorption behavior of pfas for accurate characterization modeling and design determining robust values for the air water or napl water interfacial adsorption coefficient kia is key to characterizing and modeling pfas transport and fate in these environmental systems therefore there is great interest in the measurement of kia values and in their functional dependency on system conditions of particular concern is the determination of kia values that are representative of the dynamic conditions relevant to transport in the environment the standard method for determining kia values is to measure surface interfacial tension as a function of aqueous concentration and to apply the gibbs adsorption equation this method is a convenient and easily accessible approach for characterizing fluid fluid interfacial adsorption and determining kia values a critical question to address is if this approach produces kia values that are applicable to pfas transport in dynamic environmental systems another issue of particular import for pfas transport in the environment is the concentration dependency of kia values given that environmentally relevant concentrations span many orders of magnitude lyu et al 2018 presented the first comparison of transport measured and surface tension based kia values and examination of their concentration dependency the present study represents an in depth follow up investigation of these issues the objectives of this study are three fold transport experiments and surface tension measurements both produce indirect determinations of fluid fluid interfacial adsorption and associated kia values hence the first objective is to examine the robustness of these methods through a comparison to data generated by direct measurements of fluid fluid interfacial adsorption the results of multiple studies that have used advanced high resolution methods to directly measure adsorbed quantities of surfactant at air water and napl water interfaces are aggregated from the literature to generate a gold standard reference data set this data set provides a robust benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of measurements based on transport experiments surface tension measurements and other methods it also provides a direct means of examining the concentration dependency of kia values for the second objective the largest set of kia data obtained to date from miscible displacement transport experiments is aggregated and analyzed to determine their robustness and concentration dependency a potential source of uncertainty in determining kia values from transport experiments is the need to quantify the magnitude of air water or napl water interface novel approaches are employed herein that minimize or eliminate this potential uncertainty the third objective entails examining the robustness of kia values determined from surface tension data and their relevancy for transport conditions by comparing them to directly measured and transport based values application of the gibbs equation to surface tension data is often accompanied by an assumption of a specific isotherm model which introduces a source of uncertainty an alternative approach is used herein that eliminates the need for isotherm model specification and the associated uncertainty in total this study provides the first comprehensive investigation of the accuracy and robustness of kia values relevant for pfas transport in environmental systems 2 theory the amount of pfas or any substance adsorbed at a fluid fluid interface often referred to as surface excess is defined as γ mol cm2 the relationship between surface excess and the bulk solution concentration c mol cm3 defines the kia 1 k ia γ c where kia has units of cm the gibbs adsorption equation provides a thermodynamically based relationship between surface tension and surface excess 2 γ 1 xrt γ l n c c xrt γ c where γ is the surface or interfacial tension dyn cm or mn m t is temperature k r is the universal gas constant dyne cm mol k and x in simplified terms is a coefficient equal to 1 for systems with nonionic surfactants or ionic surfactants with excess electrolyte in solution and equal to 2 for systems with ionic surfactants without excess electrolyte e g deionized water combining eqs 1 and 2 produces 3 k i a 1 xrt c γ l n c 1 xrt γ c eqs 2 and 3 are greatly significant in that their application allows the determination of γ and kia values respectively from measured surface interfacial tension data for convenience γ and kia values determined in this manner will be referred to henceforth as st gibbs values it is important to note that such values are thermodynamic based measurements derived albeit indirectly from measured surface or interfacial tensions it is widely accepted standard practice in surfactant and surface science fields to apply the gibbs equation to measured surface interfacial tension data to determine surface excess as noted in the introduction a critical question to address is if γ and kia values determined from st gibbs are applicable for the transport of pfas in dynamic environmental systems the first step in such an assessment is to consider and review the inherent validity of γ and kia values determined with st gibbs questions regarding the validity of st gibbs measurements are fundamentally a question of the validity of the gibbs equation or more accurately as will be discussed below its application numerous investigators have demonstrated via detailed treatments that the gibbs adsorption equation is based on rigorous thermodynamic principles e g davies and rideal 1961 defay et al 1966 chattoraj and birdi 1984 this work continues as illustrated by a recent treatment that demonstrated via thermodynamic principles that both zero volume and finite volume assumptions for the gibbs dividing surface produce identical results for the gibbs adsorption equation confirming the thermodynamic generality and rigor of the equation radke 2015 hence there is no question of the inherent validity of the gibbs adsorption equation in and of itself therefore questions of its validity are in reality questions of its application particularly with respect to the use of surface interfacial tension data to determine γ and thus kia the quest to demonstrate experimentally the validity of the gibbs adsorption equation and its application has been ongoing for decades the gold standard approach is to employ an experimental method that can directly measure the amount of adsorbate present at the fluid fluid interface and then to compare the independently measured adsorption isotherm to the one determined from st gibbs numerous methods have been employed to successfully accomplish this including physical collection of the surface excess using microtome or bubble generation systems radiotracer measurement optical methods various spectroscopic methods and neutron reflectometry davies and rideal 1961 and defay et al 1966 provide overviews of the many initial attempts conducted in the early mid 1900 s to use independent measurements to validate application of the gibbs equation many of the earliest attempts employed physical means such as microtomes or bubble generation to physically collect the surface excess for subsequent quantification for example good correspondence was observed between surface excess measured with a microtome method versus st gibbs snavely et al 1962 several investigators have used radiolabeled surfactants to provide direct quantification of the surface excess and shown consistency with st gibbs e g tajima et al 1970 muramatsu et al 1973 more recently neutron reflectometry has become a standard method for the direct measurement of adsorbed surfactant at air water interfaces many of the applications of neutron reflectometry nr for direct measurement of surfactant adsorption at the air water interface have used pfas as the test surfactant simister et al 1992 and downes et al 1995 both reported that γmax values measured directly with nr compared well to those determined with st gibbs for nh4 pfoa an et al 1996 used nr to measure isotherms for cs pfoa na pfoa and h pfoa in the absence and presence of excess electrolyte these directly measured isotherms were compared to those determined with st gibbs they showed that the presence of impurities in solution caused a disparity between the two sets of isotherms for the system without excess electrolyte however the isotherms matched well when the impurities were removed they also matched well for the isotherms measured in solutions containing excess electrolyte the addition of which ameliorates the impacts of impurities downer eastoe et al reported similar results for na perfluorononanoate pfna and na 9 h perfluorononanoate in a series of papers downer et al 1999a observed that isotherms determined with st gibbs deviated from those measured with nr and attributed this disparity to the presence of impurities this was confirmed in follow up studies wherein it was reported that the two sets of isotherms matched well when all sources of impurities were removed downer et al 1999b eastoe et al 2000 similarly the st gibbs based isotherm matched very well to the isotherm measured directly with nr for nh4 pfna sekine et al 2004 in addition to the results reported in the preceding paragraph for the anionic perfluoroalkyls pfoa and pfna consistency between nr measured and st gibbs measured isotherms has been demonstrated for other pfas these include anionic dual chain polyfluoroalkyl sulfosuccinates downer et al 1999b eastoe et al 2000 nonionic perfluoroalkyl triethyleneoxide methyl ethers eastoe et al 2001 nonionic fluorinated ethylene oxides richards et al 2003 eastoe et al 2006 and a nonionic fluorotelomer dupont et al 2003 consistency between nr and st gibbs isotherms has also been reported for a range of hydrocarbon surfactants including anionics cationics nonionics and zwitterionics e g lu et al 1993 hines et al 1997 nave et al 2000 malec et al 2004 used horizontal touch voltammetry htv and brewster angle microscopy as two independent methods to directly measure the air water interfacial adsorption isotherm for a nonionic hydrocarbon surfactant c8tempo the isotherm determined from st gibbs compared very well to the two directly measured isotherms this is shown in the reproduced data presented in fig 1 it is noted that the langmuir isotherm provides an excellent fit to the measured data sets over the entire concentration range in summary it is indisputable that the gibbs adsorption equation is fundamentally valid furthermore the research highlighted above in addition to other works has conclusively demonstrated that application of the gibbs adsorption equation to surface interfacial tension data produces correct measurements of surface excess validating the standard approach hence any discrepancies observed when employing this approach are not an issue of the inherent validity of the gibbs equation itself or its fundamental application but rather the result of experimental limitations related to impurities measurement error or other issues e g an et al 1996 mukherjee et al 2013 martínez balbuena et al 2017 as a corollary kia values determined from st gibbs must therefore also be valid in principle it is particularly noteworthy that many of the experiment based demonstrations of validity discussed above employed various pfas hence there is no readily apparent reason that γ and kia values determined from st gibbs should not be valid in general for the adsorption of pfas at air water or napl water interfaces the relevant question then becomes if such values are applicable for the dynamic conditions of pfas transport in environmental systems 3 methods 3 1 data sets published transport and surface tension data sets are used for this study brusseau and colleagues reported the first pfas kia values determined from unsaturated flow miscible displacement transport experiments lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019a brusseau 2020 lyu and brusseau 2020 yan et al 2020 the raw data were reprocessed and aggregated as described in the supplemental information si file section si 1 two recent studies of pfoa transport in unsaturated sand conducted by another research group lyu et al 2020 li et al 2021 are available for comparison to the work of brusseau and colleagues these are described in section si 1 of the si surface tension data sets are also reported in the source studies additional pfoa surface tension measurements were conducted for this study as described in the si si 2 several studies reporting direct measurements of the adsorption of surfactants at the air water and napl water interfaces were retrieved from the literature these are listed in table si 1 in the si file transport measured data are presented for three pfas pfoa pfos apmo and for one hydrocarbon surfactant sddbs note that both air water and napl water data are available for pfos from the study of brusseau et al 2019a with decane as the napl directly measured data are presented for three pfas pfoa pfna c6f13peo and for several common hydrocarbon surfactants including sds the acronyms are defined in table si 2 in the si 3 2 miscible displacement transport data analysis the retardation factor r for aqueous phase transport of an adsorbing solute under water unsaturated conditions is defined as e g kim et al 1997 brusseau et al 2007 4 r 1 k d ρ b θ w k ia a ia θ w where kd is the solid phase sorption coefficient cm3 g ρb is porous medium bulk density g cm3 θw is volumetric water content and aia is the specific air water or napl water interfacial area cm2 cm3 note that the latter term represents the amount of fluid fluid interfacial area normalized by the volume of the porous medium the r in eq 4 comprises contributions from all sources of retention the contribution associated with adsorption at the fluid fluid interface is 5 k ia 0 k ia a ia θ w where kia 0 is the nondimensional term representing the magnitude of fluid fluid interface retention which can be considered a normalized kia details of how r and kia 0 are quantified from the breakthrough curves generated from transport experiments are provided in the si section si 1 the description of how measured surface tension data are used in conjunction with the gibbs equation to determine γ and kia values is also provided in the si section si 2 discussion of potential sources of uncertainty for determination of the measurements is provided in relevant sections of the si and in section 4 3 of the results and discussion 4 results and discussion 4 1 data comparisons and concentration scaling γ and kia values measured for multiple pfas and hydrocarbon surfactants in different ionic strength solutions are compared in this study as a function of aqueous concentrations the relevant concentrations for such comparisons are not the actual values but rather the concentrations relative to the respective surface activities of each surfactant solution system hence the aqueous concentrations are scaled to account for the differences in surface activities of the different systems one approach for scaling is to normalize the concentration by a reference concentration such as the critical micelle concentration cmc this approach has been used to scale both surface tension and surface excess data comprising different surfactants and different ionic strengths compositions e g matuura et al 1962 hill et al 2018 other reference concentrations can also be used such as the inflection point of the surface tension curves the point of maximum change in slope which is a critical reference point brusseau 2019a for example the inflection point concentrations are approximately 3 3 10 6 m 3 3 10 5 m and 7 3 10 5 m for pfos pfoa and apmo respectively another approach based on mean ionic activity has been used to scale systems comprising different ionic strengths e g miyajima et al 1980 fainerman et al 2002 for example gurkov et al 2005 used this approach to scale surface coverages calculated from surface tension data for different surfactants including both air water and napl water systems the concept of scaling to match surface activities is illustrated with two sets of surface tension data one reported by lunkenheimer et al 2015 for the c6 c11 series of na perfluorocarboxylic acids and the other set reported by brusseau and van glubt 2019 for na pfoa in different ionic strength solutions see figure si 1 in the si the c6 c11 data exhibit typical behavior wherein the pfas with the longest chain has the greatest surface activity and the surface activities decrease in sequence by chain length for the remaining pfas figure si 1a the surface activity of pfoa is observed to be greater for higher ionic strength as expected figure si 1b these data can be scaled as described above to account for the observed differences in surface activities the data scaled by the respective cmcs are presented in figure si 2a the net result of scaling is that all 9 curves collapse into one master curve this standard scaling procedure produces non dimensional units for the normalized concentrations this can be limiting in cases for which actual concentration units are desired the data scaled by mean ionic activity are presented in figure si 2b it is observed that this scaling approach produces a master curve for all of the pfoa c8 data including the different ionic strengths however this approach does not scale the different pfas a novel scaling method is introduced in this study wherein concentrations are standardized to match the surface activity of a selected common or representative surfactant pfoa is selected for the purposes of this study for the example of pfoa pfos and apmo the net result of applying the alternative scaling with respect to pfoa is that the concentrations for pfos and apmo are in effect multiplied by a scaling factor sf of 10 and 0 45 respectively based on their respective inflection point reference values noted above this produces scaled pfos and apmo aqueous concentrations equivalent to those of pfoa in terms of concordant surface activities this scaling factor can be thought of as the relative surface activity strength of a given surfactant compared to that of pfoa for example pfos can be considered to have a 10 times greater surface activity than pfoa for a given non scaled concentration this approach allows the use of actual concentration units rather than normalized units it is critical to note that this scaling procedure does not change the inherent nature of the individual data sets it only translates the curves along the x axis to facilitate direct comparison specifically the curve is translated rightward for sf 1 and leftward for sf 1 thus the actual nature of the relationships e g the γ c and γ c profiles is preserved application of this approach to the data sets presented in figure si 1 is shown in figure si 2c all data sets collapse into one master curve the respective scaling factors are reported in the figure caption scaled with respect to pfoa it is observed that the scaling factors are larger than 1 for the pfas with greater activities longer chains and less than 1 for those with weaker activities shorter chains similarly the scaling factors are greater than 1 for the two non zero ionic strength data sets 4 2 direct measurements of surfactant adsorption at the fluid fluid interface several methods have been used to directly measure the adsorbed quantity of surfactant at the fluid fluid interface γ as previously discussed data sets collected from the literature for pfoa pfna c6f13peo and 7 hydrocarbon surfactants are presented in fig 2a the specific data sets used in the figure along with the respective γmax and scaling factors are reported in table si 1 the measurements of γ were extended to sufficient concentrations to attain maximum values therefore the γmax values used for normalizing γ were determined directly from the measured data as noted above the concentration scaling does not alter the γ c profiles of the individual data sets to illustrate the γ c data for sds and sdbs plotted with actual unscaled concentrations are reported in fig 2b comparison of figs 2a and 2b shows identical overall γ c profiles irrespective of scaling or no scaling together these observations indicate that the normalization and scaling procedure did not introduce bias or uncertainty to the analysis the striking observation for fig 2a is the consistency of all of the data sets the measured data span more than 4 5 orders of magnitude in aqueous concentration of particular import the measurements span from 100 down to 0 6 relative surface coverage γ γmax in total the data represent 11 different direct measurement methods notably data reported for sds comprise 6 different measurement methods also of note is that three data sets are reported for napl water systems and that the data sets include measurements for solutions with ionic strengths of 0 1 0 01 and 0 these factors increase the degree of difficulty for and broaden the applicability of the comparative assessment one important point to address is the equilibrium conditions of the measurements neutron reflectometry is considered to provide equilibrium measures of surface excess e g eastoe et al 2000 2003 this has been confirmed for example by comparison of nr measured isotherms to those measured by drop volume tensiometry e g downer et al 1999b eastoe et al 2000 2001 2006 nave et al 2000 dupont et al 2003 the use of which ensures equilibrium is attained e g downer et al 1999a eastoe et al 2000 2001 as noted above 6 measurement methods were reported for sds the isotherms measured for sds by the five other methods are consistent with the nr measured isotherm this indicates that the surface excesses measured by these other methods also represent equilibrium conditions it is critical to recognize that most of these measurements were obtained with advanced high resolution methods designed to directly characterize soft matter surfaces and interfaces these include the htv bam vsfs niciss irras and nr methods the other methods represent ingenious approaches for the physical collection microtome bubble generation emulsion formation or direct measurement radiotracer of surface excess as such these data represent the most accurate and robust direct measurements of surfactant adsorption at fluid fluid interfaces available this data set serves as a gold standard benchmark to which to compare measurements obtained with other methods measured kia values can be determined from the data presented in fig 2 by application of eq 1 normalized kia values determined for the entire data set presented in fig 2a are shown in fig 3 a the non scaled data set for air water interfacial adsorption of sds and sdbs determined from the data presented in fig 2b is shown in fig 3b the kia c functions are similar for scaled and non scaled data consistent with the adsorption isotherms to our knowledge these data represent the first reported kia values obtained from direct high resolution measurements of surfactant adsorption at air water and napl water interfaces it is clearly evident that the kia values asymptotically approach and eventually attain constant values at lower aqueous concentrations the slope of the curve begins to decrease at a concentration 10 4 m and attains constancy at 10 5 m after which it remains constant for more than 1 5 orders of magnitude change in concentration these results clearly demonstrate that kia values for surfactant absorption at fluid fluid interfaces are subject to a maximum upper limit at lower concentrations 4 3 transport measured γ and kia values uncertainty analysis example arrival fronts for transport of pfoa pfos and apmo in the sand under unsaturated conditions are shown in figure si 3 the magnitude of retardation is observed to be greatest for pfos the pfas with the longest chain and greatest surface activity whereas apmo which has the shortest chain and weakest surface activity has the lowest magnitude of retardation the contribution of solid phase sorption to retardation is relatively low for all three pfas in addition the magnitude of aia is similar for all three experiments because similar water saturations were used hence the observed significant differences in retardation are due to the relative magnitudes of air water interfacial adsorption i e kia among the three pfas there are four primary sources of uncertainty in the determination of kia and γ values from transport experiments the first two comprise measurement uncertainty associated with the transport experiments and the data analysis methods used to determine retardation factors these two sources are discussed in sections si 3 and si 4 respectively of the si in summary the methods used are demonstrably robust the third source of uncertainty entails quantifying the contribution of solid phase sorption for the determination of kia 0 with eq 4 specification of aia for determination of kia from eq 5 is the fourth source of uncertainty this latter step can be problematic in some cases particularly for porous media that have not been sufficiently characterized inaccurate characterization of kd and or aia can be a source of uncertainty in generating representative kia and γ values from transport experiments these potential constraints are mitigated in this study through the use of highly characterized media the transport data used for this study were generated from experiments employing commercially available natural well sorted quartz sand several advantages accrue to using such a porous medium first this type of sand has been used in many transport studies conducted by numerous investigators and as such it serves as a reference natural porous medium second our prior studies have shown that the sand has a very low magnitude of solid phase sorption for the select pfas used in the transport experiments in addition this sorption has been well characterized and quantified with both transport and batch isotherm experiments van glubt et al 2021 as a result the second term on the r h s of eq 4 is both minor and well quantified which means there is minimal associated uncertainty another primary advantage of using the selected sand is that it is likely that more measurements of fluid fluid interfacial areas have been reported for this particular medium than for any other porous medium this provides a significant degree of certainty in determining relevant aia values for use in eq 5 in addition this medium has an appreciable magnitude of air water interfacial area for the conditions of the experiments the actual air water interfacial areas range from 3800 to 7500 cm2 depending on the volume of the column employed these large magnitudes provide great sensitivity to adsorption at the air water interface thereby enhancing the determination of robust kia values multiple methods are available to measure aia including various interfacial tracer techniques e g kim et al 1997 anwar et al 2000 schaefer et al 2000 brusseau et al 2007 2008 araujo et al 2015 zhong et al 2016 a gas absorption chemical reaction method lyu et al 2017 and high resolution x ray microtomography xmt brusseau et al 2006 2007 araujo and brusseau 2019 2020 these methods have been used in multiple studies to measure aia values for the sand used in this study measured values for the water saturations 65 relevant to the transport experiments are presented in table si 3 inspection of table si 3 reveals that the measured fluid fluid interfacial areas range from 30 to 100 cm 1 the smallest values are those measured by xmt a recent study demonstrated that xmt imaging provides very accurate and reproducible measurements of aia including for the sand used in the present study araujo and brusseau 2020 aia values measured with xmt can therefore be considered as benchmark baseline values for the sand however it is critical to note that the xmt values are smaller than actual transport relevant values due to the fact that the xmt method does not measure interfacial area associated with microscopic surface roughness brusseau et al 2007 2008 interfacial tracer tests do characterize the contribution of microscopic surface roughness to fluid fluid interfacial areas e g kim et al 1999 schaefer et al 2000 brusseau et al 2007 2008 jiang et al 2020 interfacial areas measured with aqueous phase interfacial tracer tests are anticipated to be the most relevant for pfas transport scenarios given the similarity of the experiment systems brusseau 2019b 2020 the tracer based aia values measured for saturations of 0 65 are in the range of 70 to 100 cm 1 the most relevant is the 87 cm 1 value obtained for an air water system with the miscible displacement tracer method row 3 in table 1 the mean of the 6 tracer test aia measurements rows 3 8 is 85 cm 1 9 7 95 ci which is close to the prior noted value the uncertainty in aia is 11 based on the 95 ci determined for the different interfacial tracer test measurements interestingly this value is very similar to the 9 measurement uncertainty reported by el ouni et al 2021 for the aqueous miscible displacement interfacial tracer method considering the existence of multiple consistent independent aia measurements for the sand it can be concluded that there is a relatively high degree of confidence in the aia values employed and concomitantly that there is a correspondingly low degree of uncertainty in the determination of γ and kia values from the transport experiments the measurement uncertainty for θw 1 contributes minimally to γ and kia uncertainty an additional transport measured data set is obtained from experiments conducted for the transport of sddbs in an unsaturated glass bead medium el ouni et al 2021 air water interfacial areas have been measured for this medium with high resolution xmt araujo and brusseau 2020 prior work has demonstrated that these glass beads do not have measurable surface roughness araujo and brusseau 2019 therefore the aia values measured by xmt can be used in eq 5 to determine kia for the transport experiments these values have minimal uncertainty given the availability of the xmt measured aia values the γ values measured from the miscible displacement transport experiments are presented in fig 4 the relatively high degree of certainty associated with the column measured data is illustrated in multiple ways first γ values were measured for pfoa in 7 separate transport experiments for the data point labeled in the figure and the 95 ci is within the size of the data symbol of particular note these experiments not only included replicate tests but also tests conducted under different conditions water content pore water velocity solution conditions second the measurement uncertainty for these values due to uncertainty in determination of aia 11 as noted above is equivalent to 1 3 larger than the size of the data symbols third the γ value determined from the independent pfoa transport study of li et al 2021 is consistent with the values determined from lyu et al 2018 fourth the values determined for air water and napl water systems are consistent for pfos finally in aggregate the transport measured data span relative surface coverages from 100 to 0 01 all of the values are approximately coincident along an identical γ c profile illustrating great consistency amongst the data sets 4 4 comparison of transport measured γ and kia values to directly measured values the transport measured γ data from fig 4 are combined with the directly measured data from fig 2a and presented in fig 5 some of the direct measured data sets reported in fig 2a are not included to reduce clutter together data are presented for a total of five pfas with three column measured data sets pfoa pfos apmo and three directly measured data sets pfoa pfna c6f13peo the measured data span approximately 6 5 orders of magnitude in aqueous concentration critically the transport measured data are observed to be fully consistent with the directly measured data specifically γ values for the two methods are entirely coincident in the region of overlapping concentrations which spans 4 orders of magnitude furthermore the two data sets adhere to an identical γ c profile the great consistency among γ data sets measured with different methods by different investigators for different surfactants is quite remarkable these results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy of the transport measured values the concentration dependency of the column measured kia data can be examined now that they have been determined to be robust kia values measured from the transport experiments are presented in fig 6 the kias clearly attain constant values at lower concentrations furthermore these constant values are maintained over 2 orders of magnitude these results clearly demonstrate that transport measured kias are subject to maximum limiting values at lower aqueous concentrations this is fully consistent with the results obtained for the direct measurement methods fig 3 4 5 alternative analysis of the concentration dependency of kia 0 and kia the determination of kia values from transport experiments is generally faced with potential uncertainty due to the need to specify the air water interfacial area however perspicacious use of eqs 4 and 5 provides a means to eliminate this uncertainty when examining the condition dependency of kia inspection of eq 5 shows that kia 0 is a function of kia aia and θw notably the values of aia and θw remain constant for experiments conducted with the same porous medium and water content thus experiments conducted in this manner allow one to investigate the influence of system variables specifically on kia without the need to specify aia for the present study the concentration dependency of kia 0 and thus kia is investigated by examining the results of transport experiments conducted with different input concentrations for the same medium and water content even though the kia values measured from the transport experiments were demonstrated to be robust in the preceding section this alternative analysis is conducted to provide an additional independent means of investigation to compare amongst the three pfas the kia 0 values are normalized by dividing by a reference kia 0 a standard reference value would be the maximum kia 0 value for each pfas however it is not desirable to make assumptions about maximum values for this analysis given the focus is on determining the concentration dependency hence an arbitrary reference is selected of kia 0 c 1 i e the respective value of kia 0 measured for each pfas at the input concentration of 1 mg l the set of kia 0 values for each pfas is scaled by the respective kia 0 c 1 for that particular pfas importantly this normalization procedure preserves the respective profiles of the individual kia 0 c functions for each pfas the aqueous concentration is not scaled for this analysis the normalized kia 0 values as a function of aqueous concentration are presented in fig 7 the kia 0 values asymptotically approach maximum values which are attained at concentrations of approximately 0 1 to 1 mg l there is some variability between the three pfas due to non scaling of the concentrations pfos is observed to exhibit a sharper slope than pfoa whereas apmo exhibits a much more moderate slope both consistent with the respective differences in surface activities as noted previously these data represent experiments that were conducted with the same porous medium and similar water contents hence these results demonstrate that kia values determined from the transport experiments exhibit asymptotic approaches to maximum values for these three pfas this conclusion is determined without the need to specify aia and therefore is not subject to any uncertainty in that regard the results of this analysis are consistent with the prior analyses 4 6 comparison of direct transport and st gibbs measurements γ and kia values determined by applying the gibbs adsorption equation to measured surface tension data for pfoa are presented in figs 4 6 inspection of fig 5 reveals that the st gibbs values are fully consistent with the data obtained by the direct measurement methods this illustrates the consistency of st gibbs and direct measured data discussed in the theory section as noted therein the consistency of the two data sets demonstrates the validity of applying the gibbs equation to surface interfacial tension data to determine γ and kia inspection of figs 4 6 shows that the st gibbs data are consistent with the transport measured data this is further examined by comparing the full set of transport measured kia values to st gibbs determined values in fig 8 excellent correspondence is exhibited among the large number of measurements 41 total this data set comprises kia values determined for solutions of 4 different ionic strengths 1 5 5 10 and 30 mm two ionic compositions nacl and cacl2 different phs 5 8 and for tests conducted with different water saturations ranging from 0 4 0 86 and mean pore water velocities and for three pfas hence the data span a wide range of conditions these results demonstrate that the gibbs adsorption equation can be applied to measured surface interfacial tension data to determine kia values that are representative for transport conditions specific kia values determined from nr direct measurements the transport experiments and from st gibbs can be compared for further assessment of consistency this is done for pfoa in 0 01 m nacl at an aqueous concentration of 10 μg l any such assessment should account for measurement uncertainty for each of the methods nr measurements have a reported uncertainty of 5 see the relevant references cited for the nr data the uncertainty associated with the surface tension measurements and the transport experiments is discussed in section si 2 of the si and section 4 3 respectively the following kia values are determined nr 0 0032 0 0030 0 0034 transport 0 0033 0 0028 0 0038 and st gibbs 0 0032 0 0024 0 0040 the comparison reveals that the mean values for all three are essentially identical as a result of this consistency predicted retardation factors calculated using either the nr or st gibbs kia values match the measured r values obtained from the transport experiments data not shown the kia values measured for pfoa with the three methods as a function of concentration are compared in figure si 4 with no normalization or scaling applied it is observed that the kia c profiles for all three measurements are coincident within the measurement uncertainty the results are consistent with the original comparison reported by lyu et al 2018 inspection of fig 5 shows that the langmuir isotherm provides an excellent match to all of the measured data it is notable that the isotherm was fit only to the pfoa data obtained from the direct nr measurements none of the transport measured data st gibbs data or the other directly measured data were used for the isotherm fitting this further supports the consistency of the data sets it also demonstrates that the langmuir isotherm is appropriate for describing these data over an extremely large 6 5 log aqueous concentration range and 4 log range in measured interfacial adsorption the isotherm represents both the linear adsorption observed at lower concentrations as the langmuir isotherm reduces to the henry linear isotherm at low concentrations while also representing the attainment of maximum interfacial adsorption at high concentrations 4 7 surface coverage and critical concentrations the directly measured γ data can be used to characterize relative surface coverage γ γmax for fluid fluid interfacial adsorption inspection of figs 2 4 and 5 shows that the surface coverages for all 5 pfas and all 8 hydrocarbon surfactants in different ionic strength solutions and including both air water and napl water systems collapse to one master curve upon scaling as noted above this illustrates the concurrence of fluid fluid interfacial adsorption behavior amongst the various systems in terms of relative surface coverage hence surface coverage can be considered a controlling discriminant for surfactant behavior with equivalence and correlation to surface activity the normalized kia is compared to the surface coverage in fig 9 the concentration at which kia approaches 95 of the maximum corresponds to approximately 10 surface coverage hence the region wherein kia is essentially constant and for which the measured adsorption isotherm is effectively linear has surface coverages of 10 similar results are obtained using the directly measured sds sdbs data figure si 5 the expectation of linear fluid fluid interfacial adsorption at very low surface coverages is widely established in surfactant and surface science e g chang and franses 1995 eastoe and dalton 2000 berg 2010 danov and kralchevsky 2012 romsted 2014 tadros 2015 lang and liu 2016 aveyard 2019 this is often referred to as henry s adsorption such ideal linear behavior is consistent with coverages that are sufficiently low such that lateral interactions amongst adsorbed monomers is minimal and the total occupied area is small relative to the total interfacial area the linear isotherm and constant kia observed at low concentrations for the directly measured data and the transport measured data are consistent with ideal conditions at low surface coverage the specific concentration at which the onset of linear adsorption and constant kia will be observed for any given surfactant will depend on the surface activity of that particular surfactant and when the degree of surface coverage becomes sufficiently low such that adsorption becomes ideal in terms of a readily measurable property such as the surface tension function figure si 6 shows that pfoa surface tension begins to decrease significantly in the range of 10 surface coverage this is consistent with the results reported for ctab by mukherjee et al 2013 the critical surface coverage for surface tension reduction is consistent with that for the attainment of kia constancy these results highlight an important point concerning the adsorption behavior of surfactants at fluid fluid interfaces with regards to concentration related effects it is not the actual concentration that is of import but rather the concentration with respect to the surface activity and degree of surface coverage under the extant conditions one may define a set of concentration regimes based on correlation of the ranges of pfas concentrations observed in environmental systems of interest to transport phenomenon of import for the example of pfas adsorption at fluid fluid interfaces the critical concentrations at which kia values approach their maximum are likely to be higher than measured concentrations at many but not all sites as noted by brusseau 2019a the critical concentrations may be lower than measured concentrations for example at some afff source zones this approach can be applied to other transport phenomena of relevance to pfas fate in the environment 5 conclusion direct high resolution measurements of surfactant adsorption at the air water and napl water interface were aggregated from the literature these data represent the most accurate and robust measurements of γ and kia values that exist to date this data set provides a gold standard benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of measurements based on transport experiments surface tension measurements and other methods it is anticipated that this data set will be useful for future development and testing of methods for measurement and estimation of pfas adsorption at fluid fluid interfaces the largest data set to date of γ and kia values measured from transport experiments was compiled from several miscible displacement studies investigating the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media although the need to specify aia can be an impediment to accurate determination of kia values from transport experiments the use of highly characterized media with robust measures of aia minimized this issue for the present study γ and kia values determined from the transport measured data were observed to be fully consistent with the directly measured data these results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy of the transport measured values this in turn validates the efficacy of the methods used for the transport experiments and the values used for aia γ and kia values determined from the application of the gibbs equation to measured surface tension data were fully consistent with the directly measured and transport measured data the directly measured data were used to examine the concentration dependency of kia values which clearly demonstrated that kia attains a constant maximum value at lower concentrations two separate analyses of the transport measured data both produced observations of constant kia values at lower concentrations consistent with the directly measured data the critical concentration at which adsorption is effectively linear and kia approaches its maximum depends on the relative surface coverage which is a function of the surface activity of the particular pfas under the extant conditions the importance of evaluating concentrations in terms of surface activities and surface coverage and the concept of defining critical concentrations in reference to pfas transport phenomena of interest was discussed the outcomes of this study should be of relevance to the characterization and modeling of pfas transport and fate in multiple environmental systems the results of this study elucidate the fundamental concentration dependency behavior for pfas fluid fluid interfacial adsorption however the actual magnitudes and significance of interfacial adsorption particularly for field systems are a function of a number of factors and other processes as described in prior studies e g brusseau 2018 2019b 2020 brusseau and
