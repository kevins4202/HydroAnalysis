21930,the article focuses on proposing a new hybrid time laplace domain response calculation method for symmetrical floating structures by solving cummins equation which is depending on the state space model identified from transfer function different from a time or frequency domain method the proposed approach estimates the state space model of a floating structure system from the transfer function in the laplace domain and calculates the response by considering the exciting forces as an input of the state space model implementing complex exponential decomposition to the retardation functions the retardation functions in the laplace domain are expressed using a series of poles and the corresponding residues which avoids the numerical integral of the convolution terms in the cummins equation and greatly improves the computational efficiency during the process of a dynamic response analysis three examples are applied to investigate the validity of the proposed method the first is a simple single degree of freedom mathematical model excited by an irregular wave studies have shown that the response calculated by the proposed method matches well with that of a traditional newmark β method meanwhile this approach is insensitive to the interval time of the calculation and consumes less calculation time which means that the proposed method has higher precision and computational efficiency the last two examples are a spar type offshore wind turbine and a semi submersible platform model semi in sesam which extend the proposed method to solve the response estimation problem of marine structures the results of the spar type floating structure show that the estimated responses when using the proposed method are in good agreement with the results of the traditional time domain method by studying the response calculation of semi the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the estimated responses match well with the traditional time domain method and wasim code of sesam and 2 the calculation time of the new approach is reduced significantly compared with the newmark β method especially under a long simulation time keywords cummins equation retardation function complex exponential decomposition laplace transform state space model dynamic response estimation 1 introduction floating offshore structures are the foundation of marine resource and energy development in deep sea locations such as the exploitation of fossil resources and offshore wind energy capture different types of floating offshore platforms have been developed in recent decades including floating production storage and offloading fpso spar platforms and semi submersible platforms the dynamic response estimation of such platforms is an important part during the design stage depending on the calculated response the shape and size of the platform can be optimized to obtain a better hydrodynamic performance the motion behavior of the floating offshore structures under wavy conditions can be expressed through a linear model using the cummins equation cummins 1962 which applies convolution terms of the retardation functions and the motion velocity to reflect the fluid memory effects compared with a low order approximation using constant coefficients to exchange the frequency dependent added mass and damping the accuracy of the response computation when using the cummins equation improves significantly through the introduction of the convolution terms taghipour et al 2008 however the presence of the convolution terms in cummins equation makes it inconvenient for the analysis and design of a motion control system fossen 2002 perez 2002 in addition the dynamic response calculation based on the cummins equation is computationally demanding when solving linear transient or nonlinear problems and the convolution terms integral in the time domain are not convenient to apply in standard simulation packages kashiwagi 2004 to improve the calculation efficiency newman 1977 solved the problem of conducting a dynamic response calculation in the frequency domain when the floating structures are excited by a wave force under the assumption that waves can be expressed as a gaussian process the first order potential theory is applied before applying this method it should be assumed that the steepness of the wave is low and that the response caused by the wave exciting force is proportional to the wave amplitude faltinsen 2005 the linear theory can then be used to compute the dynamic response within the frequency domain considering that the method is based on linear frequency domain theory nonlinear effects induced by damping and stiffness or other factors should be avoided to use the linear theory or should be approximated in a linear form the standard hydrodynamic code of wadam in the commercial software sesam was designed using a frequency domain approach to estimate the frequency response of a floating structure which is implemented through the following three steps first the wave spectrum used to describe the sea state of a floating structure location should be selected second the response amplitude operators raos depending on the potential theory should be calculated third the frequency response of the floating structures depending on the raos is obtained by applying the superposition principle sesam 2017 theoretically the frequency domain method calculates the frequency response under the condition of a steady process which means that only a steady state response can be obtained and not a transient response meanwhile the component of an incident wave acting on a floating structure is defined as a strictly harmonic wave when calculating the raos using the frequency method which ignores the case of a damping harmonic wave to calculate the time domain response an inverse fourier transform should be applied to the obtained frequency response the limitation of an inverse fourier transform such as spectrum leakage may occur during this process which should be considered carefully to address this problem liu et al 2017 calculated the frequency response of floating structures in the laplace domain which applies complex exponential decomposition to the retardation functions and uses the calculated poles and corresponding residues in the laplace transform of the retardation functions thereby avoiding the restriction of demanding wave forces consisting of purely harmonic components when considering the nonlinear effects caused by viscous forces and the water entry and exit a high order frequency domain approach should be applied to solve the nonlinear dynamic response problem bendat 1998 nevertheless high order frequency domain methods are inconvenient to apply and are computationally inefficient taghipour et al 2008 different from a frequency domain method the time domainmethod used to calculate the response of a floating structure is usually based on a numerical integral to solve the cummins equation which can be used to analyze the transient response and avoid the limitation of a fourier transform applied through a frequency domain method however the integral calculation of the convolution terms requires a large amount of computational time and numerous resources when estimating the response of a floating structure which leads to a low computational efficiency of the response estimation to improve the analysis efficiency within the time domain numerous studies have been conducted most of these studies have focused on exchanging the convolution terms with constant coefficients or a state space model which mainly includes the following three methods taghipour et al 2008 1 the use of constant coefficients to replace the frequency dependent added mass and damping 2 the use of a state space formulation to exchange the convolution terms and 3 the use of a state space model to replace the force to motion response function of a floating structure the first approximation is the simplest possible approach and uses constant matrices to replace the frequency dependent added mass and damping values the low order approximation method may lead to relatively large errors when analyzing the transient response excited by a single frequency wave or a steady state response excited by multiple frequency excitations holappa and falzarano 1999 the second approach replaces the convolution terms with a state space model estimated from the retardation functions in the cummins equation which has been widely discussed owing to its efficiency and accuracy to the best of the authors knowledge this method was originally proposed by schmiechen 1973 to analyze the transient response of a ship subsequently the method was applied to calculate the dynamic response of various floating structures taghipour et al 2007 used an alternative state space model to replace the convolution terms associated with the fluid memory effect and conducted a hydroelastic time domain analysis of a flexible marine structure duarte et al 2013 discussed several methods for finding a state space model for the wave radiation forces and compared the results with fast an offshore wind turbine computer aided engineering tool lu et al 2019 applied the replacement of the convolution terms using a state space model to analyze the dynamic response of a semi submersible platform depending on the solution domain the state space model estimation method includes a time domain method and a frequency domain method nocedal and wright 1999 described an impulse response curve fitting method to identify the corresponding state space replacement of the retardation function this method is a nonlinear optimization problem solved by gauss newton algorithms kung 1978 used realization theory to deal with the problem of obtaining a minimal realization the singular value decomposition svd is applied to the hankel matrix consisting of the retardation functions whose results can be used to calculate a minimal realization a replaced state space model can then be constructed sanathanan and koerner 1963 applied quasi linear regression to estimate the transfer function of the retardation function in the frequency domain the state space model is constructed depending on the parameters of the transfer function in the form of a rational fraction the first two methods are time domain methods and the last is a frequency domain method the third approach to converting the force to motion response into a state space model was originally proposed by cummins 1962 inspired by this perez and lande 2006 changed the displacement to velocity using the impulse response from force to velocity which was used to calculate the state space model depending on the frequency response function frf differing from the method mentioned above the objective of this study is to estimate the state space model of floating structures depending on the transfer function in the laplace domain the laplace transfer of the retardation functions is expressed as a sum of the pole residue form which is obtained by implementing complex exponential decomposition to the retardation function the exciting forces are substituted into the estimated state space model to calculate the response of a floating structure depending on the research of wu and moan 1996 the nonlinear effects can be considered as additional load in the process of dynamic response estimation inspired by the study nonlinear effects can be introduced to the model of the proposed method at the late stage to deal with nonlinear effects as the advantages of the proposed method more accurate results can be obtained compared with the step by step integral method and the computational efficiency of the response estimation is greatly improved three examples are applied to investigate the performance of the new approach the first example is a simple single degree of freedom sdof mathematical model whose retardation function depends on a pure analytical relationship and does not represent a real system an irregular exciting force synthesized by harmonic waves is simulated to act on the sdof system applying the proposed method and a step by step integral method to the calculation of the dynamic response a comparison of the corresponding results is conducted the second example is a spar type offshore wind turbine jonkman 2010 excited by two regular waves and an irregular wave the results of the response estimation using the proposed approach and the newmark β method are described in this section the last example is a semi submersible semi platform excited by an irregular wave obeying the jonswap spectrum hasselmann 1973 the response comparison and computational efficiency of the simulation are discussed in the example the final two examples show the potential application of the dynamic response calculation in an ocean engineering project 2 preliminaries 2 1 cummins equation in time and frequency domains depending on the potential theory the governing differential equation of floating offshore structures with zero forward speed can be considered in the time domain cummins 1962 1 m m a η t 0 t k t τ η τ d τ c η t f e x c t where m is the mass matrix m a is the added mass matrix k t is the retardation function c is the restoring

which can be expressed through the following form 4 m a lim ω a ω a 5 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω substituting the infinite frequency added mass a into eq 1 the equivalent cummins equation can be expressed as follows 6 m a η t 0 t k t τ η τ d τ c η t f e x c t eq 6 describes the motion of a floating structure completely in the time domain which can be solved depending on time domain integral algorithm 2 2 response calculation using traditional time domain method the analytical solution to the cummins equation as shown in eq 6 is difficult to obtain to calculate the response of a floating structure numerical methods are usually applied the newmark β method is one of the most common integral approaches and is widely used to calculate the response of a vibrating system the discrete motion equation of a floating structure is as follows 7 m a η i 1 n 1 i 1 k i 2 n η n δ t c η i 1 f i 1 e x c where η i η i δ t is the discrete acceleration η i η i δ t is the discrete velocity η i η i δ t is the discrete displacement k i k i δ t is the discrete retardation function and f i e x c f e x c i δ t is the discrete exciting force based on the average acceleration and linear acceleration

the parameters of the newmark β method substituting eqs 8 and 9 into eq 7 the recursion formula of the newmark β method can be obtained as follows 10 k η i 1 f i 1 where k m a 1 β δ t 2 k 1 α β c f i 1 f i 1 e x c n 1 i k i 2 n η n δ t m a 1 β δ t 2 k 1 α β η i m a 1 β δ t k 1 α β 1 δ t η i m a 1 2 β 1 k 1 α 2 β 1 δ t 2 η i depending on the recursion formulas of eqs 8 10 the response of a floating structure can be calculated using the newmark β method 3 response estimation of symmetric floating structures based on the state space model identified in the laplace domain floating offshore structures usually have geometry or mass symmetry such as a spar platform and semi submersible platform such symmetrical properties may simplify the matrices in the cummins equation which make it convenient for a response estimation of a floating structure in this paper the response estimation of this type of symmetrical floating structure is discussed which is symmetrical about the x o z and y o z planes simultaneously depending on the symmetrical features the process using a hybrid time laplace domain method to calculate the response of a floating structure is as follows 3 1 radiation potential of floating structures depending on the potential flow theory the radiation force is caused by the radiation potential which relates to the frequency dependent added mass and damping the frequency dependent added mass and damping can be converted to added mass and retardation function in the cummins equation the radiation potential satisfies the body boundary conditions on the wet surface of a floating offshore structure which can be written as follows newman 1977 11 ϕ i n j ω n i i 1 2 6 where ϕ i x y z gives the radiation potential of the floating offshore structure with the unit amplitude which corresponds to the response motion of mode i i 1 2 6 for surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw n n 1 n 2 n 3 represents the unit normal vector on the wet surface of the floating offshore structure directed into the body r is the position vector where r n n 4 n 5 n 6 and ω is the radian frequency of the steady motions bernoulli s equation illustrates the relationship between the velocity potential and hydrodynamic pressure acting on the wet surface of a floating structure the radiation force can then be expressed as follows dai and duan 2008 12 f r i re k 1 6 η k e j ω t f i k i 1 2 6 in which 13 f i k ρ s b ϕ i n ϕ k d s where the coefficients f i k give the complex force in direction i owing to a motion of the floating structure with the unit amplitude in direction k substituting eq 11 into eq 13 and decomposing f i k into real and imaginary parts the coefficients can be written as follows 14 f i k ω 2 a i k j ω b i k where the real part a i k and imaginary part b i k depend on the frequency in radian ω then the radiation force can be expressed in the following form by substituting eq 14 into eq 12 15 f r i k 1 6 η k a i k η k b i k where coefficient a i k is proportional to the acceleration and is known as added mass b i k is so called damping coefficient and provides force components proportional to the velocity to investigate the symmetrical feature of the added mass and damping coefficient green s theorem is applied to the potentials ϕ i and ϕ k over a completely closed surface which includes free surface wet surface bottom and control surface at infinity because the integrand from the free surface bottom and control surface at infinity has zero contribution newman 1977 the relationship can be obtained as follows 16 s b ϕ i ϕ k n ϕ k ϕ i n d s 0 i k 1 2 6 form eq 13 it follows that 17 f i k f k i i k 1 2 6 because the added mass and damping coefficients correspond to the real and imaginary parts of f i k the added mass and damping coefficients are symmetrical i e a i k a k i b i k b k i 3 2 symmetrical feature analysis of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients moving the body fixed coordinates to place the center of gravity cog and center of buoyancy cob along the z axis the coordinates of cog and cob become 0 0 z g and 0 0 z b because of the symmetrical property of symmetrical floating structures the moments of inertia i i k 0 i k and the elements of restoring matrix c 34 c 43 0 c 35 c 53 0 and c 45 c 54 0 can be obtained depending on the calculation formula of the quantities newman 1977 then the mass matrix and restoring matrix of the symmetrical floating structures can be expressed as follows 18 m m 0 0 0 m z g 0 0 m 0 m z g 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 m z g 0 i 11 0 0 m z g 0 0 0 i 22 0 0 0 0 0 0 i 33 19 c 0 0 0 0 0

unit normal vector on a wet surface of a body which points to outside the floating structures when the floating offshore structure is symmetrical about the x o z plane the relationship can be obtained in the following form 20 n 1 x y z n 1 x y z n 2 x y z n 2 x y z n 3 x y z n 3 x y z substituting eq 20 into the relationship formula r n n 4 n 5 n 6 the vector r n satisfies the following relationships 21 n 4 x y z y n 3 x y z z n 2 x y z n 4 x y z n 5 x y z z n 1 x y z x n 3 x y z n 5 x y z n 6 x y z x n 2 x y z y n 1 x y z n 6 x y z depending on eqs 20 and 21 and substituting into eq 11 the relationships can be obtained 22 ϕ 1 3 5 x y z n ϕ 1 3 5 x y z n 23 ϕ 2 4 6 x y z n ϕ 2 4 6 x y z n because eqs 22 and 23 are workable for every point on the wet surface of a symmetrical floating structure the radiation potentials satisfy the following relationship 24 ϕ 1 3 5 x y z ϕ 1 3 5 x y z 25 ϕ 2 4 6 x y z ϕ 2 4 6 x y z depending on the discussion above n 1 n 3 and n 5 are symmetrical about the x o z plane and n 2 n 4 and n 6 are antisymmetrical about the x o z plane associated with the body surface boundary conditions of a floating structure the radiation potential ϕ i i 1 3 5 is symmetrical and ϕ i i 2 4 6 is antisymmetrical about the x o z plane respectively combining the symmetrical features of ϕ i and n i with eqs 11 and 13 when a floating offshore structure is symmetrical about the x o z plane the coefficients f i k are equal to zero when i and k combine in the following ways table1 similarly if the floating offshore structure is symmetric about the y o z plane the coefficients f i k are equal to zero at the following position table2 therefore the added mass coefficient a i k and damping coefficient b i k in eq 14 are equal to zero at the position above which means a ω and b ω of the symmetrical floating structures can be simplified as follows ran 2000 26 a ω a 11 0 0 0 a 15 0 0 a 22 0 a 24 0 0 0 0 a 33 0 0 0 0 a 42 0 a 44 0 0 a 51 0 0 0 a 55 0

parameters can be solved leading to simplified formulas then the state space model of the floating structures can be obtained depending on this formulas 3 3 cummins equation in laplace domain this study is an attempt to find a new method to estimate the response of a symmetrical floating offshore structure in a hybrid time laplace domain implementing laplace transform to eq 6 the cummins equation in the laplace domain is expressed as follows liu et al 2019a 28 s 2 m a η s s k s η s c η s f e x c s or 29 z s η s f e x c s where 30 z s s 2 m a s k s c gives the impedance function of the cummins equation and η s k s and f e x c s are the laplace transform of the displacement η t the retardation function k t and the exciting force f e x c t respectively to calculate the determinant of the impedance function the matrix of the impedance function is divided into four submatrices zhang and hao 2004 for simplicity let z i j z i j s and the impedance function can be expressed in the following form 31 z s z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z 11 0 0 0 z 15 0 0 z 22 0 z 24 0 0 0 0 z 33 0 0 0 0 z 42 0 z 44 0 0 z 51 0 0 0 z 55 0 0 0 0 0 0 z 66 where z 1 z 11 0 0 0 z 22 0 0 0 z 33 z 2 0 z 15 0 z 24 0 0 0 0 0 z 3 0 z 42 0 z 51 0 0 0 0 0 z 4 z 44 0 0 0 z 55 0 0 0 z 66 then the determinant of the impedance function is calculated using the following formula 32 z s z 1 z 4 z 3 z 1 1 z 2 z 11 z 22 z 33 z 44 z 42 z 22 1 z 24 z 55 z 51 z 11 1 z 15 z 66 the same method is used to calculate the corresponding algebraic complements of z s the transfer function of a symmetrical floating offshore structure is the reciprocal of the impedance function which can be expressed as follows 33 h s z s 1 z 55 z 11 z 55 z 15 2 0 0 0 z 15 z 15 2 z 11 z 55 0 0 z 44 z 22 z 44 z 42 2 0 z 24 z 24 2 z 22 z 44 0 0 0 0 1 z 33 0 0 0 0 z 42 z 42 2 z 22 z 44 0 z 22 z 22 z 44 z 42 2 0 0 z 51 z 51 2 z 11 z 55 0 0 0 z 11 z 11 z 55 z 15 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 z 66 let m i k m i k a i k where m i k and a i k give the element of mass matrix m and infinite frequency added mass a then the elements of the impedance function z s become the following 34 z i k s s 2 m i k s k i k s c i k where k i k s and c i k are the elements of k s and c 3 4 response estimation based on state space model the retardation function can be decomposed into a finite number of exponential components using a previously described method hu et al 2013 35 k i k t l 1 p γ i k l e λ i k l t where p is the number of terms λ i k l must be real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs and γ i k l are the complex numbers corresponding to λ i k l therefore the laplace transfer of a retardation function yields the following pole residue form in the laplace domain 36 k i k s l 1 p γ i k l s λ i k l i e λ i k l are the poles and γ i k l are the corresponding residues a equivalent form of eq 36 can be expressed as a rational function a i k s b i k s where b i k s s λ i k 1 s λ i k 2 s λ i k p and a i k s is the sum of the numerators after a reduction of the fractions to a common denominator substituting the rational function of eq 36 into eq 34 the elements of z s can be expressed as follows 37 z i k s s 2 m i k s a i k s b i k s c i k n i k s m i k s where n i k s and m i k s are the numerator and denominator after a reduction of the fractions to a common denominator substituting eq 37 into eq 33 the transfer function of a symmetrical floating offshore structure can be calculated using the following method 38 h i i s z i i 1 m i i s n i i s i 3 6 39 h i i s z k k z i i z k k z i k 2 n k k s m k k s n i i s m i i s n k k

polynomial b i k s has distinct roots which means the order of the denominator b i k s is p and is greater than the order of the numerator a i k s after a reduction of the fractions to a common denominator the order of the numerator polynomial n i k s is p 2 and the denominator polynomial m i k s is the same as b i k s therefore the order of the denominator polynomial of h i k s is greater than the order of the corresponding numerator polynomial after substituting eq 37 into eq 33 and the transfer function can be expressed in the following pole residue form 41 h i k s p i k s q i k s l 1 q ν i k l s μ i k l h i k s 0 where p i k s and q i k s are the numerator and denominator of the transfer function the pole μ i k l is the root of q i k s 0 and the corresponding residue ν i k l can be calculated by the following limit operation tian et al 2019 42 ν i k l lim s μ i k l s μ i k l h i k s the transfer function and the impulse response function of a symmetrical floating offshore structure is a laplace transfer pair implementing an inverse laplace transfer to eq 41 the impulse response function can be obtained as follows 43 h i k t l 1 h i k s l 1 q ν i k l e μ i k l t for a linear system the response of the system is the convolution of the impulse response function and input therefore the displacement response of a floating offshore structure at coordinate k to the load at i is expressed through the following convolution integral 44 η i k t 0 t h i k t τ f k e x c τ d τ the convolution integral is inconvenient for an analysis of the response estimation and will consume numerous computing resources when the duration of the calculation time is comparatively long the impulse response function can be converted into a equivalent state space model of a linear system taghipour et al 2008 which can be used to improve the calculation efficiency lu et al 2019 discussed a method to calculate the state space model depending on the impulse response function and proposed a method using poles and the corresponding residues of the impulse response function to establish a state space model which coincides with the case applied in the present study the equivalence of eq 44 can be expressed using the state space model in the following form liu et al 2016 45 z t a i k z t b i k f k e x c t η i k t c i k z t where a i k μ i k 1 μ i k 2 μ i k q b i k 1

be obtained by summing the contributions from all load components as follows 46 η i t k 1 6 η i k t 3 5 procedure of the proposed method to apply the method proposed in this article the following procedures are implemented to calculate the response of a symmetrical floating structure 1 extracting a and b ω from sesam software and using eq 5 to implement a trapezoidal integral the retardation function k t is obtained which is used to compute the transfer function of the floating structure after applying laplace transform 2 substituting the retardation functions k i k t into eq 35 and implementing complex exponential decomposition using the prony ss method the poles and corresponding residues are obtained which means the laplace transform of the retardation function k i k s can be expressed using the pole residue form 3 applying a laplace transform to the cummins equation and assuming that the initial displacement and velocity are both zero the impedance function of the cummins equation is calculated as shown in eq 30 substituting k i k s into the impedance function and reducing the fraction to a common denominator the impedance function z i k s can be expressed using a rational fraction as shown in eq 37 4 substituting the impedance function z i k s into eq 33 and using eqs 38 40 to calculate the transfer function of the floating structure the rational fraction of the transfer functions can be obtained the pole residue form of the transfer functions is then calculated using eq 41 5 constructing the state space model of the floating structure based on the identified poles and the corresponding residues using eq 45 the response of the floating structures is computed by regarding the exciting force as an input of the system the flow chart of the proposed method is shown as fig 1 depending on the procedures above the dynamic response of the symmetrical floating structure can be calculated 4 test case response calculation of an sdof system based on the proposed method in this section an sdof system is presented to investigate the performance of the proposed method the heave motion of a symmetrical floating structure is usually decoupled with the other motions which means that studies on an sdof system have a practical significance the newmark β method is applied to compute the dynamic response of the sdof model excited by the force synthesis of harmonic waves which is compared with the proposed method using a state space model instead of an integral directly 4 1 complex exponential decomposition of retardation function the retardation function used in the sdof system is based on pure analytical relations and has all the properties of the convolution term in the time and frequency domains and can be expressed as follows after substituting the parameters taghipour et al 2008 47 k s t 3 e 0 2 t cos 2 t 0 1 sin 2 t implementing laplace transform to the retardation function the laplace transform of eq 47 can be obtained as follows 48 k s s 3 s s 2 0 4 s 4 04 which means the analytical values of the poles and residues of the retardation function can be calculated conveniently through mathematical method the poles are λ 0 2 2 j by solving s 2 0 4 s 4 04 0 and the corresponding residues are 1 5 0 15 j the analytical values can be used to verify the correctness of the poles and the residues calculated by the proposed method to obtain the poles and residues of the retardation function the proposed method decomposes the retardation function into a series of complex exponential components using eq 35 the process contains the following three steps 1 using the discrete retardation function values to construct a hankel matrix 2 obtaining a realization of the system matrix by implementing svd to the obtained hankel matrix and 3 applying an eigenvalue analysis to the system matrix refer to the study by hu et al 2013 and liu et al 2019b to obtain further details of this process in this example the interval time used to discretize the retardation function is δ t 0 2 s and the order of the decomposition is p 2 then the estimated poles when using the proposed method are λ ˆ 0 2 2 j and the corresponding residues are γ ˆ 1 5 0 15 j which are equal to the analytical solutions the reconstructed signal depending on the estimated poles and residues using the proposed method matches well with the original retardation function in both the time and frequency domains as shown in fig 2 which also indicates that the estimate poles and residues have same intrinsic attributes to the retardation function 4 2 identification of state space model based on transfer function once the poles and residues of the retardation function are obtained the state space model corresponding to the sdof system can be further calculated substituting m 1 a 0 5 c 5 5 and eq 47 into eq 6 the expression of the sdof mathematical model can be written as follows 49 1 5 η t 0 t k s t τ η τ d τ 5 5 η t f e x c t depending on the estimated poles and corresponding residues of the retardation function the rational fraction of the laplace transform k s s can be obtained using eq 36 implementing laplace transform to eq 49 and substituting the estimated k s s the impedance function of the sdof model using eq 37 is expressed as follows 50 z s s 1 5 s 2 3 s 2 s 2 0 4 s 4 04 5 5 1 5 s 4 0 6 s 3 14 56 s 2 2 2 s 22 22 s 2 0 4 s 4 04 then the transfer function i e the reciprocal of the impedance function with the pole residue form using eq 41 can be obtained as follows 51 h s s l 1 4 ν l s μ l where the poles of the transfer function are μ 1 2 0 1399 2 7831 j and μ 3 4 0 0601 1 3799 j and the corresponding residues are ν 1 2 0 0126 0 0758 j and ν 3 4 0 0126 0 0879 j in theory the estimation of the transfer function using the proposed method is equivalent to eq 3 when s j ω setting the frequency range from 0 1 to 5 rad s with a frequency interval of δ ω 0 1 rad s the frfs calculated by the estimated transfer function and the traditional frequency domain method are as shown in fig 3 a comparison of the amplitude and phase show that the two results are in accordance with each other therefore the estimated poles and corresponding residues can be used to represent the sdof model depending on the estimated poles and residues of the transfer function the state space of the sdof model can be built using eq 45 as follows 52 a s 0 1399 2 7831 j 0 1399 2 7831 j 0 0601 1 3799 j 0 0601 1 3799 j 53 b s 1 1 1 1 t 54 c s 0 0126 0 0758 j 0 0126 0 0758 j 0 0126 0 0879 j 0 0126 0 0879 j depending on the identified state space model of the sdof system which preserves all information of the system the dynamic response of the sdof system excited by the wave force can be calculated 4 3 comparison of calculated response between the proposed method and traditional time domain method to investigate the proposed method the excitation of the sdof system is simulated using the following formula 55 f e x c t n 1 l a n cos ω n t θ n where a n ω n and θ n are the amplitude frequency and phase of the exciting force components the waves occurring in an actual ocean are usually irregular and can be synthesized by harmonic waves depending on the wave spectrum theory in this example the exciting force contains 20 harmonic components whose frequencies range from 0 15 to 2 rad s with an equal frequency interval of δ ω 0 1 rad s which correspond to the periods of the excitation force covering 3 142 to 41 8879 s to simulate an irregular exciting wave force the amplitudes and phases are generated from a normal distribution generator and the amplitudes should be applied through an absolute value operation to ensure that the values are positive the exciting force of the sdof system is then obtained as plotted in fig 4 excited by the simulated force the traditional newmark β method and the proposed method were both applied to calculate the response of the sdof system setting the calculation time interval as δ t 0 1 s the traditional newmark β method is applied to compute the response of the sdof system with α 0 5 and β 0 25 at the same time substituting the exciting force simulated by eq 55 into the estimated state space model of eqs 52 54 the displacement response of the sdof system can be easily calculated using the function lsim of the control system toolbox in matlab the responses calculated by the two methods are then obtained in the time and frequency domains as shown in fig 5 the comparison diagram indicates that the estimated responses using the traditional method and the proposed approach match well in both time and frequency domains the small discrepancy in the frequency domain can be found when magnifying the frequency range from 1 2 to 1 5 rad s the poorer correspondence between the two methods within a frequency range of 1 2 to 1 5 rad s may lead to the conclusion that new approach has a poor accuracy depending on a study by lu et al 2019 the calculation time step will influence the response estimation of a vibrating system to investigate the reason for the discrepancy between the two methods different calculated time intervals are applied to the proposed method and the time integral method when calculating the response of the sdof system for simplicity and a convenient observation the parameters of eq 55 are set to a n 0 8 ω n 1 5 rad s and θ n π 4 and time intervals δ t 0 01 s and 0 2 s will be applied during the displacement response calculation using the newmark β method the newmark β method is a numerical integral method which means a small time interval according to a higher accuracy the response calculated using δ t 0 01 s is considered as an accurate reference result to discuss the accuracy of the proposed method a time interval of δ t 0 2 s is applied to calculate the response of the sdof system using the proposed method the results are shown in fig 6 as the figure indicates the response calculated by the newmark β method with δ t 0 01 s matches well with the result using the proposed method with δ t 0 2 s but not the newmark β method result with δ t 0 2 s depending on the figure the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the accuracy of the newmark β method is influenced greatly by the calculation time interval and a larger time interval corresponds to a worse result and 2 the proposed method is insensitive to the time interval and has a higher calculation precision when estimating the response of the sdof system 4 4 analysis of computational efficiency the discussion above shows that the proposed method can be applied to accurately calculate the response of the sdof system in fact the proposed method estimates the state space model in the laplace domain and avoids the convolution calculation in the time domain which means that the proposed method may achieve high computational efficiency to survey the computational efficiency of the proposed method the traditional newmark β method was selected for comparison with the proposed method using both methods to calculate the displacement response of the sdof system the cpu time consumed by both methods was saved when running the matlab codes matlab 2016 the calculations were conducted in a computer with an intel core i7 8700 cpu and 16 gb of physical memory the calculation time step of the integral and the discrete time interval of the retardation functions are both set as 0 01 s the time consumed by the two methods is shown as fig 7 when the calculation time ranges from 20 to 120 s with interval 20 s the figure shows that the time consumed by newmark β increases rapidly with duration time of calculation but not the proposed method which indicates that the proposed method is more computationally efficient than the traditional time domain method 5 test case spar type floating offshore wind turbine in this section a spar type floating offshore wind turbine structure is discussed with an aim to extend the proposed method to actual floating offshore structures and to investigate the performance of the estimated responses through a comparison with the results from a traditional time domain method the spar type offshore wind turbine structure is identical to that described by jonkman 2010 which is shown in fig 8 the offshore wind turbine structure includes a 5 mw wind turbine tower and spar type floating platform structure the top of the tower is located at an elevation of 87 6 m above the still water level swl which is coincident with the yaw bearing and the elevation to the tower base is 10 m above the swl the draft of the floating spar platform is 120 m and the spar type floating platform is moored by a system with three catenary lines in the following studies the wave cases include two different regular waves and an irregular wave the response of a spar type floating structure excited by the three waves is estimated by both the proposed method and traditional newmark β method a comparison of their responses was conducted to confirm the validity of the proposed method 5 1 identification of poles and residues of the retardation functions to identify the poles and residues of the corresponding retardation functions the frequency dependent damping should first be calculated the hydrodynamic model of the spar type floating platform is established in sesam and the frequency dependent damping is extracted using the wadam code of sesam the directional angles of the three incident waves are zero degrees which means the responses of the sway roll and yaw are all zero responses only occur in the surge heave and pitch the response amplitude operators raos of which are as shown in fig 9 when the mooring system is linearized as described by jonkman 2010 based on eq 33 the retardation functions k 11 s k 33 t k 51 t and k 55 t will participate in the response computation to obtain these retardation functions the frequency dependent damping b 11 ω b 33 ω b 51 ω and b 55 ω should first be calculated the sampling number of the frequency dependent damping is finite when using sesam to extract b ω which means that a suitable frequency range of b ω should be used to obtain more accurate results applying sesam to extract the frequency dependent damping 200 frequency sampling points of b ω are applied which range from 0 01 to 4 985 rad s as shown in fig 10 the frequency dependent damping of b 11 ω b 33 ω b 51 ω and b 55 ω tends to be zero when the wave frequencies are larger than 5 rad s which means that the truncated errors are negligible once the frequency dependent damping is obtained the corresponding retardation functions in the time domain can be calculated by implementing a cosine transform using eq 5 the retardation functions calculated using the trapezoidal integral method are shown with green lines at the top of figs 11 14 which decline over the time and trend toward zero when the time is longer than 30 s therefore the retardation functions from 0 to 30 s are used to calculate the corresponding poles and residues the sampling time interval is set to 0 1 s to discretize the retardation functions which is the same as the time interval of the displacement response calculation based on the obtained retardation functions of the spar type floating structure the complex exponential decomposition method described in eq 35 is used to identify the poles and residues of the retardation functions to obtain the accurate poles and residues the suitable decomposition orders should be confirmed at first with this method the decomposition orders of the retardation functions are presupposed and the poles and residues are then calculated using the presupposed orders comparing the retardation functions reconstructed by the obtained poles and residues with the original retardation functions and increasing the preset orders until the reconstructed retardation functions coincide with the original retardation functions the preset orders are regarded as suitable decomposition orders lu et al 2019 applying the prony ss method to the retardation functions k 11 t k 33 t k 51 t and k 55 t with decomposition orders 16 10 10 and 10 the results of the identified poles and residues are listed in tables3 4 the retardation functions reconstructed by those poles and residues are shown in the top of figs 11 14 a comparison between the reconstructed and original retardation functions in the time domain indicate that the two sets of data match well to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed decomposition method further the frequency spectrum of the reconstructed and original retardation functions are compared by implementing fourier transform comparisons of the amplitudes in the frequency domain are plotted in the bottom of figs 11 14 which shows that the amplitudes of the reconstructed retardation functions are in good agreement with the original retardation functions i e the identified poles and residues can represent the original retardation functions of the spar type floating structure 5 2 state space model estimation of spar type floating structure system to obtain the state space model of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine the parameters of mass matrix m infinite frequency added mass a and restoring matrix c are first extracted using the wasim code of sesam which are expressed as follows 56 m 8 151 1 0 6 0 0 0 7 329 1 0 8 0 0 8 151 1 0 6 0 7 329 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 151 1 0 6 0 0 0 0 7 329 1 0 8 0 7 541 1 0 10 0 0 7 329 1 0 8 0 0 0 7 541 1 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 716 1 0 7 57 a 7 688 1

replaced with an additional restoring matrix jonkman 2010 the transfer function of the spar type floating structure can be obtained depending on the identified poles and residues and the extracted parameters firstly the identified poles λ i k l and the corresponding residues γ i k l listed in tables3 4 are substituted into eq 37 and the elements of the impedance function z i k s are calculated secondly the rational fraction polynomial form of the impedance function z i k s is computed through a reduction of the fractions into a common denominator thirdly the rational fraction polynomial is substituted into eqs 38 41 and the poles and corresponding residues of the transfer functions are calculated the transfer function can then be obtained in the form of poles and residues the transfer function represents the inherent attribute of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine which can be expressed as h j ω in the frequency domain or h s in the laplace domain the two forms are equivalent in representing the inherent attribute of the system and can be converted into each other using the relation s j ω in addition a ω and b ω are extracted using the wadam code of sesam ranging from 0 01 to 4 985 rad s with a frequency interval of δ ω 0 025 rad s substituting the two parameters into eq 3 the frfs of the spar type floating structure can be obtained the proposed method uses the poles and corresponding residues of the system to express the transfer function of the floating structure in the laplace domain as shown in eq 41 to confirm the correctness of the continuous transfer function calculated by the proposed method the formula s j ω is substituted into eq 41 with the same discrete frequency set as the frfs a comparison of frfs h 11 j ω h 33 j ω h 51 j ω and h 55 j ω as calculated by the traditional and proposed methods are shown in figs 15 18 the figures show that the frfs calculated using the proposed method match well with the results of the traditional method in both the real and imaginary parts which means that the estimated poles and residues of the spar type floating structure system calculated by the proposed method can represent the inherent attribute of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine to calculate the displacement response of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine the state space model should first be constructed which depends on the estimated poles and residues of the transfer function substituting the poles and residues of the spar type floating structure system into eq 45 the state space model corresponding to the transfer function can be obtained the problem of solving the floating offshore structure response is converted into a calculation of the output of a system based on state space model the wave forces are regarded as the input of the system and the outputs then become convenient to obtain based on the state space model 5 3 response calculation of spar type floating offshore wind turbine the wave forces acting on the spar type floating offshore wind turbine are computed using the wasim code of sesam including two regular wave cases and an irregular wave case the wave heights of the two regular waves are 1 4 and 3 66 m and the corresponding periods are 6 5 and 9 7 s which are airy waves from mild to extreme sea state the irregular wave obey the jonswap wave spectrum where the significant wave height is 6 m and the corresponding peak period is 10 s the parameters of the three incident waves are listed in table5 and the three waves are as shown in fig 19 the wave forces include froude krylov and diffraction forces which are extracted by fixing the floating structure the water depth at the location of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine is 320 m the two regular waves defined in table5 change from a mild to an extreme sea state jonkman 2010 substituting the regular wave forces into the estimated state space model of the system described in the above section the displacement responses in the surge heave and pitch are computed using eq 45 which are shown by the red lines in figs 20 and 21 to confirm the correctness of the results the newmark β method is also used to calculate the responses the results are provided in figs 20 and 21 which indicate that the estimated responses when using the proposed method match well with the traditional time domain method the ocean waves are usually irregular to survey the performance of the proposed method the case of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine excited by irregular wave is considered the parameters of the irregular wave cases are list in table5 which is a stochastic wave the results of calculating the wave force and using the two methods mentioned above to estimate the response for the surge heave and pitch are shown in fig 22 the response estimation results of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine indicate that the response using the proposed method is in agreement with the results calculated by the traditional time domain method regardless of whether the exciting wave forces are caused by regular or irregular waves 6 test case a semi submersible platform a semi submersible semi at zero forward speed is described in this section to investigate the performance of the proposed method the semi is a concept model used as an example in sesam which consists of two horizontal pontoons four vertical columns an upper deck and a derrick as shown in fig 23 the semi is symmetrical with respect to the x o z and y o z panels at the same time the length of the two equal pontoons is 80 6 m the horizontal braces have a length of 54 72 m and the height of the semi is 41 m the semi is located in the sea area with a water depth of 300 m the draft of the floating structure is 13 m with a displacement 2 507 10 7 kg the cob is 0 0 13 57 m and the cog is 0 0 10 57 m the detailed parameters can be obtained from sesam 2017 depending on the raos of the semi computed using the wadam code of sesam the responses at the surge heave and pitch only occur when the directional angle of the incident wave is zero degrees to simplify the process of the dynamic response analysis the mooring system is ignored in this example considering the integral drift without a mooring system the response in the surge is unstable so the responses of heave and pitch are analyzed which means that the frequency dependent damping of b 11 ω b 33 ω b 51 ω and b 55 ω will participate in the calculation when using the proposed method the frequency dependent damping is extracted from the wadam code in sesam which ranges from 0 015 to 3 rad s with an interval frequency 0 015 rad s the corresponding retardation functions can then be obtained through cosine transform using eq 5 which are discretized using the interval time δ t 0 1 s once the discrete retardation functions are obtained the poles and residues of the retardation functions can be calculated using the prony ss method the decomposition orders of k 11 t k 33 t k 51 t and k 55 t are set as 20 12 12 and 16 the wave force acting on the semi is computed using the wasim code of sesam which is an irregular wave obeying the jonswap spectrum with a significant wave height of 3 m and a corresponding peak period of 8 s the direction of the irregular wave is zero which indicates that the wave forces only exist in the degrees of the surge heave and pitch as shown in fig 24 excited by the irregular wave the performance of the two methods used to calculate the displacement responses of the semi are discussed namely the proposed method depending on the estimated state space model of the system and the newmark β method applying the two methods to calculate the response with interval time δ t 0 1 s and comparing with the wasim code results the dynamic response in the degrees of heave and pitch are as shown in fig 25 and are in good agreement with each other the response calculation of floating offshore structures using the integral method in the time domain consumes a significant amount of time because of the convolution terms in the motion equation the proposed method avoids the convolution calculation by converting the retardation functions into the form of poles and residues which means that the computational time may be reduced applying the proposed method and the newmark β method to calculate the displacement response of the semi the computational efficiency of the six dofs response estimation will be investigated the calculation time step of the integral and the discrete interval time of the retardation functions are both set as 0 1 s the time duration of the response estimation changes from 200 to 2200 s and increases with a time interval of 400 s under the same computing resources as described in section4 3 the comparison of the computational time when using the proposed and newmark β methods to calculate the displacement response of the semi is shown in fig 26 which indicates that the calculational efficiency of the proposed method improves significantly as compared with traditional time domain method 7 conclusion in this paper a new hybrid time laplace domain response calculation approach for symmetrical floating structures is described implementing complex exponential decomposition to retardation functions the retardation functions can be decomposed into a finite number of exponential components which are a laplace pair with pole residue form of the retardation functions in the laplace domain to obtain the state space model of floating structures the laplace transform is applied to the cummins equation whose retardation functions in the laplace domain are expressed by the estimated poles and residues depending on the special characteristics of the symmetrical floating structures the state space model is identified from the corresponding transfer function finally the exciting forces are regarded as an input of the state space system to calculate the dynamic response the results of three numerical studies elicit the following conclusions 1 the responses calculated by the new method match well with those from the traditional time domain method under various wave excitation cases 2 the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy and stability compared with the newmark β method which means that the estimated response will not show a significant error when using a relatively large calculation time interval finally 3 the time consumption of the response estimation when using the proposed method is significantly reduced compared with the traditional step by step time integral method particularly when the time duration is relatively large which means the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency in addition although the proposed method has the advantage of a higher accuracy and greater computational efficiency there are still two further studies to be conducted in the future the first is how to consider the non zero initial condition such as the velocity or displacement effects on the process of the response estimation for the second a tank experimental study should be conducted to survey the performance of the new method in greater detail credit authorship contribution statement hongchao lu methodology data curation writing original draft writing review

21930,the article focuses on proposing a new hybrid time laplace domain response calculation method for symmetrical floating structures by solving cummins equation which is depending on the state space model identified from transfer function different from a time or frequency domain method the proposed approach estimates the state space model of a floating structure system from the transfer function in the laplace domain and calculates the response by considering the exciting forces as an input of the state space model implementing complex exponential decomposition to the retardation functions the retardation functions in the laplace domain are expressed using a series of poles and the corresponding residues which avoids the numerical integral of the convolution terms in the cummins equation and greatly improves the computational efficiency during the process of a dynamic response analysis three examples are applied to investigate the validity of the proposed method the first is a simple single degree of freedom mathematical model excited by an irregular wave studies have shown that the response calculated by the proposed method matches well with that of a traditional newmark β method meanwhile this approach is insensitive to the interval time of the calculation and consumes less calculation time which means that the proposed method has higher precision and computational efficiency the last two examples are a spar type offshore wind turbine and a semi submersible platform model semi in sesam which extend the proposed method to solve the response estimation problem of marine structures the results of the spar type floating structure show that the estimated responses when using the proposed method are in good agreement with the results of the traditional time domain method by studying the response calculation of semi the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the estimated responses match well with the traditional time domain method and wasim code of sesam and 2 the calculation time of the new approach is reduced significantly compared with the newmark β method especially under a long simulation time keywords cummins equation retardation function complex exponential decomposition laplace transform state space model dynamic response estimation 1 introduction floating offshore structures are the foundation of marine resource and energy development in deep sea locations such as the exploitation of fossil resources and offshore wind energy capture different types of floating offshore platforms have been developed in recent decades including floating production storage and offloading fpso spar platforms and semi submersible platforms the dynamic response estimation of such platforms is an important part during the design stage depending on the calculated response the shape and size of the platform can be optimized to obtain a better hydrodynamic performance the motion behavior of the floating offshore structures under wavy conditions can be expressed through a linear model using the cummins equation cummins 1962 which applies convolution terms of the retardation functions and the motion velocity to reflect the fluid memory effects compared with a low order approximation using constant coefficients to exchange the frequency dependent added mass and damping the accuracy of the response computation when using the cummins equation improves significantly through the introduction of the convolution terms taghipour et al 2008 however the presence of the convolution terms in cummins equation makes it inconvenient for the analysis and design of a motion control system fossen 2002 perez 2002 in addition the dynamic response calculation based on the cummins equation is computationally demanding when solving linear transient or nonlinear problems and the convolution terms integral in the time domain are not convenient to apply in standard simulation packages kashiwagi 2004 to improve the calculation efficiency newman 1977 solved the problem of conducting a dynamic response calculation in the frequency domain when the floating structures are excited by a wave force under the assumption that waves can be expressed as a gaussian process the first order potential theory is applied before applying this method it should be assumed that the steepness of the wave is low and that the response caused by the wave exciting force is proportional to the wave amplitude faltinsen 2005 the linear theory can then be used to compute the dynamic response within the frequency domain considering that the method is based on linear frequency domain theory nonlinear effects induced by damping and stiffness or other factors should be avoided to use the linear theory or should be approximated in a linear form the standard hydrodynamic code of wadam in the commercial software sesam was designed using a frequency domain approach to estimate the frequency response of a floating structure which is implemented through the following three steps first the wave spectrum used to describe the sea state of a floating structure location should be selected second the response amplitude operators raos depending on the potential theory should be calculated third the frequency response of the floating structures depending on the raos is obtained by applying the superposition principle sesam 2017 theoretically the frequency domain method calculates the frequency response under the condition of a steady process which means that only a steady state response can be obtained and not a transient response meanwhile the component of an incident wave acting on a floating structure is defined as a strictly harmonic wave when calculating the raos using the frequency method which ignores the case of a damping harmonic wave to calculate the time domain response an inverse fourier transform should be applied to the obtained frequency response the limitation of an inverse fourier transform such as spectrum leakage may occur during this process which should be considered carefully to address this problem liu et al 2017 calculated the frequency response of floating structures in the laplace domain which applies complex exponential decomposition to the retardation functions and uses the calculated poles and corresponding residues in the laplace transform of the retardation functions thereby avoiding the restriction of demanding wave forces consisting of purely harmonic components when considering the nonlinear effects caused by viscous forces and the water entry and exit a high order frequency domain approach should be applied to solve the nonlinear dynamic response problem bendat 1998 nevertheless high order frequency domain methods are inconvenient to apply and are computationally inefficient taghipour et al 2008 different from a frequency domain method the time domainmethod used to calculate the response of a floating structure is usually based on a numerical integral to solve the cummins equation which can be used to analyze the transient response and avoid the limitation of a fourier transform applied through a frequency domain method however the integral calculation of the convolution terms requires a large amount of computational time and numerous resources when estimating the response of a floating structure which leads to a low computational efficiency of the response estimation to improve the analysis efficiency within the time domain numerous studies have been conducted most of these studies have focused on exchanging the convolution terms with constant coefficients or a state space model which mainly includes the following three methods taghipour et al 2008 1 the use of constant coefficients to replace the frequency dependent added mass and damping 2 the use of a state space formulation to exchange the convolution terms and 3 the use of a state space model to replace the force to motion response function of a floating structure the first approximation is the simplest possible approach and uses constant matrices to replace the frequency dependent added mass and damping values the low order approximation method may lead to relatively large errors when analyzing the transient response excited by a single frequency wave or a steady state response excited by multiple frequency excitations holappa and falzarano 1999 the second approach replaces the convolution terms with a state space model estimated from the retardation functions in the cummins equation which has been widely discussed owing to its efficiency and accuracy to the best of the authors knowledge this method was originally proposed by schmiechen 1973 to analyze the transient response of a ship subsequently the method was applied to calculate the dynamic response of various floating structures taghipour et al 2007 used an alternative state space model to replace the convolution terms associated with the fluid memory effect and conducted a hydroelastic time domain analysis of a flexible marine structure duarte et al 2013 discussed several methods for finding a state space model for the wave radiation forces and compared the results with fast an offshore wind turbine computer aided engineering tool lu et al 2019 applied the replacement of the convolution terms using a state space model to analyze the dynamic response of a semi submersible platform depending on the solution domain the state space model estimation method includes a time domain method and a frequency domain method nocedal and wright 1999 described an impulse response curve fitting method to identify the corresponding state space replacement of the retardation function this method is a nonlinear optimization problem solved by gauss newton algorithms kung 1978 used realization theory to deal with the problem of obtaining a minimal realization the singular value decomposition svd is applied to the hankel matrix consisting of the retardation functions whose results can be used to calculate a minimal realization a replaced state space model can then be constructed sanathanan and koerner 1963 applied quasi linear regression to estimate the transfer function of the retardation function in the frequency domain the state space model is constructed depending on the parameters of the transfer function in the form of a rational fraction the first two methods are time domain methods and the last is a frequency domain method the third approach to converting the force to motion response into a state space model was originally proposed by cummins 1962 inspired by this perez and lande 2006 changed the displacement to velocity using the impulse response from force to velocity which was used to calculate the state space model depending on the frequency response function frf differing from the method mentioned above the objective of this study is to estimate the state space model of floating structures depending on the transfer function in the laplace domain the laplace transfer of the retardation functions is expressed as a sum of the pole residue form which is obtained by implementing complex exponential decomposition to the retardation function the exciting forces are substituted into the estimated state space model to calculate the response of a floating structure depending on the research of wu and moan 1996 the nonlinear effects can be considered as additional load in the process of dynamic response estimation inspired by the study nonlinear effects can be introduced to the model of the proposed method at the late stage to deal with nonlinear effects as the advantages of the proposed method more accurate results can be obtained compared with the step by step integral method and the computational efficiency of the response estimation is greatly improved three examples are applied to investigate the performance of the new approach the first example is a simple single degree of freedom sdof mathematical model whose retardation function depends on a pure analytical relationship and does not represent a real system an irregular exciting force synthesized by harmonic waves is simulated to act on the sdof system applying the proposed method and a step by step integral method to the calculation of the dynamic response a comparison of the corresponding results is conducted

frequency dependent added mass and damping can be converted to added mass and retardation function in the cummins equation the radiation potential satisfies the body boundary conditions on the wet surface of a floating offshore structure which can be written as follows newman 1977 11 ϕ i n j ω n i i 1 2 6 where ϕ i x y z gives the radiation potential of the floating offshore structure with the unit amplitude which corresponds to the response motion of mode i i 1 2 6 for surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw n n 1 n 2 n 3 represents the unit normal vector on the wet surface of the floating offshore structure directed into the body r is the position vector where r n n 4 n 5 n 6 and ω is the radian frequency of the steady motions bernoulli s equation illustrates the relationship between the velocity potential and hydrodynamic pressure acting on the wet surface of a floating structure the radiation force can then be expressed as follows dai and duan 2008 12 f r i re k 1 6 η k e j ω t f i k i 1 2 6 in which 13 f i k ρ s b ϕ i n ϕ k d s where the coefficients f i k give the complex force in direction i owing to a motion of the floating structure with the unit amplitude in direction k substituting eq 11 into eq 13 and decomposing f i k into real and imaginary parts the coefficients can be written as follows 14 f i k ω 2 a i k j ω b i k where the real part a i k and imaginary part b i k depend on the frequency in radian ω then the radiation force can be expressed in the following form by substituting eq 14 into eq 12 15 f r i k 1 6 η k a i k η k b i k where coefficient a i k is proportional to the acceleration and is known as added mass b i k is so called damping coefficient and provides force components proportional to the velocity to investigate the symmetrical feature of the added mass and damping coefficient green s theorem is applied to the potentials ϕ i and ϕ k over a completely closed surface which includes free surface wet surface bottom and control surface at

0 i k 1 2 6 form eq 13 it follows that 17 f i k f k i i k 1 2 6 because the added mass and damping coefficients correspond to the real and imaginary parts of f i k the added mass and damping coefficients are symmetrical i e a i k a k i b i k b k i 3 2 symmetrical feature analysis of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients moving the body fixed coordinates to place the center of gravity cog and center of buoyancy cob along the z axis the coordinates of cog and cob become 0 0 z g and 0 0 z b because of the symmetrical property of symmetrical floating structures the moments of inertia i i k 0 i k and the elements of restoring matrix c 34 c 43 0 c 35 c 53 0 and c 45 c 54 0 can be obtained depending on the calculation formula of the quantities newman 1977 then the mass matrix and restoring matrix of the symmetrical floating structures can be expressed as follows 18 m m 0 0 0 m z g 0 0 m 0 m z g 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 m z g 0 i 11 0 0 m z g 0 0 0 i 22 0 0 0 0 0 0 i 33 19 c 0 0 0 0 0

unit normal vector on a wet surface of a body which points to outside the floating structures when the floating offshore structure is symmetrical about the x o z plane the relationship can be obtained in the following form 20 n 1 x y z n 1 x y z n 2 x y z n 2 x y z n 3 x y z n 3 x y z substituting eq 20 into the relationship formula r n n 4 n 5 n 6 the vector r n satisfies the following relationships 21 n 4 x y z y n 3 x y z z n 2 x y z n 4 x y z n 5 x y z z n 1 x y z x n 3 x y z n 5 x y z n 6 x y z x n 2 x y z y n 1 x y z n 6 x y z depending on eqs 20 and 21 and substituting into eq 11 the relationships can be obtained 22 ϕ 1 3 5 x y z n ϕ 1 3 5 x y z n 23 ϕ 2 4 6 x y z n ϕ 2 4 6 x y z n because eqs 22 and 23 are workable for every point on the wet surface of a symmetrical floating structure the radiation potentials satisfy the following relationship 24 ϕ 1 3 5 x y z ϕ 1 3 5 x y z 25 ϕ 2 4 6 x y z ϕ 2 4 6 x y z depending on the discussion above n 1 n 3 and n 5 are symmetrical about the x o z plane and n 2 n 4 and n 6 are antisymmetrical about the x o z plane associated with the body surface boundary conditions of a floating structure the radiation potential ϕ i i 1 3 5 is symmetrical and ϕ i i 2 4 6 is antisymmetrical about the x o z plane respectively combining the symmetrical features of ϕ i and n i with eqs 11 and 13 when a floating offshore structure is symmetrical about the x o z plane the coefficients f i k are equal to zero when i and k combine in the following ways table1 similarly if the floating offshore structure is symmetric about the y o z plane the coefficients f i k are equal to zero at the following position table2 therefore the added mass coefficient a i k and damping coefficient b i k in eq 14 are equal to zero at the position above which means a ω and b ω of the symmetrical floating structures can be simplified as follows ran 2000 26 a ω a 11 0 0 0 a 15 0 0 a 22 0 a 24 0 0 0 0 a 33 0 0 0 0 a 42 0 a 44 0 0 a 51 0 0 0 a 55 0

cummins equation and η s k s and f e x c s are the laplace transform of the displacement η t the retardation function k t and the exciting force f e x c t respectively to calculate the determinant of the impedance function the matrix of the impedance function is divided into four submatrices zhang and hao 2004 for simplicity let z i j z i j s and the impedance function can be expressed in the following form 31 z s z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z 11 0 0 0 z 15 0 0 z 22 0 z 24 0 0 0 0 z 33 0 0 0 0 z 42 0 z 44 0 0 z 51 0 0 0 z 55 0 0 0 0 0 0 z 66 where z 1 z 11 0 0 0 z 22 0 0 0 z 33 z 2 0 z 15 0 z 24 0 0 0 0 0 z 3 0 z 42 0 z 51 0 0 0 0 0 z 4 z 44 0 0 0 z 55 0 0 0 z 66 then the determinant of the impedance function is calculated using the following formula 32 z s z 1 z 4 z 3 z 1 1 z 2 z 11 z 22 z 33 z 44 z 42 z 22 1 z 24 z 55 z 51 z 11 1 z 15 z 66 the same method is used to calculate the corresponding algebraic complements of z s the transfer function of a symmetrical floating offshore structure is the reciprocal of the impedance function which can be expressed as follows 33 h s z s 1 z 55 z 11 z 55 z 15 2 0 0 0 z 15 z 15 2 z 11 z 55 0 0 z 44 z 22 z 44 z 42 2 0 z 24 z 24 2 z 22 z 44 0 0 0 0 1 z 33 0 0 0 0 z 42 z 42 2 z 22 z 44 0 z 22 z 22 z 44 z 42 2 0 0 z 51 z 51 2 z 11 z 55 0 0 0 z 11 z 11 z 55 z 15 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 z 66 let m i k m i k a i k where m i k and a i k give the element of mass matrix m and infinite frequency added mass a then the elements of the impedance function z s become the following 34 z i k s s 2 m i k s k i k s c i k where k i k s and c i k are the elements of k s and c 3 4 response estimation based on state space model the retardation function can be decomposed into a finite number of exponential components using a previously described method hu et al 2013 35 k i k t l 1 p γ i k l e λ i k l t where p is the number of terms λ i k l must be real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs and γ i k l are the complex numbers corresponding to λ i k l therefore the laplace transfer of a retardation function yields the following pole residue form in the laplace domain 36 k i k s l 1 p γ i k l s λ i k l i e λ i k l are the poles and γ i k l are the corresponding residues a equivalent form of eq 36 can be expressed as a rational function a i k s b i k s where b i k s s λ i k 1 s λ i k 2 s λ i k p and a i k s is the sum of the numerators after a reduction of the fractions to a common denominator substituting the rational function of eq 36 into eq 34 the elements of z s can be expressed as follows 37 z i k s s 2 m i k s a i k s b i k s c i k n i k s m i k s where n i k s and m i k s are the numerator and denominator after a reduction of the fractions to a common denominator substituting eq 37 into eq 33 the transfer function of a symmetrical floating offshore structure can be calculated using the following method 38 h i i s z i i 1 m i i s n i i s i 3 6 39 h i i s z k k z i i z k k z i k 2 n k k s m k k s n i i s m i i s n k k

polynomial b i k s has distinct roots which means the order of the denominator b i k s is p and is greater than the order of the numerator a i k s after a reduction of the fractions to a common denominator the order of the numerator polynomial n i k s is p 2 and the denominator polynomial m i k s is the same as b i k s therefore the order of the denominator polynomial of h i k s is greater than the order of the corresponding numerator polynomial after substituting eq 37 into eq 33 and the transfer function can be expressed in the following pole residue form 41 h i k s p i k s q i k s l 1 q ν i k l s μ i k l h i k s 0 where p i k s and q i k s are the numerator and denominator of the transfer function the pole μ i k l is the root of q i k s 0 and the corresponding residue ν i k l can be calculated by the following limit operation tian et al 2019 42 ν i k l lim s μ i k l s μ i k l h i k s the transfer function and the impulse response function of a symmetrical floating offshore structure is a laplace transfer pair implementing an inverse laplace transfer to eq 41 the impulse response function can be obtained as follows 43 h i k t l 1 h i k s l 1 q ν i k l e μ i k l t for a linear system the response of the system is the convolution of the impulse response function and input therefore the displacement response of a floating offshore structure at coordinate k to the load at i is expressed through the following convolution integral 44 η i k t 0 t h i k t τ f k e x c τ d τ the convolution integral is inconvenient for an analysis of the response estimation and will consume numerous computing resources when the duration of the calculation time is comparatively long the impulse response function can be converted into a equivalent state space model of a linear system taghipour et al 2008 which can be used to improve the calculation efficiency lu et al 2019 discussed a method to calculate the state space model depending on the impulse response function and proposed a method using poles and the corresponding residues of the impulse response function to establish a state space model which coincides with the case applied in the present study the equivalence of eq 44 can be expressed using the state space model in the following form liu et al 2016 45 z t a i k z t b i k f k e x c t η i k t c i k z t where a i k μ i k 1 μ i k 2 μ i k q b i k 1 1 1 c i k ν i k l ν i k 2 ν i k q the total response of a symmetrical floating offshore structure at coordinate i induced by a general loading involving all components of the load vector f e x c t can be obtained by summing the contributions from all load components as follows 46 η i t k 1 6 η i k t 3 5 procedure of the proposed method to apply the method proposed in this article the following procedures are implemented to calculate the response of a symmetrical floating structure 1 extracting a and b ω from sesam software and using eq 5 to implement a trapezoidal integral the retardation

implementing complex exponential decomposition using the prony ss method the poles and corresponding residues are obtained which means the laplace transform of the retardation function k i k s can be expressed using the pole residue form 3 applying a laplace transform to the cummins equation and assuming that the initial displacement and velocity are both zero the impedance function of the cummins equation is calculated as shown in eq 30 substituting k i k s into the impedance function and reducing the fraction to a common denominator the impedance function z i k s can be expressed using a rational fraction as shown in eq 37 4 substituting the impedance function z i k s into eq 33 and using eqs 38 40 to calculate the transfer function of the floating structure the rational fraction of the transfer functions can be obtained the pole residue form of the transfer functions is then calculated using eq 41 5 constructing the state space model of the floating structure based on the identified poles and the corresponding residues using eq 45 the response of the floating structures is computed by regarding the exciting force as an input of the system the flow chart of the proposed method is shown as fig 1 depending on the procedures above the dynamic response of the symmetrical floating structure can be calculated 4 test case response calculation of an sdof system based on the proposed method in this section an sdof system is presented to investigate the performance of the proposed method the heave motion of a symmetrical floating structure is usually decoupled with the other motions which means that studies on an sdof system have a practical significance the newmark β method is applied to compute the dynamic response of the sdof model excited by the force synthesis of harmonic waves which is compared with the proposed method using a state space model instead of an integral directly 4 1 complex exponential decomposition of retardation function the retardation function used in the sdof system is based on pure analytical relations and has all the properties of the convolution term in the time and frequency domains and can be expressed as follows after substituting the parameters taghipour et al 2008 47 k s t 3 e 0 2 t cos 2 t 0 1 sin 2 t implementing laplace transform to the retardation function the laplace transform of eq 47 can be obtained as follows 48 k s s 3 s s 2 0 4 s 4 04 which means the analytical values of the poles and residues of the retardation function can be calculated conveniently through mathematical method the poles are λ 0 2 2 j by solving s 2 0 4 s 4 04 0 and the corresponding residues are 1 5 0 15 j the analytical values can be used to verify the correctness of the poles and the residues calculated by the proposed method to obtain the poles and residues of the retardation function the proposed method decomposes the retardation function into a series of complex exponential components using eq 35 the process contains the following three steps 1 using the discrete retardation function values to construct a hankel matrix 2 obtaining a realization of the system matrix by implementing svd to the obtained hankel matrix and 3 applying an eigenvalue analysis to the system matrix refer to the study by hu et al 2013 and liu et al 2019b to obtain further details of this process in this example the interval time used to discretize the retardation function is δ t 0 2 s and the order of the decomposition is p 2 then the estimated poles when using the proposed method are λ ˆ 0 2 2 j and the corresponding residues are γ ˆ 1 5 0 15 j which are equal to the analytical solutions the reconstructed signal depending on the estimated poles and residues using the proposed method matches well with the original retardation function in both the time and frequency domains as shown in fig 2 which also indicates that the estimate poles and residues have same intrinsic attributes to the retardation function 4 2 identification of state space model based on transfer function once the poles and residues of the retardation function are obtained the state space model corresponding to the sdof system can be further calculated substituting m 1 a 0 5 c 5 5 and eq 47 into eq 6 the expression of the sdof mathematical model can be written as follows 49 1 5 η t 0 t k s t τ η τ d τ 5 5 η t f e x c t depending on the estimated poles and corresponding residues of the retardation function the rational fraction of the laplace transform k s s can be obtained using eq 36 implementing laplace transform to eq 49 and substituting the estimated k s s the impedance function of the sdof model using eq 37 is expressed as follows 50 z s s 1 5 s 2 3 s 2 s 2 0 4 s 4 04 5 5 1 5 s 4 0 6 s 3 14 56 s 2 2 2 s 22 22 s 2 0 4 s 4 04 then the transfer function i e the reciprocal of the impedance function with the pole residue form using eq 41 can be obtained as follows 51 h s s l 1 4 ν l s μ l where the poles of the transfer function are μ 1 2 0 1399 2 7831 j and μ 3 4 0 0601 1 3799 j and the corresponding residues are ν 1 2 0 0126 0 0758 j and ν 3 4 0 0126 0 0879 j in theory the estimation of the transfer function using the proposed method is equivalent to eq 3 when s j ω setting the frequency range from 0 1 to 5 rad s with a frequency interval of δ ω 0 1 rad s the frfs calculated by the estimated transfer function and the traditional frequency domain method are as shown in fig 3 a comparison of the amplitude and phase show that the two results are in accordance with each other therefore the estimated poles and corresponding residues can be used to represent the sdof model depending on the estimated poles and residues of the transfer function the state space of the sdof model can be built using eq 45 as follows 52 a s 0 1399 2 7831 j 0 1399 2 7831 j 0 0601 1 3799 j 0 0601 1 3799 j 53 b s 1 1 1 1 t 54 c s 0 0126 0 0758 j 0 0126 0 0758 j 0 0126 0 0879 j 0 0126 0 0879 j depending on the identified state space model of the sdof system which preserves all information of the system the dynamic response of the sdof system excited by the wave force can be calculated 4 3 comparison of calculated response between the proposed method and traditional time domain method to investigate the proposed method the excitation of the sdof system is simulated using the following formula 55 f e x c t n 1 l a n cos ω n t θ n where a n ω n and θ n are the amplitude frequency and phase of the exciting force components the waves occurring in an actual ocean are usually irregular and can be synthesized by harmonic waves depending on the wave spectrum theory in this example the exciting force contains 20 harmonic components whose frequencies range from 0 15 to 2 rad s with an equal frequency interval of δ ω 0 1 rad s which correspond to the periods of the excitation force covering 3 142 to 41 8879 s to simulate an irregular exciting wave force the amplitudes and phases are generated from a normal distribution generator and the amplitudes should be applied through an absolute value operation to ensure that the values are positive the exciting force of the sdof system is then obtained as plotted in fig 4 excited by the simulated force the traditional newmark β method and the proposed method were both applied to calculate the response of the sdof system setting the calculation time interval as δ t 0 1 s the traditional newmark β method is applied to compute the response of the sdof system with α 0 5 and β 0 25 at the same time substituting the exciting force simulated by eq 55 into the estimated state space model of eqs 52 54 the displacement response of the sdof system can be easily calculated using the function lsim of the control system toolbox in matlab the responses calculated by the two methods are then obtained in the time and frequency domains as shown in fig 5 the comparison diagram indicates that the estimated responses using the traditional method and the proposed approach match well in both time and frequency domains the small discrepancy in the frequency domain can be found when magnifying the frequency range from 1 2 to 1 5 rad s the poorer correspondence between the two methods within a frequency range of 1 2 to 1 5 rad s may lead to the conclusion that new approach has a poor accuracy depending on a study by lu et al 2019 the calculation time step will influence the response estimation of a vibrating system to investigate the reason for the discrepancy between the two methods different calculated time intervals are applied to the proposed method and the time integral method when calculating the response of the sdof system for simplicity and a convenient observation the parameters of eq 55 are set to a n 0 8 ω n 1 5 rad s and θ n π 4 and time intervals δ t 0 01 s and 0 2 s will be applied during the displacement response calculation using the newmark β method the newmark β method is a numerical integral method which means a small time interval according to a higher accuracy the response calculated using δ t 0 01 s is considered as an accurate reference result to discuss the accuracy of the proposed method a time interval of δ t 0 2 s is applied to calculate the response of the sdof system using the proposed method the results are shown in fig 6 as the figure indicates the response calculated by the newmark β method with δ t 0 01 s matches well with the result using the proposed method with δ t 0 2 s but not the newmark β method result with δ t 0 2 s depending on the figure the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the accuracy of the newmark β method is influenced greatly by the calculation time interval and a larger time interval corresponds to a worse result and 2 the proposed method is insensitive to the time interval and has a higher calculation precision when estimating the response of the sdof system 4 4 analysis of computational efficiency the discussion above shows that the proposed method can be applied to accurately calculate the response of the sdof system in fact the proposed method estimates the state space model in the laplace domain and avoids the convolution calculation in the time domain which means that the proposed method may achieve high computational efficiency to survey the computational efficiency of the proposed method the traditional newmark β method was selected for comparison with the proposed method using both methods to calculate the displacement response of the sdof system the cpu time consumed by both methods was saved when running the matlab codes matlab 2016 the calculations were conducted in a computer with an intel core i7 8700 cpu and 16 gb of physical memory the calculation time step of the integral and the discrete time interval of the retardation functions are both set as 0 01 s the time consumed by the two methods is shown as fig 7 when the calculation time ranges from 20 to 120 s with interval 20 s the figure shows that the time consumed by newmark β increases rapidly with duration time of calculation but not the proposed method which indicates that the proposed method is more computationally efficient than the traditional time domain method 5 test case spar type floating offshore wind turbine in this section a spar type floating offshore wind turbine structure is discussed with an aim to extend the proposed method to actual floating offshore structures and to investigate the performance of the estimated responses through a comparison with the results from a traditional time domain method the spar type offshore wind turbine structure is identical to that described by jonkman 2010 which is shown in fig 8 the offshore wind turbine structure includes a 5 mw wind turbine tower and spar type floating platform structure the top of the tower is located at an elevation of 87 6 m above the still water level swl which is coincident with the yaw bearing and the elevation to the tower base is 10 m above the swl the draft of the floating spar platform is 120 m and the spar type floating platform is moored by a system with three catenary lines in the following studies the wave cases include two different regular waves and an irregular wave the response of a spar type floating structure excited by the three waves is estimated by both the proposed method and traditional newmark β method a comparison of their responses was conducted to confirm the validity of the proposed method 5 1 identification of poles and residues of the retardation functions to identify the poles and residues of the corresponding retardation functions the frequency dependent damping should first be calculated the hydrodynamic model of the spar type floating platform is established in sesam and the frequency dependent damping is extracted using the wadam code of sesam the directional angles of the three incident waves are zero degrees which means the responses of the sway roll and yaw are all zero responses only occur in the surge heave and pitch the response amplitude operators raos of which are as shown in fig 9 when the mooring system is linearized as described by jonkman 2010 based on eq 33 the retardation functions k 11 s k 33 t k 51 t and k 55 t will participate in the response computation to obtain these retardation functions the frequency dependent damping b 11 ω b 33 ω b 51 ω and b 55 ω should first be calculated the sampling number of the frequency dependent damping is finite when using sesam to extract b ω which means that a suitable frequency range of b ω should be used to obtain more accurate results applying sesam to extract the frequency dependent damping 200 frequency sampling points of b ω are applied which range from 0 01 to 4 985 rad s as shown in fig 10 the frequency dependent damping of b 11 ω b 33 ω b 51 ω and b 55 ω tends to be zero when the wave frequencies are larger than 5 rad s which means that the truncated errors are negligible once the frequency dependent damping is obtained the corresponding retardation functions in the time domain can be calculated by implementing a cosine transform using eq 5 the retardation functions calculated using the trapezoidal integral method are shown with green lines at the top of figs 11 14 which decline over the time and trend toward zero when the time is longer than 30 s therefore the retardation functions from 0 to 30 s are used to calculate the corresponding poles and residues the sampling time interval is set to 0 1 s to discretize the retardation functions which is the same as the time interval of the displacement response calculation based on the obtained retardation functions of the spar type floating structure the complex exponential decomposition method described in eq 35 is used to identify the poles and residues of the retardation functions to obtain the accurate poles and residues the suitable decomposition orders should be confirmed at first with this method the decomposition orders of the retardation functions are presupposed and the poles and residues are then calculated using the presupposed orders comparing the retardation functions reconstructed by the obtained poles and residues with the original retardation functions and increasing the preset orders until the reconstructed retardation functions coincide with the original retardation functions the preset orders are regarded as suitable decomposition orders lu et al 2019 applying the prony ss method to the retardation functions k 11 t k 33 t k 51 t and k 55 t with decomposition orders 16 10 10 and 10 the results of the identified poles and residues are listed in tables3 4 the retardation functions reconstructed by those poles and residues are shown in the top of figs 11 14 a comparison between the reconstructed and original retardation functions in the time domain indicate that the two sets of data match well to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed decomposition method further the frequency spectrum of the reconstructed and original retardation functions are compared by implementing fourier transform comparisons of the amplitudes in the frequency domain are plotted in the bottom of figs 11 14 which shows that the amplitudes of the reconstructed retardation functions are in good agreement with the original retardation functions i e the identified poles and residues can represent the original retardation functions of the spar type floating structure 5 2 state space model estimation of spar type floating structure system to obtain the state space model of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine the parameters of mass matrix m infinite frequency added mass a and restoring matrix c are first extracted using the wasim code of sesam which are expressed as

replaced with an additional restoring matrix jonkman 2010 the transfer function of the spar type floating structure can be obtained depending on the identified poles and residues and the extracted parameters firstly the identified poles λ i k l and the corresponding residues γ i k l listed in tables3 4 are substituted into eq 37 and the elements of the impedance function z i k s are calculated secondly the rational fraction polynomial form of the impedance function z i k s is computed through a reduction of the fractions into a common denominator thirdly the rational fraction polynomial is substituted into eqs 38 41 and the poles and corresponding residues of the transfer functions are calculated the transfer function can then be obtained in the form of poles and residues the transfer function represents the inherent attribute of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine which can be expressed as h j ω in the frequency domain or h s in the laplace domain the two forms are equivalent in representing the inherent attribute of the system and can be converted into each other using the relation s j ω in addition a ω and b ω are extracted using the wadam code of sesam ranging from 0 01 to 4 985 rad s with a frequency interval of δ ω 0 025 rad s substituting the two parameters into eq 3 the frfs of the spar type floating structure can be obtained the proposed method uses the poles and corresponding residues of the system to express the transfer function of the floating structure in the laplace domain as shown in eq 41 to confirm the correctness of the continuous transfer function calculated by the proposed method the formula s j ω is substituted into eq 41 with the same discrete frequency set as the frfs a comparison of frfs h 11 j ω h 33 j ω h 51 j ω and h 55 j ω as calculated by the traditional and proposed methods are shown in figs 15 18 the figures show that the frfs calculated using the proposed method match well with the results of the traditional method in both the real and imaginary parts which means that the estimated poles and residues of the spar type floating structure system calculated by the proposed method can represent the inherent attribute of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine to calculate the displacement response of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine the state space model should first be constructed which depends on the estimated poles and residues of the transfer function substituting the poles and residues of the spar type floating structure system into eq 45 the state space model corresponding to the transfer function can be obtained the problem of solving the floating offshore structure response is converted into a calculation of the output of a system based on state space model the wave forces are regarded as the input of the system and the outputs then become convenient to obtain based on the state space model 5 3 response calculation of spar type floating offshore wind turbine the wave forces acting on the spar type floating offshore wind turbine are computed using the wasim code of sesam including two regular wave cases and an irregular wave case the wave heights of the two regular waves are 1 4 and 3 66 m and the corresponding periods are 6 5 and 9 7 s which are airy waves from mild to extreme sea state the irregular wave obey the jonswap wave spectrum where the significant wave height is 6 m and the corresponding peak period is 10 s the parameters of the three incident waves are listed in table5 and the three waves are as shown in fig 19 the wave forces include froude krylov and diffraction forces which are extracted by fixing the floating structure the water depth at the location of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine is 320 m the two regular waves defined in table5 change from a mild to an extreme sea state jonkman 2010 substituting the regular wave forces into the estimated state space model of the system described in the above section the displacement responses in the surge heave and pitch are computed using eq 45 which are shown by the red lines in figs 20 and 21 to confirm the correctness of the results the newmark β method is also used to calculate the responses the results are provided in figs 20 and 21 which indicate that the estimated responses when using the proposed method match well with the traditional time domain method the ocean waves are usually irregular to survey the performance of the proposed method the case of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine excited by irregular wave is considered the parameters of the irregular wave cases are list in table5 which is a stochastic wave the results of calculating the wave force and using the two methods mentioned above to estimate the response for the surge heave and pitch are shown in fig 22 the response estimation results of the spar type floating offshore wind turbine indicate that the response using the proposed method is in agreement with the results calculated by the traditional time domain method regardless of whether the exciting wave forces are caused by regular or irregular waves 6 test case a semi submersible platform a semi submersible semi at zero forward speed is described in this section to investigate the performance of the proposed method the semi is a concept model used as an example in sesam which consists of two horizontal pontoons four vertical columns an upper deck and a derrick as shown in fig 23 the semi is symmetrical with respect to the x o z and y o z panels at the same time the length of the two equal pontoons is 80 6 m the horizontal braces have a length of 54 72 m and the height of the semi is 41 m the semi is located in the sea area with a water depth of 300 m the draft of the floating structure is 13 m with a displacement 2 507 10 7 kg the cob is 0 0 13 57 m and the cog is 0 0 10 57 m the detailed parameters can be obtained from sesam 2017 depending on the raos of the semi computed using the wadam code of sesam the responses at the surge heave and pitch only occur when the directional angle of the incident wave is zero degrees to simplify the process of the dynamic response analysis the mooring system is ignored in this example considering the integral drift without a mooring system the response in the surge is unstable so the responses of heave and pitch are analyzed which means that the frequency dependent damping of b 11 ω b 33 ω b 51 ω and b 55 ω will participate in the calculation when using the proposed method the frequency dependent damping is extracted from the wadam code in sesam which ranges from 0 015 to 3 rad s with an interval frequency 0 015 rad s the corresponding retardation functions can then be obtained through cosine transform using eq 5 which are discretized using the interval time δ t 0 1 s once the discrete retardation functions are obtained the poles and residues of the retardation functions can be calculated using the prony ss method the decomposition orders of k 11 t k 33 t k 51 t and k 55 t are set as 20 12 12 and 16 the wave force acting on the semi is computed using the wasim code of sesam which is an irregular wave obeying the jonswap spectrum with a significant wave height of 3 m and a corresponding peak period of 8 s the direction of the irregular wave is zero which indicates that the wave forces only exist in the degrees of the surge heave and pitch as shown in fig 24 excited by the irregular wave the performance of the two methods used to calculate the displacement responses of the semi are discussed namely the proposed method depending on the estimated state space model of the system and the newmark β method applying the two methods to calculate the response with interval time δ t 0 1 s and comparing with the wasim code results the dynamic response in the degrees of heave and pitch are as shown in fig 25 and are in good agreement with each other the response calculation of floating offshore structures using the integral method in the time domain consumes a significant amount of time because of the convolution terms in the motion equation the proposed method avoids the convolution calculation by converting the retardation functions into the form of poles and residues which means that the computational time may be reduced applying the proposed method and the newmark β method to calculate the displacement response of the semi the computational efficiency of the six dofs response estimation will be investigated the calculation time step of the integral and the discrete interval time of the retardation functions are both set as 0 1 s the time duration of the response estimation changes from 200 to 2200 s and increases with a time interval of 400 s under the same computing resources as described in section4 3 the comparison of the computational time when using the proposed and newmark β methods to calculate the displacement response of the semi is shown in fig 26 which indicates that the calculational efficiency of the proposed method improves significantly as compared with traditional time domain method 7 conclusion in this paper a new hybrid time laplace domain response calculation approach for symmetrical floating structures is described implementing complex exponential decomposition to retardation functions the retardation functions can be decomposed into a finite number of exponential components which are a laplace pair with pole residue form of the retardation functions in the laplace domain to obtain the state space model of floating structures the laplace transform is applied to the cummins equation whose retardation functions in the laplace domain are expressed by the estimated poles and residues depending on the special characteristics of the symmetrical floating structures the state space model is identified from the corresponding transfer function finally the exciting forces are regarded as an input of the state space system to calculate the dynamic response the results of three numerical studies elicit the following conclusions 1 the responses calculated by the new method match well with those from the traditional time domain method under various wave excitation cases 2 the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy and stability compared with the newmark β method which means that the estimated response will not show a significant error when using a relatively large calculation time interval finally 3 the time consumption of the response estimation when using the proposed method is significantly reduced compared with the traditional step by step time integral method particularly when the time duration is relatively large which means the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency in addition although the proposed method has the advantage of a higher accuracy and greater computational efficiency there are still two further studies to be conducted in the future the first is how to consider the non zero initial condition such as the velocity or displacement effects on the process of the response estimation for the second a tank experimental study should be conducted to survey the performance of the new method in greater detail credit authorship contribution statement hongchao lu methodology data curation writing original draft writing review

21931,synthetic fiber ropes are widely used in the maritime industry with applications from sailboat rigging to offshore platform mooring lines thanks to their numerous qualities compared to steel cables light weight good specific mechanical properties and excellent marine resistance a key feature of these ropes is their sensitivity to loading history as this affects subsequent performance in the present work the influence of the maximum bedding in load level and the loading path were studied at the different rope component scales filament yarn and braided rope in order to develop an optimal bedding in procedure for braided ropes the load levels were 10 30 and 50 of the tensile break load of the sample from the results obtained the influence of braid construction and material have been studied and an efficient bedding in process has been defined it was shown that the main parameter is the maximum load level the loading path is not important the load required to bed in hmpe ropes is closely related to changes in the braid angle under load keywords hmpe rope bedding in stretched fiber braided 1 introduction fiber ropes have been used for thousands of years thanks to their excellent tensile strength environmental resistance and light weight synthetic materials such as polyester polyamide aramid and polyethylene are newcomers in the history of fiber ropes and have extended the range of possible applications they offer the potential to replace many steel wire ropes and chains especially for mooring lines however synthetic fiber rope behavior is more complex than that of steel wire ropes this is due to both the complex behavior of polymer fibers and the hierarchical structure of rope components leech 2003 the most common rope construction used in mooring lines is based on twisted strands and these have been widely studied del vecchio 1992 ghoreishi 2005 raoof and hobbs 1988 braided ropes are the other main type of rope construction and have also been studied in the past decades davies et al 2002 vu et al 2015 a bedding in protocol a sequence of tensile loading to settle the fibers and their geometry is essential for synthetic fiber ropes it allows stabilizing the mechanical properties of ropes by applying a known loading history to the rope before use to understand the consequences of the bedding in protocol on the rope deformation mechanisms some researchers have focused on the influence of rope construction on the mechanical behavior hoppe 1991 leech and hearle 1993 raoof and hobbs 1988 and others on the role of loading history casey et al 2000 davies et al 2002 del vecchio 1992 these two points concerning the construction and the history effect need further investigation many investigations have focused on the understanding of the geometry of the rope the interactions between each scale and the behavior of smaller scales in order to be able to model numerically or empirically the mechanical behavior of synthetic fiber ropes for example ghoreishi et al 2007 developed a nonlinear elastic continuum model based on various earlier models for steel and synthetic stranded ropes such as those of hoppe 1991 leech and hearle 1993 raoof and hobbs 1988 these models are based on the geometries and the properties of each scale and friction is also considered in some of them davies et al 2006 applied leech s model and found a good correlation of tension torsion properties for results on full size long rope samples braided ropes have received less attention than stranded ropes but some researchers have investigated behavior models in particular rawal et al 2015 vu et al 2015 the development of finite element simulations and other analytical models are helpful to understand the complex behavior of fiber ropes and the mechanisms of the bedding in process these must account for internal friction between fibers and the reorganization of fibers under the load the bedding in process and loading history effects have been studied in some detail during the development of the use of polyester ropes for floating platform mooring lines in the offshore industry it is generally agreed that a bedding in process will change the mechanical properties of ropes significantly for banfield and casey 1998 the bedding process has to be recorded to interpret rope properties correctly work by casey et al 2000 davies et al 2002 del vecchio 1992 hooker and bosman 1999 liu et al 2014 weller et al 2014 has led to the conclusion that the mean load and the strain amplitude are the two main parameters which influence the mechanical behavior of ropes under cyclic loads as casey et al 2000 concluded the dynamic stiffness after a full bedding in process remains constant however if the permanent strain due to molecular rearrangement in the fibers and geometric construction changes is not removed by the bedding in sequence it will result in lower stiffness values by understanding the effects of the bedding in simplified behavior models for ropes can be proposed davies et al 2002 developed an empirical expression for evaluating the dynamic stiffness of hmpe ropes liu et al 2014 further developed these expressions in order to obtain the dynamic stiffness from small size ropes and extrapolate to larger ones and also to take into account the mean load strain amplitude and number of loading cycles lian et al 2018a concluded that different bedding in levels can cause different values of strain initial creep and dynamic stiffness for the same test samples for this reason the investigation of the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes is essential for most applications even if there is agreement on the need for a bedding in procedure to stabilize rope behavior before measuring stiffness values there are different recommendations american bureau of shipping abs 2011 bureau veritas 2007 international standards organization iso 2004 bedding in protocols are not the same according to each guideline but they have the same purpose which is to stabilize the rope length and to improve rope and termination efficiencies del vecchio 1992 used a bedding in loading sequence of 1000 cycles between 10 and 30 of the minimum breaking load mbl casey and banfield 2005 concluded that at least 10 000 cycles are required to get nearer to a fully bedded in state but they recommend that at least 500 cycles be applied lechat 2007 followed a recommendation of the oil companies international marine forum ocimf for bedding in before testing which includes five steps of 5 min at 50 of the mbl minimum break load each followed by a recovery step at 2 of the mbl humeau 2017 applied 5 cycles between 2 and 50 of the mbl these different examples show how numerous bedding in sequences are used and that there is not a unified procedure that is why lian et al 2018a presented a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes based on the tension strain curve for static tensile loading the permanent elongation francois and davies 2000 humeau 2017 of synthetic fiber ropes is the result of two types of elongation the rope construction component and the material contribution the permanent elongation related to the construction can be explained by compaction and the realignment of fibers in the loading direction chailleux and davies 2005 humeau 2017 and williams et al 2002 have included these contributions in elasto viscoelastic plastic models which they applied to polyester and aramid yarns williams et al 2002 have observed that for a basic response for each sub scale the response of the rope is not the same due to the construction influence most of the published work on bedding in has been focused on polyester polyamide and aramid fibers very few authors with the exception of costa and chimisso 2011 davies et al 2011 humeau et al 2018 lian et al 2019 2018b 2015 have considered hmpe to the authors knowledge no previous studies have presented results for ropes based on the dyneema sk99 hmpe grade this grade was specially developed for the nautical industry and shows high tensile stiffness and strength table 1 shows nominal properties of different grades of dyneema vlasblom 2018 there are also few published test results from tests at different scales of a rope construction and these are essential in order to establish the influence of load history on each one in the present study different input parameters have been varied such as maximum load during bedding in this has been done previously but here the loading history path was also varied in order to understand its contribution in summary bedding in is primordial for synthetic fiber ropes and a thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved is very important for many marine applications for example neither tensioning of sailboat rigging nor the installation of offshore mooring lines is possible without a good estimation of elongation during first loading the aim of the present study is to separate the construction and material contributions of the bedding in process to the mechanical behavior of hmpe braided ropes different bedding in sequences will be applied to investigate the influence of the loading history on the mechanical behavior first the material and experimental devices will be presented followed by the definition of the bedding in protocols the stress strain curves from static tensile tests for each scale of synthetic fibers ropes will then be presented based on the test results the discussion will provide conclusions about the optimal bedding in process and the influence of rope construction 2 materials and methods 2 1 material the synthetic fiber ropes tested in the present study were made of dyneema sk99 fibers the rope was braided with a 16 strand construction and a nominal diameter of 4 mm a coating was applied by the manufacturer the samples were provided by the lancelin corderie ernée france the results from these small diameter ropes can be used as a first approach towards understanding the behavior of bigger ropes such as the ones used in offshore platform mooring lines as many researchers have shown previously the geometrical structure of the rope is one of the major factors in determining the mechanical elongations that occur during bedding in process in order to quantify the importance of the construction the study investigated the bedding in behavior at different rope levels fig 1 the different scales are the braided rope the strand the yarn and the filament the rope is made of 16 strands each strand composed of 5 yarns and each yarn of approximately 800 filaments 2 2 samples and experimental equipment 2 2 1 rope the tensile testing machine used for ropes is an adamel lhomargy dy 36 with a 100 kn load cell the 100 kn load cell was calibrated in 2019 it has an accuracy of 5 8n 0 0421 for a 14 kn load the test specimens are ropes with eye splices at each end fig 2 several researchers leech 2003 leech and hearle 1993 milne and mclaren 2006 have studied the best way to terminate a braided rope and eye splices provide the maximal strength rope samples were loaded with steel pins with a diameter of 20 mm a local strain measurement system was used in order to avoid measuring the slip that will occur in the end termination during loading for the case of the rope a retiga 6000 camera and ni vision assistance software allowed the movement of two markers fixed to the rope to be followed each rope sample was weighed and its length measured before making the splices in order to determine its linear density the initial dimensions of the rope samples were 10 20 cm of useable length in the central section l g a u g e each splice length l s p l i c e measured 30 35 cm with an eye length around 3 5 cm giving a total length l t o t a l of 87 cm fig 3 break loads were also determined eight monotonic loading tests until failure were performed to obtain a mean breaking load the mean loading rate was 1 min the mean rope breaking load obtained was 14 7 kn with a standard deviation of 786n the linear density of the rope was measured and a value of 8 685 g m was obtained despite the fact that the strains are measured directly in the gauge region the vicinity of the splices may have an effect on the strain measured to investigate the influence of the distance from the splice on the strain measured additional tests have been performed on a dyneema sk99 rope with a diameter of 4 mm as shown in fig 4 fig 5 represents several markers which were located at different lengths from the end of a splice the marker noted 6 is located directly over the end of the splice while 1 2 3 4 5 are located at different distances away the overall gauge length between the two end splices is 388 mm in order to observe the influence of the splices on the measured strain different stress strain curves are plotted fig 6 shows the influence of the marker position on the measured strain when measurements are made directly from the end of the splice a stiffening effect is noted curve 1 6 whereas measurements away from the splice end the other 4 curves in fig 6 provide very similar stress strain plots within experimental scatter thus the strain field is certainly affected by the splices but provided markers are placed even a small distance away as was the case for the values shown in this paper the influence on measured strain is small these are results from only one test but they do indicate that strain field is uniform over most of the gauge length 2 2 2 yarn the test machine used for yarns was an instron model 5566 with a 500n load cell fig 7 the experimental setup is similar to the one used for the rope each marker was followed by a camera to determine the local deformation special pneumatic clamps were used to grip the samples as shown in fig 7b yarns were extracted from the braided ropes the coating applied on the yarns makes separation of the strand into five yarns straightforward in the same way as for the ropes the mean breaking load of the yarns was measured on 10 samples to be 277n with a standard deviation of 10 1n the mean loading rate was 0 169 min linear density was measured to be 9 73 10 2 g m the gauge length of samples was 250 mm 2 2 3 filament the same instron 5566 test machine was used for filaments but with a 50n load cell this load cell was calibrated in 2018 its accuracy is of 0 0021n for a 1n load therefore for a mbl of 0 402 the relative uncertainty is of 0 5 the filaments were extracted from the yarns after extraction of the filament each end of the latter was adhesively bonded between two pieces of cardboard pneumatic clamps were used to grip the cardboard cf fig 8 in order to determine the linear density of the filament the section of a yarn was first observed by digital microscopy keyence to count the number of filaments the linear density of the filament was then determined as follows ρ f i l a m e n t ρ y a r n n u m b e r o f f i l a m e n t s i n a y a r n the difficulty of filament extraction and the very small filament diameter make fixing markers to the specimen difficult several preliminary tests were performed with local markers and these showed that there was no slip in the clamps for subsequent tests the clamp movement was therefore used to measure the filament strain in the same way as for the ropes the mean breaking load of the filaments was measured to be 0 402n 12 samples with a standard deviation of 0 059 the mean loading rate was 5 min linear density was 1 24 10 4 g m the gauge length of filament samples was around 95 mm 2 3 definitions and protocols 2 3 1 parameters fig 9 shows the parameters studied here 2 3 2 stress and strain as noted previously synthetic fiber ropes have complex structures the cauchy stress based on the sample cross section will be difficult to use in this study a specific stress σ costa and chimisso 2011 fer 1971 is preferred which is based on the linear density of the rope σ 1 ρ t t with ρ t density in kg m3 t cauchy stress tensor in pa in the 1d case rope case this specific stress leads to σ f ρ with ρ linear density in kg m f tensile force in n the s i specific stress unit is n m kg or j kg in 1d case an equivalent unit is preferred n tex 1 j g 10 3 n t e x 1 p a g m 3 where 1 t e x 1 g k m this specific stress will allow a comparison between the behaviors at each rope scale the nominal strain ε will be used for this study ε δ l l 0 l l 0 l 0 with l 0 initial length l current length for each scale the detailed experimental procedure will be described 2 3 3 bedding in protocols three bedding in protocols were studied 1 cycle load unload 10 cycles load unload and relaxation on fig 7 the loading path of each test sequence is plotted after each of these tests a 1 h recovery step was applied in order to remove the visco elastic behavior resulting from the previous load the effects of bedding in maximal load are investigated the different bedding in maximal loads were chosen as follows based on the industrial use of this type of rope 10 30 and 50 of the mbl mean breaking load hmpe rope most guidance notes for synthetic fiber ropes recommend a maximal bedding in load of 50 of the mbl of the rope however for large diameters or very long ropes such as mooring lines test machines may not be able to reach this level for this reason investigations into the effects of lower maximal loads for a bedding in protocol are important as shown in fig 10 the different paths between point o and point a describe the different types of bedding in chosen here the time between these two points is the same for each type of bedding in in order to avoid any bias from visco elastic effects also the relaxation time is the same as the time to perform 9 load unload cycles these bedding in protocols were applied to the different components of the hmpe rope the filament the yarn and the rope itself due to the difficulty in keeping the strand together after extracting it from the rope that scale was not tested after the 1 h recovery following the bedding in protocol a monotonic uniaxial loading up to failure was applied to the specimen to characterize its mechanical behavior the extracted data were the initial modulus e i the maximal tensile strength the post bedding in strain and the maximal strains without and after bedding in protocols fig 10 henceforth in this study the bedding in protocols will be called bi protocols and simplified by the following acronyms lu one load unload 10clu 10 cycles load unload r load relaxation and unload the optimum bedding in protocol has several criteria to satisfy be fast minimize bedding in loading level particularly for large ropes stabilize the mechanical response by eliminating the construction effect introduce no damage no reduction of the maximal stress 3 results 3 1 results without bi fig 11 shows the tensile test results without any bedding in each of the curves is the mean of 3 test samples the last point with the error bar shows the break point with the minimum and the maximum of the nominal strain and specific stress from the three tests 3 2 results with bi in fig 9 the influence of the bi load level on the rope behavior is shown mechanical responses of the rope during monotonous loading are plotted with and without a bi protocol the following figures present the mean data from the experimental bedding in procedures described previously these figures show the strong influence of bedding in on the subsequent mechanical behavior of the braided rope the bi load level also has an important role the stress strain curves after bi at 30 and 50 mbl load levels are very close and mostly linear the stress strain curves after bi at 10 mbl load level are between the without bi curve and the 30 50 mbl curves the behavior after 10 mbl bi is not linear this shows the gap between the samples with and without bi loading the results in fig 12 show that the subsequent tensile behavior of the rope after bi sequences 10clu lu and r is almost the same this means that the loading path is not important the main parameter is the maximal load in fig 12d 3 3 comparison in this section the effects of each of the different bedding in protocols will be compared for each scale rope yarn and filament fig 13 presents the corresponding results the use of a specific stress allows the different scales to be compared directly the post bedding in strain is the strain due to the bedding in loading cf post bi strain description at fig 6 table 2 shows these results for all bedding in and all scales in table 3 the linear densities and corresponding maximum specific stress are presented 4 discussion 4 1 behavior of the rope and its components 4 1 1 post bedding in strain the same relative classification of the post bedding in strain for each bi was expected it has been observed previously davies et al 2006 humeau 2017 liu et al 2014 that the rope s construction influences the bedding in behavior the fact that filament post bedding in strain is not zero shows that the material fiber history also influences the global behavior scanning electron microscopy sem observations were made on sk99 filaments fig 14 the coating is visible and is not continuous along the filament fibrils can also be observed these fibrils are a subscale of the filament microstructure different interpretations of the filament post bedding in strain can be made the first is to conclude that fibrils are being reoriented along the tension axis during the process after the reorientation of the fibrils a permanent post bedding in strain occurs the second possibility is that we assume that the fibrils are perfectly oriented along their neutral fiber the post bi strain is then due to perfect plasticity of the material the third and the most likely hypothesis is a combination of these two possibilities which several studies have assumed davies et al 2011 to verify this assumption similar experimental tests would need to be performed at the fibril scale but this would require very delicate measurements whatever the scale the post bi strain increases with increasing bi load level according to the third assumption this plastic strain ε p measured at the end of the recovery step is the sum of a geometrical plastic strain ε p g and a material plastic strain ε p m ε p ε p g ε p m the geometrical plastic strain ε p g is due to the reorganization of fiber sub scales for the case of rope yarn and filament and the material plastic strain ε p g is due to an irreversible molecular rearrangement for the rope case its fiber structure being more complex the post bi strain is increasing more than for the yarn and the filament the material behavior and the rope s structure are both important for stabilizing the behavior of hmpe fiber ropes 4 1 2 maximum strain the maximum strain is highest for the rope scale whatever the bi protocol the complex assembly of fibers increases the strain due to the rearrangement of the structure of fibers also the maximum strain is similar for the scale of filament and yarn this is because the filaments within the yarn are nearly perfectly aligned in the loading direction the bi protocol reduces the maximum strain significantly an interesting observation is that the maximum strain is higher for the filament the fibrils orientation in the filament may change during the filament extraction the fibril misalignment caused by the filament extraction will disappear by stretching in the load direction and thus increasing the modulus together with the maximal tensile strength and the maximal strain see fig 15 4 1 3 initial modulus and rope behavior the modulus values obtained here were lower than those given by the fiber producer from 110n tex for the filament to 136 8n tex for the yarn compared with 159n tex for dsm vlasblom 2018 there is a difference of 14 between the yarn experimental value and the manufacturer s modulus dsm indicates a yarn linear density in the range 80 88 tex the linear density measured for the yarn here is 97 tex that is 9 18 higher than the manufacturer s values this difference can be explained by the presence of the coating on the filaments for the present tests that increases the linear density if this difference is taken into account then the experimental initial modulus values obtained for the yarn are in the same range as those of the fibre supplier the initial modulus values for filament and yarn are at least twice as high as that of the rope this can be explained by the effect of the construction the fibers in the rope are stretched in the direction of the tension but they are not in uniaxial tension due to the braided construction the sub elements will be initially off axis before reorientation of the rope occurs during tension as shown in fig 16 fig 17 shows that the apparent diameter of the rope is decreasing significantly until 30 of the mbl and then stabilizes the angle α between the strands was determined cf fig 18 this shows the reorientation of the strands towards the rope axis the evolution of the apparent diameter and the angle α were obtained during monotonic tensile tests on rope samples with a digital camera which allowed the changes to the rope structure to be quantified on the recorded images using image analysis software the reduction of the apparent diameter changes in a very similar way to the angle between strands and the neutral fiber of the rope as shown in fig 19 also the plots become horizontal characterizing a locking angle this angle can be estimated from image analysis to be around 31 and corresponds to a reduction in the apparent diameter of 25 the relationship between the lay angle of twisted ropes and their mechanical response is well known but for braided constructions there is no simple expression vu et al 2015 there appears to be a correlation here fig 16 shows both the maximum strain drop after different bi load levels and the evolution of the angle between strands and neutral fiber for the same loading the similarity in the curves indicates that if the geometry is known then the mechanical behavior can be predicted this suggests that a simple observation of the structural change of the rope during loading can indicate the optimum bedding in loading level to reach in order to stabilize the mechanical properties of the rope this is an interesting observation and further investigation is needed to determine whether it is applicable for other types of rope material construction diameter in order to extend this conclusion see fig 20 as a first step the evolution of the angle α during a monotonous loading has been measured on two other ropes which are a dyneema sk78 16 strand braided rope with a diameter of 4 mm with a mbl of 11 2 kn the construction and coating are very similar to the main sk99 rope of this study a dyneema sk78 12 strand braided rope with a diameter of 22 mm and a mbl of 274 kn an exponential function was used to fit the experimental data as follows f x a e b x α l o c k with a and b constants α l o c k constant which represents the locking angle the optimization algorithm used for this fitting was a polynomial least squares routine then with this method the locking angle is 30 9 for the dyneema sk99 rope with a 4 mm diameter 25 6 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 4 mm diameter and 28 6 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 22 mm diameter we assume that the optimum bedding in loading level is reached when the realignment of the strands towards the rope axis stops the criterion to reach this optimum level was chosen to be d α d f f o p t 0 05 d α d f f 0 where α is the strand strand angle and f is the tension load applied on the rope thus the optimum bedding in loading level is 32 0 of the mbl for the dyneema sk99 rope with a 4 mm diameter 27 4 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 4 mm diameter and 22 0 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 22 mm diameter as shown previously the influence of the bedding in loading path is small one load unload cycle at the optimum loading level is sufficient to stabilize the mechanical properties of the rope 4 1 4 maximal tensile strength according to the experimental data the maximal tensile strength from the highest to the lowest can be ranked as follows 1 filament 2 yarn and 3 rope this ranking is not surprising previous studies have already observed stress concentrations in rope construction resulting in lower strength than their constituent yarns del vecchio 1992 lechat 2007 the filament path in a rope is more complex than in a yarn and results in stress concentrations between fibers this phenomenon is sometimes called the bundle effect and can explain why rope construction has a lower tensile strength than a yarn and a filament the bi procedures studied here do not weaken the rope even with a 50 mbl bedding in load level previous studies have concluded that if the maximal bedding in load does not exceed 60 of the mbl fibers are not damaged francois and davies 2000 in addition an increase of 10 of the maximal tensile strength can be observed on the rope scale after bi as demonstrated previously the fibers tend to re align in the tensile direction the bedding in protocol helps to organize the fibers along the neutral fiber of the rope and the bundle effect is reduced the maximal tensile strength is slightly higher for the filament than for the yarn this observation is in agreement with the bundle effect 4 2 influence of the load unload sequence bi protocol table 4 compares the evolution of post bi strain maximal strain and maximal stress depending on the bi load level and the rope scale in the case of the load unload sequence bi protocol the post bi strain increases with the bi load level and with higher scale as already observed previously the evolution of the maximal tensile stress seems stable within a range of 10 for the filament and yarn scale the experimental noise is higher for the yarn and the filament than for the rope as shown by fig 13d therefore the results for yarn and for filament can be considered stable the experimental noise for the maximal tensile stress i the rope is a lot lower and shows a 10 increase of the maximal tensile stress for the rope after bi the reorganization of fibers during the bi of a rope decreases the bundle effect and increases the maximal tensile stress the maximum strain also seems to reach a maximum after a preload of 30 of the mbl as observed earlier the locking angle between the strands is achieved with a 30 preload this can explain the stabilization of the maximal strain for a preload level higher than 30 of the mbl similar observations can be made for the 10 cycles load unload and relaxation bi protocol fig 21 shows how the rope stiffness changes for the different bi protocols the change in the tangent modulus with nominal strain is nonlinear without the bi protocol with a 10 mbl bi protocol the initial modulus is higher but still unstable with 30 and 50 mbl bi protocols the modulus is more stable than for lower bi load and the initial modulus is still around 30n tex for both also the initial modulus is higher for the 30 and 50 preload levels than for 10 the modulus after a bi protocol seems to reach an optimum level this optimum modulus is especially notable for the relaxation bi case with a value around 60n tex but the tangent modulus does not reach an optimum level for the case of rope without bi 5 conclusion this paper describes the influence of bedding in loading on the mechanical performance of braided hmpe fiber rope developed for nautical applications the results show that in order to improve rope properties significantly a preloading sequence should be applied with loads at least to 30 of the break load the loading path is of secondary importance the improved rope behavior is the result of contributions both at the fiber level polymer molecule reorganization and alignment and from the rope construction alignment and compaction the observation of the apparent diameter of a rope and the change in the strand orientation during a monotonic loading allow an optimum bedding in load level to be determined rapidly this was applied successfully to a larger braid but it would be very interesting to extend this study to bigger ropes and different rope constructions these results are important because a rope which has not been fully bedded in may de tension in service this may have significant consequences on marine structures for example a sailing boat mast may be less securely held or a floating offshore platform may require mooring line re tensioning to limit the platform offset for the latter permanent removal of bedding in strain can also significantly reduce the amount of steel chain required during take up on winches author contributions section cédric bain testing

21931,synthetic fiber ropes are widely used in the maritime industry with applications from sailboat rigging to offshore platform mooring lines thanks to their numerous qualities compared to steel cables light weight good specific mechanical properties and excellent marine resistance a key feature of these ropes is their sensitivity to loading history as this affects subsequent performance in the present work the influence of the maximum bedding in load level and the loading path were studied at the different rope component scales filament yarn and braided rope in order to develop an optimal bedding in procedure for braided ropes the load levels were 10 30 and 50 of the tensile break load of the sample from the results obtained the influence of braid construction and material have been studied and an efficient bedding in process has been defined it was shown that the main parameter is the maximum load level the loading path is not important the load required to bed in hmpe ropes is closely related to changes in the braid angle under load keywords hmpe rope bedding in stretched fiber braided 1 introduction fiber ropes have been used for thousands of years thanks to their excellent tensile strength environmental resistance and light weight synthetic materials such as polyester polyamide aramid and polyethylene are newcomers in the history of fiber ropes and have extended the range of possible applications they offer the potential to replace many steel wire ropes and chains especially for mooring lines however synthetic fiber rope behavior is more complex than that of steel wire ropes this is due to both the complex behavior of polymer fibers and the hierarchical structure of rope components leech 2003 the most common rope construction used in mooring lines is based on twisted strands and these have been widely studied del vecchio 1992 ghoreishi 2005 raoof and hobbs 1988 braided ropes are the other main type of rope construction and have also been studied in the past decades davies et al 2002 vu et al 2015 a bedding in protocol a sequence of tensile loading to settle the fibers and their geometry is essential for synthetic fiber ropes it allows stabilizing the mechanical properties of ropes by applying a known loading history to the rope before use to understand the consequences of the bedding in protocol on the rope deformation mechanisms some researchers have focused on the influence of rope construction on the mechanical behavior hoppe 1991 leech and hearle 1993 raoof and hobbs 1988 and others on the role of loading history casey et al 2000 davies et al 2002 del vecchio 1992 these two points concerning the construction and the history effect need further investigation many investigations have focused on the understanding of the geometry of the rope the interactions between each scale and the behavior of smaller scales in order to be able to model numerically or empirically the mechanical behavior of synthetic fiber ropes for example ghoreishi et al 2007 developed a nonlinear elastic continuum model based on various earlier models for steel and synthetic stranded ropes such as those of hoppe 1991 leech and hearle 1993 raoof and hobbs 1988 these models are based on the geometries and the properties of each scale and friction is also considered in some of them davies et al 2006 applied leech s model and found a good correlation of tension torsion properties for results on full size long rope samples braided ropes have received less attention than stranded ropes but some researchers have investigated behavior models in particular rawal et al 2015 vu et al 2015 the development of finite element simulations and other analytical models are helpful to understand the complex behavior of fiber ropes and the mechanisms of the bedding in process these must account for internal friction between fibers and the reorganization of fibers under the load the bedding in process and loading history effects have been studied in some detail during the development of the use of polyester ropes for floating platform mooring lines in the offshore industry it is generally agreed that a bedding in process will change the mechanical properties of ropes significantly for banfield and casey 1998 the bedding process has to be recorded to interpret rope properties correctly work by casey et al 2000 davies et al 2002 del vecchio 1992 hooker and bosman 1999 liu et al 2014 weller et al 2014 has led to the conclusion that the mean load and the strain amplitude are the two main parameters which influence the mechanical behavior of ropes under cyclic loads as casey et al 2000 concluded the dynamic stiffness after a full bedding in process remains constant however if the permanent strain due to molecular rearrangement in the fibers and geometric construction changes is not removed by the bedding in sequence it will result in lower stiffness values by understanding the effects of the bedding in simplified behavior models for ropes can be proposed davies et al 2002 developed an empirical expression for evaluating the dynamic stiffness of hmpe ropes liu et al 2014 further developed these expressions in order to obtain the dynamic stiffness from small size ropes and extrapolate to larger ones and also to take into account the mean load strain amplitude and number of loading cycles lian et al 2018a concluded that different bedding in levels can cause different values of strain initial creep and dynamic stiffness for the same test samples for this reason the investigation of the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes is essential for most applications even if there is agreement on the need for a bedding in procedure to stabilize rope behavior before measuring stiffness values there are different recommendations american bureau of shipping abs 2011 bureau veritas 2007 international standards organization iso 2004 bedding in protocols are not the same according to each guideline but they have the same purpose which is to stabilize the rope length and to improve rope and termination efficiencies del vecchio 1992 used a bedding in loading sequence of 1000 cycles between 10 and 30 of the minimum breaking load mbl casey and banfield 2005 concluded that at least 10 000 cycles are required to get nearer to a fully bedded in state but they recommend that at least 500 cycles be applied lechat 2007 followed a recommendation of the oil companies international marine forum ocimf for bedding in before testing which includes five steps of 5 min at 50 of the mbl minimum break load each followed by a recovery step at 2 of the mbl humeau 2017 applied 5 cycles between 2 and 50 of the mbl these different examples show how numerous bedding in sequences are used and that there is not a unified procedure that is why lian et al 2018a presented a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes based on the tension strain curve for static tensile loading the permanent elongation francois and davies 2000 humeau 2017 of synthetic fiber ropes is the result of two types of elongation the rope construction component and the material contribution the permanent elongation related to the construction can be explained by compaction and the realignment of fibers in the loading direction chailleux and davies 2005 humeau 2017 and williams et al 2002 have included these contributions in elasto viscoelastic plastic models which they applied to polyester and aramid yarns williams et al 2002 have observed that for a basic response for each sub scale the response of the rope is not the same due to the construction influence most of the published work on bedding in has been focused on polyester polyamide and aramid fibers very few authors with the exception of costa and chimisso 2011 davies et al 2011 humeau et al 2018 lian et al 2019 2018b 2015 have considered hmpe to the authors knowledge no previous studies have presented results for ropes based on the dyneema sk99 hmpe grade this grade was specially developed for the nautical industry and shows high tensile stiffness and strength table 1 shows nominal properties of different grades of dyneema vlasblom 2018 there are also few published test results from tests at different scales of a rope construction and these are essential in order to establish the influence of load history on each one in the present study different input parameters have been varied such as maximum load during bedding in this has been done previously but here the loading history path was also varied in order to understand its contribution in summary bedding in is primordial for synthetic fiber ropes and a thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved is very important for many marine applications for example neither tensioning of sailboat rigging nor the installation of offshore mooring lines is possible without a good estimation of elongation during first loading the aim of the present study is to separate the construction and material contributions of the bedding in process to the mechanical behavior of hmpe braided ropes different bedding in sequences will be applied to investigate the influence of the loading history on the mechanical behavior first the material and experimental devices will be presented followed by the definition of the bedding in protocols the stress strain curves from static tensile tests for each scale of synthetic fibers ropes will then be presented based on the test results the discussion will provide conclusions about the optimal bedding in process and the influence of rope construction 2 materials and methods 2 1 material the synthetic fiber ropes tested in the present study were made of dyneema sk99 fibers the rope was braided with a 16 strand construction and a nominal diameter of 4 mm a coating was applied by the manufacturer the samples were provided by the lancelin corderie ernée france the results from these small diameter ropes can be used as a first approach towards understanding the behavior of bigger ropes such as the ones used in offshore platform mooring lines as many researchers have shown previously the geometrical structure of the rope is one of the major factors in determining the mechanical elongations that occur during bedding in process in order to quantify the importance of the construction the study investigated the bedding in behavior at different rope levels fig 1 the different scales are the braided rope the strand the yarn and the filament the rope is made of 16 strands each strand composed of 5 yarns and each yarn of approximately 800 filaments 2 2 samples and experimental equipment 2 2 1 rope the tensile testing machine used for ropes is an adamel lhomargy dy 36 with a 100 kn load cell the 100 kn load cell was calibrated in 2019 it has an accuracy of 5 8n 0 0421 for a 14 kn load the test specimens are ropes with eye splices at each end fig 2 several researchers leech 2003 leech and hearle 1993 milne and mclaren 2006 have studied the best way to terminate a braided rope and eye splices provide the maximal strength rope samples were loaded with steel pins with a diameter of 20 mm a local strain measurement system was used in order to avoid measuring the slip that will occur in the end termination during loading for the case of the rope a retiga 6000 camera and ni vision assistance software allowed the movement of two markers fixed to the rope to be followed each rope sample was weighed and its length measured before making the splices in order to determine its linear density the initial dimensions of the rope samples were 10 20 cm of useable length in the central section l g a u g e each splice length l s p l i c e measured 30 35 cm with an eye length around 3 5 cm giving a total length l t o t a l of 87 cm fig 3 break loads were also determined eight monotonic loading tests until failure were performed to obtain a mean breaking load the mean loading rate was 1 min the mean rope breaking load obtained was 14 7 kn with a standard deviation of 786n the linear density of the rope was measured and a value of 8 685 g m was obtained despite the fact that the strains are measured directly in the gauge region the vicinity of the splices may have an effect on the strain measured to investigate the influence of the distance from the splice on the strain measured additional tests have been performed on a dyneema sk99 rope with a diameter of 4 mm as shown in fig 4 fig 5 represents several markers which were located at different lengths from the end of a splice the marker noted 6 is located directly over the end of the splice while 1 2 3 4 5 are located at different distances away the overall gauge length between the two end splices is 388 mm in order to observe the influence of the splices on the measured strain different stress strain curves are plotted fig 6 shows the influence of the marker position on the measured strain when measurements are made directly from the end of the splice a stiffening effect is noted curve 1 6 whereas measurements away from the splice end the other 4 curves in fig 6 provide very similar stress strain plots within experimental scatter thus the strain field is certainly affected by the splices but provided markers are placed even a small distance away as was the case for the values shown in this paper the influence on measured strain is small these are results from only one test but they do indicate that strain field is uniform over most of the gauge length 2 2 2 yarn the test machine used for yarns was an instron model 5566 with a 500n load cell fig 7 the experimental setup is similar to the one used for the rope each marker was followed by a camera to determine the local deformation special pneumatic clamps were used to grip the samples as shown in fig 7b yarns were extracted from the braided ropes the coating applied on the yarns makes separation of the strand into five yarns straightforward in the same way as for the ropes the mean breaking load of the yarns was measured on 10 samples to be 277n with a standard deviation of 10 1n the mean loading rate was 0 169 min linear density was measured to be 9 73 10 2 g m the gauge length of samples was 250 mm 2 2 3 filament the same instron 5566 test machine was used for filaments but with a 50n load cell this load cell was calibrated in 2018 its accuracy is of 0 0021n for a 1n load therefore for a mbl of 0 402 the relative uncertainty is of 0 5 the filaments were extracted from the yarns after extraction of the filament each end of the latter was adhesively bonded between two pieces of cardboard pneumatic clamps were used to grip the cardboard cf fig 8 in order to determine the linear density of the filament the section of a yarn was first observed by digital microscopy keyence to count the number of filaments the linear density of the filament was then determined as follows ρ f i l a m e n t ρ y a r n n u m b e r o f f i l a m e n t s i n a y a r n the difficulty of filament extraction and the very small filament diameter make fixing markers to the specimen difficult several preliminary tests were performed with local markers and these showed that there was no slip in the clamps for subsequent tests the clamp movement was therefore used to measure the filament strain in the same way as for the ropes the mean breaking load of the filaments was measured to be 0 402n 12 samples with a standard deviation of 0 059 the mean loading rate was 5 min linear density was 1 24 10 4 g m the gauge length of filament samples was around 95 mm 2 3 definitions and protocols 2 3 1 parameters fig 9 shows the parameters studied here 2 3 2 stress and strain as noted previously synthetic fiber ropes have complex structures the cauchy stress based on the sample cross section will be difficult to use in this study a specific stress σ costa and chimisso 2011 fer 1971 is preferred which is based on the linear density of the rope σ 1 ρ t t with ρ t density in kg m3 t cauchy stress tensor in pa in the 1d case rope case this specific stress leads to σ f ρ with ρ linear density in kg m f tensile force in n the s i specific stress unit is n m kg or j kg in 1d case an equivalent unit is preferred n tex 1 j g 10 3 n t e x 1 p a g m 3 where 1 t e x 1 g k m this specific stress will allow a comparison between the behaviors at each rope scale the nominal strain ε will be used for this study ε δ l l 0 l l 0 l 0 with l 0 initial length l current length for each scale the detailed experimental procedure will be described 2 3 3 bedding in protocols three bedding in protocols were studied 1 cycle load unload 10 cycles load unload and relaxation on fig 7 the loading path of each test sequence is plotted after each of these tests a 1 h recovery step was applied in order to remove the visco elastic behavior resulting from the previous load the effects of bedding in maximal load are investigated the different bedding in maximal loads were chosen as follows based on the industrial use of this type of rope 10 30 and 50 of the mbl mean breaking load hmpe rope most guidance notes for synthetic fiber ropes recommend a maximal bedding in load of 50 of the mbl of the rope however for large diameters or very long ropes such as mooring lines test machines may not be able to reach this level for this reason investigations into the effects of lower maximal loads for a bedding in protocol are important as shown in fig 10 the different paths between point o and point a describe the different types of bedding in chosen here the time between these two points is the same for each type of bedding in in order to avoid any bias from visco elastic effects also the relaxation time is the same as the time to perform 9 load unload cycles these bedding in protocols were applied to the different components of the hmpe rope the filament the yarn and the rope itself due to the difficulty in keeping the strand together after extracting it from the rope that scale was not tested after the 1 h recovery following the bedding in protocol a monotonic uniaxial loading up to failure was applied to the specimen to characterize its mechanical behavior the extracted data were the initial modulus e i the maximal tensile strength the post bedding in strain and the maximal strains without and after bedding in protocols fig 10 henceforth in this study the bedding in protocols will be called bi protocols and simplified by the following acronyms lu one load unload 10clu 10 cycles load unload r load relaxation and unload the optimum bedding in protocol has several criteria to satisfy be fast minimize bedding in loading level particularly for large ropes stabilize the mechanical response by eliminating the construction effect introduce no damage no reduction of the maximal stress 3 results 3 1 results without bi fig 11 shows the tensile test results without any bedding in each of the curves is the mean of 3 test samples the last point with the error bar shows the break point with the minimum and the maximum of the nominal strain and specific stress from the three tests 3 2 results with bi in fig 9 the influence of the bi load level on the rope behavior is shown mechanical responses of the rope during monotonous loading are plotted with and without a bi protocol the following figures present the mean data from the experimental bedding in procedures described previously these figures show the strong influence of bedding in on the subsequent mechanical behavior of the braided rope the bi load level also has an important role the stress strain curves after bi at 30 and 50 mbl load levels are very close and mostly linear the stress strain curves after bi at 10 mbl load level are between the without bi curve and the 30 50 mbl curves the behavior after 10 mbl bi is not linear this shows the gap between the samples with and without bi loading the results in fig 12 show that the subsequent tensile behavior of the rope after bi sequences 10clu lu and r is almost the same this means that the loading path is not important the main parameter is the maximal load in fig 12d 3 3 comparison in this section the effects of each of the different bedding in protocols will be compared for each scale rope yarn and filament fig 13 presents the corresponding results the use of a specific stress allows the different scales to be compared directly the post bedding in strain is the strain due to the bedding in loading cf post bi strain description at fig 6 table 2 shows these results for all bedding in and all scales in table 3 the linear densities and corresponding maximum specific stress are presented 4 discussion 4 1 behavior of the rope and its components 4 1 1 post bedding in strain the same relative classification of the post bedding in strain for each bi was expected it has been observed previously davies et al 2006 humeau 2017 liu et al 2014 that the rope s construction influences the bedding in behavior the fact that filament post bedding in strain is not zero shows that the material fiber history also influences the global behavior scanning electron microscopy sem observations were made on sk99 filaments fig 14 the coating is visible and is not continuous along the filament fibrils can also be observed these fibrils are a subscale of the filament microstructure different interpretations of the filament post bedding in strain can be made the first is to conclude that fibrils are being reoriented along the tension axis during the process after the reorientation of the fibrils a permanent post bedding in strain occurs the second possibility is that we assume that the fibrils are perfectly oriented along their neutral fiber the post bi strain is then due to perfect plasticity of the material the third and the most likely hypothesis is a combination of these two possibilities which several studies have assumed davies et al 2011 to verify this assumption similar experimental tests would need to be performed at the fibril scale but this would require very delicate measurements whatever the scale the post bi strain increases with increasing bi load level according to the third assumption this plastic strain ε p measured at the end of the recovery step is the sum of a geometrical plastic strain ε p g and a material plastic strain ε p m ε p ε p g ε p m the geometrical plastic strain ε p g is due to the reorganization of fiber sub scales for the case of rope yarn and filament and the material plastic strain ε p g is due to an irreversible molecular rearrangement for the rope case its fiber structure being more complex the post bi strain is increasing more than for the yarn and the filament the material behavior and the rope s structure are both important for stabilizing the behavior of hmpe fiber ropes 4 1 2 maximum strain the maximum strain is highest for the rope scale whatever the bi protocol the complex assembly of fibers increases the strain due to the rearrangement of the structure of fibers also the maximum strain is similar for the scale of filament and yarn this is because the filaments within the yarn are nearly perfectly aligned in the loading direction the bi protocol reduces the maximum strain significantly an interesting observation is that the maximum strain is higher for the filament the fibrils orientation in the filament may change during the filament extraction the fibril misalignment caused by the filament extraction will disappear by stretching in the load direction and thus increasing the modulus together with the maximal tensile strength and the maximal strain see fig 15 4 1 3 initial modulus and rope behavior the modulus values obtained here were lower than those given by the fiber producer from 110n tex for the filament to 136 8n tex for the yarn compared with 159n tex for dsm vlasblom 2018 there is a difference of 14 between the yarn experimental value and the manufacturer s modulus dsm indicates a yarn linear density in the range 80 88 tex the linear density measured for the yarn here is 97 tex that is 9 18 higher than the manufacturer s values this difference can be explained by the presence of the coating on the filaments for the present tests that increases the linear density if this difference is taken into account then the experimental initial modulus values obtained for the yarn are in the same range as those of the fibre supplier the initial modulus values for filament and yarn are at least twice as high as that of the rope this can be explained by the effect of the construction the fibers in the rope are stretched in the direction of the tension but they are not in uniaxial tension due to the braided construction the sub elements will be initially off axis before reorientation of the rope occurs during tension as shown in fig 16 fig 17 shows that the apparent diameter of the rope is decreasing significantly until 30 of the mbl and then stabilizes the angle α between the strands was determined cf fig 18 this shows the reorientation of the strands towards the rope axis the evolution of the apparent diameter and the angle α were obtained during monotonic tensile tests on rope samples with a digital camera which allowed the changes to the rope structure to be quantified on the recorded images using image analysis software the reduction of the apparent diameter changes in a very similar way to the angle between strands and the neutral fiber of the rope as shown in fig 19 also the plots become horizontal characterizing a locking angle this angle can be estimated from image analysis to be around 31 and corresponds to a reduction in the apparent diameter of 25 the relationship between the lay angle of twisted ropes and their mechanical response is well known but for braided constructions there is no simple expression vu et al 2015 there appears to be a correlation here fig 16 shows both the maximum strain drop after different bi load levels and the evolution of the angle between strands and neutral fiber for the same loading the similarity in the curves indicates that if the geometry is known then the mechanical behavior can be predicted this suggests that a simple observation of the structural change of the rope during loading can indicate the optimum bedding in loading level to reach in order to stabilize the mechanical properties of the rope this is an interesting observation and further investigation is needed to determine whether it is applicable for other types of rope material construction diameter in order to extend this conclusion see fig 20 as a first step the evolution of the angle α during a monotonous loading has been measured on two other ropes which are a dyneema sk78 16 strand braided rope with a diameter of 4 mm with a mbl of 11 2 kn the construction and coating are very similar to the main sk99 rope of this study a dyneema sk78 12 strand braided rope with a diameter of 22 mm and a mbl of 274 kn an exponential function was used to fit the experimental data as follows f x a e b x α l o c k with a and b constants α l o c k constant which represents the locking angle the optimization algorithm used for this fitting was a polynomial least squares routine then with this method the locking angle is 30 9 for the dyneema sk99 rope with a 4 mm diameter 25 6 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 4 mm diameter and 28 6 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 22 mm diameter we assume that the optimum bedding in loading level is reached when the realignment of the strands towards the rope axis stops the criterion to reach this optimum level was chosen to be d α d f f o p t 0 05 d α d f f 0 where α is the strand strand angle and f is the tension load applied on the rope thus the optimum bedding in loading level is 32 0 of the mbl for the dyneema sk99 rope with a 4 mm diameter 27 4 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 4 mm diameter and 22 0 for the dyneema sk78 rope with a 22 mm diameter as shown previously the influence of the bedding in loading path is small one load unload cycle at the optimum loading level is sufficient to stabilize the mechanical properties of the rope 4 1 4 maximal tensile strength according to the experimental data the maximal tensile strength from the highest to the lowest can be ranked as follows 1 filament 2 yarn and 3 rope this ranking is not surprising previous studies have already observed stress concentrations in rope construction resulting in lower strength than their constituent yarns del vecchio 1992 lechat 2007 the filament path in a rope is more complex than in a yarn and results in stress concentrations between fibers this phenomenon is sometimes called the bundle effect and can explain why rope construction has a lower tensile strength than a yarn and a filament the bi procedures studied here do not weaken the rope even with a 50 mbl bedding in load level previous studies have concluded that if the maximal bedding in load does not exceed 60 of the mbl fibers are not damaged francois and davies 2000 in addition an increase of 10 of the maximal tensile strength can be observed on the rope scale after bi as demonstrated previously the fibers tend to re align in the tensile direction the bedding in protocol helps to organize the fibers along the neutral fiber of the rope and the bundle effect is reduced the maximal tensile strength is slightly higher for the filament than for the yarn this observation is in agreement with the bundle effect 4 2 influence of the load unload sequence bi protocol table 4 compares the evolution of post bi strain maximal strain and maximal stress depending on the bi load level and the rope scale in the case of the load unload sequence bi protocol the post bi strain increases with the bi load level and with higher scale as already observed previously the evolution of the maximal tensile stress seems stable within a range of 10 for the filament and yarn scale the experimental noise is higher for the yarn and the filament than for the rope as shown by fig 13d therefore the results for yarn and for filament can be considered stable the experimental noise for the maximal tensile stress i the rope is a lot lower and shows a 10 increase of the maximal tensile stress for the rope after bi the reorganization of fibers during the bi of a rope decreases the bundle effect and increases the maximal tensile stress the maximum strain also seems to reach a maximum after a preload of 30 of the mbl as observed earlier the locking angle between the strands is achieved with a 30 preload this can explain the stabilization of the maximal strain for a preload level higher than 30 of the mbl similar observations can be made for the 10 cycles load unload and relaxation bi protocol fig 21 shows how the rope stiffness changes for the different bi protocols the change in the tangent modulus with nominal strain is nonlinear without the bi protocol with a 10 mbl bi protocol the initial modulus is higher but still unstable with 30 and 50 mbl bi protocols the modulus is more stable than for lower bi load and the initial modulus is still around 30n tex for both also the initial modulus is higher for the 30 and 50 preload levels than for 10 the modulus after a bi protocol seems to reach an optimum level this optimum modulus is especially notable for the relaxation bi case with a value around 60n tex but the tangent modulus does not reach an optimum level for the case of rope without bi 5 conclusion this paper describes the influence of bedding in loading on the mechanical performance of braided hmpe fiber rope developed for nautical applications the results show that in order to improve rope properties significantly a preloading sequence should be applied with loads at least to 30 of the break load the loading path is of secondary importance the improved rope behavior is the result of contributions both at the fiber level polymer molecule reorganization and alignment and from the rope construction alignment and compaction the observation of the apparent diameter of a rope and the change in the strand orientation during a monotonic loading allow an optimum bedding in load level to be determined rapidly this was applied successfully to a larger braid but it would be very interesting to extend this study to bigger ropes and different rope constructions these results are important because a rope which has not been fully bedded in may de tension in service this may have significant consequences on marine structures for example a sailing boat mast may be less securely held or a floating offshore platform may require mooring line re tensioning to limit the platform offset for the latter permanent removal of bedding in strain can also significantly reduce the amount of steel chain required during take up on winches author contributions section cédric bain testing

21932,in this paper we investigated issues of arctic supply vessel design and fleet composition analysis of factors of various nature that influence the performance of the arctic supply system as well as exploration the possible ways to improve its efficiency are presented for addressing this we developed a research approach that joins the holistic parametric design model of arctic supply vessel and the fleet planning algorithm the last one solves the fleet sizing problem and simulates the dynamics of vessel operation ice state and logistics features of platform operation we presented the results of system performance analysis for the case of supply fleet operation in the kara sea factors under investigation were ice class deadweight ship type the structure of cargo flow and distribution of useful hull capacity by cargo type the article provides the recommendations on the formation of the offshore supply system based on the studied case this confirms the usefulness of the proposed approach for handling the considered problem keywords supply vessel arctic fleet ship design fleet planning optimization parametric 1 introduction offshore industry has to deal with the issues of arctic deposits development in harsh ice conditions at the same time the actual experience is generally limited to the operation in relatively mild ice conditions of barents okhotsk and caspian seas arctic vessels should have enough icebreaking capability safety and efficiency to address the issues of ice navigation arctic supply fleet has to deal not only with the ice and its substantial temporal dynamics but also with the other aspects of maritime transportation in the far north such as complicated logistics and lack of infrastructure for these reasons the development of the theory and tools for arctic supply vessel design and operation modeling is still relevant offshore supply fleet is an expensive and comprehensive artificial system with a high level of complexity the high price of supply system deployment and maintenance is mainly associated with the fleet acquisition or freight as well as the operational costs there are many circumstances affecting its performance of both internal and external nature gaspar et al 2012a 2012b among them are subsystems configuration weather conditions the role and behavior of a ship in the global transport system logistic economic ecological administrative and ergonomic aspects brett et al 2006 bergström et al 2016 sevaldson et al 2012 the transportation system should not be designed as separate parts but in an integral sustainable and multidisciplinary manner montreuil 2011 therefore a promising way to improve the quality of the preliminary ship and maritime transport system mts design is merging tools from different disciplines such as naval architecture system theory logistics planning and optimization brett et al 2006 gkochari and papanikolaou 2010 tarovik et al 2017 engineering became genuinely interdisciplinary therefore simplifying is an inappropriate approach for complex design cases sevaldson 2009 intuitive decisions at the conceptual stage of supply vessel design andrews 2013 and fleet sizing which are not supported by sufficient justification could result in substantial financial losses the positive results of a number of studies with the involvement of industrial partners brett et al 2006 tarovik et al 2017 2018 are the additional acknowledgement for these statements risk management in arctic shipping is closely related to the problem studied therefore some recent studies in this area could be mentioned in afenyo et al 2017 a simplified methodology for prediction of an arctic shipping accident and addressing possible consequences is presented this is based on the bayesian network model an article khan et al 2018 proposes an object oriented bayesian network model to dynamically predict ship ice collision probability based on navigational and operational system states weather and ice conditions as well as the human factor a risk model rahman et al 2019 is devoted to assessing the risk associated with marine logistics operations in remote offshore locations the methodology of the conceptual ship design had been evolving out of the approaches based on the design spiral evans 1959 pawling et al 2017 common sense and experience up to the modern comprehensive and holistic methods the last ones were developed with the special attention to subsystems performance priftis et al 2018 erikstad and levander 2012 vessel behavior and interaction with other entities in the frame of marine gaspar et al 2012a 2012b mauro et al 2019 or multimodal gkochari and papanikolaou 2010 transport system as shown in andrews and erikstad 2015 the use of traditional parent hull based design methods as well as the application of modern cfd fea and 3d modeling tools without sufficient design space investigation often leads to a single point design focus an important step for the statement of the ship design problem is determination of the evaluation criterion for a desirable design solution a tendency of moving from the prescriptive rule based design to the goal based design gbd is evident tsakalakis 2009 and supported by international maritime organization imo 2015 application of the prescriptive rules narrows the design space and restricts the ability to find innovative solutions vassalos 2009 substantial opportunities in concept ship design arise when considering not only the main function of a vessel but also the other characteristics associated with certain features martin 2013 thus gbd and design for x andrews and erikstad 2015 principles suggest consideration of performance oriented requirements to meet both safety and functionality the risk based design concept is an extension of gbd vassalos 2009 kujala 2019 by the introduction of probabilistic entities into the design process we decided to keep closer to the goal based paradigm with special attention to the technical economical and logistics features one of the challenges that face the logistic analysis of supply system is the necessity of a vessel to transport various types of cargoes simultaneously it poses the task of optimal distribution of vessel capacity by cargo types this should be considered when designing a ship optimizing fleet configuration as well as during simulations of transport logistics therefore the cargo flow structure is an important factor tightly connected with the process of supply vessel design cargo flow patterns may significantly vary depending on the particular offshore project for example table 1 shows two alternative scenarios for drill mud production and transportation the conventional supply system supports a cluster of platforms up to 10 15 units located not far off the shore and close to each other drilling and production conditions in such a case are almost similar since supply vessels cover short distances the round trip takes several days therefore the drill mud can be produced in a centralized manner onshore and then shipped by supply vessels in special purpose underdeck tanks such a logistic scheme became popular for two main reasons firstly onshore production is cheaper than offshore one secondly short distance and persistent voyage duration in open water make it possible to keep appropriate quality of drill mud until its delivery without special technical measures however the picture is quite different for most of the remote russian arctic fields where the conventional scheme becomes not suitable long distances between various offshore installations and supply base different geological conditions in each drilling point and uncertainty in ship voyage duration make the mud production on a platform a more feasible solution in such case dry mud components are packed into containers at the supply base and then delivered to the platform by sea this results in substantial growth of the number of deck cargoes and negatively impacts the utilization of cargo spaces and the overall supply fleet efficiency thus the objective of this study is the development of the complex approach and research software tool for arctic supply vessel optimization this is incorporating arctic related parameters in the offshore support vessel design fleet planning and composition the approach considers not only ice conditions and corresponding requirements for the vessel but also the cargo flow structure and the dynamics of supply consumption at the platform to do this we made a research software tool that includes the holistic goal based parametric calculation model of supply vessel and the fleet planning algorithm with a deterministic simulation model of mts operation a high level of fidelity of both elements permits to analyze the ship design planning and fleet operation aspects together we presented the results of the feasibility analysis for the case of the kara sea considering various ice class and icebreaking capability of the vessel ship type deadweight and cargo capacity distribution by cargo type 2 general description of the approach to design and analysis of supply systems fig 1 presents the general steps of the calculation process the main goal of the study is the feasibility analysis of various fleet configurations and the selection of the most appropriate one this study infers the optimization of fleet configuration based on predefined vessel variants using a brute force search algorithm a formal description of the objective function could be given as follows min p t o t v for v v where v is a set of available ship types p t o t v a value of the total cost criterion see section 4 for a fleet configuration based on a vessel of type v step 1 together the lists of parameters section 3 for all vessels under consideration and data for the fleet sizing algorithm section 4 represent a formulation of the task for design of a supply system section 5 step 2 in section 3 we presented the parametric model of arctic supply vessel developed in accordance with the main idea of the holistic ship design concept priftis et al 2018 this allows considering a vessel as a complex system with various relevant features the purpose of the parametric model is to calculate vessel parameters which influence fleet efficiency cargo capacities deck area fuel consumption payload etc the most the model is intended to generate a detailed object oriented information description of a vessel this incorporates the ice related features to supply vessel design the model performs calculation for each vessel variant under consideration we verified the algorithms by comparing the modeling results with the characteristics of built vessels step 3 the supply fleet planning algorithm described in section 4 creates the voyage plan and evaluates the required number of vessels as well as the total amount of fuel consumption for each considered fleet configuration this algorithm simulates ice conditions on the route and is not limited to the regular weekly schedules finally at the feasibility study stage see section 4 the algorithm calculates the parameters of economic efficiency for each variant of fleet configuration and finds the most appropriate solution step 4 of the algorithm in fig 1 the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 3 and 4 are devoted to the description of the technical realization of the proposed approach a case study of supply fleet analysis is given in section 5 where a group of platforms in the kara sea is considered and several practical conclusions are obtained final remarks are given in the conclusion section 3 the parametric design model of supply vessels in order to develop the parametric model we collected a large amount of data and formed a database for further analysis this contains more than 100 parameters for 115 original without sisterships platform supply vessels psv and anchor handling tug supply ahts projects of vessels built in 1997 2017 the main data sources were the official web cites of shipping companies and ship equipment manufacturers as well as previous research outputs of krylov state research centre if the use of other sources is applicable this is mentioned separately table 2 includes the list of input parameters of the design model and the corresponding ranges of possible values the parametric model allows determining the characteristics of psv and ahts the minimum and maximum values of the main dimensions l pp b d d match the corresponding ranges from the database the maximum design speed in open water v s corresponds to the froude number fn 0 35 ice classes c are provided in accordance with the russian maritime register of shipping rs each ice class corresponds to a certain range of icebreaking capability values fig 2 shows the general flow chart of the vessel parametric design algorithm the first two steps are the validation of input data and checking the freeboard for the compliance with the load line regulations at step 3 the algorithm generates the hull lines by means of the prototype drawings modification using the interpolation method fig 3 gives examples of the prototype lines drawings for vessels with various ice classes steps 4 5 the algorithm checks whether the obtained hull angles of vessels with ice class arc4 or higher comply with rs recommendations for ice going vessels non compliant vessels are withdrawn from consideration step 6 is the calculation of hydrostatic curves transverse section waterplane and wetted surface areas areas and volumes of the ship hull all of those calculations are based on the offset tables and conducted by means of numerical integration step 7 all existing supply vessels have two propellers therefore we set this assumption as a default in the model however the algorithm could also add a third propeller to ensure the high icebreaking capability of arctic vessels the use of statistics allows to make the formulation of the simple equations to estimate the propeller diameter d p m d p 0 48 d for psv with ice class arc4 or lower d p 0 55 d 0 33 for all ahts vessels and for psvs with ice class arc5 or higher for psv and ahts with ice class arc5 and higher we considered the propulsion with azimuth thrusters and electric power transmission in such a case we assume that the type of propeller depends on ice class and set a controllable pitch cp for vessels with ice class arc4 or lower and a fixed pitch fp for others for ahts with ice class arc4 or lower we provided a propulsion system with mechanical shaft transmission and cp propellers in kort nozzles every modern supply vessel has tunnel thrusters to ensure high manoeuvrability and compliance with dynamic positioning requirements in accordance with the actual design practice dp 2 class is enough statistics shows that vessels with azimuth thrusters need to have two bow tunnel thrusters to reach dp 2 class while vessels with mechanical shaft transmission should have four tunnel thrusters bow and stern to ensure the appropriate level of redundancy we used the equation 1 which is based on wärtsilä s

resistance in open water in a case of vessels with ice class arc4 and lower we used the method developed in holtrop and mennen 1982 it shows a good agreement with model tests data for offshore support vessels even though holtrop and mennen method suits for non arctic vessels well it underestimates the resistance of ice going ships approximately by 15 25 as our analysis has shown more precise results could be obtained when using dubrovin s method kashtelyan et al 1972 originally developed for icebreakers this method is based on the recalculation of residual resistance of the prototype ship

lower ice class vessels special series of ice class propellers for other ships the main characteristics of propellers for the last series were approximated in this study wake fraction coefficient w t

values for the worst loading case as the last one we consider the case of deployment of the maximum possible amount of cargo on a deck the algorithm reaches the minimum acceptable level of stability using step by step addition of a small volume of ballast water into various ballast tanks the criterion of such level is near zero trim and metacentric height g m 0 11 b for this purpose the model runs a special iterative algorithm we subdivided the ballast tanks into three main groups forward central and aft with capacities of 33 15 and 52 of the total ballast volume correspondingly finally the roll period evaluation is performed we verified the parametric model of the supply vessel by comparing parameters of the real existing modern vessels with the calculated ones for this purpose we selected 10 offshore vessels in a broad range of main dimensions ice classes and icebreaking capability values they are bourbon liberty 150 havila foresight normand skipper vos hermes maersk handler maersk dispatcher normand prosper aleut yury topchev and vitus bering the verification criteria are the useful deck area useful cargo volume and deadweight since they are the most important parameters of ship performance and efficiency in addition the calculated values of these parameters are the result of complex mutual influence between numerous subsystems of the vessel i e they are not calculated directly in the design model and can be used for verification purposes after analysing the verification results fig 5 we suggested that the model complies with the modern design practice for the entire range of vessels under consideration the best agreement is seen for the deadweight parameter where the mismatch is not more than 4 5 the average mismatch for the area s d and volume w c is about 5 5 4 the algorithm for supply fleet operation planning and feasibility evaluation the basic principle of the algorithm is step by step planning of supply fleet operations and choosing the most suitable vessel from the current fleet to perform every next operation tarovik et al 2018 this is focused on the problem of a single platform supply in accordance with the common practice in the russian arctic such a statement leads to the simplification of a model the algorithm uses the description of the cargo flow in order to simulate the consumption of supply cargoes and reproduce the dynamics of cargo spaces filling it considers the characteristics of each cargo and the dynamics of their amount over the modeling period deck cargo is described in terms of standard equivalent containers tarovik et al 2018 we considered four types of volume cargoes they are bulk cargo drill mud brine fuel and water we study only the upstream cargo flow and assume that the downstream cargo flow is less in quantity and can be provided by default other inputs are the platform capacities for each type of cargo distance from supply base to the platform and ice conditions on the vessel route the algorithm is organized in a way to maximize the time of depletion of storages on the platform fig 6 shows the general flow chart of the fleet planning algorithm the cycle simulates the dynamics of transport system operation and represents the values of system indicators at each step one loop of the cycle describes a round voyage of one vessel and includes several steps at first steps 1 2 the algorithm forms a planning task on the basis of initial data on cargo flows the special purpose schedule describes a planning task for every cargo and contains its required amount for each moment of model time this includes daily and monthly plans the daily plan expresses the actual daily needs of the platform while the monthly one serves to control the progress of the planning process at step 3 the algorithm defines the initial state of all system elements and starts the planning cycle steps 4 5 are the calculation of the time until platform storages depletion to the limit level for this the algorithm uses the date of the last cargo operation at the platform the actual quantity of each type of cargo and the daily plan the result of these steps is the information on the required cargo quantity of each type and the critical time date counted from the initial date of the experiment of its deficit at step 6 the algorithm sorts cargoes by the last mentioned values the earliest of the dates is a critical date t crit and the corresponding cargo is considered as a critical one at steps 7 8 the algorithm selects vessels able to transport the critical cargo and finds the best one using the efficiency criterion k 15 15 k q t m 2 o r m 3 p e r d a y where q is the volume or area of the vessel for transportation of the critical cargo t is the characteristic time the time t is defined for each vessel as the following 16 t t m i n t 0 d a y s where t 0 is a date of the end of the last platform operation of any vessel from the previous records of the voyage plan t m i n t r e l e a s

the platform the last two equations are based on the marine traffic data related to russian arctic supply vessels such an algorithm is divined to the prolongation of the period until the depletion of critical cargo storage the main assumption towards the moving duration and fuel consumption is operation at maximum possible speed both in open water and ice conditions a simplified description of ice conditions includes the equivalent ice thickness h ice m and the percentage of lanes p lane equations for evaluation of the average ship speed in ice v i are given in 17 17 v l i v l i m v m a x v l i

value 17 with a restriction t m i n t c r i t if this condition is not met for the entire list of ships the planning algorithm ends in the last case we make the statement about the inability of fleet configuration to address the task step 10 is the estimation of the platform needs and filling levels of storages for a moment corresponding to the end of the vessel cargo operations such foresight is essential to determine the number of cargoes that can be placed on the platform i e free volumes of storages for this the algorithm represents their consumption the daily plan determines the time of the consumption of supplies on the platform as well as future needs as soon as the described model predicted the state of the platform storages at step 11 the algorithm determines the load of vessel executor when departing from the supply port it could be described by the quantity of each cargo in current delivery for this we used an optimization iterative procedure aimed at maximum delaying the date of storage overflow depleting for all types of cargoes the principle of this algorithm suggests that current critical cargo is loaded until another cargo becomes critical we considered a set of constraints in this procedure such as priority of cargoes according to the needs of the platform capacity of vessel storages for each type of cargo vessel payload and available free spaces in platform storages the last volumes cannot be exceeded when planning to load the vessel then steps 12 16 the algorithm simulates the rest of the voyage and the planning cycle continues until the end of the planning task the result of the planning is a detailed list of ship operations such as moving cargo operations at a platform or in port the main purpose of the planning algorithm in the proposed approach is estimation of the required number of vessels n for each fleet configuration under consideration this could be performed by a calculation cycle where the integer number of vessels varies from 1 to n by adjustment of 1 at each step in such a case n the lowest value when the algorithm is performed up to the end of planning from step 16 we used the total cost criterion to evaluate the economic efficiency of a supply fleet configuration the criterion represents the sum of the fleet acquisition cost and the fuel cost for the entire considered period to estimate the fleet acquisition cost we used the market statistics for over 50 supply vessels sale transactions during the period from 1998 tо 2017 and built the corresponding regression equation 18 all prices are recalculated to

of offshore production platforms in the kara sea the supply fleet transports cargoes from an onshore base to the floating storage located in the open sea at a distance of 300 nm the total annual amount of cargo flow is 160 000 t we set the values of the storage cargo volumes and areas assuming the 10 day endurance based on this configuration we analyzed how various internal and external factors impact the entire system feasibility they are ice class cargo flow structure deadweight ship type psv ahts and capacity distribution by cargo type table 5 shows two considered variants of the cargo flow structure in the first case cf 1 the supply fleet carries drill mud and brine in the specialized tanks while in the second case cf 2 it transports separated components in offshore containers the second case infers the production of drill mud brine directly on the platform parameters of ice conditions for the considered case are presented in fig 7 we obtained this data by processing the monthly statistics of ice parameters in a chosen region raw data is taken from aari web site even though this data formally corresponds to the average severity of ice conditions the actual warming of the arctic climate leads to its shift closer to the heavy ice conditions table 6 shows the considered alternatives to supply fleet configurations with two variants of ice classes arc7 and arc8 and in a broad range of deadweight values the values of n dw s d and m c were calculated in advance using the parametric design model of a vessel described in section 3 the deadweight of arc7 vessels is varied on a larger scale because such ships are less restricted by the constraints on the main dimensions table 7 describes the considered variants of the vessel capacity distribution by cargo type they include the average statistical variant and two others that are optimized for cargo flow structures cf 1 and cf 2 optimized capacity distributions correspond to the share of each cargo in the total cargo flow the only exception is the fuel oil since the volume of fuel tanks is taken as 35 of w c based on arctic shipping practice fig 8 presents an example of calculations for the 10 year operation period the graph illustrates the discrete values of the required number of psv vessels and p tot of fleet configurations with the average distribution of useful capacity per cargo type the number of vessels in the fleet is at least two these values were estimated using the planning algorithm presented in section 4 for other graphs we presented only smoothing curves for the p tot values because it helps to better analyze the results fig 9 illustrates the outputs of a feasibility analysis for the variety of supply fleet configurations fig 9a f refer to the vessels with an average capacity distribution fig 9e and f refer to the vessels adapted to cf 1 and cf 2 cargo flows respectively fig 9а shows the calculation results for psv based supply systems with cf 1 cargo flow structure and 10 year operation period the arc7 vessels of 3200 4000 t deadweight have the lowest values of the p tot higher icebreaking capability and speed in the ice of arc8 vessels do not compensate for the negative impact of substantial capacity reduction and higher acquisition cost the situation is quite different in the case of cf 2 cargo flow structure with a larger share of containers see fig 9b the performance of arc7 vessels essentially decreases due to the inefficient utilization of large cargo capacities at the same time the value of p tot for arc8 vessels remains the same in a certain small range of deadweight 2500 3500 t they outperform arc7 vessels we also found this feature in other analyzed cases however arc7 vessels in the deadweight range of 4500 5000 t have the best economic efficiency according to our model it is important to note that the value of p tot for arc8 vessels has a low level of sensitivity to the changes in a cargo flow structure this is due to their high fuel consumption and low capacity of fuel tanks 24 of w c make the fuel a type of cargo that limits the fleet performance i e in this case fuel becomes a limiting type of cargo the situation when the amount and share of one cargo in the cargo flow structure determines the number of ship voyages as well as the overall supply system efficiency is quite typical in the case of open water operation containers play the role of a critical type of cargo together with other deck cargoes the promising opportunity to enlarge the supply system performance is balancing correspondence between the cargo flow structure and supply vessel characteristics our study confirms that the cargo flow structure substantially affects the supply fleet efficiency in other words if we traditionally consider only the deck cargoes in the last calculation example it will lead to inaccurate estimations in a large range of vessel deadweight fig 9c and d show a comparison of the supply fleet efficiency for four fleet groups psv and ahts of arc7 and arc8 ice classes and two cargo flow cases cf 1 fig 9c cf 2 fig 9d for a span of 20 years of operation in the case of arc7 vessels and cf 1 the choice of ahts instead of psv leads to the rise of expenses by about 5 for arc8 vessels of small deadweight under 3000 t ahts p tot values are much higher as compared to psv because of the lack of capacity provided by the first type of ships for cf 1 the psv of arc7 class with deadweight in the range of 3500 5000 t show the best economic efficiency according to our model in the case of cf 2 and arc7 vessels a large share of deck cargoes leads to a systematic decrease of the ahts performance since p tot difference versus psvs reaches 15 the performance of all arc8 vessels remains almost unchanged under variation of cargo flow structure see fig 9c for cf 2 case psv arc7 fleet has the best values of p tot in the deadweight range of 4000 5000 t fig 9e and f compare the psv arc7 and psv arc 8 fleet configurations with different capacity distributions by cargo type i e the average and adapted ones see table 7 we found out that the arc7 ice class is indifferent to the changes in capacity distribution this is due to their large useful capacity that is enough without any special measures in contrast the arc8 vessels with small deadweight below 3000 t typically show a lack of useful capacity therefore in this case changes in cargo space configurations reduce p tot by more than 10 for both cf 1 and cf 2 cases 6 conclusions in this study we showed how the developed approach and software let us analyze the impact of specific arctic related factors on offshore support vessels design and fleet composition performance these factors have various nature and combination of the holistic design model of support vessel and the fleet planning algorithm with the incorporation of arctic related parameters became a possible instrument to address the problem the strengths of the approach are an adaptation of the holistic ship design concept to arctic offshore support vessel and integration of the arctic logistics aspects and organizational features in the feasibility study application of such a method permits obtaining a more precise representation of the real transport system to study the mutual interaction of its elements the provided results of the vessel model verification suggested that it complies with the modern design practice as the case study we presented the analysis of the artic supply system in the kara sea the structure of cargo flow significantly influences the performance and reliability of the supply fleet researchers should keep this fact in mind at the stage of conceptual analysis of the supply system as well as during the design of the individual supply vessel project in the majority of practical cases the most promising way to increase the supply system efficiency is to minimize the share of deck cargoes in the cargo flow structure optimization of the capacity distribution by cargo types is the most effective in the case of supply vessels with a lack of internal hull volume between them are the vessels with high engine power such as ice going support vessels and modern ahtss for deep sea oil and gas offshore fields also we made a number of conclusions for the case of supplying the production platforms in the kara sea the fleet configurations based on psv vessels with arc 7 ice class deadweight range of 3000 4000 t and icebreaking capability close to 2 m showed the lowest values of the cost criterion the use of ahtss for the production platform supply instead of specialized psvs leads to decrease of efficiency by 5 15 because of less deck area useful capacity and payload there are also some possibilities for improvement in the approach a brute force algorithm could be replaced by a more sophisticated one such as a genetic or an ant colony algorithm it would help to extend the design space and perform formal optimization without predefined variants of vessels the parametric model of the vessel could be improved by introducing risk based elements into the ship design process another opportunity to increase the validity of the approach is rejecting an assumption of a ship moving at maximum possible speed the parts of the approach could be also applied separately the parametric model of supply vessel is a possible basis for the subsystems performance investigation and optimization while the planning algorithm is a prototype of a fleet scheduling tool credit authorship contribution statement

21932,in this paper we investigated issues of arctic supply vessel design and fleet composition analysis of factors of various nature that influence the performance of the arctic supply system as well as exploration the possible ways to improve its efficiency are presented for addressing this we developed a research approach that joins the holistic parametric design model of arctic supply vessel and the fleet planning algorithm the last one solves the fleet sizing problem and simulates the dynamics of vessel operation ice state and logistics features of platform operation we presented the results of system performance analysis for the case of supply fleet operation in the kara sea factors under investigation were ice class deadweight ship type the structure of cargo flow and distribution of useful hull capacity by cargo type the article provides the recommendations on the formation of the offshore supply system based on the studied case this confirms the usefulness of the proposed approach for handling the considered problem keywords supply vessel arctic fleet ship design fleet planning optimization parametric 1 introduction offshore industry has to deal with the issues of arctic deposits development in harsh ice conditions at the same time the actual experience is generally limited to the operation in relatively mild ice conditions of barents okhotsk and caspian seas arctic vessels should have enough icebreaking capability safety and efficiency to address the issues of ice navigation arctic supply fleet has to deal not only with the ice and its substantial temporal dynamics but also with the other aspects of maritime transportation in the far north such as complicated logistics and lack of infrastructure for these reasons the development of the theory and tools for arctic supply vessel design and operation modeling is still relevant offshore supply fleet is an expensive and comprehensive artificial system with a high level of complexity the high price of supply system deployment and maintenance is mainly associated with the fleet acquisition or freight as well as the operational costs there are many circumstances affecting its performance of both internal and external nature gaspar et al 2012a 2012b among them are subsystems configuration weather conditions the role and behavior of a ship in the global transport system logistic economic ecological administrative and ergonomic aspects brett et al 2006 bergström et al 2016 sevaldson et al 2012 the transportation system should not be designed as separate parts but in an integral sustainable and multidisciplinary manner montreuil 2011 therefore a promising way to improve the quality of the preliminary ship and maritime transport system mts design is merging tools from different disciplines such as naval architecture system theory logistics planning and optimization brett et al 2006 gkochari and papanikolaou 2010 tarovik et al 2017 engineering became genuinely interdisciplinary therefore simplifying is an inappropriate approach for complex design cases sevaldson 2009 intuitive decisions at the conceptual stage of supply vessel design andrews 2013 and fleet sizing which are not supported by sufficient justification could result in substantial financial losses the positive results of a number of studies with the involvement of industrial partners brett et al 2006 tarovik et al 2017 2018 are the additional acknowledgement for these statements risk management in arctic shipping is closely related to the problem studied therefore some recent studies in this area could be mentioned in afenyo et al 2017 a simplified methodology for prediction of an arctic shipping accident and addressing possible consequences is presented this is based on the bayesian network model an article khan et al 2018 proposes an object oriented bayesian network model to dynamically predict ship ice collision probability based on navigational and operational system states weather and ice conditions as well as the human factor a risk model rahman et al 2019 is devoted to assessing the risk associated with marine logistics operations in remote offshore locations the methodology of the conceptual ship design had been evolving out of the approaches based on the design spiral evans 1959 pawling et al 2017 common sense and experience up to the modern comprehensive and holistic methods the last ones were developed with the special attention to subsystems performance priftis et al 2018 erikstad and levander 2012 vessel behavior and interaction with other entities in the frame of marine gaspar et al 2012a 2012b mauro et al 2019 or multimodal gkochari and papanikolaou 2010 transport system as shown in andrews and erikstad 2015 the use of traditional parent hull based design methods as well as the application of modern cfd fea and 3d modeling tools without sufficient design space investigation often leads to a single point design focus an important step for the statement of the ship design problem is determination of the evaluation criterion for a desirable design solution a tendency of moving from the prescriptive rule based design to the goal based design gbd is evident tsakalakis 2009 and supported by international maritime organization imo 2015 application of the prescriptive rules narrows the design space and restricts the ability to find innovative solutions vassalos 2009 substantial opportunities in concept ship design arise when considering not only the main function of a vessel but also the other characteristics associated with certain features martin 2013 thus gbd and design for x andrews and erikstad 2015 principles suggest consideration of performance oriented requirements to meet both safety and functionality the risk based design concept is an extension of gbd vassalos 2009 kujala 2019 by the introduction of probabilistic entities into the design process we decided to keep closer to the goal based paradigm with special attention to the technical economical and logistics features one of the challenges that face the logistic analysis of supply system is the necessity of a vessel to transport various types of cargoes simultaneously it poses the task of optimal distribution of vessel capacity by cargo types this should be considered when designing a ship optimizing fleet configuration as well as during simulations of transport logistics therefore the cargo flow structure is an important factor tightly connected with the process of supply vessel design cargo flow patterns may significantly vary depending on the particular offshore project for example table 1 shows two alternative scenarios for drill mud production and transportation the conventional supply system supports a cluster of platforms up to 10 15 units located not far off the shore and close to each other drilling and production conditions in such a case are almost similar since supply vessels cover short distances the round trip takes several days therefore the drill mud can be produced in a centralized manner onshore and then shipped by supply vessels in special purpose underdeck tanks such a logistic scheme became popular for two main reasons firstly onshore production is cheaper than offshore one secondly short distance and persistent voyage duration in open water make it possible to keep appropriate quality of drill mud until its delivery without special technical measures however the picture is quite different for most of the remote russian arctic fields where the conventional scheme becomes not suitable long distances between various offshore installations and supply base different geological conditions in each drilling point and uncertainty in ship voyage duration make the mud production on a platform a more feasible solution in such case dry mud components are packed into containers at the supply base and then delivered to the platform by sea this results in substantial growth of the number of deck cargoes and negatively impacts the utilization of cargo spaces and the overall supply fleet efficiency thus the objective of this study is the development of the complex approach and research software tool for arctic supply vessel optimization this is incorporating arctic related parameters in the offshore support vessel design fleet planning and composition the approach considers not only ice conditions and corresponding requirements for the vessel but also the cargo flow structure and the dynamics of supply consumption at the platform to do this we made a research software tool that includes the holistic goal based parametric calculation model of supply vessel and the fleet planning algorithm with a deterministic simulation model of mts operation a high level of fidelity of both elements permits to analyze the ship design planning and fleet operation aspects together we presented the results of the feasibility analysis for the case of the kara sea considering various ice class and icebreaking capability of the vessel ship type deadweight and cargo capacity distribution by cargo type 2 general description of the approach to design and analysis of supply systems fig 1 presents the general steps of the calculation process the main goal of the study is the feasibility analysis of various fleet configurations and the selection of the most appropriate one this study infers the optimization of fleet configuration based on predefined vessel variants using a brute force search algorithm a formal description of the objective function could be given as follows min p t o t v for v v where v is a set of available ship types p t o t v a value of the total cost criterion see section 4 for a fleet configuration based on a vessel of type v step 1 together the lists of parameters section 3 for all vessels under consideration and data for the fleet sizing algorithm section 4 represent a formulation of the task for design of a supply system section 5 step 2 in section 3 we presented the parametric model of arctic supply vessel developed in accordance with the main idea of the holistic ship design concept priftis et al 2018 this allows considering a vessel as a complex system with various relevant features the purpose of the parametric model is to calculate vessel parameters which influence fleet efficiency cargo capacities deck area fuel consumption payload etc the most the model is intended to generate a detailed object oriented information description of a vessel this incorporates the ice related features to supply vessel design the model performs calculation for each vessel variant under consideration we verified the algorithms by comparing the modeling results with the characteristics of built vessels step 3 the supply fleet planning algorithm described in section 4 creates the voyage plan and evaluates the required number of vessels as well as the total amount of fuel consumption for each considered fleet configuration this algorithm simulates ice conditions on the route and is not limited to the regular weekly schedules finally at the feasibility study stage see section 4 the algorithm calculates the parameters of economic efficiency for each variant of fleet configuration and finds the most appropriate solution step 4 of the algorithm in fig 1 the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 3 and 4 are devoted to the description of the technical realization of the proposed approach a case study of supply fleet analysis is given in section 5 where a group of platforms in the kara sea is considered and several practical conclusions are obtained final remarks are given in the conclusion section 3 the parametric design model of supply vessels in order to develop the parametric model we collected a large amount of data and formed a database for further analysis this contains more than 100 parameters for 115 original without sisterships platform supply vessels psv and anchor handling tug supply ahts projects of vessels built in 1997 2017 the main data sources were the official web cites of shipping companies and ship equipment manufacturers as well as previous research outputs of krylov state research centre if the use of other sources is applicable this is mentioned separately table 2 includes the list of input parameters of the design model and the corresponding ranges of possible values the parametric model allows determining the characteristics of psv and ahts the minimum and maximum values of the main dimensions l pp b d d match the corresponding ranges from the database the maximum design speed in open water v s corresponds to the froude number fn 0 35 ice classes c are provided in accordance with the russian maritime register of shipping rs each ice class corresponds to a certain range of icebreaking capability values fig 2 shows the general flow chart of the vessel parametric design algorithm the first two steps are the validation of input data and checking the freeboard for the compliance with the load line regulations at step 3 the algorithm generates the hull lines by means of the prototype drawings modification using the interpolation method fig 3 gives examples of the prototype lines drawings for vessels with various ice classes steps 4 5 the algorithm checks whether the obtained hull angles of vessels with ice class arc4 or higher comply with rs recommendations for ice going vessels non compliant vessels are withdrawn from consideration step 6 is the calculation of hydrostatic curves transverse section waterplane and wetted surface areas areas and volumes of the ship hull all of those calculations are based on the offset tables and conducted by means of numerical integration step 7 all existing supply vessels have two propellers therefore we set this assumption as a default in the model however the algorithm could also add a third propeller to ensure the high icebreaking capability of arctic vessels the use of statistics allows to make the formulation of the simple equations to estimate the propeller diameter d p m d p 0 48 d for psv with ice class arc4 or lower d p 0 55 d 0 33 for all ahts vessels and for psvs with ice class arc5 or higher for psv and ahts with ice class arc5 and higher we considered the propulsion with azimuth thrusters and electric power transmission in such a case we assume that the type of propeller depends on ice class and set a controllable pitch cp for vessels with ice class arc4 or lower and a fixed pitch fp for others for ahts with ice class arc4 or lower we provided a propulsion system with mechanical shaft transmission and cp propellers in kort nozzles every modern supply vessel has tunnel thrusters to ensure high manoeuvrability and compliance with dynamic positioning requirements in accordance with the actual design practice dp 2 class is enough statistics shows that vessels with azimuth thrusters need to have two bow tunnel thrusters to reach dp 2 class while vessels with mechanical shaft transmission should have four tunnel thrusters bow and stern to ensure the appropriate level of redundancy we used the equation 1 which is based on wärtsilä s

resistance in open water in a case of vessels with ice class arc4 and lower we used the method developed in holtrop and mennen 1982 it shows a good agreement with model tests data for offshore support vessels even though holtrop and mennen method suits for non arctic vessels well it underestimates the resistance of ice going ships approximately by 15 25 as our analysis has shown more precise results could be obtained when using dubrovin s method kashtelyan et al 1972 originally developed for icebreakers this method is based on the recalculation of residual resistance of the prototype ship

values for the worst loading case as the last one we consider the case of deployment of the maximum possible amount of cargo on a deck the algorithm reaches the minimum acceptable level of stability using step by step addition of a small volume of ballast water into various ballast tanks the criterion of such level is near zero trim and metacentric height g m 0 11 b for this purpose the model runs a special iterative algorithm we subdivided the ballast tanks into three main groups forward central and aft with capacities of 33 15 and 52 of the total ballast volume correspondingly finally the roll period evaluation is performed we verified the parametric model of the supply vessel by comparing parameters of the real existing modern vessels with the calculated ones for this purpose we selected 10 offshore vessels in a broad range of main dimensions ice classes and icebreaking capability values they are bourbon liberty 150 havila foresight normand skipper vos hermes maersk handler maersk dispatcher normand prosper aleut yury topchev and vitus bering the verification criteria are the useful deck area useful cargo volume and deadweight since they are the most important parameters of ship performance and efficiency in addition the calculated values of these parameters are the result of complex mutual influence between numerous subsystems of the vessel i e they are not calculated directly in the design model and can be used for verification purposes after analysing the verification results fig 5 we suggested that the model complies with the modern design practice for the entire range of vessels under consideration the best agreement is seen for the deadweight parameter where the mismatch is not more than 4 5 the average mismatch for the area s d and volume w c is about 5 5 4 the algorithm for supply fleet operation planning and feasibility evaluation the basic principle of the algorithm is step by step planning of supply fleet operations and choosing the most suitable vessel from the current fleet to perform every next operation tarovik et al 2018 this is focused on the problem of a single platform supply in accordance with the common practice in the russian arctic such a statement leads to the simplification of a model the algorithm uses the description of the cargo flow in order to simulate the consumption of supply cargoes and reproduce the dynamics of cargo spaces filling it considers the characteristics of each cargo and the dynamics of their amount over the modeling period deck cargo is described in terms of standard equivalent containers tarovik et al 2018 we considered four types of volume cargoes they are bulk cargo drill mud brine fuel and water we study only the upstream cargo flow and assume that the downstream cargo flow is less in quantity and can be provided by default other inputs are the platform capacities for each type of cargo distance from supply base to the platform and ice conditions on the vessel route the algorithm is organized in a way to maximize the time of depletion of storages on the platform fig 6 shows the general flow chart of the fleet planning algorithm the cycle simulates the dynamics of transport system operation and represents the values of system indicators at each step one loop of the cycle describes a round voyage of one vessel and includes several steps at first steps 1 2 the algorithm forms a planning task on the basis of initial data on cargo flows the special purpose schedule describes a planning task for every cargo and contains its required amount for each moment of model time this includes daily and monthly plans the daily plan expresses the actual daily needs of the platform while the monthly one serves to control the progress of the planning process at step 3 the algorithm defines the initial state of all system elements and starts the planning cycle steps 4 5 are the calculation of the time until platform storages depletion to the limit level for this the algorithm uses the date of the last cargo operation at the platform the actual quantity of each type of cargo and the daily plan the result of these steps is the information on the required cargo quantity of each type and the critical time date counted from the initial date of the experiment of its deficit at step 6 the algorithm sorts cargoes by the last mentioned values the earliest of the dates is a critical date t crit and the corresponding cargo is considered as a critical one at steps 7 8 the algorithm selects vessels able to transport the critical cargo and finds the best one using the efficiency criterion k 15 15 k q t m 2 o r m 3 p e r d a y where q is the volume or area of the vessel for transportation of the critical cargo t is the characteristic time the time t is defined for each vessel as the following 16 t t m i n t 0 d a y s where t 0 is a date of the end of the last platform operation of any vessel from the previous records of the voyage plan t m i n t r e l e a s

the platform the last two equations are based on the marine traffic data related to russian arctic supply vessels such an algorithm is divined to the prolongation of the period until the depletion of critical cargo storage the main assumption towards the moving duration and fuel consumption is operation at maximum possible speed both in open water and ice conditions a simplified description of ice conditions includes the equivalent ice thickness h ice m and the percentage of lanes p lane equations for evaluation of the average ship speed in ice v i are given in 17 17 v l i v l i m v m a x v l i

value 17 with a restriction t m i n t c r i t if this condition is not met for the entire list of ships the planning algorithm ends in the last case we make the statement about the inability of fleet configuration to address the task step 10 is the estimation of the platform needs and filling levels of storages for a moment corresponding to the end of the vessel cargo operations such foresight is essential to determine the number of cargoes that can be placed on the platform i e free volumes of storages for this the algorithm represents their consumption the daily plan determines the time of the consumption of supplies on the platform as well as future needs as soon as the described model predicted the state of the platform storages at step 11 the algorithm determines the load of vessel executor when departing from the supply port it could be described by the quantity of each cargo in current delivery for this we used an optimization iterative procedure aimed at maximum delaying the date of storage overflow depleting for all types of cargoes the principle of this algorithm suggests that current critical cargo is loaded until another cargo becomes critical we considered a set of constraints in this procedure such as priority of cargoes according to the needs of the platform capacity of vessel storages for each type of cargo vessel payload and available free spaces in platform storages the last volumes cannot be exceeded when planning to load the vessel then steps 12 16 the algorithm simulates the rest of the voyage and the planning cycle continues until the end of the planning task the result of the planning is a detailed list of ship operations such as moving cargo operations at a platform or in port the main purpose of the planning algorithm in the proposed approach is estimation of the required number of vessels n for each fleet configuration under consideration this could be performed by a calculation cycle where the integer number of vessels varies from 1 to n by adjustment of 1 at each step in such a case n the lowest value when the algorithm is performed up to the end of planning from step 16 we used the total cost criterion to evaluate the economic efficiency of a supply fleet configuration the criterion represents the sum of the fleet acquisition cost and the fuel cost for the entire considered period to estimate the fleet acquisition cost we used the market statistics for over 50 supply vessels sale transactions during the period from 1998 tо 2017 and built the corresponding regression equation 18 all prices are recalculated to

of offshore production platforms in the kara sea the supply fleet transports cargoes from an onshore base to the floating storage located in the open sea at a distance of 300 nm the total annual amount of cargo flow is 160 000 t we set the values of the storage cargo volumes and areas assuming the 10 day endurance based on this configuration we analyzed how various internal and external factors impact the entire system feasibility they are ice class cargo flow structure deadweight ship type psv ahts and capacity distribution by cargo type table 5 shows two considered variants of the cargo flow structure in the first case cf 1 the supply fleet carries drill mud and brine in the specialized tanks while in the second case cf 2 it transports separated components in offshore containers the second case infers the production of drill mud brine directly on the platform parameters of ice conditions for the considered case are presented in fig 7 we obtained this data by processing the monthly statistics of ice parameters in a chosen region raw data is taken from aari web site even though this data formally corresponds to the average severity of ice conditions the actual warming of the arctic climate leads to its shift closer to the heavy ice conditions table 6 shows the considered alternatives to supply fleet configurations with two variants of ice classes arc7 and arc8 and in a broad range of deadweight values the values of n dw s d and m c were calculated in advance using the parametric design model of a vessel described in section 3 the deadweight of arc7 vessels is varied on a larger scale because such ships are less restricted by the constraints on the main dimensions table 7 describes the considered variants of the vessel capacity distribution by cargo type they include the average statistical variant and two others that are optimized for cargo flow structures cf 1 and cf 2 optimized capacity distributions correspond to the share of each cargo in the total cargo flow the only exception is the fuel oil since the volume of fuel tanks is taken as 35 of w c based on arctic shipping practice fig 8 presents an example of calculations for the 10 year operation period the graph illustrates the discrete values of the required number of psv vessels and p tot of fleet configurations with the average distribution of useful capacity per cargo type the number of vessels in the fleet is at least two these values were estimated using the planning algorithm presented in section 4 for other graphs we presented only smoothing curves for the p tot values because it helps to better analyze the results fig 9 illustrates the outputs of a feasibility analysis for the variety of supply fleet configurations fig 9a f refer to the vessels with an average capacity distribution fig 9e and f refer to the vessels adapted to cf 1 and cf 2 cargo flows respectively fig 9а shows the calculation results for psv based supply systems with cf 1 cargo flow structure and 10 year operation period the arc7 vessels of 3200 4000 t deadweight have the lowest values of the p tot higher icebreaking capability and speed in the ice of arc8 vessels do not compensate for the negative impact of substantial capacity reduction and higher acquisition cost the situation is quite different in the case of cf 2 cargo flow structure with a larger share of containers see fig 9b the performance of arc7 vessels essentially decreases due to the inefficient utilization of large cargo capacities at the same time the value of p tot for arc8 vessels remains the same in a certain small range of deadweight 2500 3500 t they outperform arc7 vessels we also found this feature in other analyzed cases however arc7 vessels in the deadweight range of 4500 5000 t have the best economic efficiency according to our model it is important to note that the value of p tot for arc8 vessels has a low level of sensitivity to the changes in a cargo flow structure this is due to their high fuel consumption and low capacity of fuel tanks 24 of w c make the fuel a type of cargo that limits the fleet performance i e in this case fuel becomes a limiting type of cargo the situation when the amount and share of one cargo in the cargo flow structure determines the number of ship voyages as well as the overall supply system efficiency is quite typical in the case of open water operation containers play the role of a critical type of cargo together with other deck cargoes the promising opportunity to enlarge the supply system performance is balancing correspondence between the cargo flow structure and supply vessel characteristics our study confirms that the cargo flow structure substantially affects the supply fleet efficiency in other words if we traditionally consider only the deck cargoes in the last calculation example it will lead to inaccurate estimations in a large range of vessel deadweight fig 9c and d show a comparison of the supply fleet efficiency for four fleet groups psv and ahts of arc7 and arc8 ice classes and two cargo flow cases cf 1 fig 9c cf 2 fig 9d for a span of 20 years of operation in the case of arc7 vessels and cf 1 the choice of ahts instead of psv leads to the rise of expenses by about 5 for arc8 vessels of small deadweight under 3000 t ahts p tot values are much higher as compared to psv because of the lack of capacity provided by the first type of ships for cf 1 the psv of arc7 class with deadweight in the range of 3500 5000 t show the best economic efficiency according to our model in the case of cf 2 and arc7 vessels a large share of deck cargoes leads to a systematic decrease of the ahts performance since p tot difference versus psvs reaches 15 the performance of all arc8 vessels remains almost unchanged under variation of cargo flow structure see fig 9c for cf 2 case psv arc7 fleet has the best values of p tot in the deadweight range of 4000 5000 t fig 9e and f compare the psv arc7 and psv arc 8 fleet configurations with different capacity distributions by cargo type i e the average and adapted ones see table 7 we found out that the arc7 ice class is indifferent to the changes in capacity distribution this is due to their large useful capacity that is enough without any special measures in contrast the arc8 vessels with small deadweight below 3000 t typically show a lack of useful capacity therefore in this case changes in cargo space configurations reduce p tot by more than 10 for both cf 1 and cf 2 cases 6 conclusions in this study we showed how the developed approach and software let us analyze the impact of specific arctic related factors on offshore support vessels design and fleet composition performance these factors have various nature and combination of the holistic design model of support vessel and the fleet planning algorithm with the incorporation of arctic related parameters became a possible instrument to address the problem the strengths of the approach are an adaptation of the holistic ship design concept to arctic offshore support vessel and integration of the arctic logistics aspects and organizational features in the feasibility study application of such a method permits obtaining a more precise representation of the real transport system to study the mutual interaction of its elements the provided results of the vessel model verification suggested that it complies with the modern design practice as the case study we presented the analysis of the artic supply system in the kara sea the structure of cargo flow significantly influences the performance and reliability of the supply fleet researchers should keep this fact in mind at the stage of conceptual analysis of the supply system as well as during the design of the individual supply vessel project in the majority of practical cases the most promising way to increase the supply system efficiency is to minimize the share of deck cargoes in the cargo flow structure optimization of the capacity distribution by cargo types is the most effective in the case of supply vessels with a lack of internal hull volume between them are the vessels with high engine power such as ice going support vessels and modern ahtss for deep sea oil and gas offshore fields also we made a number of conclusions for the case of supplying the production platforms in the kara sea the fleet configurations based on psv vessels with arc 7 ice class deadweight range of 3000 4000 t and icebreaking capability close to 2 m showed the lowest values of the cost criterion the use of ahtss for the production platform supply instead of specialized psvs leads to decrease of efficiency by 5 15 because of less deck area useful capacity and payload there are also some possibilities for improvement in the approach a brute force algorithm could be replaced by a more sophisticated one such as a genetic or an ant colony algorithm it would help to extend the design space and perform formal optimization without predefined variants of vessels the parametric model of the vessel could be improved by introducing risk based elements into the ship design process another opportunity to increase the validity of the approach is rejecting an assumption of a ship moving at maximum possible speed the parts of the approach could be also applied separately the parametric model of supply vessel is a possible basis for the subsystems performance investigation and optimization while the planning algorithm is a prototype of a fleet scheduling tool credit authorship contribution statement

21933,real time prediction of ship motion is essential for decision making in shipborne maritime operations differences in ship hulls render different ship motion characteristics which consequently affects the performance of real time prediction models in this study the ship hull scale effects in real time motion prediction are investigated using the ar model the ship datasets are generated by applying the strip theory these ship motions datasets with various spectral characteristics are used in real time prediction simulations this study explores how the spectrum bandwidth peak frequency and ship hull scale influence prediction performance and conclusions are drawn based on numerical simulation results prediction accuracy shows a negative relation to spectrum bandwidth and peak frequency the ar model performance is better for ships with larger principal dimensions where ship hulls are the same a preliminary empirical formulation for evaluating the maximum predictable time duration is developed based on the above regularities keywords ship motions real time prediction scale effects predictable time duration ar model 1 introduction the ship motion resulting from sea waves has adverse effects on performing ship related maritime operations such operations are cargo transfers between ships float over installations shipborne helicopter recovery etc the real time prediction of ship motion in future seconds is used to improve operational safety and efficiency duan et al 2015a and it has proved to be effective in avoiding crashes of cargo in cargo transfers and improving the fire accuracy of shipborne weapon systems ra and whang 2006 khan et al 2006 ship motion real time prediction has been widely investigated since the 1950s various methods have been developed over the past several decades to present a clear review of this research topic huang et al 2014 classified prediction models into three categories hydrodynamic based prediction methods classic time series prediction models and nonlinear and intelligent learning prediction models the first effort in real time prediction of ship motion was performed based on ship hydrodynamic equations kaplan and sargent 1965 a real time predictor was developed by applying wave height measurements to a convolutional equation and its performance depended on the ship response kernel function it had limitations since accurate ship response kernel functions are difficult to obtain in real time varying sea states to overcome this challenge in identifying ship response kernel functions the kalman filtering technique was investigated triantafyllou and athans 1981 1982 triantafyllou et al 1983 for the real time ship forecasting real time prediction models were constructed according to precise state space equations simulations on the us destroyer dd 963 demonstrated the feasibility of the prediction models based on the kalman filter prediction performance greatly depended on the ocean wave frequency and noise however accurate state space equations and noise statistics are hard to determine in practical engineering problems additionally the real time implementation of models based on the kalman filter is challenging since enormous computational efforts are required for obtaining ship hydrodynamic coefficients involved in state space equations yang 2013 to overcome the practical limitations involved in the accurate estimation of state space noise and response kernel function time series models were used to forecast ship motions in real time whereby only the ship motions or the ocean waves were required for modeling yumori 1981 comparatively the autoregressive ar model is most explored because of its computational costs and convenience in real time implementation there was a lot of investigation on the identification schemes for the ar model yang 2013 but the ar model does not yield sufficient performance in high sea conditions as ship motion in severe seas is nonlinear and non stationary duan et al 2015a to achieve better prediction results an ar moving average arma model was designed yumori 1981 compared with the ar model wave measurements were used here as the additional input to the time series model the arma model gives good predictions when lead time is shorter than 4 s but it fails to capture the amplitude of the target ship motion when lead time exceeds 4 s also satisfactory results could only be achieved if the waves at a distance from the ship bow are accurately sensed whereas accurate phase resolved wave remote sensing is still very difficult in practical situations the classic time series approaches like ar and arma models are limited in high sea states because of their linear and stationary assumptions to handle ship motion nonlinearity various models based on the nonlinear time series and artificial intelligent theories were proposed zhou and zhao 1996 proposed a nonlinear ar nar model and demonstrated that the nar model shows higher prediction accuracy khan et al 2005 studied the real time ship motion prediction problem using the artificial neural network ann method the ann model they constructed showed satisfactory predictions when lead time increases to 7 s khan et al 2005 gu et al 2013 combined the ann model based on the radial basis function rbf with the chaotic time series theory the results based on numerically simulated data showed that the rbf based ann model performs acceptably up to 10 s even the above model based on the nonlinear and intelligent theory gives better results than the linear method whose disadvantages such as its high computational cost demanding substantial samples and non adaptation in parameter tuning need to be further overcome in practical applications compared with the nonlinearity problem non stationary processing is more challenging the non stationarity leads to increments in prediction errors for both linear and nonlinear time series models details about the effects of the non stationarity on prediction accuracy were discussed in duan et al 2016 to get better predictions for non stationary ship motion hybrid time series models have been developed in recent years the hybrid model was developed by coupling the prediction model with preprocessing techniques among these preprocessing methods empirical mode decomposition emd proved to be the most capable in non stationary processing emd based hybrid models were widely explored in nonlinear and non stationary real time ship motion forecasting for example aiming to improve the performance of the rbf neural network rbfnn model in non stationary ship motion prediction hou and qi 2011 proposed a hybrid emd rbfnn model when applying the hybrid emd rbfnn model the non stationary ship motion time series was decomposed into several stationary intrinsic model functions imfs the rbfnn model is applied to predict imf components after which the prediction result from each sub component is summarized to obtain the final predicted ship motion results show that the hybrid emd rbfnn model performs better than the single rbfnn model the support vector regression svr model is also capable of learning nonlinear time series but it requires smaller sample size the non stationary effects on the svr model were investigated by duan et al 2016 and hybrid emd svr models were developed for both nonlinear and non stationary ship motion prediction duan et al 2015a prediction results were largely improved for both wave forecasting and ship motion prediction issues the above studies also indicate that the predictability of a given prediction model is affected by the characteristics of the ship motion time series however these relationships are still unclear wave induced ship motion is mainly determined by dimension scales the sea condition and speed this study investigates dimension scale effects in ship motion real time prediction aiming to provide some preliminary insights for evaluating the predictability of ship motion this study focuses on the ar prediction model as it is mostly used and recommended in practical applications in addition to being convenient for implementation e g jie et al 2006 yang 2013 alford et al 2015 in addition the hybrid emd based models are the feasible and potential ways for improving nonlinear and non stationary ship motions prediction however present literatures just compared the results of the single and hybrid models to demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid models the theoretical foundations for why chose the hybrid models and how the hybrid models perform better are still not clear to understand why use hybrid models or how to improve the present prediction models clear understandings on how the ship motions characteristics affect the performance of the single prediction models are essential therefore the present work explores how spectral parameters affect the prediction results of the ar model the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theoretical formulations for the ar prediction model section 3 describes the hydrodynamic numerical simulation used to generate ship motion data prediction results are presented and discussed in section 4 whereas section 5 summarizes the findings of the present investigation 2 theoretical formulations for the ar prediction model time series prediction models assume the existence of hidden relations in time sequential variables the ar model represents the present variable using the linear superposition of previous time variables the ar model for the given time sequence x t t 1 n is formulated as eq 1 1 x t φ 1 x t 1 φ 2 x t 2 φ p x t p ε t t 1 2 3 n where p is the model order φ 1 φ 2 φ p are unknown model parameters and ε t t 1 2 n is zero mean white noise the identification of the ar model shown in eq 1 involves the selection of model order p and the estimation of model parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ p once the prediction model in eq 1 is determined using the given time series a k step ahead adaptive predictor can be developed as follows 2 x ˆ t k i 1 p φ i x t k i k 1 i 1 k 1 φ i x ˆ t i n i i k p φ i x t k i k 2 p i 1 p φ i x ˆ t k i k p in which x ˆ t k is the prediction of advancing k steps 2 1 parameter estimation yule walker equations can be derived according to eq 1 multiplying both sides of eq 1 by x t k and calculating their expectations yields the following equations 3 r k ϕ 1 r k 1 ϕ 2 r k 2 ϕ 3 x k 3 ϕ p x k p j 1 p ϕ j r k j where p is the model order k values vary from 1 to p and r k denotes the auto covariance function of x t for lag k which is shown in eq 4 4 r ˆ k r ˆ k 1 n t 1 n k x t x t k k 0 1 2 the yule walker equations can be rewritten as eq 5 5 r 1 r 2 r p r 0 r 1 r p 1 r 1 r 0 r p 2 r p 1 r p 2 r 0 1 ϕ p 1 ϕ p 2 ϕ p p as can be seen from eq 4 the parameters ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ p of the ar model can be solved if the autocorrelation functions are known the parameters are expressed as eq 6 6 ϕ ˆ p 1 ϕ ˆ p 2 ϕ ˆ p p r ˆ 0 r ˆ 1 r ˆ p 1 r ˆ 1 r ˆ 0 r ˆ p 2 r ˆ p 1 r ˆ p 2 r ˆ 0 1 r ˆ 1 r ˆ 2 r ˆ p when the number of model parameters p is small a direct matrix inversion based on eq 6 can provide satisfactory model parameters however deficiencies such as high algorithm complexity and expensive computational cost arise in direct matrix inversion when p is large this leads to real time difficulty when implementing the ar model a recursive algorithm provides an effective way of solving the yule walker equation in this study the levinson durbin l d algorithm was adopted to estimate model parameters as the l d algorithm has higher computational efficiency better prediction accuracy and better adaptability huang 2016 the l d algorithm for an ar model with an order of p consists of the following steps a compute the autocorrelation matrix r with a size of p 1 p 1 using eq 7 b set the initial conditions using eqs 8 and 9 c compute the coefficients of order k using the coefficients of model order k 1 based on equations until k equals the preset order p 7 r k 1 n k i 1 n x i x i k k 0 p where r k denotes the autocorrelation function of sequence x 1 x 2 x 3 x n 1 x n for lag k 8 φ 1 1 ρ 1 9 σ 1 r 0 1 ρ 1 2 where φ 1 1 is the first order model parameter σ 1 is the variance and ρ 1 is the reflection coefficient as shown in the following equations 10 ρ 1 r 1 r 0 11 φ i k ρ k i k φ i k 1 ρ k φ k i k 1 i 1 k 1 12 σ k 2 σ k 1 2 1 ρ k 2 where φ i k is the kth order model parameter and σ k is the corresponding variance the kth order reflection coefficient ρ k is formulated as follows 13 ρ k r k i 1 k 1 φ i k 1 r k i σ k 1 2 2 2 order selection another issue of ar model identification is how to select an optimal order over the last decades information criteria like the akaike information criterion akaike 1974 and bayesian information criterion akaike 1979 have been widely used these order selection principles provide reasonable results according to the samples however their computation efficiency in determining model order is relatively low especially in large samples whereas their accuracy performance becomes poor when the sampling frequency increases duan et al 2015b this study applies a ship related impulse response function irf on the basis of the order selection technique duan et al 2015b memory effects in ship motion result from radiated waves that are a consequence of ship response and its scattering of incident waves under the frame of linear theory formulation for ship motion in one degree of freedom is simplified using a generalized form in eq 14 irf is a set of weights reflecting how a ship reacts over time to its motion velocity impulsive input from the past therefore it has been extensively applied to model memory effects cummins 1962 liapis 1986 bingham 1994 14 m m x t t h τ x t τ d τ c x t f t inspired by the memory effects in ship motion duan et al 2015b demonstrated that an ar model can be derived using a discrete form of eq 14 which means that ship motion in an ocean wave is an ar process the order of the ar model for ship motion depends on the discretization of the convolutional term in eq 14 the order of the ar model determined by the irf technique is formulated as eq 15 15 p τ 0 δ t where p is the model order τ 0 is memory length and δ t is the sampling step as indicated in eq 15 order parameter p depends on memory length τ 0 and sampling step δ t as shown in fig 2 it is obviously suggested that the strength of memory effect h τ decreases when time delay τ grows hence memory length τ 0 can be calculated by eq 16 16 h τ 0 ε where ε is a non negative small quantity approaching zero as the irf is derived from ship s hydrodynamics the prediction results using the irf technique are identical to the parameter estimation algorithm sample size and sampling frequency 3 mathematical model of ship hydrodynamics this section gives formulations for a three degree of freedom ship hydrodynamic model the roll pitch and heave motions and their modeling coordinate systems are illustrated in fig 1 the roll pitch and heave motions are respectively represented as η 4 η 5 and η 3 the coordinate systems consist of the inertial coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 the body fixed coordinate system g xyz and the horizontal body coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 a wave is modeled using the inertial coordinate system fixed on the calm water surface the body fixed coordinate system that starts from the ship s center of gravity and moves with the ship is applied to describe the ship s hydrodynamics the horizontal body coordinate system is fixed on the calm water surface and it translates with the ship in the forward direction it is used to describe the hydrodynamic boundary value problem for practical purposes potential flow theories are mostly used in ship hydrodynamic modeling eqs 17 19 formulate the roll heave and pitch motions in the time domain using the impulsive response function

difference operators indices jk suggest the contribution of an oscillatory motion of the jth mode to the hydrodynamic coefficients in kth direction the third fourth and fifth mode motions represent heave roll and pitch respectively μ jk denotes the infinite frequency added mass coefficients b jk represents radiated damping coefficients and c jk and k jk t are the restoring hydrodynamic factor and time dependent memory functions respectively the hydrodynamic coefficients in the ship dynamic mathematical model can be obtained by solving the boundary value problem in this work a 2 d simulation is used to represent ship motion accurately and thus enable an accurate calculation of hydrodynamic forces see fonseca and guedes soares 1998 the ship hydrodynamics can be also simulated by other higher accuracy methods such as the high order boundary element method chen et al 2018 4 description of ship motion data and prediction evaluation measure 4 1 experimental ship motion data for ar modeling experimental ship motion time series data of the c11 container ship were used in the verification of the ar model the seakeeping experiment was performed in a towing tank at the harbin engineering university see fig 2 the main features of the c11 ship model were summarized in table 1 ship motion time series of the c11 container ship in heading waves with the condition of sea state 5 is presented in fig 3 the forward speed was 20 knots with respect to the full scale ship ship motion statuses heave and pitch were sampled at a 50 hz rate in model testing the full scale ship motion data were obtained according to the geometric and kinematic similarities and they were down sampled to two points per second using a cubic spline interpolation technique when verification was implemented 4 2 numerical simulation ship motion data for ar modeling this study investigates the s175 container ship the main particulars and the body plan of the ship are given in table 2 numerical simulations are implemented using a 2 d strip theory to obtain the ship hydrodynamic coefficients and motion the mathematical model is provided in sec 3 whereas details about the numerical implementation using 2 d theory can be found in duan et al 2015b in the present simulation the sea condition is assumed to be sea state 5 in heading waves the forward speed is 20 knots fig 4 shows the irf memory functions of s175 the memory lengths with respect to roll pitch and heave are summarized in table 3 where the non negative small quantity ε equals 0 05 the power spectrum density of pitch and heave motions under sea state 5 is given in fig 3 the ship motion power spectrum density is determined by both the ship hull and sea conditions it is clearly indicated in fig 5 that the energy of the ship motion is focused on the frequency range of 0 3 1 2 rad s the amplitude and the period are the basic measures for ship motion characteristics ship motions are irregular under irregular waves so the amplitude and period are time varying power spectrum density provides a direct and effective way for irregular ship motion representation where the peak period in the spectrum is usually considered to be the characteristic period the significant value determined by the zero order moment of the spectrum is used as the characteristic amplitude time series data are necessary for both training and validation purposes of the ar model as shown in fig 6 the ship motion time series are obtained using a linear superposition of a set of sinusoidal elementary waves where the sinusoidal elementary waves are generated through the discretization of power spectrum density a detailed implementation procedure of generating ship motion time series using power spectrum density is explained in subsection 5 5 4 in journée and massie 2001 4 3 forecast evaluation approaches for forecasting performance evaluation prediction results are studied by comparing the root mean square error rmse as shown in eq 20 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x ˆ t x t 2 where x ˆ t is the predicted ship motion whereas x ˆ m is the mean value of x ˆ t x t is the measured ship motion x m is the mean value of x t n represents testing times 5 prediction results and discussions this work investigates the effects that the ship motion spectral bandwidth peak period and ship hull scale have on prediction accuracy 5 1 experimental verification of the ar model the ar model was tested using the above experimental ship motion a fixed sliding window with a sample size of 1000 s ship motion record was designed to construct the prediction model whereas the subsequent 2000 s data were used for validation purposes the two step and 10 step historical predictions of ship motion are shown in figs 7 and 8 additionally the error measures of rmse are plotted in fig 9 to show the relations between their magnitudes and prediction lead times it is clear from the results that the two step pitch and heave motion predicted using the ar model agree with the measurements to a high degree as fig 7 suggests the general patterns of the recorded pitch and heave motion are well captured by the ar model with only minor errors in the peaks and troughs of the ship motion these experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ar model in real time prediction of ship motion as shown in fig 8 the general tendency of pitch and heave motion is reasonably predicted however prediction errors are noticeable in the predicted time series as prediction lead steps increase spatial offsets appear as large parts of the peaks and troughs that are underestimated or overestimated in addition to the spatial offsets a shift between the recorded and predicted wave time series can be noted the shift is a kind of prediction error that can also be found in other research studies deo and sridhar 1998 londhe and panchang 2006 the shift results mainly from the non stationarity hidden in the measured ship motion time series even if the nonlinear model is used to forecast the nonlinear and non stationary time series the shift remains duan et al 2015a it was also found that the spatial offsets and the shift are proportional to the lead step duan et al 2016 consequently prediction errors increase this can be confirmed by the predicted rmses results presented in fig 9 experimental results suggest that the ar model is effective in real time prediction of ship motion when the lead step is small nevertheless its performance in prediction of nonlinear and non stationary ship motion needs to be further improved especially for a large prediction lead step 5 2 prediction rmse as a function of ship motion spectral bandwidth a ship motion time series can be obtained based on its power spectrum density a set of sinusoidal elementary waves are constructed by implementing numerical discretization on the power spectrum density where the spectrum is uniformly divided into n parts the frequency step is designated as δ ω the ship motion time series can be expressed as 21 η t i 1 n a i cos ω i t ε i where ω i is frequency of the ith sinusoidal elementary waves ε i is the stochastic phase and a i is the amplitude successive ω i values are chosen at equally spaced interval δ ω along the frequency axis of the given spectrum the area under the associated segment of the spectrum s ω i δ ω is equal to the variance of the time series component journée and massie 2001 hence amplitude a i can be calculated using eq 22 22 1 2 a i 2 s ω i δ ω the bandwidth parameter υ for the power spectrum is defined as 23 υ n δ ω as shown in eq 23 bandwidth parameter υ is determined by both the frequency domain decomposition number n and frequency step δ ω hence to investigate the effects of bandwidth on the ar model the relations among parameters n and δ ω with prediction errors are analyzed 24 η t a 1 cos ω 1 t a 2 cos ω 2 t the time series based on a synthetic function formulated in eq 24 is used to explore the relationship between frequency step δ ω and prediction accuracy the frequency step is formulated as 25 δ ω ω 2 ω 1 as shown in fig 5 the dominant ship motion energy is in the frequency range of 0 3 1 2 rad s in which ω 1 and ω 2 are valued as shown in eq 26 the amplitudes of sinusoidal waves are set to 1 0 26 ω 1 0 3 r a d s ω 2 0 4 1 3 r a d s the time series from eq 24 is used to construct the ar model the prediction rmse under various frequency steps is summarized in table 4 and plotted in fig 10 the results show that the rmse decreases as frequency steps increase and it finally fluctuates within a certain range 27 η t a 1 a 2 cos ω 1 ω 2 2 t cos ω 1 ω 2 2 t a 2 a 1 sin ω 1 ω 2 2 t sin ω 1 ω 2 2 t eq 24 can be reformulated into eq 27 where it is clearly shown that the summation of two sinusoidal waves produces a sum frequency component and a difference frequency component there is an increased difference between these two modes if δ ω becomes smaller this big difference makes it difficult for the ar model to model these two modes simultaneously which consequently leads to a lager prediction rmse when the frequency step grows the difference between sum frequency and difference frequency components decreases as a result prediction accuracy is improved and the rmse is smaller as shown in fig 10 it is important to explore the relationship between decomposition number n and rmses the pitch power spectrum in fig 5 is discretized to generate ship motion data frequency step δ ω ranges from 0 04 to 0 08 rad s whereas n ranges from 1 to 20 the generated ship motion data using different parameters n and δ ω are later used for ar modeling and prediction simulation variations of the rmse to decomposition number n are given in fig 11 meanwhile the corresponding rmse values are presented in table 5 it is noticeable in fig 11 that the prediction rmse increases linearly as parameter n raises this can be easily explained by eq 21 the larger the parameter n is the more temporal scales there are in ship motion data as it is difficult for a single ar model to capture each temporal scale simultaneously a more different mode superposition leads to lower prediction accuracy fig 11 also shows that when parameter n is larger than 5 there is an increment in the prediction rmse when frequency step δ ω increases as expressed in eq 22 the amplitudes of elementary waves become large if there is growth in frequency steps which eventually leads to large amplitude modulations in the ship motion time sequence as seen in eq 21 the larger the amplitude modulations hidden in the ship motion time sequence the more difficult it is to make prediction that is why prediction accuracy deteriorates when frequency step δ ω increases to summarize the relationship between the spectrum discrete parameters and prediction rmse it is revealed that the ar model performs with low accuracy when ship motion has a big bandwidth spectrum the wider the spectrum band is the more complicated temporal scales and amplitude variations are hidden in the ship motion data 5 3 prediction rmse as a function of ship motion spectral peak frequency this subsection discusses the effects of spectral peak frequency on prediction performance as shown in fig 12 a series of motion spectra with the same spectral shape and bandwidth but different peak frequencies are generated by translating the peak frequency of the pitch power spectrum as shown in fig 5 a these spectra are then used to produce ship time series datasets using eq 21 table 6 summarizes prediction rmses for ship motion with various peak frequencies the forecasting leading steps are 40 and 80 respectively the tendency of the prediction rmse to peak frequency is exhibited in fig 13 where it is suggested that the prediction rmse shows a positive relation to peak frequency in both situations the zero order moments of spectra in fig 12 are the same therefore the same significant amplitudes of the ship motion datasets generated by these spectra are equivalent in addition to the amplitude the circular frequency is another basic parameter for describing ship motion time series in this situation the intensity of ship motion time series is determined by the peak frequency higher circular frequency leads to more intense ship motion which means a quicker change and shorter memory length in the time variables of a ship motion sequence this results in a lower prediction performance of the ar model to present a reasonable explanation from another viewpoint a non dimensional forecasting duration parameter is introduced in the following discussion the forecasting duration parameter designated as t is defined by eq 28 28 t k δ t t c where t c is the peak period corresponding to peak frequency ω c and k denotes the leading steps fig 14 shows prediction rmses across various non dimensional forecasting durations in case of ship motion with peak frequencies of 0 495 0 81 and 1 08 rad s it is first seen from the results that forecasting rmse is proportional to parameter t which is reasonable and easy to understand furthermore it is interesting to find that prediction rmses with respect to various peak frequencies agree to a significant degree the prediction rmse is a proportional function of the non dimensional forecasting duration as shown in eq 28 for a given leading step parameter k the non dimensional forecasting duration parameter t grows as peak frequency ω c increases as a consequence the increment in peak frequency ω c results in lower prediction accuracy as shown in fig 13 it can also be inferred from the above results that the ar model has different performances in predicting ship motion as the peak frequency of the ship motion spectrum is determined by both the ship hull and the sea condition therefore for a given forecasting error tolerance the predictable time duration is determined by the ship hull and the sea condition 5 4 prediction rmse as a ship hull scale function this subsection discusses the effects of the hull scale on prediction performance since different ship hull scales render different spectrum bandwidths and peak frequencies a variety of ship hulls are obtained by enlarging and reducing the standard s175 ship hull the enlargement and reduction scales as well as the main particulars of these ship hulls are provided in table 7 these ship hulls are used in the ship motion simulation program to produce ship motion data the ship motion data then serves for the ar modeling fig 15 presents prediction rmses under a variety of forecasting leading steps whereas fig 16 displays the variations of prediction accuracy related to ship displacement it can be seen that the rmse grows linearly as the forecasting leading step increases meanwhile the rmse corresponding to each forecasting leading step decreases when ship displacement becomes larger because ship motion under a given sea condition slows down when the ship hull scale rises the ship itself is a filter to ocean waves the larger the ship hull the lower the frequency band of the filter in this case both the bandwidth and peak frequencies of ship motion decrease which improves the ar model performance 5 5 empirical formulation for evaluating maximum predictable time duration the above numerical results describe how spectrum bandwidth peak frequency and ship hull scale influence prediction performance an increase in spectrum bandwidth and peak frequency has a negative effect on prediction accuracy motivated by these relations an empirical formulation for evaluating maximum predictable time duration is developed the maximum predictable time duration designated as t p under a certain forecasting error tolerance is approximately expressed by eq 29 29 t p c e r m s e n δ ω ω c where c is a parameter related to the prediction model e r m s e is the tolerant forecasting error and n and δ ω are the frequency domain decomposition number and frequency step respectively n δ ω can be approximately treated as spectrum bandwidth whereas ω c is the peak frequency of the ship motion spectrum for an expected prediction error tolerance it can be seen from eq 29 that the maximum predictable time duration t p is longer for larger ships this provides a feasible and direct way for evaluating the maximum predictable time duration for ships under various sea conditions fig 17 shows the pitch time series with peak frequencies of 0 47 0 9 and 1 07 rad s fig 18 presents 10 step ahead predicted time histories using the ar models it can be seen that the predicted time series match the target time series well when the lead step is 10 prediction rmses under various lead steps are further summarized in fig 19 to show predictable time durations it is suggested that lower peak frequency means longer predictable time duration taking the rmse threshold equaled to 0 05 deg as an example predictable time durations with respect to peak frequencies of 0 47 0 9 and 1 07 rad s are 7 5 3 8 and 2 8 s respectively this tendency is in agreement with the empirical formulation of the maximum predictable time duration nevertheless it should be pointed out that the detailed expression of the prediction model related parameter c in eq 29 needs to be further investigated in future works 6 concluding remarks the real time prediction of ship motion plays an essential role in decision making related to shipborne maritime operations differences in ship hulls lead to different ship motion characteristics which consequently affects the performance of real time prediction models this study investigated the ship hull scale effects in real time ship motions prediction using the ar model the ship datasets for forecasting simulation were generated by applying the stf method the aim was to explore how the spectrum bandwidth peak frequency and ship hull scale influence prediction performance firstly it was found that when the peak frequency is constant prediction accuracy decreases as the spectrum bandwidth becomes wider which was demonstrated by the numerical results in subsection 5 2 secondly when the spectrum bandwidth is constant prediction accuracy decreases as the peak frequency increases moreover for a given prediction error tolerance the non dimensional prediction duration for ship motion with various peak frequencies tends to be constant finally when ship hulls are the same the ar model performance is better for ships with larger principal dimensions a preliminary empirical formulation for evaluating the maximum predictable time duration was developed based on the above regularities the present research work provides preliminary insights into how precondition techniques improve the performance of real time prediction models for example hybrid prediction models that use the emd technique e g zhou and shi 2013 duan et al 2015a have been widely applied in recent years the ship motion time series are decomposed into several subcomponents that can be separately predicted by a single prediction model the predicted results of the subcomponents are then summarized to get the final predictions on the other hand hybrid models have better performance than single prediction models but although reasons for this are seldom given they can actually be derived from the findings of this study the subcomponents produced using the emd technique have narrower bandwidth and smaller spectral peaks the narrow bandwidth leads to better prediction performance which is why the hybrid prediction model gives better results than the single prediction model credit authorship contribution statement hua jiang methodology software writing original draft shiliang duan

21933,real time prediction of ship motion is essential for decision making in shipborne maritime operations differences in ship hulls render different ship motion characteristics which consequently affects the performance of real time prediction models in this study the ship hull scale effects in real time motion prediction are investigated using the ar model the ship datasets are generated by applying the strip theory these ship motions datasets with various spectral characteristics are used in real time prediction simulations this study explores how the spectrum bandwidth peak frequency and ship hull scale influence prediction performance and conclusions are drawn based on numerical simulation results prediction accuracy shows a negative relation to spectrum bandwidth and peak frequency the ar model performance is better for ships with larger principal dimensions where ship hulls are the same a preliminary empirical formulation for evaluating the maximum predictable time duration is developed based on the above regularities keywords ship motions real time prediction scale effects predictable time duration ar model 1 introduction the ship motion resulting from sea waves has adverse effects on performing ship related maritime operations such operations are cargo transfers between ships float over installations shipborne helicopter recovery etc the real time prediction of ship motion in future seconds is used to improve operational safety and efficiency duan et al 2015a and it has proved to be effective in avoiding crashes of cargo in cargo transfers and improving the fire accuracy of shipborne weapon systems ra and whang 2006 khan et al 2006 ship motion real time prediction has been widely investigated since the 1950s various methods have been developed over the past several decades to present a clear review of this research topic huang et al 2014 classified prediction models into three categories hydrodynamic based prediction methods classic time series prediction models and nonlinear and intelligent learning prediction models the first effort in real time prediction of ship motion was performed based on ship hydrodynamic equations kaplan and sargent 1965 a real time predictor was developed by applying wave height measurements to a convolutional equation and its performance depended on the ship response kernel function it had limitations since accurate ship response kernel functions are difficult to obtain in real time varying sea states to overcome this challenge in identifying ship response kernel functions the kalman filtering technique was investigated triantafyllou and athans 1981 1982 triantafyllou et al 1983 for the real time ship forecasting real time prediction models were constructed according to precise state space equations simulations on the us destroyer dd 963 demonstrated the feasibility of the prediction models based on the kalman filter prediction performance greatly depended on the ocean wave frequency and noise however accurate state space equations and noise statistics are hard to determine in practical engineering problems additionally the real time implementation of models based on the kalman filter is challenging since enormous computational efforts are required for obtaining ship hydrodynamic coefficients involved in state space equations yang 2013 to overcome the practical limitations involved in the accurate estimation of state space noise and response kernel function time series models were used to forecast ship motions in real time whereby only the ship motions or the ocean waves were required for modeling yumori 1981 comparatively the autoregressive ar model is most explored because of its computational costs and convenience in real time implementation there was a lot of investigation on the identification schemes for the ar model yang 2013 but the ar model does not yield sufficient performance in high sea conditions as ship motion in severe seas is nonlinear and non stationary duan et al 2015a to achieve better prediction results an ar moving average arma model was designed yumori 1981 compared with the ar model wave measurements were used here as the additional input to the time series model the arma model gives good predictions when lead time is shorter than 4 s but it fails to capture the amplitude of the target ship motion when lead time exceeds 4 s also satisfactory results could only be achieved if the waves at a distance from the ship bow are accurately sensed whereas accurate phase resolved wave remote sensing is still very difficult in practical situations the classic time series approaches like ar and arma models are limited in high sea states because of their linear and stationary assumptions to handle ship motion nonlinearity various models based on the nonlinear time series and artificial intelligent theories were proposed zhou and zhao 1996 proposed a nonlinear ar nar model and demonstrated that the nar model shows higher prediction accuracy khan et al 2005 studied the real time ship motion prediction problem using the artificial neural network ann method the ann model they constructed showed satisfactory predictions when lead time increases to 7 s khan et al 2005 gu et al 2013 combined the ann model based on the radial basis function rbf with the chaotic time series theory the results based on numerically simulated data showed that the rbf based ann model performs acceptably up to 10 s even the above model based on the nonlinear and intelligent theory gives better results than the linear method whose disadvantages such as its high computational cost demanding substantial samples and non adaptation in parameter tuning need to be further overcome in practical applications compared with the nonlinearity problem non stationary processing is more challenging the non stationarity leads to increments in prediction errors for both linear and nonlinear time series models details about the effects of the non stationarity on prediction accuracy were discussed in duan et al 2016 to get better predictions for non stationary ship motion hybrid time series models have been developed in recent years the hybrid model was developed by coupling the prediction model with preprocessing techniques among these preprocessing methods empirical mode decomposition emd proved to be the most capable in non stationary processing emd based hybrid models were widely explored in nonlinear and non stationary real time ship motion forecasting for example aiming to improve the performance of the rbf neural network rbfnn model in non stationary ship motion prediction hou and qi 2011 proposed a hybrid emd rbfnn model when applying the hybrid emd rbfnn model the non stationary ship motion time series was decomposed into several stationary intrinsic model functions imfs the rbfnn model is applied to predict imf components after which the prediction result from each sub component is summarized to obtain the final predicted ship motion results show that the hybrid emd rbfnn model performs better than the single rbfnn model the support vector regression svr model is also capable of learning nonlinear time series but it requires smaller sample size the non stationary effects on the svr model were investigated by duan et al 2016 and hybrid emd svr models were developed for both nonlinear and non stationary ship motion prediction duan et al 2015a prediction results were largely improved for both wave forecasting and ship motion prediction issues the above studies also indicate that the predictability of a given prediction model is affected by the characteristics of the ship motion time series however these relationships are still unclear wave induced ship motion is mainly determined by dimension scales the sea condition and speed this study investigates dimension scale effects in ship motion real time prediction aiming to provide some preliminary insights for evaluating the predictability of ship motion this study focuses on the ar prediction model as it is mostly used and recommended in practical applications in addition to being convenient for implementation e g jie et al 2006 yang 2013 alford et al 2015 in addition the hybrid emd based models are the feasible and potential ways for improving nonlinear and non stationary ship motions prediction however present literatures just compared the results of the single and hybrid models to demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid models the theoretical foundations for why chose the hybrid models and how the hybrid models perform better are still not clear to understand why use hybrid models or how to improve the present prediction models clear understandings on how the ship motions characteristics affect the performance of the single prediction models are essential therefore the present work explores how spectral parameters affect the prediction results of the ar model the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the theoretical formulations for the ar prediction model section 3 describes the hydrodynamic numerical simulation used to generate ship motion data prediction results are presented and discussed in section 4 whereas section 5 summarizes the findings of the present investigation 2 theoretical formulations for the ar prediction model time series prediction models assume the existence of hidden relations in time sequential variables the ar model represents the present variable using the linear superposition of previous time variables the ar model for the given time sequence x t t 1 n is formulated as eq 1 1 x t φ 1 x t 1 φ 2 x t 2 φ p x t p ε t t 1 2 3 n where p is the model order φ 1 φ 2 φ p are unknown model parameters and ε t t 1 2 n is zero mean white noise the identification of the ar model shown in eq 1 involves the selection of model order p and the estimation of model parameters φ 1 φ 2 φ p once the prediction model in eq 1 is determined using the given time series a k step ahead adaptive predictor can be developed as follows 2 x ˆ t k i 1 p φ i x t k i k 1 i 1 k 1 φ i x ˆ t i n i i k p φ i x t k i k 2 p i 1 p φ i x ˆ t k i k p in which x ˆ t k is the prediction of advancing k steps 2 1 parameter estimation yule walker equations can be derived according to eq 1 multiplying both sides of eq 1 by x t k and calculating their expectations yields the following equations 3 r k ϕ 1 r k 1 ϕ 2 r k 2 ϕ 3 x k 3 ϕ p x k p j 1 p ϕ j r k j where p is the model order k values vary from 1 to p and r k denotes the auto covariance function of x t for lag k which is shown in eq 4 4 r ˆ k r ˆ k 1 n t 1 n k x t x t k k 0 1 2 the yule walker equations can be rewritten as eq 5 5 r 1 r 2 r p r 0 r 1 r p 1 r 1 r 0 r p 2 r p 1 r p 2 r 0 1 ϕ p 1 ϕ p 2 ϕ p p as can be seen from eq 4 the parameters ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ p of the ar model can be solved if the autocorrelation functions are known the parameters are expressed as eq 6 6 ϕ ˆ p 1 ϕ ˆ p 2 ϕ ˆ p p r ˆ 0 r ˆ 1 r ˆ p 1 r ˆ 1 r ˆ 0 r ˆ p 2 r ˆ p 1 r ˆ p 2 r ˆ 0 1 r ˆ 1 r ˆ 2 r ˆ p when the number of model parameters p is small a direct matrix inversion based on eq 6 can provide satisfactory model parameters however deficiencies such as high algorithm complexity and expensive computational cost arise in direct matrix inversion when p is large this leads to real time difficulty when implementing the ar model a recursive algorithm provides an effective way of solving the yule walker equation in this study the levinson durbin l d algorithm was adopted to estimate model parameters as the l d algorithm has higher computational efficiency better prediction accuracy and better adaptability huang 2016 the l d algorithm for an ar model with an order of p consists of the following steps a compute the autocorrelation matrix r with a size of p 1 p 1 using eq 7 b set the initial conditions using eqs 8 and 9 c compute the coefficients of order k using the coefficients of model order k 1 based on equations until k equals the preset order p 7 r k 1 n k i 1 n x i x i k k 0 p where r k denotes the autocorrelation function of sequence x 1 x 2 x 3 x n 1 x n for lag k 8 φ 1 1 ρ 1 9 σ 1 r 0 1 ρ 1 2 where φ 1 1 is the first order model parameter σ 1 is the variance and ρ 1 is the reflection coefficient as shown in the following equations 10 ρ 1 r 1 r 0 11 φ i k ρ k i k φ i k 1 ρ k φ k i k 1 i 1 k 1 12 σ k 2 σ k 1 2 1 ρ k 2 where φ i k is the kth order model parameter and σ k is the corresponding variance the kth order reflection coefficient ρ k is formulated as follows 13 ρ k r k i 1 k 1 φ i k 1 r k i σ k 1 2 2 2 order selection another issue of ar model identification is how to select an optimal order over the last decades information criteria like the akaike information criterion akaike 1974 and bayesian information criterion akaike 1979 have been widely used these order selection principles provide reasonable results according to the samples however their computation efficiency in determining model order is relatively low especially in large samples whereas their accuracy performance becomes poor when the sampling frequency increases duan et al 2015b this study applies a ship related impulse response function irf on the basis of the order selection technique duan et al 2015b memory effects in ship motion result from radiated waves that are a consequence of ship response and its scattering of incident waves under the frame of linear theory formulation for ship motion in one degree of freedom is simplified using a generalized form in eq 14 irf is a set of weights reflecting how a ship reacts over time to its motion velocity impulsive input from the past therefore it has been extensively applied to model memory effects cummins 1962 liapis 1986 bingham 1994 14 m m x t t h τ x t τ d τ c x t f t inspired by the memory effects in ship motion duan et al 2015b demonstrated that an ar model can be derived using a discrete form of eq 14 which means that ship motion in an ocean wave is an ar process the order of the ar model for ship motion depends on the discretization of the convolutional term in eq 14 the order of the ar model determined by the irf technique is formulated as eq 15 15 p τ 0 δ t where p is the model order τ 0 is memory length and δ t is the sampling step as indicated in eq 15 order parameter p depends on memory length τ 0 and sampling step δ t as shown in fig 2 it is obviously suggested that the strength of memory effect h τ decreases when time delay τ grows hence memory length τ 0 can be calculated by eq 16 16 h τ 0 ε where ε is a non negative small quantity approaching zero as the irf is derived from ship s hydrodynamics the prediction results using the irf technique are identical to the parameter estimation algorithm sample size and sampling frequency 3 mathematical model of ship hydrodynamics this section gives formulations for a three degree of freedom ship hydrodynamic model the roll pitch and heave motions and their modeling coordinate systems are illustrated in fig 1 the roll pitch and heave motions are respectively represented as η 4 η 5 and η 3 the coordinate systems consist of the inertial coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 the body fixed coordinate system g xyz and the horizontal body coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 a wave is modeled using the inertial coordinate system fixed on the calm water surface the body fixed coordinate system that starts from the ship s center of gravity and moves with the ship is applied to describe the ship s hydrodynamics the horizontal body coordinate system is fixed on the calm water surface and it translates with the ship in the forward direction it is used to describe the hydrodynamic boundary value problem for practical purposes potential flow theories are mostly used in ship hydrodynamic modeling eqs 17 19 formulate the roll heave and pitch motions in the time domain using the impulsive response function

difference operators indices jk suggest the contribution of an oscillatory motion of the jth mode to the hydrodynamic coefficients in kth direction the third fourth and fifth mode motions represent heave roll and pitch respectively μ jk denotes the infinite frequency added mass coefficients b jk represents radiated damping coefficients and c jk and k jk t are the restoring hydrodynamic factor and time dependent memory functions respectively the hydrodynamic coefficients in the ship dynamic mathematical model can be obtained by solving the boundary value problem in this work a 2 d simulation is used to represent ship motion accurately and thus enable an accurate calculation of hydrodynamic forces see fonseca and guedes soares 1998 the ship hydrodynamics can be also simulated by other higher accuracy methods such as the high order boundary element method chen et al 2018 4 description of ship motion data and prediction evaluation measure 4 1 experimental ship motion data for ar modeling experimental ship motion time series data of the c11 container ship were used in the verification of the ar model the seakeeping experiment was performed in a towing tank at the harbin engineering university see fig 2 the main features of the c11 ship model were summarized in table 1 ship motion time series of the c11 container ship in heading waves with the condition of sea state 5 is presented in fig 3 the forward speed was 20 knots with respect to the full scale ship ship motion statuses heave and pitch were sampled at a 50 hz rate in model testing the full scale ship motion data were obtained according to the geometric and kinematic similarities and they were down sampled to two points per second using a cubic spline interpolation technique when verification was implemented 4 2 numerical simulation ship motion data for ar modeling this study investigates the s175 container ship the main particulars and the body plan of the ship are given in table 2 numerical simulations are implemented using a 2 d strip theory to obtain the ship hydrodynamic coefficients and motion the mathematical model is provided in sec 3 whereas details about the numerical implementation using 2 d theory can be found in duan et al 2015b in the present simulation the sea condition is assumed to be sea state 5 in heading waves the forward speed is 20 knots fig 4 shows the irf memory functions of s175 the memory lengths with respect to roll pitch and heave are summarized in table 3 where the non negative small quantity ε equals 0 05 the power spectrum density of pitch and heave motions under sea state 5 is given in fig 3 the ship motion power spectrum density is determined by both the ship hull and sea conditions it is clearly indicated in fig 5 that the energy of the ship motion is focused on the frequency range of 0 3 1 2 rad s the amplitude and the period are the basic measures for ship motion characteristics ship motions are irregular under irregular waves so the amplitude and period are time varying power spectrum density provides a direct and effective way for irregular ship motion representation where the peak period in the spectrum is usually considered to be the characteristic period the significant value determined by the zero order moment of the spectrum is used as the characteristic amplitude time series data are necessary for both training and validation purposes of the ar model as shown in fig 6 the ship motion time series are obtained using a linear superposition of a set of sinusoidal elementary waves where the sinusoidal elementary waves are generated through the discretization of power spectrum density a detailed implementation procedure of generating ship motion time series using power spectrum density is explained in subsection 5 5 4 in journée and massie 2001 4 3 forecast evaluation approaches for forecasting performance evaluation prediction results are studied by comparing the root mean square error rmse as shown in eq 20 20 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x ˆ t x t 2 where x ˆ t is the predicted ship motion whereas x ˆ m is the mean value of x ˆ t x t is the measured ship motion x m is the mean value of x t n represents testing times 5 prediction results and discussions this work investigates the effects that the ship motion spectral bandwidth peak period and ship hull scale have on prediction accuracy 5 1 experimental verification of the ar model the ar model was tested using the above experimental ship motion a fixed sliding window with a sample size of 1000 s ship motion record was designed to construct the prediction model whereas the subsequent 2000 s data were used for validation purposes the two step and 10 step historical predictions of ship motion are shown in figs 7 and 8 additionally the error measures of rmse are plotted in fig 9 to show the relations between their magnitudes and prediction lead times it is clear from the results that the two step pitch and heave motion predicted using the ar model agree with the measurements to a high degree as fig 7 suggests the general patterns of the recorded pitch and heave motion are well captured by the ar model with only minor errors in the peaks and troughs of the ship motion these experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ar model in real time prediction of ship motion as shown in fig 8 the general tendency of pitch and heave motion is reasonably predicted however prediction errors are noticeable in the predicted time series as prediction lead steps increase spatial offsets appear as large parts of the peaks and troughs that are underestimated or overestimated in addition to the spatial offsets a shift between the recorded and predicted wave time series can be noted the shift is a kind of prediction error that can also be found in other research studies deo and sridhar 1998 londhe and panchang 2006 the shift results mainly from the non stationarity hidden in the measured ship motion time series even if the nonlinear model is used to forecast the nonlinear and non stationary time series the shift remains duan et al 2015a it was also found that the spatial offsets and the shift are proportional to the lead step duan et al 2016 consequently prediction errors increase this can be confirmed by the predicted rmses results presented in fig 9 experimental results suggest that the ar model is effective in real time prediction of ship motion when the lead step is small nevertheless its performance in prediction of nonlinear and non stationary ship motion needs to be further improved especially for a large prediction lead step 5 2 prediction rmse as a function of ship motion spectral bandwidth a ship motion time series can be obtained based on its power spectrum density a set of sinusoidal elementary waves are constructed by implementing numerical discretization on the power spectrum density where the spectrum is uniformly divided into n parts the frequency step is designated as δ ω the ship motion time series can be expressed as 21 η t i 1 n a i cos ω i t ε i where ω i is frequency of the ith sinusoidal elementary waves ε i is the stochastic phase and a i is the amplitude successive ω i values are chosen at equally spaced interval δ ω along the frequency axis of the given spectrum the area under the associated segment of the spectrum s ω i δ ω is equal to the variance of the time series component journée and massie 2001 hence amplitude a i can be calculated using eq 22 22 1 2 a i 2 s ω i δ ω the bandwidth parameter υ for the power spectrum is defined as 23 υ n δ ω as shown in eq 23 bandwidth parameter υ is determined by both the frequency domain decomposition number n and frequency step δ ω hence to investigate the effects of bandwidth on the ar model the relations among parameters n and δ ω with prediction errors are analyzed 24 η t a 1 cos ω 1 t a 2 cos ω 2 t the time series based on a synthetic function formulated in eq 24 is used to explore the relationship between frequency step δ ω and prediction accuracy the frequency step is formulated as 25 δ ω ω 2 ω 1 as shown in fig 5 the dominant ship motion energy is in the frequency range of 0 3 1 2 rad s in which ω 1 and ω 2 are valued as shown in eq 26 the amplitudes of sinusoidal waves are set to 1 0 26 ω 1 0 3 r a d s ω 2 0 4 1 3 r a d s the time series from eq 24 is used to construct the ar model the prediction rmse under various frequency steps is summarized in table 4 and plotted in fig 10 the results show that the rmse decreases as frequency steps increase and it finally fluctuates within a certain range 27 η t a 1 a 2 cos ω 1 ω 2 2 t cos ω 1 ω 2 2 t a 2 a 1 sin ω 1 ω 2 2 t sin ω 1 ω 2 2 t eq 24 can be reformulated into eq 27 where it is clearly shown that the summation of two sinusoidal waves produces a sum frequency component and a difference frequency component there is an increased difference between these two modes if δ ω becomes smaller this big difference makes it difficult for the ar model to model these two modes simultaneously which consequently leads to a lager prediction rmse when the frequency step grows the difference between sum frequency and difference frequency components decreases as a result prediction accuracy is improved and the rmse is smaller as shown in fig 10 it is important to explore the relationship between decomposition number n and rmses the pitch power spectrum in fig 5 is discretized to generate ship motion data frequency step δ ω ranges from 0 04 to 0 08 rad s whereas n ranges from 1 to 20 the generated ship motion data using different parameters n and δ ω are later used for ar modeling and prediction simulation variations of the rmse to decomposition number n are given in fig 11 meanwhile the corresponding rmse values are presented in table 5 it is noticeable in fig 11 that the prediction rmse increases linearly as parameter n raises this can be easily explained by eq 21 the larger the parameter n is the more temporal scales there are in ship motion data as it is difficult for a single ar model to capture each temporal scale simultaneously a more different mode superposition leads to lower prediction accuracy fig 11 also shows that when parameter n is larger than 5 there is an increment in the prediction rmse when frequency step δ ω increases as expressed in eq 22 the amplitudes of elementary waves become large if there is growth in frequency steps which eventually leads to large amplitude modulations in the ship motion time sequence as seen in eq 21 the larger the amplitude modulations hidden in the ship motion time sequence the more difficult it is to make prediction that is why prediction accuracy deteriorates when frequency step δ ω increases to summarize the relationship between the spectrum discrete parameters and prediction rmse it is revealed that the ar model performs with low accuracy when ship motion has a big bandwidth spectrum the wider the spectrum band is the more complicated temporal scales and amplitude variations are hidden in the ship motion data 5 3 prediction rmse as a function of ship motion spectral peak frequency this subsection discusses the effects of spectral peak frequency on prediction performance as shown in fig 12 a series of motion spectra with the same spectral shape and bandwidth but different peak frequencies are generated by translating the peak frequency of the pitch power spectrum as shown in fig 5 a these spectra are then used to produce ship time series datasets using eq 21 table 6 summarizes prediction rmses for ship motion with various peak frequencies the forecasting leading steps are 40 and 80 respectively the tendency of the prediction rmse to peak frequency is exhibited in fig 13 where it is suggested that the prediction rmse shows a positive relation to peak frequency in both situations the zero order moments of spectra in fig 12 are the same therefore the same significant amplitudes of the ship motion datasets generated by these spectra are equivalent in addition to the amplitude the circular frequency is another basic parameter for describing ship motion time series in this situation the intensity of ship motion time series is determined by the peak frequency higher circular frequency leads to more intense ship motion which means a quicker change and shorter memory length in the time variables of a ship motion sequence this results in a lower prediction performance of the ar model to present a reasonable explanation from another viewpoint a non dimensional forecasting duration parameter is introduced in the following discussion the forecasting duration parameter designated as t is defined by eq 28 28 t k δ t t c where t c is the peak period corresponding to peak frequency ω c and k denotes the leading steps fig 14 shows prediction rmses across various non dimensional forecasting durations in case of ship motion with peak frequencies of 0 495 0 81 and 1 08 rad s it is first seen from the results that forecasting rmse is proportional to parameter t which is reasonable and easy to understand furthermore it is interesting to find that prediction rmses with respect to various peak frequencies agree to a significant degree the prediction rmse is a proportional function of the non dimensional forecasting duration as shown in eq 28 for a given leading step parameter k the non dimensional forecasting duration parameter t grows as peak frequency ω c increases as a consequence the increment in peak frequency ω c results in lower prediction accuracy as shown in fig 13 it can also be inferred from the above results that the ar model has different performances in predicting ship motion as the peak frequency of the ship motion spectrum is determined by both the ship hull and the sea condition therefore for a given forecasting error tolerance the predictable time duration is determined by the ship hull and the sea condition 5 4 prediction rmse as a ship hull scale function this subsection discusses the effects of the hull scale on prediction performance since different ship hull scales render different spectrum bandwidths and peak frequencies a variety of ship hulls are obtained by enlarging and reducing the standard s175 ship hull the enlargement and reduction scales as well as the main particulars of these ship hulls are provided in table 7 these ship hulls are used in the ship motion simulation program to produce ship motion data the ship motion data then serves for the ar modeling fig 15 presents prediction rmses under a variety of forecasting leading steps whereas fig 16 displays the variations of prediction accuracy related to ship displacement it can be seen that the rmse grows linearly as the forecasting leading step increases meanwhile the rmse corresponding to each forecasting leading step decreases when ship displacement becomes larger because ship motion under a given sea condition slows down when the ship hull scale rises the ship itself is a filter to ocean waves the larger the ship hull the lower the frequency band of the filter in this case both the bandwidth and peak frequencies of ship motion decrease which improves the ar model performance 5 5 empirical formulation for evaluating maximum predictable time duration the above numerical results describe how spectrum bandwidth peak frequency and ship hull scale influence prediction performance an increase in spectrum bandwidth and peak frequency has a negative effect on prediction accuracy motivated by these relations an empirical formulation for evaluating maximum predictable time duration is developed the maximum predictable time duration designated as t p under a certain forecasting error tolerance is approximately expressed by eq 29 29 t p c e r m s e n δ ω ω c where c is a parameter related to the prediction model e r m s e is the tolerant forecasting error and n and δ ω are the frequency domain decomposition number and frequency step respectively n δ ω can be approximately treated as spectrum bandwidth whereas ω c is the peak frequency of the ship motion spectrum for an expected prediction error tolerance it can be seen from eq 29 that the maximum predictable time duration t p is longer for larger ships this provides a feasible and direct way for evaluating the maximum predictable time duration for ships under various sea conditions fig 17 shows the pitch time series with peak frequencies of 0 47 0 9 and 1 07 rad s fig 18 presents 10 step ahead predicted time histories using the ar models it can be seen that the predicted time series match the target time series well when the lead step is 10 prediction rmses under various lead steps are further summarized in fig 19 to show predictable time durations it is suggested that lower peak frequency means longer predictable time duration taking the rmse threshold equaled to 0 05 deg as an example predictable time durations with respect to peak frequencies of 0 47 0 9 and 1 07 rad s are 7 5 3 8 and 2 8 s respectively this tendency is in agreement with the empirical formulation of the maximum predictable time duration nevertheless it should be pointed out that the detailed expression of the prediction model related parameter c in eq 29 needs to be further investigated in future works 6 concluding remarks the real time prediction of ship motion plays an essential role in decision making related to shipborne maritime operations differences in ship hulls lead to different ship motion characteristics which consequently affects the performance of real time prediction models this study investigated the ship hull scale effects in real time ship motions prediction using the ar model the ship datasets for forecasting simulation were generated by applying the stf method the aim was to explore how the spectrum bandwidth peak frequency and ship hull scale influence prediction performance firstly it was found that when the peak frequency is constant prediction accuracy decreases as the spectrum bandwidth becomes wider which was demonstrated by the numerical results in subsection 5 2 secondly when the spectrum bandwidth is constant prediction accuracy decreases as the peak frequency increases moreover for a given prediction error tolerance the non dimensional prediction duration for ship motion with various peak frequencies tends to be constant finally when ship hulls are the same the ar model performance is better for ships with larger principal dimensions a preliminary empirical formulation for evaluating the maximum predictable time duration was developed based on the above regularities the present research work provides preliminary insights into how precondition techniques improve the performance of real time prediction models for example hybrid prediction models that use the emd technique e g zhou and shi 2013 duan et al 2015a have been widely applied in recent years the ship motion time series are decomposed into several subcomponents that can be separately predicted by a single prediction model the predicted results of the subcomponents are then summarized to get the final predictions on the other hand hybrid models have better performance than single prediction models but although reasons for this are seldom given they can actually be derived from the findings of this study the subcomponents produced using the emd technique have narrower bandwidth and smaller spectral peaks the narrow bandwidth leads to better prediction performance which is why the hybrid prediction model gives better results than the single prediction model credit authorship contribution statement hua jiang methodology software writing original draft shiliang duan

21934,the interactions between ships and propellers interfere with the performance of both this paper aims to discuss the current methods of modeling ship propeller interactions using computational fluid dynamics cfd the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans and body force methods the fully resolved propeller method with the rans solver the prescribed body force method and the boundary element method bem and rans coupled iterative body force method were used to predict the propulsive performance and calculate the self propulsion point of a kriso container ship model for the rans bem iterative body force method a new method without nesting iteration is adopted to calculate the self propulsion point an additional discussion of self propulsion factors is presented based on these results calculation results showed good agreement with model test results the rans method performs better at obtaining detailed flow field information and at analyzing the propeller plane wake fields on a propeller plane the body force method has a unique advantage in terms of computational efficiency for performance evaluations of both ships and propellers keywords cfd self propulsion rans method bem body force method coupled calculation 1 introduction hull and propeller designs should account for both isolated performance and the interactions that occur when these elements are used together numerical simulations of ship propeller interference typically utilize ship propeller fully resolved method and body force method the most intuitive method is to use integral modeling with a viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd algorithm for both the ship and the propeller where the fully resolved method solves the flow field directly using a cfd algorithm this produces more accurate results and successfully reflects detailed information unfortunately this method requires a complex mesh model which in turn necessitates an unsteady sliding mesh calculation for the propeller consuming a considerable amount of computing power the body force method uses a body force momentum source model an actuator disk model to simulate a real ship propeller a simplification from the hull propeller combination model two categories of this method can be defined iterative body force method and prescribed body force method kawamura et al 1997 and moctar 2001 the prescribed body force method is relatively simple and convenient however it lacks the requirements for propeller performance calculations and it cannot directly determine the force and pressure distribution of a propeller working behind the hull previous studies have adopted this method to calculate the self propulsion performance of a kriso container ship kcs shao hua et al 2013 noting that even when the torque was ignored the overall performance prediction results were considerably accurate the actuator disk model was also used for self propulsion assessment with comparation to rans approach with a real propeller furthermore the actuator disk technology has been widely used in the wake simulation of wind turbines and tidal turbines when the actuator disk is combined with the classical turbulence model reliable numerical results can be obtained van and sylvain 2016 the numerical results obtained using the k ε turbulence model can be compared with the experimental measurements cabezon et al 2009 crespo and hernández 1996 the performance of the standard k ε model the realizable k ε model and the reynolds stress model rsm have been evaluated and their results were compared with the experimental measurements cleijne 1992 this comparison indicated that all turbulence models can obtain satisfactory results and the rsm showed the best performance although it required a large amount of calculation some scholars successfully improved their model results by modifying the turbulence equations they aimed to simulate the dynamics of the energy generated by small vortices as air flowed through a turbine chen and kim 1987 based on the source terms of chen and kim and the standard k ε model kasmi and masson 2008 another study simulated axisymmetric flow through a horizontal axis wind turbine p e réthoré et al 2009 the numerical results were shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results obtained from another study taylor et al 1985 in terms of velocity and turbulence intensity several studies have proven the applicability of the actuator disk method based on the k ω or the k ε model in simulating wakes behind tidal devices palm et al 2010 and harrison et al 2010 a similar experiment was simulated batten et al 2013 the results showed that all turbulence models can accurately simulate the far wake i e the diameter of the turbine is greater than five times the distance however the reliability of the model can be improved when the wake is near the iterative body force method is a potential viscous flow coupling method with wider applications simonsen 2005 and vaz and bosschers 2006 in this approach propeller loading calculated by various potential methods is transformed into a body force distribution which is then imposed onto the rans computation forces are added as momentum source terms in the adopted body force model either a single plane 2d or a three dimensional 3d distribution within the swept volume of the propeller and the resulting effective wake is input into the potential code to calculate the new propeller performance where both sides are iterated until convergence this calculation method has certain advantages for grid partitioning and computing resource occupancy as well as accurate forecasting results zheng yang 2015 combined the lifting surface method pien 1961 of potential flow calculation on the propeller and viscous flow calculation for the hull to solve the self propulsion problem based on the boundary element method bem a potential viscous flow coupling method iterative body force method was used to derive detailed propeller induced velocity and volume force information for its potential flow calculation which was performed directly in the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans computational domain villa et al 2012 further research was performed by stefano gaggero et al 2017 they later performed extensive numerical validations with the available experimental measurements of the coupled bem rans approach to verify the reliability of the approach the coupled iteration mechanism is computationally efficient and accurate the blade element momentum theory bemt o brian 1969 which is very popular in aerodynamics has also been applied to potential calculations as a part of flow coupling in ships turnock et al 2011 and phillips et al 2009 the iterative body force method has begun to address special propeller calculations such as contra rotating propulsion ducted propellers and podded propellers sánchez caja et al 2015 and dominguez et al 2015 increasingly intensive research has extended the scope of application for the iterative body force method wake fraction evaluations have become a distinguishing point in this field furthermore the iterative body force method has also been applied in other fields starke and bosschers 2012 dominguez et al 2016 turnock et al 2011 and batten et al 2013 in this study the fully resolved propeller prescribed body force and rans bem coupled iterative body force methods were used to calculate the ship propulsion performance on a model scale for the bem rans coupled approach a low level unsteady bem was applied to the propeller performance calculation the singularity distribution on the surface was assumed to be uniform the inflow information needed for the bem code is not directly acquired by from the wake field in rans calculation results the velocity distribution of the wake the sum of the induced speed of the propeller and the effective wake is not the real inflow for the bem propeller calculation current practices for determining the effective wake require measuring the apparent wake in the propeller plane acquired directly from the calculation and transforming it into the effective wake field for the bem code input the bem calculation code which considers how the wake affects propeller performance was compiled in fortran the rans equation was used to calculate the viscous flow iterative computation methods were adopted to calculate the ship self propulsion point verifying the feasibility and reliability of these methods the results and advantages of these methods are compared and evaluated in this paper

ship research institute sri to provide validation data for the international workshop on cfd in ship hydrodynamics the flow field characteristics at the stern of the ship are observable detailed test results and calculation data are available for this ship type concentrated in the conference data from gothenburg 2000 tokyo 2005 and gothenburg 2010 a kcs model without a rudder was used as shown in fig 1 a the central parameters of the model are described in table 1 a kp505 five bladed propeller with the profile of a standard naca airfoil was used as shown in fig 1 b the central parameters of which are described in table 2 3 resistance calculation for bare hull the flow field around the bare hull was simulated using the rans equation for the solution of the hull flow and the prediction of the ship s resistance the general purpose commercial rans solver starccm was used the fluid volume function vof was used for the free surface calculation as shown in figs 2 and 3 a trimmed unstructured mesh with 3 7 million grids was used to model the ship hull without rudder and fluid region for which local refinement of anisotropic meshes was conducted at the bow and stern to increase accuracy all y treatment was applied with a y value 50 across the bare hull surface the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model was adopted for the viscous fluid calculation for its advantages in the near wall region and wake simulation menter 1994 table 3 shows the comparison of the calculated resistance c t 103 of the bare hull with the test value at the speed of 2 197 m s it can be seen that the difference between the calculated value and the test value is not large which shows the accuracy of the calculation fig 4 shows a comparison of wave patterns at the design speed at the waterline surface the similarity between the numerical simulation and test results was very high shown in figs 4 and 5 indicating the rans calculation method is highly accurate for wave predictions it should be noted that the bow prediction was particularly accurate for both wave height and distribution waves after the stern of ship were slightly different but the longitudinal and horizontal waveform distributions were dissimilar after waves spread past the stern the wave height data were different but the diffusion trends were similar and height errors fell within the acceptable range a comparison of wave heights between tested and calculated results can be seen in fig 5 showing both value sets agreed well in errors and in trends this further demonstrates the high accuracy and reliability of the selected calculation method fig 6 shows the characteristics of the nominal wake field this figure shows the wake of the bare hull running in the water without a propeller the calculated results left image agree well with the test results right image shown in fig 6 which also displays a significant slowdown of x axis velocity in the flow field at the hub caused by viscous force the x axis velocity increases along the radius in fig 7 it can be seen that the speed changes rapidly near the hub but slowly near the blade edge combining with the velocity distribution of the longitudinal profile in fig 7 the flow deceleration caused by the viscous force acting on the hull can be observed this force results in the formation of the boundary layer the sensitivity analysis of fine grids as well as the different turbulence models or time discretization are beyond the scope of current analysis and are therefore not considered in this study 4 prediction of ship propulsion performance on model scale 4 1 fully resolved propeller method the integral models of both the hull and propeller were directly developed using the rans calculation the propeller portion was a real model like the hull these parts are separated by a cylindrical region partitioned into hexahedral meshes the total number of grids was 1 4 million the interface between this area and the hull flow field was divided for data exchange the speed of the hull model was 2 197 m s and the rotational speed of propeller was 9 5 r s a sliding mesh was adopted for the unsteady calculation to simulate propeller working behind the ship s hull because the inflow field to the propeller is spatially non homogeneous the axial velocity distribution at the propeller disk is shown in fig 9 the propeller produced significant suction and torsion in the flow field the high axial velocity region was concentrated at the propeller blades whereas this velocity was reduced at the blade tip and root hub the former phenomenon results from the suction force left by the tip of the propeller as the blade spins and the latter is caused by friction at the hub due to actions of real blades the axial velocity field distribution was asymmetrical and the selected algorithm simulated the real propeller model thus it can clearly show flow field details because of the non uniformity of the propeller inflow the sliding grid is suitable however this method is time consuming for the later work which needs to be iterated the calculation time of the sliding grid is obviously too long therefore the multiple reference mrf algorithm was also used for the propeller performance in this region applying the mrf enabled steady calculation resulting in savings for computing resources this approximation can save a lot of computing time and its performance prediction results can also be used for comparison when using sliding grids 4 2 prescribed body force method the prescribed body force method was based on the meshing and settings of the bare hull without propeller of the rans algorithm calculation model the body force momentum source loading of the propeller part was calculated by replacing the original real propeller mode with a virtual actuator disk model the thrust and torque applied by the propeller were input into the actuator disk and the surface load of the propeller was replaced by the effect of the actuator disk on the flow field shao hua et al 2013 the difference between the actuator disk and the real propeller used for calculation are shown in fig 10 the momentum source distribution of the actuator disk was as follows cd adapco 2012 1 f b x a x r 1 r 2 f b θ a θ r 1 r r 1 r h r h where 3 a θ 105 8 q π δ r p 3 r h 4 r p r p r h 4 a x 105 8 t π δ 3 r h 4 r p r p r h 5 r r r h 1 r h in these equations f b x and f b θ represent the axial and circumferential momentum source distributions respectively r represents the radial coordinates r h represents the hub diameter δ represents the thickness of the actuator disk a x and a θ are constant numbers r p represents the propeller radius and r h and r represent the dimensionless hub radius and dimensionless radial coordinates respectively these equations show that the body force source of the excitation plate model is a function of the radial coordinate r implying the distribution does not change in the axial or circumferential directions to complete these calculations the specific force application process was to directly input the open water performance curve of a kp505 propeller into the actuator disk this allowed the actuator disk to produce appropriate forces and torques according to the flow through the disk speed simulating self propulsion fig 11 shows the axial velocity profile at the propeller disk u 2 197 m s and n 9 5 r s the high speed region in the figure shows the pumping effect of the actuator disk on the flow field when comparing the nominal flow field symmetry of the bare hull with refe 1rence to the projection line y 0 in this figure the overall flow field displays a certain degree of right handedness showing the torsion effect of the actuator disk model on the flow field this indicates the actuator disk model simulated simultaneous suction and torsion in the flow field as are observed in real propellers showing it possible for this model to replace the real propeller 4 3 rans bem coupled body force method the open water performance of propellers differs greatly from their performance when affected by flow fields in the previous section 4 2 the effect of the flow field on propeller performance was not considered the remainder of this section addresses that issue using the rans bem coupled body force method which simultaneously applies the bare hull used in rans and actuator disk models unlike section 4 2 the actuator disk model data here was not the water performance curve but instead the unsteady performance curve the propeller calculation result which considers the wake flow field influence propeller performance in the rans bem coupled body force method was calculated using the unsteady boundary element method bem whereas the hull and surrounding flow field were calculated with the rans method the former calculation requires the wake field calculation result from the rans equation and the latter requires the performance from the actuator disk model the following subsections iteratively calculate these two processes until convergence thus simulating the process of ship propulsion 4 3 1 boundary element method bem the fluid inside the basin was assumed to be free of rotation inviscid and incompressible as inflow was non uniform for the propeller influenced by the wake flow field the velocity of the flow could be described as v a x y z t the perturbation velocity vector of the propeller could be described by the perturbation velocity potential φ t which satisfies the laplace equation 6 2 φ t 0 according to green s third formula perturbation velocity potentials can be represented by the surface distribution of sources and dipoles the relevant boundary conditions must also be considered kinematic boundary conditions and the condition that perturbation speed fades to zero at infinity the above conditions and formulas may be combined to produce the following formula 7 s b ϕ q n q 1 r p q d s s w δ ϕ q n q 1 1 r p q 1 d s s b v 0 n q 1 r p q d s 2 π ϕ p where s b and s w represent the surface of the object and the tail vortex respectively p represents a field point q represents a point on the surface of the area boundary and q 1 represents a point on the surface of the tail vortex the propeller surface and tail vortex were divided into multiple facets equation 7 was divided into elements to describe the resulting boundary the kutta condition was considered for edges acquiring numerical results for each time step of this unsteady calculation each propeller blade surface was divided into 20 equal parts in each direction such that the discretized surface mesh consisted of 800 panel elements for each blade the vortex was linearly modeled and trapped by the trailing edge of the blade the trailing vortical wake extended for two complete revolutions and was discretized with a time equivalent to the 6 angular step as shown in fig 12 the results calculated by this bem code proved feasible in comparison with hoshino 1989 the kp505 open water performance calculation results are shown in fig 13 where k t k q and η are the calculated propeller thrust coefficient torque coefficient and propeller efficiency values respectively and k t0 k q0 and η 0 are the corresponding test values this figure shows that the overall accuracy of the calculation was relatively high with errors between the calculated and test values of 5 when the advance coefficient j was in the range of 0 5 0 85 the errors at low j values in fig 13 are mainly attributable to the wake alignment and to the leading edge suction force the unsteady bem calculation results changed constantly according to the time step this paper acquired the propeller performance curve from the average values of each rotation period this performance data was entered into the actuator disk model to simulate the propeller effects in the hull rans calculation 4 3 2 potential viscous flow coupled iterative mechanism the classical assumption of unbounded non rotational flow generally valid for propeller design and analysis using simplified potential flow based theories is typically not applicable for propellers operating behind a hull for these conditions the flow field on the propeller disk is not the simple sum of the nominal flow field and propeller induced velocity field instead complex interactions occur in which suction from the propeller alters the original flow field and the flow field in turn alters propeller performance the disk flow field following a ship is the sum of the hull propeller interaction velocity field the effective wake and the propeller induced velocity field produced by propeller rotation rijpkema et al 2013 as shown in equation 8 from the perspective of the propeller this effect wake its wake fraction distribution is the data that should be used as input conditions for the unsteady bem code 8 v t o t a l v e f f e c t i v e v i n d u c e d the viscous potential flow calculation coupling iterative method was applied for this purpose the propeller was solved using the potential flow method and the force and moment information calculated for the propeller were brought into the rans hull field the rans method was then used to calculate the hull field with an actuator disk in place of the propeller the following is the iterative mechanism for calculating potential and viscous flow coupling see fig 14 this iterative process requires special processing in the companion field for iteration the effective wake distribution input is the actuator disk result for the apparent wake field minus the induced velocity field of the propeller described by equation 8 the feasibility of the proposed method can be verified by observing the convergence of the results shown in fig 15 u 2 197 m s and n 9 5 r s as shown in fig 15 t q and r t s p represent the calculated propeller thrust torque and hull resistance respectively as the first iteration calculated a bare hull without actuator disk no thrust torque or other propeller performance results were produced it was thus excluded from fig 15 the convergence criterion is that the change in value of the last two steps is less than 5 of the previous result the convergence was achieved at seven steps 5 self propulsion point solution according to the similarity theorem geometric and movement similarities must be fulfilled simultaneously to fully simulate the working state of a self propelled ship this means that the froude number and reynolds number need to meet the same between the model and the full scale version unfortunately it is difficult to achieve equivalent reynolds numbers meaning total resistance fails to fulfill the similar relationship requirement to overcome this contradiction a friction correction value sfc was introduced as shown in equation 9 9 s f c r t m ρ m ρ s r s λ 3 where r t m and ρ m represent hull resistance and water density respectively on the model scale ρ s and r s represent hull resistance and water density respectively for the full scale version and λ represents the scale ratio from real scale to model scale after the sfc was introduced according to the state of self propulsion force balance the force on the ship should fulfill the following relationship 10 t r t s p s f c in this study the sfc was 30 25 n the calculation results from the previous section 4 3 2 using a propeller speed n 9 5 r s and ship speed u 2 197 m s failed to satisfy equation 10 for this section the ship speed was fixed and the rotating speed of the propeller was changed to fulfill equation 10 and calculate the self propulsion point 5 1 self propulsion point solution of fully resolved propeller method and prescribed body force method the process of solving the self propulsion point is iterative for the fully resolved propeller approach if the sliding grid is selected for unsteady computation in the iteration process the computational resources consumed are too large although mrf is rather rough because of the non uniformity of the propeller inflow it does save a lot of computing resources and has greater engineering significance the emphasis of this paper is to discuss the simplified algorithm therefore the fully resolved propeller approach uses the constant calculation of the mrf using the fully resolved propeller and prescribed body force methods the propeller actuator disk and hull calculation results can be acquired directly when determining these calculation results the rotating speed can be adjusted directly for a fixed ship speed to produce corresponding calculation results that fulfill equation 10 changes in the thrust and torque output can be small for small range propeller speed adjustments if this adjustment range is sufficiently small the propeller actuator disk rotational speed n and its output thrust t can be approximated to satisfy the required linear relationship then according to a given n 9 5 r s the rotation speed can be changed in a small range to n to calculate the corresponding thrust t according to equation 10 a target thrust can be acquired through this process the propeller speed n the output of the target thrust can be obtained by linear interpolation as the assumption was approximated there will be errors in the resulting output the error range of these results can be reduced by iterative calculation thus values for the bare hull axial resistance and propeller disk thrust that satisfy equation 10 within the specified error range for the utilized rotating speed n are obtained thus the iterative process for these two methods is as follows see fig 16 5 2 self propulsion point solution of rans bem coupled body force method if the method described in the previous section was used to calculate the self propulsion point solution for the rans bem coupled body force method nested iterations will result as the rans bem coupled body force method also performs iterations this cumbersome calculation process consumes excessive amounts of computation times and resources as such a new iteration mechanism was required to calculate the rans bem coupled body force method self propulsion point propeller performance curves can be approximated as a straight line when their j is relatively large typically 0 5 as shown in fig 8 the straight line obtained by linear fitting for the kp505 propeller may have an error of less than 5 relative to test results with especially small data errors in high advance coefficient regions j 0 5 under these conditions the straight line approximation of test results can be expressed as follows 11 k t a v a n d b where a and b are coefficient values that can be simulated by bem and the rotation speed n is a variable that must be calculated the dimensionless formula equation can change as follows 12 k t n 2 t ρ d 4 where the water density ρ and propeller diameter d are known and t represents the propeller thrust combining these two expressions produces 13 b n 2 a v a d n t ρ d 4 0 the above equation is a unitary quadratic equation the fitting line expression can be acquired from the propeller performance curve by bem code the rotating speed n could be acquired from this unitary quadratic equation in combination with the fitting line expression and propeller target thrust t for the rans bem coupled body force method self propulsion point solution the iterative mechanism was as follows 1 the overall bare hull viscous flow field was calculated using the rans solver the hull resistance r i was thus acquired 2 the propeller plane spatial nonuniform velocity field was extracted using the rans computation the effective wake field as the inflow for the unsteady computation using the propeller panel method was obtained by extracting this velocity field and subtracting the corresponding induced velocity field readings according to equation 8 3 the inlet velocity was fixed and the rotation speed n i was varied to calculate the unsteady performance of the propeller the unsteady results were averaged by time 4 a performance curve was acquired from the propeller calculation results a line was fit to the curve to obtain a fitted straight line expression subsequently the target output thrust was identified according to equation 10 and the thrust was brought into equation 13 to obtain the speed n i 1 which was then used to calculate the thrust next the input speed was corrected and the propeller performance curve was obtained 5 the corrected performance curve and rotating speed n i 1 were then brought to the actuator disk and the rans hull calculation was run with the actuator disk information the hull resistance r i 1 and thrust t i 1 generated by the disk were then acquired 6 the hull resistance r i 1 and thrust t i 1 are checked for fulfillment of equation 10 within a set error range the convergence acceptance standard was set as r i 1 t i 1 s f c s f c 2 if the calculated results failed to converge the hull resistance r i was refreshed to r i 1 and calculations returned to step 2 7 steps 2 6 were performed iteratively until hull resistance and disk thrust converged a simplification of this complex iterative mechanism is shown in fig 17 it should be noted that the first iteration of the input flow field was the bare hull nominal wake and the input flow field of the bem code was the effective wake the difference between the apparent wake and propeller inducted velocity field 8 in the following iteration processes the induced velocity field is extracted from the calculation results of open water performance under the corresponding conditions the linear relationship between propeller rps and thrust is accepted for very small variations of the rotation speed rps however at each iteration when the resistance of the ship changes due to the presence of the body forces of previous iteration also the inflow to the propeller changes at each new iteration then the propeller operates in a different functioning conditions not only due to the updated rps to deliver the right thrust but also due to the different inflow this could worsen the assumed linearity between t and rps table 4 gives the calculated results from this method demonstrating that the final resulting error from equation 10 can be lower than 2 within the selected acceptable error range furthermore the propeller rotation speed changes in the final two steps were below 1 showing the convergence of the iterative process compared to the propeller speed calculation in villa et al 2012 these differences were very small based on these results this iterative calculation method was proven to be feasible for calculating self propulsion point solutions with the rans bem coupled body force method 6 results and discussion 6 1 ship model propulsion performance simulation results the simulated ship model propulsion results are given in table 5 these results show the three investigated methods can ensure calculation accuracy in ship model simulations the fully resolved propeller method produced the most accurate propeller efficiency results however its deviations in forecasted resistance for the hull were larger the two body force methods predicted results closer to the hull resistance test values for the propeller portion of the forecast the prescribed body force method which directly input the propeller open water curve was most accurate it can be seen that applications simply desiring the self propulsion performance without requirements for the overall modeling of the rans calculation can use the body force method to replace the propeller the results of the rans bem coupled iterative body force method did not reach the expected target potentially owing to unsatisfactory treatment of the flow field during the iterative process fig 18 shows the apparent wake flow the x axis velocity distribution behind on and after the propeller disk plane as the two body force methods produced highly similar models the figures at the middle vertical section should be similar with slight differences of surface and color depth in the high speed regions as such fig 18 the result of the body force method shows only the results from the prescribed body force method which produced more accurately flow field calculations from fig 18 a i variations in the wake map for different sections show clear velocity accelerations in the x axis flow field direction displaying good simulation of the propeller suction and curl effect fig 19 shows the longitudinal profile of the flow field behind the propeller where a similar propeller suction phenomenon was observed fig 18 b e and h show the rans mrf steady calculation results compared with the rans unsteady calculation results although the distribution of high speed regions varies due to the different propeller blade angle positions its basic distribution characteristics are similar the momentum source of the actuator disk alongside the real propeller model from the fully resolved propeller successfully simulated the effect of the propeller force on the flow field difference between actuator disk and resolved propeller with rans are acceptable since actuator disk uses only body forces the momentum source of the model along the circumference was constant the detailed force distribution of the complex five bladed propeller could not be fully simulated by the body force method using the actuator disk model the fully resolved propeller unsteady calculation results shown in fig 18 a d and g had greater asymmetric velocity distributions in the acceleration region in the chart comparing figs 18 and 19 the fully resolved propeller method could reflect the asymmetry and complexity of the flow field at the paddle disc under the action of the asymmetric five leaf propeller this demonstrates that the fully resolved propeller method has greater advantages for detailed flow field analyses 6 2 self propulsion point solution result the self propulsion factors from different calculation methods are shown in table 6 each of the three methods has its own advantages and disadvantages results demonstrated that the prescribed body force method was the most accurate with satisfactory calculation accuracy as for the propulsion efficiency η d in this paper the fully resolved propeller mrf method error was the best as its larger calculated resistance caused larger target thrusts which in turn reduced the calculation accuracy of the companion flow fraction this was primarily because the mrf algorithm which applies to the uniform flow constant calculation reduces calculation time but is associated with greater errors the propulsion efficiency η d calculated by the iterative body force method was comparatively better but still failed to reach the desired target as the prediction value of the thrust coefficient was smaller and the speed coefficient of the difference calculation was larger the prescribed body force method generally behaves better than the coupled rans bem method which in principle should account for unsteadiness one of the error sources is non optimal bem calculation in the unsteady panel method the input of effective wake field is added the velocity field and apparent wake field as the source of effective wake field are obtained by reading the velocity components of specific points on propeller inflow section in cylindrical coordinate system one of the sources of errors is that the information of wake field on section reflected by coordinate points is not detailed enough radial circumference 5 36 180 coordinate points which results in the imprecise calculation results on the other hand in order to input the results into the actuator disk the average processing of the results will also cause some errors another source of error is that the input of wake field comes from a specific disk section such as the inflow section used in this paper for the flow field in a cylindrical region near the propeller it is inaccurate to use one section to represent the whole basin in this bem code a cross section is used to represent the whole flow field near propeller which makes the input of the effective wake have some errors this extrapolation is also used to the propeller plane of self induced velocities calculated with the bem this could be a possible reasons of discrepancies since the actual flow field should be more complex the steady processing of the rans mrf algorithm ignores the asymmetry of the wake and causes errors if the rans unsteady calculation based on sliding mesh is performed the error should be much smaller s gaggero et al 2015 however computing time will increase significantly the computational error of the prescribed body force method is a result of neglecting the influence of the ship propeller interference on propeller performance in the rans bem coupled method of self propulsion point solution although the asymmetry of the wake is considered in the calculation process the error may be due to the error of bem unsteady calculation referring to the description of the previous calculation process the unsteady calculation results of bem are finally processed by averaging linear fitting to deal with the propeller performance error in the input excitation disk which affects the calculation of wake fraction thus further enlarging the data error 7 conclusion in this study the fully resolved propeller method prescribed body force method and rans bem iterative body force methods were used to predict the propulsion performance of a kcs ship model and the self propulsion factors were solved the three calculation methods were evaluated and compared generally constant calculations were conducted for the three methods to minimize the computing resource costs and ensure calculation accuracy from the flow field analysis perspective the rans method was the best for simulating the flow field details accurately reflecting flow field information in regions near the propeller and at the propeller disk in contrast the body force methods simply simulated the propeller suction and curl effects but failed to predict the full asymmetry of the flow calculation as seen from these results the body force methods could accurately predict the overall propulsion performance of the ship and solve for self propelled points the proposed rans bem iterative body force method used a constant calculation to reflect a certain extent of the unsteady calculation processes indicating this method may be valuable for research in the future it will be necessary to optimize these iterative mechanisms and focus on methods of dealing with the flow field to produce more accurate results simplifying the iterative procedure of the rans bem iterative body force method for self propulsion point calculations reducing the number of iterative steps also reduces the time of calculation the number of iterative steps required for the original iterative mechanism was the result of multiplying the product of the number of iterations for performance prediction with the number of rotating speed corrections the body force method simplifies modeling reducing the number and complexity of the required computational grid this advantage considerably decreases computing resource consumption playing an important positive role in engineering applications furthermore this method may be applied to simulate rotational motion in ship maneuvering which is important for simplifying

21934,the interactions between ships and propellers interfere with the performance of both this paper aims to discuss the current methods of modeling ship propeller interactions using computational fluid dynamics cfd the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation rans and body force methods the fully resolved propeller method with the rans solver the prescribed body force method and the boundary element method bem and rans coupled iterative body force method were used to predict the propulsive performance and calculate the self propulsion point of a kriso container ship model for the rans bem iterative body force method a new method without nesting iteration is adopted to calculate the self propulsion point an additional discussion of self propulsion factors is presented based on these results calculation results showed good agreement with model test results the rans method performs better at obtaining detailed flow field information and at analyzing the propeller plane wake fields on a propeller plane the body force method has a unique advantage in terms of computational efficiency for performance evaluations of both ships and propellers keywords cfd self propulsion rans method bem body force method coupled calculation 1 introduction hull and propeller designs should account for both isolated performance and the interactions that occur when these elements are used together numerical simulations of ship propeller interference typically utilize ship propeller fully resolved method and body force method the most intuitive method is to use integral modeling with a viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd algorithm for both the ship and the propeller where the fully resolved method solves the flow field directly using a cfd algorithm this produces more accurate results and successfully reflects detailed information unfortunately this method requires a complex mesh model which in turn necessitates an unsteady sliding mesh calculation for the propeller consuming a considerable amount of computing power the body force method uses a body force momentum source model an actuator disk model to simulate a real ship propeller a simplification from the hull propeller combination model two categories of this method can be defined iterative body force method and prescribed body force method kawamura et al 1997 and moctar 2001 the prescribed body force method is relatively simple and convenient however it lacks the requirements for propeller performance calculations and it cannot directly determine the force and pressure distribution of a propeller working behind the hull previous studies have adopted this method to calculate the self propulsion performance of a kriso container ship kcs shao hua et al 2013 noting that even when the torque was ignored the overall performance prediction results were considerably accurate the actuator disk model was also used for self propulsion assessment with comparation to rans approach with a real propeller furthermore the actuator disk technology has been widely used in the wake simulation of wind turbines and tidal turbines when the actuator disk is combined with the classical turbulence model reliable numerical results can be obtained van and sylvain 2016 the numerical results obtained using the k ε turbulence model can be compared with the experimental measurements cabezon et al 2009 crespo and hernández 1996 the performance of the standard k ε model the realizable k ε model and the reynolds stress model rsm have been evaluated and their results were compared with the experimental measurements cleijne 1992 this comparison indicated that all turbulence models can obtain satisfactory results and the rsm showed the best performance although it required a large amount of calculation some scholars successfully improved their model results by modifying the turbulence equations they aimed to simulate the dynamics of the energy generated by small vortices as air flowed through a turbine chen and kim 1987 based on the source terms of chen and kim and the standard k ε model kasmi and masson 2008 another study simulated axisymmetric flow through a horizontal axis wind turbine p e réthoré et al 2009 the numerical results were shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results obtained from another study taylor et al 1985 in terms of velocity and turbulence intensity several studies have proven the applicability of the actuator disk method based on the k ω or the k ε model in simulating wakes behind tidal devices palm et al 2010 and harrison et al 2010 a similar experiment was simulated batten et al 2013 the results showed that all turbulence models can accurately simulate the far wake i e the diameter of the turbine is greater than five times the distance however the reliability of the model can be improved when the wake is near the iterative body force method is a potential viscous flow coupling method with wider applications simonsen 2005 and vaz and bosschers 2006 in this approach propeller loading calculated by various potential methods is transformed into a body force distribution which is then imposed onto the rans computation forces are added as momentum source terms in the adopted body force model either a single plane 2d or a three dimensional 3d distribution within the swept volume of the propeller and the resulting effective wake is input into the potential code to calculate the new propeller performance where both sides are iterated until convergence this calculation method has certain advantages for grid partitioning and computing resource occupancy as well as accurate forecasting results zheng yang 2015 combined the lifting surface method pien 1961 of potential flow calculation on the propeller and viscous flow calculation for the hull to solve the self propulsion problem based on the boundary element method bem a potential viscous flow coupling method iterative body force method was used to derive detailed propeller induced velocity and volume force information for its potential flow calculation which was performed directly in the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans computational domain villa et al 2012 further research was performed by stefano gaggero et al 2017 they later performed extensive numerical validations with the available experimental measurements of the coupled bem rans approach to verify the reliability of the approach the coupled iteration mechanism is computationally efficient and accurate the blade element momentum theory bemt o brian 1969 which is very popular in aerodynamics has also been applied to potential calculations as a part of flow coupling in ships turnock et al 2011 and phillips et al 2009 the iterative body force method has begun to address special propeller calculations such as contra rotating propulsion ducted propellers and podded propellers sánchez caja et al 2015 and dominguez et al 2015 increasingly intensive research has extended the scope of application for the iterative body force method wake fraction evaluations have become a distinguishing point in this field furthermore the iterative body force method has also been applied in other fields starke and bosschers 2012 dominguez et al 2016 turnock et al 2011 and batten et al 2013 in this study the fully resolved propeller prescribed body force and rans bem coupled iterative body force methods were used to calculate the ship propulsion performance on a model scale for the bem rans coupled approach a low level unsteady bem was applied to the propeller performance calculation the singularity distribution on the surface was assumed to be uniform the inflow information needed for the bem code is not directly acquired by from the wake field in rans calculation results the velocity distribution of the wake the sum of the induced speed of the propeller and the effective wake is not the real inflow for the bem propeller calculation current practices for determining the effective wake require measuring the apparent wake in the propeller plane acquired directly from the calculation and transforming it into the effective wake field for the bem code input the bem calculation code which considers how the wake affects propeller performance was compiled in fortran the rans equation was used to calculate the viscous flow iterative computation methods were adopted to calculate the ship self propulsion point verifying the feasibility and reliability of these methods the results and advantages of these methods are compared and evaluated in this paper

which are described in table 2 3 resistance calculation for bare hull the flow field around the bare hull was simulated using the rans equation for the solution of the hull flow and the prediction of the ship s resistance the general purpose commercial rans solver starccm was used the fluid volume function vof was used for the free surface calculation as shown in figs 2 and 3 a trimmed unstructured mesh with 3 7 million grids was used to model the ship hull without rudder and fluid region for which local refinement of anisotropic meshes was conducted at the bow and stern to increase accuracy all y treatment was applied with a y value 50 across the bare hull surface the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model was adopted for the viscous fluid calculation for its advantages in the near wall region and wake simulation menter 1994 table 3 shows the comparison of the calculated resistance c t 103 of the bare hull with the test value at the speed of 2 197 m s it can be seen that the difference between the calculated value and the test value is not large which shows the accuracy of the calculation fig 4 shows a comparison of wave patterns at the design speed at the waterline surface the similarity between the numerical simulation and test results was very high shown in figs 4 and 5 indicating the rans calculation method is highly accurate for wave predictions it should be noted that the bow prediction was particularly accurate for both wave height and distribution waves after the stern of ship were slightly different but the longitudinal and horizontal waveform distributions were dissimilar after waves spread past the stern the wave height data were different but the diffusion trends were similar and height errors fell within the acceptable range a comparison of wave heights between tested and calculated results can be seen in fig 5 showing both value sets agreed well in errors and in trends this further demonstrates the high accuracy and reliability of the selected calculation method fig 6 shows the characteristics of the nominal wake field this figure shows the wake of the bare hull running in the water without a propeller the calculated results left image agree well with the test results right image shown in fig 6 which also displays a significant slowdown of x axis velocity in the flow field at the hub caused by viscous force the x axis velocity increases along the radius in fig 7 it can be seen that the speed changes rapidly near the hub but slowly near the blade edge combining with the velocity distribution of the longitudinal profile in fig 7 the flow deceleration caused by the viscous force acting on the hull can be observed this force results in the formation of the boundary layer the sensitivity analysis of fine grids as well as the different turbulence models or time discretization are beyond the scope of current analysis and are therefore not considered in this study 4 prediction of ship propulsion performance on model scale 4 1 fully resolved propeller method the integral models of both the hull and propeller were directly developed using the rans calculation the propeller portion was a real model like the hull these parts are separated by a cylindrical region partitioned into hexahedral meshes the total number of grids was 1 4 million the interface between this area and the hull flow field was divided for data exchange the speed of the hull model was 2 197 m s and the rotational speed of propeller was 9 5 r s a sliding mesh was adopted for the unsteady calculation to simulate propeller working behind the ship s hull because the inflow field to the propeller is spatially non homogeneous the axial velocity distribution at the propeller disk is shown in fig 9 the propeller produced significant suction and torsion in the flow field the high axial velocity region was concentrated at the propeller blades whereas this velocity was reduced at the blade tip and root hub the former phenomenon results from the suction force left by the tip of the propeller as the blade spins and the latter is caused by friction at the hub due to actions of real blades the axial velocity field distribution was asymmetrical and the selected algorithm simulated the real propeller model thus it can clearly show flow field details because of the non uniformity of the propeller inflow the sliding grid is suitable however this method is time consuming for the later work which needs to be iterated the calculation time of the sliding grid is obviously too long therefore the multiple reference mrf algorithm was also used for the propeller performance in this region applying the mrf enabled steady calculation resulting in savings for computing resources this approximation can save a lot of computing time and its performance prediction results can also be used for comparison when using sliding grids 4 2 prescribed body force method the prescribed body force method was based on the meshing and settings of the bare hull without propeller of the rans algorithm calculation model the body force momentum source loading of the propeller part was calculated by replacing the original real propeller mode with a virtual actuator disk model the thrust and torque applied by the propeller were input into the actuator disk and the surface load of the propeller was replaced by the effect of the actuator disk on the flow field shao hua et al 2013 the difference between the actuator disk and the real propeller used for calculation are shown in fig 10 the momentum source distribution of the actuator disk was as follows cd adapco 2012 1 f b x a x r 1 r 2 f b θ a θ r 1 r r 1 r h r h where 3 a θ 105 8 q π δ r p 3 r h 4 r p r p r h 4 a x 105 8 t π δ 3 r h 4 r p r p r h 5 r r r h 1 r h in these equations f b x and f b θ represent the axial and circumferential momentum source distributions respectively r represents the radial coordinates r h represents the hub diameter δ represents the thickness of the actuator disk a x and a θ are constant numbers r p represents the propeller radius and r h and r represent the dimensionless hub radius and dimensionless radial coordinates respectively these equations show that the body force source of the excitation plate model is a function of the radial coordinate r implying the distribution does not change in the axial or circumferential directions to complete these calculations the specific force application process was to directly input the open water performance curve of a kp505 propeller into the actuator disk this allowed the actuator disk to produce appropriate forces and torques according to the flow through the disk speed simulating self propulsion fig 11 shows the axial velocity profile at the propeller disk u 2 197 m s and n 9 5 r s the high speed region in the figure shows the pumping effect of the actuator disk on the flow field when comparing the nominal flow field symmetry of the bare hull with refe 1rence to the projection line y 0 in this figure the overall flow field displays a certain degree of right handedness showing the torsion effect of the actuator disk model on the flow field this indicates the actuator disk model simulated simultaneous suction and torsion in the flow field as are observed in real propellers showing it possible for this model to replace the real propeller 4 3 rans bem coupled body force method the open water performance of propellers differs greatly from their performance when affected by flow fields in the previous section 4 2 the effect of the flow field on propeller performance was not considered the remainder of this section addresses that issue using the rans bem coupled body force method which simultaneously applies the bare hull used in rans and actuator disk models unlike section 4 2 the actuator disk model data here was not the water performance curve but instead the unsteady performance curve the propeller calculation result which considers the wake flow field influence propeller performance in the rans bem coupled body force method was calculated using the unsteady boundary element method bem whereas the hull and surrounding flow field were calculated with the rans method the former calculation requires the wake field calculation result from the rans equation and the latter requires the performance from the actuator disk model the following subsections iteratively calculate these two processes until convergence thus simulating the process of ship propulsion 4 3 1 boundary element method bem the fluid inside the basin was assumed to be free of rotation inviscid and incompressible as inflow was non uniform for the propeller influenced by the wake flow field the velocity of the flow could be described as v a x y z t the perturbation velocity vector of the propeller could be described by the perturbation velocity potential φ t which satisfies the laplace equation 6 2 φ t 0 according to green s third formula perturbation velocity potentials can be represented by the surface distribution of sources and dipoles the relevant boundary conditions must also be considered kinematic boundary conditions and the condition that perturbation speed fades to zero at infinity the above conditions and formulas may be combined to produce the following formula 7 s b ϕ q n q 1 r p q d s s w δ ϕ q n q 1 1 r p q 1 d s s b v 0 n q 1 r p q d s 2 π ϕ p where s b and s w represent the surface of the object and the tail vortex respectively p represents a field point q represents a point on the surface of the area boundary and q 1 represents a point on the surface of the tail vortex the propeller surface and tail vortex were divided into multiple facets equation 7 was divided into elements to describe the resulting boundary the kutta condition was considered for edges acquiring numerical results for each time step of this unsteady calculation each propeller blade surface was divided into 20 equal parts in each direction such that the discretized surface mesh consisted of 800 panel elements for each blade the vortex was linearly modeled and trapped by the trailing edge of the blade the trailing vortical wake extended for two complete revolutions and was discretized with a time equivalent to the 6 angular step as shown in fig 12 the results calculated by this bem code proved feasible in comparison with hoshino 1989 the kp505 open water performance calculation results are shown in fig 13 where k t k q and η are the calculated propeller thrust coefficient torque coefficient and propeller efficiency values respectively and k t0 k q0 and η 0 are the corresponding test values this figure shows that the overall accuracy of the calculation was relatively high with errors between the calculated and test values of 5 when the advance coefficient j was in the range of 0 5 0 85 the errors at low j values in fig 13 are mainly attributable to the wake alignment and to the leading edge suction force the unsteady bem calculation results changed constantly according to the time step this paper acquired the propeller performance curve from the average values of each rotation period this performance data was entered into the actuator disk model to simulate the propeller effects in the hull rans calculation 4 3 2 potential viscous flow coupled iterative mechanism the classical assumption of unbounded non rotational flow generally valid for propeller design and analysis using simplified potential flow based theories is typically not applicable for propellers operating behind a hull for these conditions the flow field on the propeller disk is not the simple sum of the nominal flow field and propeller induced velocity field instead complex interactions occur in which suction from the propeller alters the original flow field and the flow field in turn alters propeller performance the disk flow field following a ship is the sum of the hull propeller interaction velocity field the effective wake and the propeller induced velocity field produced by propeller rotation rijpkema et al 2013 as shown in equation 8 from the perspective of the propeller this effect wake its wake fraction distribution is the data that should be used as input conditions for the unsteady bem code 8 v t o t a l v e f f e c t i v e v i n d u c e d the viscous potential flow calculation coupling iterative method was applied for this purpose the propeller was solved using the potential flow method and the force and moment information calculated for the propeller were brought into the rans hull field the rans method was then used to calculate the hull field with an actuator disk in place of the propeller the following is the iterative mechanism for calculating potential and viscous flow coupling see fig 14 this iterative process requires special processing in the companion field for iteration the effective wake distribution input is the actuator disk result for the apparent wake field minus the induced velocity field of the propeller described by equation 8 the feasibility of the proposed method can be verified by observing the convergence of the results shown in fig 15 u 2 197 m s and n 9 5 r s as shown in fig 15 t q and r t s p represent the calculated propeller thrust torque and hull resistance respectively as the first iteration calculated a bare hull without actuator disk no thrust torque or other propeller performance results were produced it was thus excluded from fig 15 the convergence criterion is that the change in value of the last two steps is less than 5 of the previous result the convergence was achieved at seven steps 5 self propulsion point solution according to the similarity theorem geometric and movement similarities must be fulfilled simultaneously to fully simulate the working state of a self propelled ship this means that the froude number and reynolds number need to meet the same between the model and the full scale version unfortunately it is difficult to achieve equivalent reynolds numbers meaning total resistance fails to fulfill the similar relationship requirement to overcome this contradiction a friction correction value sfc was introduced as shown in equation 9 9 s f c r t m ρ m ρ s r s λ 3 where r t m and ρ m represent hull resistance and water density respectively on the model scale ρ s and r s represent hull resistance and water density respectively for the full scale version and λ represents the scale ratio from real scale to model scale after the sfc was introduced according to the state of self propulsion force balance the force on the ship should fulfill the following relationship 10 t r t s p s f c in this study the sfc was 30 25 n the calculation results from the previous section 4 3 2 using a propeller speed n 9 5 r s and ship speed u 2 197 m s failed to satisfy equation 10 for this section the ship speed was fixed and the rotating speed of the propeller was changed to fulfill equation 10 and calculate the self propulsion point 5 1 self propulsion point solution of fully resolved propeller method and prescribed body force method the process of solving the self propulsion point is iterative for the fully resolved propeller approach if the sliding grid is selected for unsteady computation in the iteration process the computational resources consumed are too large although mrf is rather rough because of the non uniformity of the propeller inflow it does save a lot of computing resources and has greater engineering significance the emphasis of this paper is to discuss the simplified algorithm therefore the fully resolved propeller approach uses the constant calculation of the mrf using the fully resolved propeller and prescribed body force methods the propeller actuator disk and hull calculation results can be acquired directly when determining these calculation results the rotating speed can be adjusted directly for a fixed ship speed to produce corresponding calculation results that fulfill equation 10 changes in the thrust and torque output can be small for small range propeller speed adjustments if this adjustment range is sufficiently small the propeller actuator disk rotational speed n and its output thrust t can be approximated to satisfy the required linear relationship then according to a given n 9 5 r s the rotation speed can be changed in a small range to n to calculate the corresponding thrust t according to equation 10 a target thrust can be acquired through this process the propeller speed n the output of the target thrust can be obtained by linear interpolation as the assumption was approximated there will be errors in the resulting output the error range of these results can be reduced by iterative calculation thus values for the bare hull axial resistance and propeller disk thrust that satisfy equation 10 within the specified error range for the utilized rotating speed n are obtained thus the iterative process for these two methods is as follows see fig 16 5 2 self propulsion point solution of rans bem coupled body force method if the method described in the previous section was used to calculate the self propulsion point solution for the rans bem coupled body force method nested iterations will result as the rans bem coupled body force method also performs iterations this cumbersome calculation process consumes excessive amounts of computation times and resources as such a new iteration mechanism was required to calculate the rans bem coupled body force method self propulsion point propeller performance curves can be approximated as a straight line when their j is relatively large typically 0 5 as shown in fig 8 the straight line obtained by linear fitting for the kp505 propeller may have an error of less than 5 relative to test results with especially small data errors in high advance coefficient regions j 0 5 under these conditions the straight line approximation of test results can be expressed as follows 11 k t a v a n d b where a and b are coefficient values that can be simulated by bem and the rotation speed n is a variable that must be calculated the dimensionless formula equation can change as follows 12 k t n 2 t ρ d 4 where the water density ρ and propeller diameter d are known and t represents the propeller thrust combining these two expressions produces 13 b n 2 a v a d n t ρ d 4 0 the above equation is a unitary quadratic equation the fitting line expression can be acquired from the propeller performance curve by bem code the rotating speed n could be acquired from this unitary quadratic equation in combination with the fitting line expression and propeller target thrust t for the rans bem coupled body force method self propulsion point solution the iterative mechanism was as follows 1 the overall bare hull viscous flow field was calculated using the rans solver the hull resistance r i was thus acquired 2 the propeller plane spatial nonuniform velocity field was extracted using the rans computation the effective wake field as the inflow for the unsteady computation using the propeller panel method was obtained by extracting this velocity field and subtracting the corresponding induced velocity field readings according to equation 8 3 the inlet velocity was fixed and the rotation speed n i was varied to calculate the unsteady performance of the propeller the unsteady results were averaged by time 4 a performance curve was acquired from the propeller calculation results a line was fit to the curve to obtain a fitted straight line expression subsequently the target output thrust was identified according to equation 10 and the thrust was brought into equation 13 to obtain the speed n i 1 which was then used to calculate the thrust next the input speed was corrected and the propeller performance curve was obtained 5 the corrected performance curve and rotating speed n i 1 were then brought to the actuator disk and the rans hull calculation was run with the actuator disk information the hull resistance r i 1 and thrust t i 1 generated by the disk were then acquired 6 the hull resistance r i 1 and thrust t i 1 are checked for fulfillment of equation 10 within a set error range the convergence acceptance standard was set as r i 1 t i 1 s f c s f c 2 if the calculated results failed to converge the hull resistance r i was refreshed to r i 1 and calculations returned to step 2 7 steps 2 6 were performed iteratively until hull resistance and disk thrust converged a simplification of this complex iterative mechanism is shown in fig 17 it should be noted that the first iteration of the input flow field was the bare hull nominal wake and the input flow field of the bem code was the effective wake the difference between the apparent wake and propeller inducted velocity field 8 in the following iteration processes the induced velocity field is extracted from the calculation results of open water performance under the corresponding conditions the linear relationship between propeller rps and thrust is accepted for very small variations of the rotation speed rps however at each iteration when the resistance of the ship changes due to the presence of the body forces of previous iteration also the inflow to the propeller changes at each new iteration then the propeller operates in a different functioning conditions not only due to the updated rps to deliver the right thrust but also due to the different inflow this could worsen the assumed linearity between t and rps table 4 gives the calculated results from this method demonstrating that the final resulting error from equation 10 can be lower than 2 within the selected acceptable error range furthermore the propeller rotation speed changes in the final two steps were below 1 showing the convergence of the iterative process compared to the propeller speed calculation in villa et al 2012 these differences were very small based on these results this iterative calculation method was proven to be feasible for calculating self propulsion point solutions with the rans bem coupled body force method 6 results and discussion 6 1 ship model propulsion performance simulation results the simulated ship model propulsion results are given in table 5 these results show the three investigated methods can ensure calculation accuracy in ship model simulations the fully resolved propeller method produced the most accurate propeller efficiency results however its deviations in forecasted resistance for the hull were larger the two body force methods predicted results closer to the hull resistance test values for the propeller portion of the forecast the prescribed body force method which directly input the propeller open water curve was most accurate it can be seen that applications simply desiring the self propulsion performance without requirements for the overall modeling of the rans calculation can use the body force method to replace the propeller the results of the rans bem coupled iterative body force method did not reach the expected target potentially owing to unsatisfactory treatment of the flow field during the iterative process fig 18 shows the apparent wake flow the x axis velocity distribution behind on and after the propeller disk plane as the two body force methods produced highly similar models the figures at the middle vertical section should be similar with slight differences of surface and color depth in the high speed regions as such fig 18 the result of the body force method shows only the results from the prescribed body force method which produced more accurately flow field calculations from fig 18 a i variations in the wake map for different sections show clear velocity accelerations in the x axis flow field direction displaying good simulation of the propeller suction and curl effect fig 19 shows the longitudinal profile of the flow field behind the propeller where a similar propeller suction phenomenon was observed fig 18 b e and h show the rans mrf steady calculation results compared with the rans unsteady calculation results although the distribution of high speed regions varies due to the different propeller blade angle positions its basic distribution characteristics are similar the momentum source of the actuator disk alongside the real propeller model from the fully resolved propeller successfully simulated the effect of the propeller force on the flow field difference between actuator disk and resolved propeller with rans are acceptable since actuator disk uses only body forces the momentum source of the model along the circumference was constant the detailed force distribution of the complex five bladed propeller could not be fully simulated by the body force method using the actuator disk model the fully resolved propeller unsteady calculation results shown in fig 18 a d and g had greater asymmetric velocity distributions in the acceleration region in the chart comparing figs 18 and 19 the fully resolved propeller method could reflect the asymmetry and complexity of the flow field at the paddle disc under the action of the asymmetric five leaf propeller this demonstrates that the fully resolved propeller method has greater advantages for detailed flow field analyses 6 2 self propulsion point solution result the self propulsion factors from different calculation methods are shown in table 6 each of the three methods has its own advantages and disadvantages results demonstrated that the prescribed body force method was the most accurate with satisfactory calculation accuracy as for the propulsion efficiency η d in this paper the fully resolved propeller mrf method error was the best as its larger calculated resistance caused larger target thrusts which in turn reduced the calculation accuracy of the companion flow fraction this was primarily because the mrf algorithm which applies to the uniform flow constant calculation reduces calculation time but is associated with greater errors the propulsion efficiency η d calculated by the iterative body force method was comparatively better but still failed to reach the desired target as the prediction value of the thrust coefficient was smaller and the speed coefficient of the difference calculation was larger the prescribed body force method generally behaves better than the coupled rans bem method which in principle should account for unsteadiness one of the error sources is non optimal bem calculation in the unsteady panel method the input of effective wake field is added the velocity field and apparent wake field as the source of effective wake field are obtained by reading the velocity components of specific points on propeller inflow section in cylindrical coordinate system one of the sources of errors is that the information of wake field on section reflected by coordinate points is not detailed enough radial circumference 5 36 180 coordinate points which results in the imprecise calculation results on the other hand in order to input the results into the actuator disk the average processing of the results will also cause some errors another source of error is that the input of wake field comes from a specific disk section such as the inflow section used in this paper for the flow field in a cylindrical region near the propeller it is inaccurate to use one section to represent the whole basin in this bem code a cross section is used to represent the whole flow field near propeller which makes the input of the effective wake have some errors this extrapolation is also used to the propeller plane of self induced velocities calculated with the bem this could be a possible reasons of discrepancies since the actual flow field should be more complex the steady processing of the rans mrf algorithm ignores the asymmetry of the wake and causes errors if the rans unsteady calculation based on sliding mesh is performed the error should be much smaller s gaggero et al 2015 however computing time will increase significantly the computational error of the prescribed body force method is a result of neglecting the influence of the ship propeller interference on propeller performance in the rans bem coupled method of self propulsion point solution although the asymmetry of the wake is considered in the calculation process the error may be due to the error of bem unsteady calculation referring to the description of the previous calculation process the unsteady calculation results of bem are finally processed by averaging linear fitting to deal with the propeller performance error in the input excitation disk which affects the calculation of wake fraction thus further enlarging the data error 7 conclusion in this study the fully resolved propeller method prescribed body force method and rans bem iterative body force methods were used to predict the propulsion performance of a kcs ship model and the self propulsion factors were solved the three calculation methods were evaluated and compared generally constant calculations were conducted for the three methods to minimize the computing resource costs and ensure calculation accuracy from the flow field analysis perspective the rans method was the best for simulating the flow field details accurately reflecting flow field information in regions near the propeller and at the propeller disk in contrast the body force methods simply simulated the propeller suction and curl effects but failed to predict the full asymmetry of the flow calculation as seen from these results the body force methods could accurately predict the overall propulsion performance of the ship and solve for self propelled points the proposed rans bem iterative body force method used a constant calculation to reflect a certain extent of the unsteady calculation processes indicating this method may be valuable for research in the future it will be necessary to optimize these iterative mechanisms and focus on methods of dealing with the flow field to produce more accurate results simplifying the iterative procedure of the rans bem iterative body force method for self propulsion point calculations reducing the number of iterative steps also reduces the time of calculation the number of iterative steps required for the original iterative mechanism was the result of multiplying the product of the number of iterations for performance prediction with the number of rotating speed corrections the body force method simplifies modeling reducing the number and complexity of the required computational grid this advantage considerably decreases computing resource consumption playing an important positive role in engineering applications furthermore this method may be applied to simulate rotational motion in ship maneuvering which is important for simplifying
