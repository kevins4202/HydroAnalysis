23795,storm surge is the anomalous rising of the sea surface induced by intense atmospheric disturbances the storm surge caused by tropical cyclones often causes great socio economic human activity and life and property hazards to coastal areas in terms of research resource consumption and computational time machine learning algorithms that depend on data driven strong nonlinear mapping skills outperform standard numerical model forecasting to obtain a lighter and faster storm surge shortcoming forecast we use a deep learning based single station water level prediction model for a storm surge at several locations in this work in contrast to earlier research this study employs convolutional neural networks to extract two dimensional wind field information and merge them with local water level features to produce a more time efficient intelligent forecast keywords storm surge deep learning intelligent forecasting data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction storm surges are coastal phenomena in which the ocean water level rises dramatically due to intense atmospheric disturbances as may be caused by temperate cyclones cold waves and tropical cyclone tc forcing needham et al 2015 kohno et al 2018 and is often accompanied by torrential rain and flooding wu et al 2018 lai et al 2021 qiang et al 2021 although a global phenomenon storm surge is particularly severe in china as they consistently rank at the top of the nation s oceanographic disasters due to its large number of landfalling tcs extremely long coastline 18 000 km 54 coastal cities and such accounts for nearly half the national population and total gross domestic product shi et al 2013 2020b feng et al 2021 wang et al 2021a consequently precise and rapid storm surge forecasts are urgently required and are crucial for safeguarding both the lives and livelihoods of millions of people takagi et al 2018 shi et al 2020a traditionally storm surge forecasting methods can be subdivided into empirical statistical and numerical model based methodologies with increasing computing power and storage capacity numerical models are widely used in studying storm surges as a phenomenon their effects on both natural and human environments and their responses to storm surges e g pan and liu 2020 widely used is the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national hurricane center nhc and other departments sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh model to study tc induced storm surge based on different storm paths and intensity thereby provided storm surge probability and maximum possible water gain products glahn et al 2009 within the literature liu et al 2022 used a hydrodynamic model to assess tc induced compound flood risk in haikou city china and found that coastal areas are major floodplains with the severity of inundation being positively correlated with storm tide heights using a coupled high resolution advanced circulation adcirc and simulating waves nearshore swan model yin et al 2017 investigated the effects of sea level rise slr and typhoon intensification ti on storm surge and waves in china s pearl river estuary and showed that ti had a greater effect on storm surge though slr was more significant on waves within the estuary similarly chi and rong 2021 investigated extreme storm surges by simulating 98 typhoons between 1987 and 2018 using the coupled adcirc swan model and found that wave setup could be responsible for 2 12 5 of the 50 year extreme surge level important for the current discussion by simulating results using the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom li et al 2022 reported that storm surge during typhoon chan hom in the macro tidal hangzhou bay was related to both tides and wind field but tides dominated although numerical models are widely used in scientific investigations of storm surge and early warning systems e g harley et al 2016 they are expensive in terms of required computational cost the expertise required to set up evaluate run and analyze and time to overcome these and other issues artificial intelligence ai may be a solution that shows great potential in forecasting and model parameter estimation zhu et al 2022 xie et al 2021 numerical models are rapidly being supplemented with and supplanted by ai methodologies for storm surge forecasting tadesse et al 2020 early lee 2006 rajasekaran et al 2008 and hashemi et al 2016 used inputs of tc wind speed wind direction and pressure into artificial neural networks anns and support vector regression svr for storm surge forecasts chao et al 2020 used ann and effective typhoon parameters for storm surge predictions but also considered the introduction of a knowledge extraction method with backward tracking and forward exploration procedures to analyze the roles of hidden neurons and typhoon parameters in said predictions the authors found that while excellent results were achieved in hour ahead predictions accuracy over longer lead times 12 h can be achieved when the general pattern of maximum storm surge under various scenarios is acquired in dealing with storm surge forecasting problems these and other works have used statistical methods or combined machine learning with numerical models to decompose and integrate tc properties such as minimum central pressure and maximum central one dimension into one cohesive variable and then used backpropagation bp neural networks or rnns for forecasting despite the relative quantity of successful examples of these methodologies signal to noise ratios increase when two dimensional and intense atmospheric input variables are decomposed and integrated into one variable thus leaving room for improvement convolutional neural networks cnns provide powerful tools to overcome these issues and are being increasingly used in the forecasting of typhoon intensities and even storm surges for example wimmers et al 2019 proposed a deepmicronet model using a deep learning cnn model to estimate tc intensity using satellite images in different wavebands pradhan et al 2018 designed a deep cnn structure for tc intensity classification using a graphics processing unit the model obtained a higher accuracy and lower root mean square error than using only satellite images lee et al 2019 proposed a cnn based tc intensity estimation method to analyze the intensity characteristics of multispectral satellite tc images zhang et al 2019 proposed a two branch cnn tc intensity estimation model based on infrared and water vapor images and a preliminary study found that the model performed best under the tropical storm and super typhoon categories wang et al 2021b used and compared a cnn long short term memory lstm and joint cnn lstm networks for surge level forecasting results indicated that based on 11 years of sea level and wind data cnn and lstm were each superior to svr and multilayer perceptron models but when combined lstm cnn and cnn lstm models allowed for accuracy improvements of 10 at all forecasting steps tiggeloven et al 2021 used anns cnns and the joint convlstm to construct neural network nn ensembles at 736 global tide stations and found that lstm generally outperforms the other nn models additionally the authors also found that while the addition of predictands for storm surge forecasts improved performance this came at the cost of greater computation time to take advantage of cnn strengths in tc feature extraction and bp and rnn strengths in forecasting this study uses a cnn to extract two dimensional wind field features directly and fuse them with tide level time series for forecasting water levels at several stations at the pearl river estuary in china similar to the study conducted by ayyad et al 2022 this study also uses a large number of physics based numerical simulations to generate a large dataset for cnn model training the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the utilized data and methodology section 3 concerns itself with the main findings of this study section 4 gives a discussion and section 5 concludes 2 data and methodology 2 1 data 2 1 1 numerical model data to generate storm surge test and training datasets fvcom a nearshore ocean circulation model is used chen et al 2006a b fvcom is an unstructured grid finite volume 3d primitive equation turbulent closure coastal model and is widely used to investigate the impact that typhoons have on marine environments chu et al 2019 cong et al 2021 tang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the finite volume method which combines the characteristics of finite difference and finite element models can be fitted to complex shore boundaries in shallow waters and facilitate discrete discretization of the original set of dynamical equations thus ensuring high computational efficiency the computational format can better ensure mass conservation for computational problems with complex topographic shore boundaries irregular non overlapping triangular meshes are used in the horizontal direction which can easily fit complex boundaries and perform local encryption here the pearl river and adjacent east china sea ecs enclosed by 21 2 n 23 2 n and 112 8 e 114 8 e is set as the model simulation area fig 1 with the model covering 116 typhoons from 1958 2018 the horizontal resolution of the triangular grid is 5 km for the open boundary and shelf area the grid resolution is 200 m for the nearshore area as well as the intertidal area extending about 10 km landward the land elevation and bathymetric topographic data were obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco dataset kapoor 1981 with a spatial resolution of 10 min the modeled area grid has a total of 53 058 nodes and 104 850 elements with 10 nodes for the river open boundary and 198 nodes for the outer sea open boundary a dry and wet grid processing module is introduced to accurately simulate the high and low tide processes of nearshore mudflats and intertidal zones fvcom is forced by time varying winds and barometric pressure at the sea surface with tides sea surface height and inverse pressure effects due to barometric pressure changes set on the open boundary sea surface wind and barometric pressure data during 1958 1978 and 1979 2018 are derived from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 and national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 global reanalysis datasets respectively sea surface winds are interpolated to the model grid elements while barometric pressures are interpolated to the model grid nodes ecmwf data can be acquired at https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data

tpxo7 2 forecasted tidal heights runoff data added on the river open boundaries are derived from the monthly average climatic state runoff data measured at the mainstream and major tributary hydrological stations of the pearl river the model is uniformly divided into 10 layers in the vertical direction and the time step is 12 s for the inner mode and 1 2 s for the outer mode with an hourly output of coastal sea surface height flow field and beaching processes 2 1 2 in situ observations to verify the accuracy of the historical storm surge dataset generated by the fvcom model it is also necessary to validate it with actual site measurements the university of hawaii sea level center uhslc plays a variety of roles in supporting real time ocean operations and climate and ocean research for assimilation of numerical models calibration of satellite altimeter data production of marine products and research on a variety of time scales from interdecadal climate fluctuations to short term extreme events it contains many tide gauge records the most prominent of which is the gloss core network gcn tide gauge record which consists of nearly 300 tide gauge stations that provide tidal data at 1 hour or 1 day intervals in this study the hong kong station data with a 1 hour interval in the uhslc dataset is selected as the model result validation data with the starting year of 1986 and the longitude and latitude of the station at 114 22 e 22 30 n 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 convolutional neural network in order to enable the machine learning model to obtain both the typhoon intensity information in the atmosphere and the tidal signal at the local area this study inputs water level time series based on cnn output the consequent features are extracted using a fully connected layer fig 2 in the convolution process the input tensor size is set to 128 128 12 where the 12 channels contain both longitudinal and latitudinal wind speeds with a time span of 6 h each the convolution process generally uses 3 3 convolution kernels as well as 2 2 maximum pooling layers and two successive convolutions were performed before each pooling layer to obtain a larger perceptual field with fewer parameters a 24 hour water level sequence input is added before the fully connected layer of the regular convolutional network and this input will enter the fully connected layer together with the feature maps obtained from the straightened convolution to ensure that the machine learning model obtains the correct data relationships during training the wind field inputs for the training and validation sets used are consistent with the model driven wind field while the hour by hour sea surface height results from the fvcom model output are used as the true values for the neural network the length of the output water level time series is chosen to be 72 h to ensure the quality of the forecast and to explore the timeliness of the forecast we adopted and applied the model to three stations namely hong kong hk zhuhai zh and shenzhen sz stations with the locations marked in fig 1 the architecture of the convolution process is a linear stack of depth wise separable convolution layers with residual connections this makes the architecture very easy to define and modify chollet 2017 this structure is utilized on the one hand to ensure that the model extracts wind field features efficiently and on the other hand to prevent features from being lost in numerous convolutions separable convolutions consist of first performing a depth wise spatial convolution which acts on each input channel separately followed by a pointwise convolution that mixes the resulting output channels the selection of 6 hour wind data as the input is based on a series of sensitivity experiments not shown in which different temporal lengths of the input data are tested and the 6 hour input is found to be the best choice from the physical perspective as we know well the water level rise during a storm surge could be caused by three reasons ekman transport wind disturbed gravity wave and astronomical spring tides storm surges caused by ekman transport are controlled by the along shore wind direction along the wind direction when the shore is on its right the wind could cause the sea level rise by the shoreward ekman transport which can be identified by the wind direction therefore the temporal length for the wind input is not required but the gravity wave disturbed by the storm needs a certain time to propagate from the disturbance point to the location of interest for a gravity wave the wave crest causes the water level to rise while the trough of the wave causes the water level to decrease roughly estimated the distance between the southeast corner of the model domain and the zh site is approximately 170 km in the model domain the water depth changes from 10 to 85 m and then the average is 13 m so the mean speed of baroclinic gravity wave in the model domain g h is approximately 2 m s the barotropic gravity wave with speed g h is approximately 11 m s and then it will take about 6 7 h for the mixture of barotropic and baroclinic gravity wave to travel from the corner 114 8 e 21 2 n to zh site therefore 6 hour wind data is needed to generate an accurate prediction the feature maps obtained from the convolution are linked to a fully connected layer i e a layer in which the neurons between the two layers are fully connected and the weights of the neurons are initially given randomly as are the weights of the convolutional kernel and are optimized during training unlike the fully connected layer in traditional cnns the fully connected layer in this study does not only receive the spreading and straightening feature maps as input but also connects the water level time series features of the past hours the feature maps from the convolutional pooling are flattened and stretched into sequences which are simply combined with the new input water level sequences and then passed through the fully connected layer the relu activation is used between the fully connected layers but no activation function is used in the output layer the principle of the fully connected layer is shown in eq 1 1 y i r e l u j 1 n w i j x j b i where w j i denotes the current layer s first j neuron of the current layer and the next layer s i th weight between the first neuron of the current layer and the first neuron of the next layer x j denotes the value of the current layer j th value of the first neuron of the current layer n denotes the number of neurons in the current layer and b i denotes represents the bias of the i th neuron in the next layer relu is the activation function and y i is the value of i th neuron in the next layers the fully connected layer accumulates the neuron values by multiplying them with the corresponding weights and then adding bias after the activation function to finally obtain the values of the corresponding neurons in the next layer the fully connected layer integrates the features by matrix multiplication and then relies on the activation function to increase the nonlinear expressiveness of the model the fully connected layer can effectively reduce the feature dimensionality filter the learned high dimensional features and keep the most favorable features for the model which makes the impact of redundant information on the model reduced effectively improving the accuracy of the model and also reducing the number of operations and speeding up the model operation 2 2 2 model performance metrics to describe the difference between the results generated by the deep learning model and the results of the fvcom model this paper uses the root mean square error rmse to evaluate while the correlation coefficient corr is used to measure the linear relationship between the deep learning model forecasts and the results of the fvcom model the specific expressions are as follows 2 corr t 1 n h g t h g h p t h p t 1 n h g t h g 2 t 1 n h p t h p 2 3 rmse 1 n t 1 n h g t h p t 2 where h g t h p t are the true and predicted values at moment t respectively h g and h p are the sample averages of the true and forecast values respectively and n is the total number of hours in the sample here it is important to note that during fvcom model validation the true values are the uhslc station observations and forecast values are the fvcom model output however in evaluating the cnn model fvcom simulations are held as true values and the forecast values are the cnn predictions 3 results 3 1 fvcom model validation we used the measured data of uhslc at the hk station for comparison in order to assess the capability of fvcom to replicate historical typhoon cases fig 3 shows the simulated water level and uhslc station observations during typhoon helen which is a more representative example of the simulation effect of the typhoon process helen is typhoon no 8 in 1995 which made landfall in hong kong on august 12 of that year and caused high winds and water increase in the nearby area fvcom nearly replicated the actual change in water level at the station for the prediction of water level at the hk station the largest tidal difference occurs on the 11th the day before the typhoon officially makes landfall with a tidal difference of more than two meters and on the following 12 th and there is also a tidal difference of almost two meters which is reproduced by the fvcom simulation on the 13 th and 14 th the intensity of the typhoon weakened after landfall and the water level at the station dropped back both of which were also reproduced in the simulation results with a corr of 0 96 and an rmse of 0 14 m we compared all the fvcom simulations after 1986 with the actual data from uhslc and the average corr is 0 94 and rmse is 0 17 m therefore the example selected for display is relatively close to the average of the fvcom simulations this level of corr and rmse also indicates that these historical typhoon conditions simulated by fvcom are close to the real ones and can be used as a network model training for deep learning the results of all fvcom generated storm surge processes are used for training validation or testing of the cnn models in addition to focusing on the overall simulation effect of the model we should also focus on the data performance in the test set eight typhoon cases were randomly selected as the test data set about 10 of the total data and their information is listed in table 1 the eight randomly selected typhoons are hope kompasu mac lynn kammuri brendan gerald and victor some of these typhoons are well simulated such as kammuri and victor with a corr of 0 97 and an rmse of 0 13 m which are good compared to the remaining typhoons we have simulated the worst simulated typhoon is typhoon gerald with a corr of 0 88 and rmse of 0 18 m the poor simulation in this case may be due to the unusual track of this typhoon although it was a typhoon that originated in the south china sea it did not hit directly near the pearl river estuary s coast it traveled through the south china sea in an s pattern over seven days from its generation to landing initially traveling eastward it abruptly veered to the northwest and directly struck the pearl river estuary this process may cause some difficulties in the simulation despite the fact that this inaccuracy is larger than a few other cases we think it still falls within the acceptable range the average corr of these test set data is 0 93 and the rmse is 0 16 m so the simulation level of the randomly selected test set is almost the same as the level of the whole data set and the performance level of the deep learning model in the test set can represent the performance level of the model in the whole data the preceding section mainly assesses the capacity of model simulation for storm tides and the following section is about fvcom s simulation of storm surges the maximum surges in 57 typhoon cases from fvcom are compared with observed data at hongkong station fig 4 the correlation coefficient is 0 72 and rmse is 0 24 m generally the fvcom reproduces the sea level rise it should be noticed that there is no data assimilation in the model so one should expect deviations between the model results and the observational data when the maximum surges are larger the deviations between the fvcom simulation and the observational data are also larger noting this phenomenon we further assess the capacity of the numerical simulations for storm surges and show 6 cases in fig 5 the fvcom can accurately predict the phase of the storm surge from these several cases in some cases such as no 1208 and 1822 the numerical model cannot hindcast such large surges in summary fvcom can accurately predict the amplitude and phase of the storm surge in general cases and the errors of fvcom simulation which is used to generate training data and transfer learning data are within the acceptable range in network training both training and validation datasets use hourly fvcom ssh output and the corresponding model forcing wind field since the model uses an irregular triangular grid we interpolate it to a regular grid of 128 128 points in order to facilitate convolutional operations before feeding it to the cnn which allows for lower computational expense increases in model training and computation speeds while maintaining little difference in resolution as compared to original model output although each typhoon that affected the study area over the past 60 years is simulated fewer than 100 sample cases are acquired and this is insufficient to train a deep learning model to expand the dataset s size each process of obtaining a 72 hour water level sequence from a 6 hour wind field plus a 24 hour water level sequence as input is used to generate a training or prediction sample for machine learning this increases the training sample size by a factor of nearly 100 and does not require significant additional computational resources to compute more model results as all training data are as close to realistic and physically meaningful as possible in this study more than 7600 samples are generated from the 79 historical typhoon landfall events simulated of which the samples generated from the first 71 typhoon landfall events are used for training and validation and they are split into training and validation sets in the ratio of 8 1 the remaining samples not used for training or validation are used as the test set making the ratio of training validation and test sets about 8 1 1 study the keras chollet 2015 framework is used to build the model the loss function used is the mean absolute error mae and the optimization is adam kingma and ba 2014 and training is stopped until the loss value of the validation set no longer decreased the trained model is used in the test set for prediction and the results obtained are shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows cnn s forecast results of storm surge with the lead time of 6 12 18 and 24 h for a typhoon case in which the remaining storm surge results are presented after the astronomical tide is removed cnn s corr can reach 0 95 for the 6 hour forecast and its rmse is under 0 08 m cnn is able to keep the rmse at 0 07 m 0 08 m and the corr at a level greater than 0 90 for forecasts that are with a lead time of 12 or 18 h the rmse can still be kept at 0 08 m for the forecast that is made 24 h in advance despite the corr being reduced to 0 89 in general the cnn model is accurate in predicting the changing trend of storm surges and peak water levels with the increase of the forecast lead time the cnn forecast results will have some phase deviation even peak delay as shown in fig 6 d to further assess the forecasting capability of the model this study also statistically evaluates the overall forecast timeliness of the model in the test set in terms of both corr and rmse fig 7 shows the results of this evaluation and it shows that the forecast performance of the cnn model declines slowly over time the decay of the correlation coefficient with time and decay of the correlation coefficient and the increase of the rmse with time show a paragraph like variation specifically the slow decay of the forecast performance from 1 12 h the most rapid drop in forecast performance occurs after 12 h but the forecast stabilizes at a good level again after 15 h and our model maintains a correlation coefficient greater than 0 89 and an average rmse of less than 0 08 m even for the 24 hour forecast the model can be considered to provide more accurate forecasting results within 12 h and still has some reference value in 24 hour forecasting the above results and discussion show that the model achieves good performance results for the hong kong station but we still need to pay attention to whether it has similar or better performance for other stations we chose two more stations on the two sides of the pearl river zh and sz in fig 1 for model training using the same settings as the hk station but samples are reshuffled before training the wind field inputs water level inputs and outputs are also similar to those used for the hong kong station except that the water level data are used as the local results of the model water level forecasts respectively as shown in fig 8 high accurate are also obtained for the forecasts at both stations after the model is migrated to learn at both stations separately overall the forecast performance of the model at both stations also shows a decreasing trend in paragraphs with the forecast duration and since the rmse obtained by both shows a staggered increasing trend with little difference it can be considered that the difference in the forecast timeliness of the two models is mainly reflected in the difference of corr if we only focus on the variation of corr the time period in which the two models are more consistent is in the short horizon hourly forecasts where the corrs obtained by the two models are very close to each other marked by sz corr and zh corr respectively and shown as solid and dashed lines in the figure the corrs of both models are above 0 95 in the short period hourly forecasts and can be maintained above 0 9 in the 24 hour forecasts with the model for the zh outperforming that for the sz station with the correlation coefficient remaining around 0 95 subsequently the two models show a similar trend of plummeting correlation coefficients and rebound slowly in the forecasts from about 36 h onwards until another plummet in the forecasts for 48 h later during this process the corr of the zh station is higher than that of station sz in other words the model is less time efficient for the sz station and the correlation of the forecast results decreases more rapidly with increasing forecast length the two models behave differently for longer forecasts as the model rebounded for forecasts longer than 57 h for the sz station while this occurred for forecasts longer than 62 h for the zh station in addition the corr of the model for zh once again shows a large plunge when the forecast time is longer than 66 h while the model for sz has only slight fluctuations and does not show a large change across the forecast time the corr of the model for the zh station can be maintained above 0 85 when the forecast time is close to 72 h while the corr of the model for the sz station can only be maintained above 0 80 in summary the forecast model for zh station has a slightly better forecast time performance than the forecast model for sh station and the two models can almost reproduce the fvcom forecast results for the 72 hour forecast from the above results we draw a conclusion that the deep learning model can effectively reproduce the results simulated by the fvcom model and at the same time has good scalability for different site applications it can be considered that the model can reproduce the results of the fvcom model in 1d 2d forecasts for the single site storm surge level forecasting process but the computational time to be spent is much less compared to the model 4 discussion in the results section we show the model forecasts for three stations hong kong zhuhai and shenzhen and briefly discuss whether the model can be migrated or not from the results our model forecasts well and has good migration capability in previous studies convlstm and bpnn are commonly used machine learning models for forecasting here we provide an idea to fuse high dimensional signals and one dimensional signals which is different from convlstm or bpnn obviously convlstm performs well for two dimensional or three dimensional time series change prediction problems however it is not applicable for such single site forecasting problems and the computational complexity is much higher than the model in this paper while the bpnn like network can only deal with one dimensional to one dimensional problems and requires dimensionality reduction when facing high dimensional data which may lose most of the spatial information the model presented in this manuscript eliminates the drawbacks of bpnn networks and convolutional like networks while maximizing their benefits the issue of having to extract both high dimensional signals and local one dimensional signals is resolved by employing two inputs in this study but there are still many details worth discussing for example a considerable number of hyperparameters that can be adjusted in cnn model however in our preliminary experiments we found that most of the hyperparameters in the model such as adding layers and changing the number of convolutional kernels or fully connected neurons do not have much impact on the overall model results therefore we will not show those experiments here and we will show the next aspect that we think has a greater impact on the model the effect of different water level sequence duration inputs on the model results from both figs 7 and 8 it can be noted that there is a paragraph wise decline in the forecast accuracy of the model then what factors affect this decreasing trend is of more concern to us considering that the forecast performance of the model is not only related to the design of the model structure itself but also may be related to the input length we have done some sensitivity experiments on the input length of the model considering that the wind field is a three dimensional two channel data that needs to occupy a large amount of computational and storage resources in order to ensure the computational speed of the model it is not much meaningful to explore the effect of the change of the input length of the wind field on the performance of the model in contrast the sequence of local water levels contains many tidal signals and the length change of the input water level sequence is likely to have a large impact on the model results therefore we explored the relationship between the time span of the input water level series and the forecast timeliness therefore in setting up the sensitivity experiments we removed the convolutional part of the model and kept only the fully connected layer i e bp neural network for water level sequence forecasting such a setup can test the relationship between water level input duration and forecast timeliness on the one hand and learn the improvement of forecast performance by introducing wind field through cnn on the other hand by comparison we choose the hong kong station as the experimental station and do not change the number of training samples or the splitting ratio of the validation set nor the number of neurons or the activation function but only the input water level sequence duration starting from a water level sequence duration of 6 h we increase the duration of each experiment by 3 h until the water level sequence input duration is 24 h fig 9 illustrates the relationship between the time span of the input water level series vertical axis and the number of hours between forecasts horizontal axis it can be observed that with longer water level time series input the correlation coefficient of the model forecast decreases more slowly with time and the point at which the correlation coefficient plummets is later and less frequent for example in the case of a 6 hour input water level series the corr plunges from nearly 0 9 to less than 0 8 at the target forecast length of 10 to 20 h and this phenomenon improves significantly as the input water level series length increases to 12 h there is a slight decrease and as the input length increases to 15 h this corr decreasing interval has disappeared and shows a weak rise and fall in addition in the case of a 6 hour input water level duration there is also an interval of rapid corr decrease in the forecast length interval oriented to 30 h to 46 h followed by a gradual increase with the growth of the forecast target length a similar situation exists in the case of input water level series of 9 and 12 h in length in the case of input lengths longer than 12 h this interval is no longer one in which the corr decreases and then increases but shows a continuous slow decline which continues until 55 h in the case of water level series with 24 hour input time there is almost no longer an interval where the corr decreases and then increases and the overall trend is that the corr gradually decreases as the forecast time increases and there is almost no longer an interval where the correlation decreases rapidly therefore the use of 24 hour long water level series as input is sufficient to produce a more stable forecast over a 72 hour period as we know well and also stated above the methodology section there are three reasons to cause the sea level rise ekman transports gravity waves and tides the former two are related to the storms in the present study we try to develop an algorithm to forecast the total sea level rise which includes tides that is why we need to include 24 hour sea level rise to incorporate the major tidal components 5 summary in this study we propose a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network which can effectively fuse atmospheric information wind field and station water level information and can effectively forecast the station water level and also have a good response to the anomalous water level increase brought by storm surge the deep learning model based on cnn is used to forecast the storm surge at a single station which is trained and tested using historical typhoon data set simulated by fvcom the cnn model can more accurately predict future storm surges with an effective forecast period of up to 24 h in the experiment the model is first evaluated at the hk site before being transferred to the zh and sz sites the outcomes demonstrate that the model s performance level in these experiments is largely consistent demonstrating the model s strong adaptability in the discussion section of this research we investigate the impact of the length of input on the model s correlative prediction outcome compared with the results generated by the bp network it can be explained that employing cnn to extract wind field characteristics is conducive to improving the prediction results in summary the cnn model s water level forecast during a storm surge has high accuracy a long effective prediction time adaptability portability and speed this is helpful for the relevant departments to make effective warnings and policy deployment when typhoons are approaching credit authorship contribution statement wenhong xie

water level features to produce a more time efficient intelligent forecast keywords storm surge deep learning intelligent forecasting data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction storm surges are coastal phenomena in which the ocean water level rises dramatically due to intense atmospheric disturbances as may be caused by temperate cyclones cold waves and tropical cyclone tc forcing needham et al 2015 kohno et al 2018 and is often accompanied by torrential rain and flooding wu et al 2018 lai et al 2021 qiang et al 2021 although a global phenomenon storm surge is particularly severe in china as they consistently rank at the top of the nation s oceanographic disasters due to its large number of landfalling tcs extremely long coastline 18 000 km 54 coastal cities and such accounts for nearly half the national population and total gross domestic product shi et al 2013 2020b feng et al 2021 wang et al 2021a consequently precise and rapid storm surge forecasts are urgently required and are crucial for safeguarding both the lives and livelihoods of millions of people takagi et al 2018 shi et al 2020a traditionally storm surge forecasting methods can be subdivided into empirical statistical and numerical model based methodologies with increasing computing power and storage capacity numerical models are widely used in studying storm surges as a phenomenon their effects on both natural and human environments and their responses to storm surges e g pan and liu 2020 widely used is the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national hurricane center nhc and other departments sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh model to study tc induced storm surge based on different storm paths and intensity thereby provided storm surge probability and maximum possible water gain products glahn et al 2009 within the literature liu et al 2022 used a hydrodynamic model to assess tc induced compound flood risk in haikou city china and found that coastal areas are major floodplains with the severity of inundation being positively correlated with storm tide heights using a coupled high resolution advanced circulation adcirc and simulating waves nearshore swan model yin et al 2017 investigated the effects of sea level rise slr and typhoon intensification ti on storm surge and waves in china s pearl river estuary and showed that ti had a greater effect on storm surge though slr was more significant on waves within the estuary similarly chi and rong 2021 investigated extreme storm surges by simulating 98 typhoons between 1987 and 2018 using the coupled adcirc swan model and found that wave setup could be responsible for 2 12 5 of the 50 year extreme surge level important for the current discussion by simulating results using the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom li et al 2022 reported that storm surge during typhoon chan hom in the macro tidal hangzhou bay was related to both tides and wind field but tides dominated although numerical models are widely used in scientific investigations of storm surge and early warning systems e g harley et al 2016 they are expensive in terms of required computational cost the expertise required to set up evaluate run and analyze and time to overcome these and other issues artificial intelligence ai may be a solution that shows great potential in forecasting and model parameter estimation zhu et al 2022 xie et al 2021 numerical models are rapidly being supplemented with and supplanted by ai methodologies for storm surge forecasting tadesse et al 2020 early lee 2006 rajasekaran et al 2008 and hashemi et al 2016 used inputs of tc wind speed wind direction and pressure into artificial neural networks anns and support vector regression svr for storm surge forecasts chao et al 2020 used ann and effective typhoon parameters for storm surge predictions but also considered the introduction of a knowledge extraction method with backward tracking and forward exploration procedures to analyze the roles of hidden neurons and typhoon parameters in said predictions the authors found that while excellent results were achieved in hour ahead predictions accuracy over longer lead times 12 h can be achieved when the general pattern of maximum storm surge under various scenarios is acquired in dealing with storm surge forecasting problems these and other works have used statistical methods or combined machine learning with numerical models to decompose and integrate tc properties such as minimum central pressure and maximum central one dimension into one cohesive variable and then used backpropagation bp neural networks or rnns for forecasting despite the relative quantity of successful examples of these methodologies signal to noise ratios increase when two dimensional and intense atmospheric input variables are decomposed and integrated into one variable thus leaving room for improvement convolutional neural networks cnns provide powerful tools to overcome these issues and are being increasingly used in the forecasting of typhoon intensities and even storm surges for example wimmers et al 2019 proposed a deepmicronet model using a deep learning cnn model to estimate tc intensity using satellite images in different wavebands pradhan et al 2018 designed a deep cnn structure for tc intensity classification using a graphics processing unit the model obtained a higher accuracy and lower root mean square error than using only satellite images lee et al 2019 proposed a cnn based tc intensity estimation method to analyze the intensity characteristics of multispectral satellite tc images zhang et al 2019 proposed a two branch cnn tc intensity estimation model based on infrared and water vapor images and a preliminary study found that the model performed best under the tropical storm and super typhoon categories wang et al 2021b used and compared a cnn long short term memory lstm and joint cnn lstm networks for surge level forecasting results indicated that based on 11 years of sea level and wind data cnn and lstm were each superior to svr and multilayer perceptron models but when combined lstm cnn and cnn lstm models allowed for accuracy improvements of 10 at all forecasting steps tiggeloven et al 2021 used anns cnns and the joint convlstm to construct neural network nn ensembles at 736 global tide stations and found that lstm generally outperforms the other nn models additionally the authors also found that while the addition of predictands for storm surge forecasts improved performance this came at the cost of greater computation time to take advantage of cnn strengths in tc feature extraction and bp and rnn strengths in forecasting this study uses a cnn to extract two dimensional wind field features directly and fuse them with tide level time series for forecasting water levels at several stations at the pearl river estuary in china similar to the study conducted by ayyad et al 2022 this study also uses a large number of physics based numerical simulations to generate a large dataset for cnn model training the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the utilized data and methodology section 3 concerns itself with the main findings of this study section 4 gives a discussion and section 5 concludes 2 data

grid finite volume 3d primitive equation turbulent closure coastal model and is widely used to investigate the impact that typhoons have on marine environments chu et al 2019 cong et al 2021 tang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the finite volume method which combines the characteristics of finite difference and finite element models can be fitted to complex shore boundaries in shallow waters and facilitate discrete discretization of the original set of dynamical equations thus ensuring high computational efficiency the computational format can better ensure mass conservation for computational problems with complex topographic shore boundaries irregular non overlapping triangular meshes are used in the horizontal direction which can easily fit complex boundaries and perform local encryption here the pearl river and adjacent east china sea ecs enclosed by 21 2 n 23 2 n and 112 8 e 114 8 e is set as the model simulation area fig 1 with the model covering 116 typhoons from 1958 2018 the horizontal resolution of the triangular grid is 5 km for the open boundary and shelf area the grid resolution is 200 m for the nearshore area as well as the intertidal area extending about 10 km landward the land elevation and bathymetric topographic data were obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco dataset kapoor 1981 with a spatial resolution of 10 min the modeled area grid has a total of 53 058 nodes and 104 850 elements with 10 nodes for the river open boundary and 198 nodes for the outer sea open boundary a dry and wet grid processing module is introduced to accurately simulate the high and low tide processes of nearshore mudflats and intertidal zones fvcom is forced by time varying winds and barometric pressure at the sea surface with tides sea surface height and inverse pressure effects due to barometric pressure changes set on the open boundary sea surface wind and barometric pressure data during 1958 1978 and 1979 2018 are derived from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 and national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 global reanalysis datasets respectively sea surface winds are interpolated to the model grid elements while barometric pressures are interpolated to the model grid nodes ecmwf data can be acquired at https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data

tpxo7 2 forecasted tidal heights runoff data added on the river open boundaries are derived from the monthly average climatic state runoff data measured at the mainstream and major tributary hydrological stations of the pearl river the model is uniformly divided into 10 layers in the vertical direction and the time step is 12 s for the inner mode and 1 2 s for the outer mode with an hourly output of coastal sea surface height flow field and beaching processes 2 1 2 in situ observations to verify the accuracy of the historical storm surge dataset generated by the fvcom model it is also necessary to validate it with actual site measurements the university of hawaii sea level center uhslc plays a variety of roles in supporting real time ocean operations and climate and ocean research for assimilation of numerical models calibration of satellite altimeter data production of marine products and research on a variety of time scales from interdecadal climate fluctuations to short term extreme events it contains many tide gauge records the most prominent of which is the gloss core network gcn tide gauge record which consists of nearly 300 tide gauge stations that provide tidal data at 1 hour or 1 day intervals in this study the hong kong station data with a 1 hour interval in the uhslc dataset is selected as the model result validation data with the starting year of 1986 and the longitude and latitude of the station at 114 22 e 22 30 n 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 convolutional neural network in order to enable the machine learning model to obtain both the typhoon intensity information in the atmosphere and the tidal signal at the local area this study inputs water level time series based on cnn output the consequent features are extracted using a fully connected layer fig 2 in the convolution process the input tensor size is set to 128 128 12 where the 12 channels contain both longitudinal and latitudinal wind speeds with a time span of 6 h each the convolution process generally uses 3 3 convolution kernels as well as 2 2 maximum pooling layers and two successive convolutions were performed before each pooling layer to obtain a larger perceptual field with fewer parameters a 24 hour water level sequence input is added before the fully connected layer of the regular convolutional network and this input will enter the fully connected layer together with the feature maps obtained from the straightened convolution to ensure that the machine learning model obtains the correct data relationships during training the wind field inputs for the training and validation sets used are consistent with the model driven wind field while the hour by hour sea surface height results from the fvcom model output are used as the true values for the neural network the length of the output water level time series is chosen to be 72 h to ensure the quality of the forecast and to explore the timeliness of the forecast we adopted and applied the model to three stations namely hong kong hk zhuhai zh and shenzhen sz stations with the locations marked in fig 1 the architecture of the convolution process is a linear stack of depth wise separable convolution layers with residual connections this makes the architecture very easy to define and modify chollet 2017 this structure is utilized on the one hand to ensure that the model extracts wind field features efficiently and on the other hand to prevent features from being lost in numerous convolutions separable convolutions consist of first performing a depth wise spatial convolution which acts on each input channel separately followed by a pointwise convolution that mixes the resulting output channels the selection of 6 hour wind data as the input is based on a series of sensitivity experiments not shown in which different temporal lengths of the input data are tested and the 6 hour input is found to be the best choice from the physical perspective as we know well the water level rise during a storm surge could be caused by three reasons ekman transport wind disturbed gravity wave and astronomical spring tides storm surges caused by ekman transport are controlled by the along shore wind direction along the wind direction when the shore is on its right the wind could cause the sea level rise by the shoreward ekman transport which can be identified by the wind direction therefore the temporal length for the wind input is not required but the gravity wave disturbed by the storm needs a certain time to propagate from the disturbance point to the location of interest for a gravity wave the wave crest causes the water level to rise while the trough of the wave causes the water level to decrease roughly estimated the distance between the southeast corner of the model domain and the zh site is approximately 170 km in the model domain the water depth changes from 10 to 85 m and then the average is 13 m so the mean speed of baroclinic gravity wave in the model domain g h is approximately 2 m s the barotropic gravity wave with speed g h is approximately 11 m s and then it will take about 6 7 h for the mixture of barotropic and baroclinic gravity wave to travel from the corner 114 8 e 21 2 n to zh site therefore 6 hour wind data is needed to generate an accurate prediction the feature maps obtained from the convolution are linked to a fully connected layer i e a layer in which the neurons between the two layers are fully connected and the weights of the neurons are initially given randomly as are the weights of the convolutional kernel and are optimized during training unlike the fully connected layer in traditional cnns the fully connected layer in this study does not only receive the spreading and straightening feature maps as input but also connects the water level time series features of the past hours the feature maps from the convolutional pooling are flattened and stretched into sequences which are simply combined with the new input water level sequences and then passed through the fully connected layer the relu activation is used between the fully connected layers but no activation function is used in the output layer the principle of the fully connected layer is shown in eq 1 1 y i r e l u j 1 n w i j x j b i where w j i denotes the current layer s first j neuron of the current layer and the next layer s i th weight between the first neuron of the current layer and the first neuron of the next layer x j denotes the value of the current layer j th value of the first neuron of the current layer n denotes the number of neurons in the current layer and b i denotes represents the bias of the i th neuron in the next layer relu is the activation function and y i is the value of i th neuron in the next layers the fully connected layer accumulates the neuron values by multiplying them with the corresponding weights and then adding bias after the activation function to finally obtain the values of the corresponding neurons in the next layer the fully connected layer integrates the features by matrix multiplication and then relies on the activation function to increase the nonlinear expressiveness of the model the fully connected layer can effectively reduce the feature dimensionality filter the learned high dimensional features and keep the most favorable features for the model which makes the impact of redundant information on the model reduced effectively improving the accuracy of the model and also reducing the number of operations and speeding up the model operation 2 2 2 model performance metrics to describe the difference between the results generated by the deep learning model and the results of the fvcom model this paper uses the root mean square error rmse to evaluate while the correlation coefficient corr is used to measure the linear relationship between the deep learning model forecasts and the results of the fvcom model the specific expressions are as follows 2 corr t 1 n h g t h g h p t h p t 1 n h g t h g 2 t 1 n h p t h p 2 3 rmse 1 n t 1 n h g t h p t 2 where h g t h p t are the true and predicted values at moment t respectively h g and h p are the sample averages of the true and forecast values respectively and n is the total number of hours in the sample here it is important to note that during fvcom model validation the true values are the uhslc station observations and forecast values are the fvcom model output however in evaluating the cnn model fvcom simulations are held as true values and the forecast values are the cnn predictions 3 results 3 1 fvcom model validation we used the measured data of uhslc at the hk station for comparison in order to assess the capability of fvcom to replicate historical typhoon cases fig 3 shows the simulated water level and uhslc station observations during typhoon helen which is a more representative example of the simulation effect of the typhoon process helen is typhoon no 8 in 1995 which made landfall in hong kong on august 12 of that year and caused high winds and water increase in the nearby area fvcom nearly replicated the actual change in water level at the station for the prediction of water level at the hk station the largest tidal difference occurs on the 11th the day before the typhoon officially makes landfall with a tidal difference of more than two meters and on the following 12 th and there is also a tidal difference of almost two meters which is reproduced by the fvcom simulation on the 13 th and 14 th the intensity of the typhoon weakened after landfall and the water level at the station dropped back both of which were also reproduced in the simulation results with a corr of 0 96 and an rmse of 0 14 m we compared all the fvcom simulations after 1986 with the actual data from uhslc and the average corr is 0 94 and rmse is 0 17 m therefore the example selected for display is relatively close to the average of the fvcom simulations this level of corr and rmse also indicates that these historical typhoon conditions simulated by fvcom are close to the real ones and can be used as a network model training for deep learning the results of all fvcom generated storm surge processes are used for training validation or testing of the cnn models in addition to focusing on the overall simulation effect of the model we should also focus on the data performance in the test set eight typhoon cases were randomly selected as the test data set about 10 of the total data and their information is listed in table 1 the eight randomly selected typhoons are hope kompasu mac lynn kammuri brendan gerald and victor some of these typhoons are well simulated such as kammuri and victor with a corr of 0 97 and an rmse of 0 13 m which are good compared to the remaining typhoons we have simulated the worst simulated typhoon is typhoon gerald with a corr of 0 88 and rmse of 0 18 m the poor simulation in this case may be due to the unusual track of this typhoon although it was a typhoon that originated in the south china sea it did not hit directly near the pearl river estuary s coast it traveled through the south china sea in an s pattern over seven days from its generation to landing initially traveling eastward it abruptly veered to the northwest and directly struck the pearl river estuary this process may cause some difficulties in the simulation despite the fact that this inaccuracy is larger than a few other cases we think it still falls within the acceptable range the average corr of these test set data is 0 93 and the rmse is 0 16 m so the simulation level of the randomly selected test set is almost the same as the level of the whole data set and the performance level of the deep learning model in the test set can represent the performance level of the model in the whole data the preceding section mainly assesses the capacity of model simulation for storm tides and the following section is about fvcom s simulation of storm surges the maximum surges in 57 typhoon cases from fvcom are compared with observed data at hongkong station fig 4 the correlation coefficient is 0 72 and rmse is 0 24 m generally the fvcom reproduces the sea level rise it should be noticed that there is no data assimilation in the model so one should expect deviations between the model results and the observational data when the maximum surges are larger the deviations between the fvcom simulation and the observational data are also larger noting this phenomenon we further assess the capacity of the numerical simulations for storm surges and show 6 cases in fig 5 the fvcom can accurately predict the phase of the storm surge from these several cases in some cases such as no 1208 and 1822 the numerical model cannot hindcast such large surges in summary fvcom can accurately predict the amplitude and phase of the storm surge in general cases and the errors of fvcom simulation which is used to generate training data and transfer learning data are within the acceptable range in network training both training and validation datasets use hourly fvcom ssh output and the corresponding model forcing wind field since the model uses an irregular triangular grid we interpolate it to a regular grid of 128 128 points in order to facilitate convolutional operations before feeding it to the cnn which allows for lower computational expense increases in model training and computation speeds while maintaining little difference in resolution as compared to original model output although each typhoon that affected the study area over the past 60 years is simulated fewer than 100 sample cases are acquired and this is insufficient to train a deep learning model to expand the dataset s size each process of obtaining a 72 hour water level sequence from a 6 hour wind field plus a 24 hour water level sequence as input is used to generate a training or prediction sample for machine learning this increases the training sample size by a factor of nearly 100 and does not require significant additional computational resources to compute more model results as all training data are as close to realistic and physically meaningful as possible in this study more than 7600 samples are generated from the 79 historical typhoon landfall events simulated of which the samples generated from the first 71 typhoon landfall events are used for training and validation and they are split into training and validation sets in the ratio of 8 1 the remaining samples not used for training or validation are used as the test set making the ratio of training validation and test sets about 8 1 1 study the keras chollet 2015 framework is used to build the model the loss function used is the mean absolute error mae and the optimization is adam kingma and ba 2014 and training is stopped until the loss value of the validation set no longer decreased the trained model is used in the test set for prediction and the results obtained are shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows cnn s forecast results of storm surge with the lead time of 6 12 18 and 24 h for a typhoon case in which the remaining storm surge results are presented after the astronomical tide is removed cnn s corr can reach 0 95 for the 6 hour forecast and its rmse is under 0 08 m cnn is able to keep the rmse at 0 07 m 0 08 m and the corr at a level greater than 0 90 for forecasts that are with a lead time of 12 or 18 h the rmse can still be kept at 0 08 m for the forecast that is made 24 h in advance despite the corr being reduced to 0 89 in general the cnn model is accurate in predicting the changing trend of storm surges and peak water levels with the increase of the forecast lead time the cnn forecast results will have some phase deviation even peak delay as shown in fig 6 d to further assess the forecasting capability of the model this study also statistically evaluates the overall forecast timeliness of the model in the test set in terms of both corr and rmse fig 7 shows the results of this evaluation and it shows that the forecast performance of the cnn model declines slowly over time the decay of the correlation coefficient with time and decay of the correlation coefficient and the increase of the rmse with time show a paragraph like variation specifically the slow decay of the forecast performance from 1 12 h the most rapid drop in forecast performance occurs after 12 h but the forecast stabilizes at a good level again after 15 h and our model maintains a correlation coefficient greater than 0 89 and an average rmse of less than 0 08 m even for the 24 hour forecast the model can be considered to provide more accurate forecasting results within 12 h and still has some reference value in 24 hour forecasting the above results and discussion show that the model achieves good performance results for the hong kong station but we still need to pay attention to whether it has similar or better performance for other stations we chose two more stations on the two sides of the pearl river zh and sz in fig 1 for model training using the same settings as the hk station but samples are reshuffled before training the wind field inputs water level inputs and outputs are also similar to those used for the hong kong station except that the water level data are used as the local results of the model water level forecasts respectively as shown in fig 8 high accurate are also obtained for the forecasts at both stations after the model is migrated to learn at both stations separately overall the forecast performance of the model at both stations also shows a decreasing trend in paragraphs with the forecast duration and since the rmse obtained by both shows a staggered increasing trend with little difference it can be considered that the difference in the forecast timeliness of the two models is mainly reflected in the difference of corr if we only focus on the variation of corr the time period in which the two models are more consistent is in the short horizon hourly forecasts where the corrs obtained by the two models are very close to each other marked by sz corr and zh corr respectively and shown as solid and dashed lines in the figure the corrs of both models are above 0 95 in the short period hourly forecasts and can be maintained above 0 9 in the 24 hour forecasts with the model for the zh outperforming that for the sz station with the correlation coefficient remaining around 0 95 subsequently the two models show a similar trend of plummeting correlation coefficients and rebound slowly in the forecasts from about 36 h onwards until another plummet in the forecasts for 48 h later during this process the corr of the zh station is higher than that of station sz in other words the model is less time efficient for the sz station and the correlation of the forecast results decreases more rapidly with increasing forecast length the two models behave differently for longer forecasts as the model rebounded for forecasts longer than 57 h for the sz station while this occurred for forecasts longer than 62 h for the zh station in addition the corr of the model for zh once again shows a large plunge when the forecast time is longer than 66 h while the model for sz has only slight fluctuations and does not show a large change across the forecast time the corr of the model for the zh station can be maintained above 0 85 when the forecast time is close to 72 h while the corr of the model for the sz station can only be maintained above 0 80 in summary the forecast model for zh station has a slightly better forecast time performance than the forecast model for sh station and the two models can almost reproduce the fvcom forecast results for the 72 hour forecast from the above results we draw a conclusion that the deep learning model can effectively reproduce the results simulated by the fvcom model and at the same time has good scalability for different site applications it can be considered that the model can reproduce the results of the fvcom model in 1d 2d forecasts for the single site storm surge level forecasting process but the computational time to be spent is much less compared to the model 4 discussion in the results section we show the model forecasts for three stations hong kong zhuhai and shenzhen and briefly discuss whether the model can be migrated or not from the results our model forecasts well and has good migration capability in previous studies convlstm and bpnn are commonly used machine learning models for forecasting here we provide an idea to fuse high dimensional signals and one dimensional signals which is different from convlstm or bpnn obviously convlstm performs well for two dimensional or three dimensional time series change prediction problems however it is not applicable for such single site forecasting problems and the computational complexity is much higher than the model in this paper while the bpnn like network can only deal with one dimensional to one dimensional problems and requires dimensionality reduction when facing high dimensional data which may lose most of the spatial information the model presented in this manuscript eliminates the drawbacks of bpnn networks and convolutional like networks while maximizing their benefits the issue of having to extract both high dimensional signals and local one dimensional signals is resolved by employing two inputs in this study but there are still many details worth discussing for example a considerable number of hyperparameters that can be adjusted in cnn model however in our preliminary experiments we found that most of the hyperparameters in the model such as adding layers and changing the number of convolutional kernels or fully connected neurons do not have much impact on the overall model results therefore we will not show those experiments here and we will show the next aspect that we think has a greater impact on the model the effect of different water level sequence duration inputs on the model results from both figs 7 and 8 it can be noted that there is a paragraph wise decline in the forecast accuracy of the model then what factors affect this decreasing trend is of more concern to us considering that the forecast performance of the model is not only related to the design of the model structure itself but also may be related to the input length we have done some sensitivity experiments on the input length of the model considering that the wind field is a three dimensional two channel data that needs to occupy a large amount of computational and storage resources in order to ensure the computational speed of the model it is not much meaningful to explore the effect of the change of the input length of the wind field on the performance of the model in contrast the sequence of local water levels contains many tidal signals and the length change of the input water level sequence is likely to have a large impact on the model results therefore we explored the relationship between the time span of the input water level series and the forecast timeliness therefore in setting up the sensitivity experiments we removed the convolutional part of the model and kept only the fully connected layer i e bp neural network for water level sequence forecasting such a setup can test the relationship between water level input duration and forecast timeliness on the one hand and learn the improvement of forecast performance by introducing wind field through cnn on the other hand by comparison we choose the hong kong station as the experimental station and do not change the number of training samples or the splitting ratio of the validation set nor the number of neurons or the activation function but only the input water level sequence duration starting from a water level sequence duration of 6 h we increase the duration of each experiment by 3 h until the water level sequence input duration is 24 h fig 9 illustrates the relationship between the time span of the input water level series vertical axis and the number of hours between forecasts horizontal axis it can be observed that with longer water level time series input the correlation coefficient of the model forecast decreases more slowly with time and the point at which the correlation coefficient plummets is later and less frequent for example in the case of a 6 hour input water level series the corr plunges from nearly 0 9 to less than 0 8 at the target forecast length of 10 to 20 h and this phenomenon improves significantly as the input water level series length increases to 12 h there is a slight decrease and as the input length increases to 15 h this corr decreasing interval has disappeared and shows a weak rise and fall in addition in the case of a 6 hour input water level duration there is also an interval of rapid corr decrease in the forecast length interval oriented to 30 h to 46 h followed by a gradual increase with the growth of the forecast target length a similar situation exists in the case of input water level series of 9 and 12 h in length in the case of input lengths longer than 12 h this interval is no longer one in which the corr decreases and then increases but shows a continuous slow decline which continues until 55 h in the case of water level series with 24 hour input time there is almost no longer an interval where the corr decreases and then increases and the overall trend is that the corr gradually decreases as the forecast time increases and there is almost no longer an interval where the correlation decreases rapidly therefore the use of 24 hour long water level series as input is sufficient to produce a more stable forecast over a 72 hour period as we know well and also stated above the methodology section there are three reasons to cause the sea level rise ekman transports gravity waves and tides the former two are related to the storms in the present study we try to develop an algorithm to forecast the total sea level rise which includes tides that is why we need to include 24 hour sea level rise to incorporate the major tidal components 5 summary in this study we propose a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network which can effectively fuse atmospheric information wind field and station water level information and can effectively forecast the station water level and also have a good response to the anomalous water level increase brought by storm surge the deep learning model based on cnn is used to forecast the storm surge at a single station which is trained and tested using historical typhoon data set simulated by fvcom the cnn model can more accurately predict future storm surges with an effective forecast period of up to 24 h in the experiment the model is first evaluated at the hk site before being transferred to the zh and sz sites the outcomes demonstrate that the model s performance level in these experiments is largely consistent demonstrating the model s strong adaptability in the discussion section of this research we investigate the impact of the length of input on the model s correlative prediction outcome compared with the results generated by the bp network it can be explained that employing cnn to extract wind field characteristics is conducive to improving the prediction results in summary the cnn model s water level forecast during a storm surge has high accuracy a long effective prediction time adaptability portability and speed this is helpful for the relevant departments to make effective warnings and policy deployment when typhoons are approaching credit authorship contribution statement wenhong xie

supplemented by numerical simulations which extend the range of the control parameters we demonstrate that meanders occur in the northern branch of the gyres within an eastward current similar to those in the kuroshio extension the meanders are due to the rossby wave reflection from the boundary the wavelength of the meanders is selected by the condition of stationarity of the westward propagating rossby wave phase within an eastward current keywords meanders kuroshio extension western boundary current subtropical gyres β plume rossby waves optical altimetry data availability matlab codes used in this paper are available from https github com zy gdou rotating tank experiment 1 introduction the kuroshio current is one of the most energetic ocean currents it closes the north pacific subtropical gyre npsg at its western boundary flowing along the continental slope of the east china sea and along the japanese coast the current leaves the coast at approximately 35 n and then flows eastward into the deep ocean forming the kuroshio extension ke the path of the ke defines the northern boundary of the npsg one of the most interesting features of the ke is two large meanders located just eastward of the point where the current separates from the coast of japan e g qiu and chen 2005 these meanders are quasi permanent as they do not disappear after temporal averaging and are present in climatological maps of the sea surface height ssh of the north pacific ocean as shown in fig 1 moreover the meanders are not just features of the circulation in the upper ocean they extend through the entire depth of the ocean and have a significant barotropic component as shown in fig 7 in de verdière and ollitrault 2016 mizuno and white 1983 interpreted the quasi permanent meanders of the ke as a stationary rossby wave within an eastward current the wavelength of the wave is given by 1 λ m 2 π u β 1 2 where u is the speed of the current and β is the meridional derivative of the coriolis parameter note that eq 1 does not contain the radius of deformation r d this is explained by the fact that according to geostrophy a uniform eastward current requires a north south slope of the surface elevation this slope increases planetary β by u r d 2 and thus compensates for the difference in westward phase velocity of rossby waves with different r d this however assumes that the eastward current and the rossby waves have the same vertical structure mizuno and white 1983 suggested that a stationary wave occurs in the lee of the izu ridge which extends to the south from the point where the kuroshio current separates from the coast they estimated the wavelength of the wave to be λ m 600 km given the speed of the current u 20 cm s and β 1 9 1 0 11 m 1s 1 at 36 n their estimate seems to agree well with observations hurlburt et al 1996 later argued that although one of their numerical simulations did conform with the theory by mizuno and white 1983 other simulations countered the theory and showed that specific bathymetry features including seamounts strongly influence the pattern of meanders the meanders developed along the separated western boundary currents are often flanked by recirculations jayne et al 2009 tracey et al 2012 these recirculations increase eastward transport in the separated currents many fold compared to their transport before separation the recirculations are deep features with a significant barotropic component observations of the recirculations prompted the occurrence of theories involving different dynamical mechanisms one of the mechanisms considered by different authors is an advection of potential vorticity pv by the flow e g greatbatch 1987 cessi et al 1987 cessi 1990 sheremet 2002 nakano et al 2008 instability of a free flowing eastward jet as well as effects of eddy eddy or eddy mean flow interactions were also considered as plausible explanations for the recirculations e g holland and rhines 1980 rhines and young 1982 young and rhines 1982 haidvogel and rhines 1983 jayne and hogg 1999 jayne et al 2009 berloff 2005 waterman 2009 the quasi permanent meanders and the recirculations seem to be pieces of a puzzle within a bigger picture an entire subtropical ocean gyre the dynamics of ocean gyres have been extensively studied classic gyre models are stationary solutions of a linearized quasi geostrophic equation forced with a basin scale wind stommel 1948 munk 1950 the gyre models can be re interpreted in terms of so called β plumes a β plume is a flow induced by a spatially localized forcing in the presence of a β effect stommel 1982 davey and killworth 1989 a time derivative is included in the equation for the potential vorticity pv the equation then supports planetary rossby waves when the forcing is initiated and then maintained at constant magnitude a spectrum of rossby waves is emitted the group velocity of longer waves has a westward component while shorter waves propagate to the east e g vallis 2017 short waves create a wavy flow to the east of the forcing area long waves have almost zonal crests they form a gyre like circulation a β plume to the west of the forcing area see laboratory visualizations in afanasyev et al 2012 afanasyev and ivanov 2019 note that the limiting case of a localized forcing is a point force the solution can also be obtained using the green function technique e g veronis 1958 webb et al 2016 haine and fuller 2016 kloosterziel and maas 2017 a β plume gyre essentially consists of two zonal jets flowing in opposite directions the jets are connected over the forcing area via the sverdrup transport mechanism in the west the circulation is closed in a plume like manner hence the name if a barrier is present in the west the circulation is closed via a narrow western boundary current wbc a wbc is typically a strong inertial current where lateral and or bottom friction and form drag are important dynamical factors e g hughes and de cuevas 2001 vallis 2017 the dynamics at the western boundary when considered within a linear framework involves reflection of the west propagating rossby waves rossby waves do not just bounce back from the boundary as say surface gravity waves do only shorter rossby waves can carry energy to the east thus the reflected waves are shorter than the incident ones longuet higgins 1964 the quasi permanent meanders of the ke are the primary motivation for this modeling study they are believed to be indicators of the dynamics of rossby waves in the entire npsg and not just due to specific features of bottom topography here we investigate the dynamics of ocean gyres in an idealized setting β plumes in a domain bounded with a barrier in the west are used to model the ocean gyres in our laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the experiments provide an opportunity to explore the dynamics of real versus virtual fluid in all entirety including geostrophic and ageostrophic baroclinic and barotropic motions our numerical simulations on the other hand are highly idealized and supplement the experiments by expanding the range of control parameters these experiments and simulations explore the evolution of flows starting from rest when the forcing is turned on at time zero this approach allows us to reveal the sequence of events leading to an ultimate steady state circulation including the setting of quasi permanent meanders in the process in laboratory rotating tanks various methods of forcing are used to generate β plumes the density field can be perturbed by heating or cooling the fluid within a localized area at the bottom or surface respectively e g sui and afanasyev 2013 heating cooling causes upwelling downwelling in the forcing area alternatively direct mass injection can be employed to generate vertical motion in a localized area water is pumped in or out of the tank through a hole in the bottom or a pipe at the surface the water can be either the same or different density from the water in the tank e g stommel et al 1958 afanasyev et al 2012 afanasyev and ivanov 2019 the latter technique is arguably more relevant to modeling ocean gyres which are forced by wind stress which in turn causes upwelling or downwelling below the ekman layer the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 contains details of the laboratory apparatus and the optical altimetry system section 3 reviews the linear theory of β plumes based on fourier decomposition and the reflection of rossby waves from a barrier a numerical model used to supplement the laboratory experiments is described in section 4 results of the experiments numerical simulations and theory are described in section 5 and the conclusions are given in section 6 2 experimental set up and data acquisition laboratory experiments were performed in a cylindrical tank installed on a rotating table fig 2 before each experiment the tank was filled with salty water low and high salinity values either s 15 ppt or s 40 ppt were used the tank was then rotated counterclockwise with an angular velocity ω 2 3 rad s the water in the tank reaches a state of a solid body like rotation when the centrifugal force is balanced by the radial pressure gradient such that the surface of water is of a shape of a paraboloid the water depth h varies quadratically with the distance r to the axis of rotation the center of the tank 2 h r h 0 ω 2 g r 2 r t 2 2 where h 0 10 cm is the average depth g 980 cm s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and r t 55 cm is the radius of the tank according to the conservation of potential vorticity pv defined as q ζ f h where ζ is the vertical component of the relative vorticity varying the depth and varying the coriolis parameter f have the same effect on vertical columns of water thus flows in a rotating tank where the coriolis parameter is constant f 0 2 ω are dynamically equivalent to flows on a rotating planet where the coriolis parameter varies with latitude a so called topographic β plane can be introduced in the usual manner in the vicinity of some reference radius r 0 where the potential vorticity can be approximated as q f 0 β y h r 0 such that e g afanasyev 2015 3 β 2 ω 3 r 0 g h r 0 here we use a local cartesian coordinate with an origin at r 0 with its x axis directed counterclockwise and y axis directed to the center of the tank the center of the tank where water is shallow is then equivalent to the north pole the flows are generated by injecting freshwater at the surface of the saline layer through a pipe with a diffuser at the end the pipe is connected to a remotely controlled pump which delivers water from an external tank at a prescribed rate varying from 1 cm 3 s to 5 cm 3 s the source of fresh water was fixed at r 0 35 cm at 11 o clock in the top view of the tank fig 2 b a vertical barrier was placed westward clockwise of the source to model a coastline the position of the barrier with respect to the source was varied between the experiments although the forcing is baroclinic the flows have a significant barotropic component because rapid rotation enforces vertical homogeneity of the horizontal velocity field via the taylor proudman effect vallis 2017 both the baroclinic and barotropic components of the velocity can be measured in two layer flows using techniques of optical thickness and altimetry e g afanasyev et al 2012 matulka et al 2016 afanasyev 2019 although we employed both techniques in some of the experiments only barotropic measurements performed with altimetry are reported here the reason is that in this article we focus on the dynamics of rossby waves which are present in the barotropic component only it is important to quantify some control parameters in our experiments the barotropic radius of deformation defined as r d g h f 0 varies between approximately 16 cm in the shallow area at the center and 25 cm in the deeper area at the wall of the tank the burger number can then be introduced as b u r d r t 2 at midlatitudes of the tank at r r 0 b u 0 13 the values of b u in the experiments are of the same order of magnitude as those in the ocean the burger number for the basin scale circulation can be estimated to be b u r d l 2 0 12 where l 6000 km is the zonal scale of the npsg and r d g h f 0 2100 km is the barotropic deformation radius with h 4500 m the ocean depth and f 0 1 0 4 s 1 the coriolis parameter at midlatitudes viscous dissipation in a rotating layer of water is usually interpreted in terms of ordinary viscosity in the bulk of the layer and bottom friction bottom friction is described by the ekman layer theory e g vallis 2017 where the ekman number is defined as e k ν ω h 2 in our experiments e k r 0 5 7 1 0 5 using the kinematic viscosity of water at temperature 20 c ν 1 0 1 0 2 cm 2 s the altimetric imaging velocimetry aiv technique measures the gradient η η x η y of the surface elevation η in the entire tank by matching the color of each pixel in the images obtained by a video camera with the reference color in the color mask 7 in fig 2 a note that η is measured with respect to the geoid defined by eq 2 the aiv technique is described in detail in afanasyev et al 2009 afanasyev 2015 the horizontal velocity is then computed using the quasi geostrophic equation 4 u g f 0 n η g f 0 2 t η g γ f 0 2 η g 2 f 0 3 j η η where n is the unit vector in the vertical direction γ ω ν 1 2 h e k 1 2 ω is the ekman friction coefficient and j is the jacobian operator j a b a x b y a y b x the first term on the right hand side is the geostrophic balance the rest of the terms approximate u beyond geostrophy to the second order in rossby number ζ f 0 in the second term the temporal derivative or tendency is calculated via finite difference between two successive frames in the video sequence with a time interval of approximately 0 15 s in the third term ekman friction at the bottom of the tank is taken into account finally the jacobian in the fourth term represents non linear advection the rossby number was below r o 0 2 everywhere in the flow 3 theory consider the evolution of a β plume a flow induced by a localized forcing on the β plane the shallow water continuity equation e g gill and adrian 1982 can be used to introduce forcing in the right hand side of the equation 5 η t h u w f where u is the horizontal velocity in the quasi geostrophic approximation given by eq 4 and h is the depth given by eq 2 the term on the right hand side is the forced local upwelling velocity substituting eqs 2 and 4 into eq 5 and introducing the stream function ψ g η f 0 we obtain 6 t 2 k d 2 ψ j ψ 2 ψ β ψ x γ 2 ψ q where k d is the reciprocal of the radius of deformation and the forcing term on the right hand side is q f 0 w f h 0 the nonlinear term in eq 6 can be neglected when the rossby number is small following davey and killworth 1989 we solve the linearized equation using fourier series 7 k 2 k d 2 ψ t i k x β ψ γ k 2 ψ q where the tilde hat denotes the fourier transform and k k x k y is the wavenumber vector whose magnitude is k k x 2 k y 2 integrating eq 7 in time with the initial condition ψ t 0 0 we obtain 8 ψ a 1 exp i ω t where the amplitude a is 9 a a k x k y q k x k y γ k 2 i k x β and the frequency ω is given by the dispersion relation 10 ω k x β i γ k 2 k 2 k d 2 the inverse fourier transform of eq 8 then gives the stream function in the physical domain 11 ψ x y t k x k y a 1 exp i ω t exp i k x x k y y when a barrier is placed to the west of the source longer rossby waves which propagate to the west are reflected at the barrier the total solution of the wave equation is then a superposition of the incident and reflected waves just as for the incident wave the reflected wave ψ r satisfies eq 11 with the same frequency 12 ψ r x y t k x k y a r 1 exp i ω t exp i k x r x k y r y note that the wavenumbers k x r and k y r are functions of the wavenumbers of the incident wave they can be found using the free slip boundary condition at the barrier given by the linear equation x b y b tan α where α is the angle measured clockwise with respect to the y axis fig 3 the total stream function is a constant say zero without loss of generality at the barrier such that 13 ψ ψ r 1 e i ω t k x k y a exp i k x x b k y y b a r exp i k x r x b k y r y b 0 this condition is satisfied when 14a a a r 14b k x sin α k y cos α k x r sin α k y r cos α these equations show that the amplitudes of the reflected and incident waves are equal in magnitude and so are their along barrier wavenumbers longuet higgins 1964 the components of the wavevector perpendicular and parallel to the barrier are defined as 15 k k cos α sin α sin α cos α k x k y the original components are given by the inverse rotation 16 k x k y cos α sin α sin α cos α k k substituting eq 16 into the dispersion relation eq 10 we obtain a quadratic equation for k its two roots give k for the incident and reflected waves noting that k r k k x sin α k y cos α the sum of the two roots is 17 k k r β cos α ω i γ this equation gives the wavenumber of the reflected wave as a function of that of the incident wave finally equations for the original components of the wavevector are obtained using eq 16 18a k x r β k 2 k d 2 cos 2 α β k x

our experiments the algorithm is based on the vorticity streamfunction equation eq 6 where a term ν 4 ψ is added on the right hand side this term describes horizontal viscous friction and as a bonus contributes to numerical stability of the algorithm weinan and liu 1996 in addition the β parameter was allowed to vary radially as specified by eq 3 a cartesian computational grid of dimensions 500 500 is used in our simulations since stream function ψ is the only variable to solve in eq 6 no stagger grid is needed an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme is used in temporal discretization the adaptive time step δ t δ x 2 u m a x where u m a x is the maximum speed at a given time is calculated using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition for stability implicit and explicit schemes are employed for the friction term and viscosity terms respectively weinan and liu 1996 the jacobian in eq 6 is discretized using the arakawa scheme eq 46 in arakawa 1966 this scheme conserves both the energy and enstrophy of the system the other terms use the second order central differencing scheme a thin barrier was inserted in the domain similar to that used in the experiments simulations with either no slip or free slip conditions were performed the latter are used for comparison with theory in section 3 the forcing term q is given by 19 q x y w f f 0 h 0 exp x x f 2 y y f 2 r f 2 where x f y f is the position of the center of the forcing area of radius r f r f was chosen to be in the range between 2 cm and 10 cm the upwelling velocity w f was varied between 1 0 1 0 3 cm s and 1 8 1 0 2 cm s in different runs 5 results in this section we describe the results of our laboratory experiments numerical simulations and linear theory and compare them to each other 5 1 laboratory experiments analyses of the video sequences reveal the emergence and evolution of a variety of eddies waves and plumes fig 4 shows snapshots of the flow during a period spanning 30 rotations the supplementary video showing the relative vorticity field is in file videofig4 when the source is turned on fresh water upwells to the surface of the salty layer and spreads horizontally acquiring an anticyclonic rotation due to the coriolis force fig 4 a and b the rossby number in the core of the anticyclonic vortex reaches approximately 0 3 as pumping of fresh water continues the first anticyclone detaches from the source and moves westward clockwise drifting slightly southward at the same time note that the southward displacement is due to the so called beta drift reznik 2010 the process repeats and a chain of eddies eventually forms and advances toward the barrier the eddies are surrounded by filaments of positive cyclonic vorticity these filaments are unstable and curl up into smaller vortices eddies emit inertial waves during their initial adjustment these waves can be seen as pale thin stripes around eddies inertial waves also known as gyroscopic waves have frequency less than 2 ω and are an important component of the dynamics of oceans and planetary atmospheres kelvin 1880 maas 2001 rabitti and maas 2013 these waves are routinely observed in our experiments with altimetry most often they spontaneously occur during adjustment or interaction of eddies e g afanasyev et al 2008 yet another type of waves observed in our experiments is rossby waves they are in fact modes of inertial waves that respond to the varying depth of water in the tank or to the varying coriolis parameter on a rotating planet phillips 1965 when forcing is initiated and then maintained at constant magnitude a spectrum of rossby waves is emitted long waves have almost zonal crests they form a β plume to the west of the forcing area the plume can be seen most clearly in fig 4 a d as wide zonal bands of different colors blue and red in panels a and c and yellow and blue in panels b and d originating at the source and extending all the way to the barrier by that time fresh water delivered by the source has not propagated far from the source as can be seen by the location of eddies since any baroclinic effects associated with the fresh water do not extend beyond the area occupied by the eddies the β plume extending to the barrier is unaffected by the eddies and is purely barotropic sufficiently short rossby waves propagate eastward they areslower than longer waves and their patterns only reveals themselves later in the experiment fig 5 shows a later phase of the evolution when the flow reaches an almost steady state on the short wave side to the east of the source the wave looks like a chain of large alternating vortices fig 5 c f the vortices eventually extend all the way to the barrier fig 5 e and f this pattern suggests what a short rossby wave looks like in this flow which is useful to keep in mind for the following discussion of rossby wave reflection at the barrier long barotropic rossby waves which propagate westward toward the barrier are very fast they reach the barrier well before the turbulent baroclinic flow gets there these waves create a β plume consisting of two zonal jets the southern jet flowing westward from the source to the barrier and the northern one flowing eastward back to the source the zonal jets are connected at the barrier the presence of a barrier in a gyre results in a strong current along the barrier the western boundary current the boundary current first becomes visible in the relative vorticity image in fig 4 d as very thin yellow and blue stripes along the barrier note that positive cyclonic vorticity is generated due to a no slip condition at the barrier the current separates from the barrier to join the eastward flowing jet and thus continues its circulation in the β plume gyre the most interesting feature of the boundary current is the meanders it creates right after its separation these meanders are quasi permanent they maintain their location and shape during the entire experiment in other experiments not shown here where we varied experimental parameters including the distance between the barrier and the source the salinity of water and the magnitude of forcing the meanders were a robust feature the wavelength of the meander λ m is defined as the distance between two successive crests as shown in fig 5 d in all experiments λ m was measured in a sequence of 180 aiv images spanning a period of approximately 10 rotations and was temporally averaged fig 6 compares the measured λ m with the wavelength of a stationary rossby wave in an eastward current given by eq 1 u was determined by averaging the velocity in the eastward flowing half of the β plume in the area including the two meanders fig 5 shows the flow at later times baroclinic eddies now fill the entire area of the gyre however the general pattern of the circulation including the meanders eastward of the separation point remains the same in the vicinity of the source the flow is unstable with respect to baroclinic and frontal instabilities and generates a rich variety of small vortices and thin filaments note that baroclinic flows tend to become more barotropic with time via a process of barotropization involving a cascade of energy to the barotropic mode charney 1971 smith and vallis 2001 fu and flierl 1980 hua and haidvogel 1986 this tendency was also demonstrated by direct measurements of the ratio of the barotropic to baroclinic components in rotating tank experiments with a forcing similar to the one used here matulka and afanasyev 2015 on a related note it was shown that during its evolution a baroclinic instability can result in the creation of zonal jets via a secondary instability of so called noodles alternating meridional currents berloff et al 2009a b radko et al 2014 in this experiment however smaller scale baroclinic eddies are rather passive and follow the large scale barotropic β plume 5 2 linear theory solutions of the linearized eq 6 described in section 3 give β plumes composed of rossby waves emitted by a spatially localized forcing and waves reflected from the barrier in the west visualizations of the total wavefield and its incident and reflected components allow us to understand their role in the creation of quasi permanent meanders fig 7 shows the surface elevation field η ψ ψ r f 0 g corresponding to the total stream function of the flow as well as its incident and reflected components where ψ and ψ r are computed using eqs 11 and 12 together with eq 18 fig 7 shows snapshots of these fields at t 13 rotations when the β plume elevated η yellow color stretched all the way to the barrier the supplementary video is in file videofig7 at the barrier the amplitude of the reflected wave must be of the opposite sign to that of the incident wave such that the total field vanishes η 0 the reflected wave then forms a crest just off the barrier crescent shaped yellow in fig 7 g h i it contributes to the incident wave to form a local maximum near the barrier top row in fig 7 this wave pattern is of fixed phase and is a linear precursor of a boundary current which develops between the barrier and the wave crest the current according to geostrophy flows to the north beyond the crest a trough forms and the process repeats the video sequences show that the phase of the reflected wave propagates westward while the energy propagates eastward the snapshot in fig 7 h shows a pattern of crescent shaped crests and troughs this pattern is similar to that observed eastward of the forcing area in the experiments as seen in fig 5 near the barrier a compressed fixed phase pattern of the reflected wave is established this pattern creates undulations in the total field see the top row in fig 7 and is a linear basis for quasi permanent meanders it is important to show that the reflected wave pattern is robust not just for a north south barrier but also when the barrier is at an angle to the meridional direction a case of an inclined barrier is shown in the left column of fig 7 the near wall pattern is asymmetric but still has similar structure to that of the straight barrier case the far field of the reflected wave however is quite different the wave is mainly reflected to the south east rather than straight to the east 5 3 numerical simulations laboratory experiments show the dynamics of a real fluid numerical simulations on the other hand deal with an idealized virtual fluid one advantage of numerical simulations however is the ability to expand the range of parameter values in our case the barotropic radius of deformation r d is one parameter that is very difficult to vary experimentally because it requires changing either the depth of water in the tank or the rate of rotation both of them can be varied only within a very limited range here we use a relatively simple 1 1 2 layer numerical model to explore a wider range of r d or in non dimensional form b u we also investigate the case with a free slip boundary condition at the barrier in order to see how it affects the boundary current separation and the creation of meanders yet another of our numerical runs is performed for parameters simulating those in the ocean first we start with a numerical run for which the laboratory parameters were simulated in particular the value of r d 20 cm as in midlatitudes of the tank in this simulation we do not include the baroclinic flow which is used for forcing the circulation in the experiments instead we force our virtual flow with the forcing term q given by eq 19 which approximates an anticyclonic vortex generated by the source in the experiments thus this run simulates the barotropic component of the laboratory flow only fig 8 shows the surface elevation field η with velocity vectors left column and the relative vorticity normalized by the coriolis parameter right column the supplementary video is in file videofig8 comparison of fig 8 with experimental figs 4 and 5 demonstrates that the simulated flow in the absence of baroclinic motions appears to be a rectified version of the experimental flow yet the simulated flow contains all of the main elements of the barotropic dynamics including i alternating vortices due to a short rossby wave eastward of the source ii elongated almost zonal circulation in the β plume iii the wbc and most importantly iv meanders eastward of the separation point in order to test to what extent the boundary condition at the barrier affects the boundary current separation and the creation of meanders we run a simulation with the same laboratory like parameters as the first one but with a free slip condition at the barrier fig 9 shows the same main features of the flow as in the no slip run in fig 8 except that there no positive yellow vorticity is created at the barrier and the boundary current or at least a part of it continues to flow along the barrier and separates only at its tip the supplementary video is in file videofig9 however the meanders still occur at approximately the same location where the eastward jet start its flow back to the source the meanders are similar in shape and size to those observed in the previous run with the no slip condition these results suggest that a no slip boundary condition can contribute to an earlier separation of wbc but it is not necessary for the creation of the quasi steady meanders to investigate the dependence of the wavelength of meanders λ m on the main control parameters we performed a series of 20 simulations where both the radius of deformation and the size of the forcing were varied 2 cm r d 20 cm and 2 cm r f 10 cm measured values of λ m are plotted in fig 6 as a function of the theoretical estimate eq 1 the speed of the eastward current u was determined in the same manner as in the experiments by averaging over the area containing the meanders fig 6 shows that λ m measured both in the simulations and in the experiments agrees well with the theoretical estimate a visual comparison of the flows observed in the experiments fig 4 or simulations fig 8 with linear flows with a north south barrier as shown in the middle column of fig 7 shows that while the linear flows are symmetric flows in the experiments or simulations develop an asymmetry with respect to the y 0 axis in particular meanders occur only in the northern branch of gyres the reason for the asymmetry is clearly an advection in the gyres to demonstrate a gradual transition of flows from the linear to non linear regimes we performed a series of 4 simulations where the amplitude of forcing was varied from relatively low to higher values 1 1 0 3 cm s w f 2 1 0 2 cm s fig 10 shows the relative vorticity fields in these simulations when the gyres are fully developed at t 80 rotations each gyre consists of westward and eastward jets in their southern and northern branches respectively in the relative vorticity images the axes of the jets are in between the positive yellow and negative blue bands of vorticity rossby waves reflected from the barrier carry energy eastward but their phase still propagates westward the westward current in the southern branch then carries the wave phase even faster toward the barrier the boundary current which can be identified as bright yellow and blue strips of vorticity next to the barrier becomes compressed at the southern flank of the gyre the situation is reversed at the northern flank where waves propagate upstream of the eastward current as a consequence a certain wavelength is selected according to eq 1 panel a in fig 10 is closest to a purely linear flow as shown in fig 7 the effects of advection become increasingly more significant with larger forcing see panels b d in fig 10 it is also interesting that when the amplitude of forcing is larger the flow becomes unstable at the forcing area the flow breaks into a chain of alternating vortices as seen in fig 10 d which then propagate westward within the southern branch of the gyre the supplementary videos are in files videofig10a videofig10b videofig10c and videofig10d respectively 6 conclusions the laboratory experiments described herein model basin scale subtropical gyres where the flow is driven by the wind stress due to high pressure atmospheric systems in the experiments the forcing is modeled by a spatially localized source the lab flows have all of the key elements of the gyre dynamics including β plumes envelopes of rossby waves and western boundary currents these experiments demonstrate the evolution of gyres starting from time zero when the forcing is turned on this process is difficult if even possible to observe in the ocean but it can be observed in great detail in our laboratory using an optical altimetry system these observations give insight into how certain features of the circulation in particular the quasi permanent meanders are formed the experiments were supplemented by numerical simulations using a 1 1 2 layer model to explore a wider range of control parameters in particular the radius of deformation r d the results of our experiments and simulations are as follows 1 quasi permanent meanders are a robust feature of the flows and were observed in all of our flows typically two distinct meanders are created similar to those observed in the kuroshio extension 2 the meanders are caused by a fixed phase pattern of rossby waves reflected from the barrier as shown by the linear theory described in section 5 2 3 the meanders occur only in the northern branch of the gyre in the eastward jet as in the kuroshio extension the reason for this asymmetry is advection by a mean flow as shown by the experiments and simulations described in sections 5 1 and 5 3 in the southern branch of the gyre in the westward current rossby waves reflected from the barrier are swept by the current toward the barrier while the envelopes and hence energy of the reflected waves propagate to the east their phase still propagates to the west thus in the southern branch phase locking with the mean current is not possible the situation is reversed in the northern branch where the phase propagates upstream 4 the wavelength of meanders is selected from the rossby wave spectrum under the condition of stationarity of the westward propagating phase in an eastward current which is in agreement with mizuno and white 1983 who demonstrated this for the kuroshio extension 5 contrary to the interpretation by mizuno and white 1983 that the meanders of the kuroshio extension are lee wave meanders occurring in the current flowing over the izu ridge we believe that the mechanism is more general and these meanders are due to rossby waves reflected from a western boundary in all of our experiments and simulations meanders were observed without a current flowing over topography the wavelength selection mechanism however works just the same in this case the izu ridge is likely to be responsible for the reflection of rossby waves especially barotropic ones to a greater extent than the coast of japan in this region finally our results point out why similar quasi permanent meanders are not observed in the kuroshio s twin in the atlantic ocean the gulf stream path of the gulf stream after it passes the cape hatteras still follows quite closely the continental shelf break such that the current only truly separates after the grand banks at that point the coast and the bottom topography which act as barriers reflecting rossby waves are northward of the gulf stream and are mainly zonal rather than meridional as in the case of the kuroshio declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

23796,this is a study of gyres bounded by a barrier in the west and forced by a localized upwelling it is motivated by observations of quasi permanent meanders of the kuroshio extension in the north pacific subtropical gyre laboratory experiments are performed in a rotating tank where a parabolic shape of the surface of water is used to model the latitudinal variation of the coriolis parameter optical altimetry provides accurate records of circulations and allows us to observe the evolution of β plumes rossby wave envelopes including their reflection from the barrier experiments are supplemented by numerical simulations which extend the range of the control parameters we demonstrate that meanders occur in the northern branch of the gyres within an eastward current similar to those in the kuroshio extension the meanders are due to the rossby wave reflection from the boundary the wavelength of the meanders is selected by the condition of stationarity of the westward propagating rossby wave phase within an eastward current keywords meanders kuroshio extension western boundary current subtropical gyres β plume rossby waves optical altimetry data availability matlab codes used in this paper are available from https github com zy gdou rotating tank experiment 1 introduction the kuroshio current is one of the most energetic ocean currents it closes the north pacific subtropical gyre npsg at its western boundary flowing along the continental slope of the east china sea and along the japanese coast the current leaves the coast at approximately 35 n and then flows eastward into the deep ocean forming the kuroshio extension ke the path of the ke defines the northern boundary of the npsg one of the most interesting features of the ke is two large meanders located just eastward of the point where the current separates from the coast of japan e g qiu and chen 2005 these meanders are quasi permanent as they do not disappear after temporal averaging and are present in climatological maps of the sea surface height ssh of the north pacific ocean as shown in fig 1 moreover the meanders are not just features of the circulation in the upper ocean they extend through the entire depth of the ocean and have a significant barotropic component as shown in fig 7 in de verdière and ollitrault 2016 mizuno and white 1983 interpreted the quasi permanent meanders of the ke as a stationary rossby wave within an eastward current the wavelength of the wave is given by 1 λ m 2 π u β 1 2 where u is the speed of the current and β is the meridional derivative of the coriolis parameter note that eq 1 does not contain the radius of deformation r d this is explained by the fact that according to geostrophy a uniform eastward current requires a north south slope of the surface elevation this slope increases planetary β by u r d 2 and thus compensates for the difference in westward phase velocity of rossby waves with different r d this however assumes that the eastward current and the rossby waves have the same vertical structure mizuno and white 1983 suggested that a stationary wave occurs in the lee of the izu ridge which extends to the south from the point where the kuroshio current separates from the coast they estimated the wavelength of the wave to be λ m 600 km given the speed of the current u 20 cm s and β 1 9 1 0 11 m 1s 1 at 36 n their estimate seems to agree well with observations hurlburt et al 1996 later argued that although one of their numerical simulations did conform with the theory by mizuno and white 1983 other simulations countered the theory and showed that specific bathymetry features including seamounts strongly influence the pattern of meanders the meanders developed along the separated western boundary currents are often flanked by recirculations jayne et al 2009 tracey et al 2012 these recirculations increase eastward transport in the separated currents many fold compared to their transport before separation the recirculations are deep features with a significant barotropic component observations of the recirculations prompted the occurrence of theories involving different dynamical mechanisms one of the mechanisms considered by different authors is an advection of potential vorticity pv by the flow e g greatbatch 1987 cessi et al 1987 cessi 1990 sheremet 2002 nakano et al 2008 instability of a free flowing eastward jet as well as effects of eddy eddy or eddy mean flow interactions were also considered as plausible explanations for the recirculations e g holland and rhines 1980 rhines and young 1982 young and rhines 1982 haidvogel and rhines 1983 jayne and hogg 1999 jayne et al 2009 berloff 2005 waterman 2009 the quasi permanent meanders and the recirculations seem to be pieces of a puzzle within a bigger picture an entire subtropical ocean gyre the dynamics of ocean gyres have been extensively studied classic gyre models are stationary solutions of a linearized quasi geostrophic equation forced with a basin scale wind stommel 1948 munk 1950 the gyre models can be re interpreted in terms of so called β plumes a β plume is a flow induced by a spatially localized forcing in the presence of a β effect stommel 1982 davey and killworth 1989 a time derivative is included in the equation for the potential vorticity pv the equation then supports planetary rossby waves when the forcing is initiated and then maintained at constant magnitude a spectrum of rossby waves is emitted the group velocity of longer waves has a westward component while shorter waves propagate to the east e g vallis 2017 short waves create a wavy flow to the east of the forcing area long waves have almost zonal crests they form a gyre like circulation a β plume to the west of the forcing area see laboratory visualizations in afanasyev et al 2012 afanasyev and ivanov 2019 note that the limiting case of a localized forcing is a point force the solution can also be obtained using the green function technique e g veronis 1958 webb et al 2016 haine and fuller 2016 kloosterziel and maas 2017 a β plume gyre essentially consists of two zonal jets flowing in opposite directions the jets are connected over the forcing area via the sverdrup transport mechanism in the west the circulation is closed in a plume like manner hence the name if a barrier is present in the west the circulation is closed via a narrow western boundary current wbc a wbc is typically a strong inertial current where lateral and or bottom friction and form drag are important dynamical factors e g hughes and de cuevas 2001 vallis 2017 the dynamics at the western boundary when considered within a linear framework involves reflection of the west propagating rossby waves rossby waves do not just bounce back from the boundary as say surface gravity waves do only shorter rossby waves can carry energy to the east thus the reflected waves are shorter than the incident ones longuet higgins 1964 the quasi permanent meanders of the ke are the primary motivation for this modeling study they are believed to be indicators of the dynamics of rossby waves in the entire npsg and not just due to specific features of bottom topography here we investigate the dynamics of ocean gyres in an idealized setting β plumes in a domain bounded with a barrier in the west are used to model the ocean gyres in our laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the experiments provide an opportunity to explore the dynamics of real versus virtual fluid in all entirety including geostrophic and ageostrophic baroclinic and barotropic motions our numerical simulations on the other hand are highly idealized and supplement the experiments by expanding the range of control parameters these experiments and simulations explore the evolution of flows starting from rest when the forcing is turned on at time zero this approach allows us to reveal the sequence of events leading to an ultimate steady state circulation including the setting of quasi permanent meanders in the process in laboratory rotating tanks various methods of forcing are used to generate β plumes the density field can be perturbed by heating or cooling the fluid within a localized area at the bottom or surface respectively e g sui and afanasyev 2013 heating cooling causes upwelling downwelling in the forcing area alternatively direct mass injection can be employed to generate vertical motion in a localized area water is pumped in or out of the tank through a hole in the bottom or a pipe at the surface the water can be either the same or different density from the water in the tank e g stommel et al 1958 afanasyev et al 2012 afanasyev and ivanov 2019 the latter technique is arguably more relevant to modeling ocean gyres which are forced by wind stress which in turn causes upwelling or downwelling below the ekman layer the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 contains details of the laboratory apparatus and the optical altimetry system section 3 reviews the linear theory of β plumes based on fourier decomposition and the reflection of rossby waves from a barrier a numerical model used to supplement the laboratory experiments is described in section 4 results of the experiments numerical simulations and theory are described in section 5 and the conclusions are given in section 6 2 experimental set up and data acquisition laboratory experiments were performed in a cylindrical tank installed on a rotating table fig 2 before each experiment the tank was filled with salty water low and high salinity values either s 15 ppt or s 40 ppt were used the tank was then rotated counterclockwise with an angular velocity ω 2 3 rad s the water in the tank reaches a state of a solid body like rotation when the centrifugal force is balanced by the radial pressure gradient such that the surface of water is of a shape of a paraboloid the water depth h varies quadratically with the distance r to the axis of rotation the center of the tank 2 h r h 0 ω 2 g r 2 r t 2 2 where h 0 10 cm is the average depth g 980 cm s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and r t 55 cm is the radius of the tank according to the conservation of potential vorticity pv defined as q ζ f h where ζ is the vertical component of the relative vorticity varying the depth and varying the coriolis parameter f have the same effect on vertical columns of water thus flows in a rotating tank where the coriolis parameter is constant f 0 2 ω are dynamically equivalent to flows on a rotating planet where the coriolis parameter varies with latitude a so called topographic β plane can be introduced in the usual manner in the vicinity of some reference radius r 0 where the potential vorticity can be approximated as q f 0 β y h r 0 such that e g afanasyev 2015 3 β 2 ω 3 r 0 g h r 0 here we use a local cartesian coordinate with an origin at r 0 with its x axis directed counterclockwise and y axis directed to the center of the tank the center of the tank where water is shallow is then equivalent to the north pole the flows are generated by injecting freshwater at the surface of the saline layer through a pipe with a diffuser at the end the pipe is connected to a remotely controlled pump which delivers water from an external tank at a prescribed rate varying from 1 cm 3 s to 5 cm 3 s the source of fresh water was fixed at r 0 35 cm at 11 o clock in the top view of the tank fig 2 b a vertical barrier was placed westward clockwise of the source to model a coastline the position of the barrier with respect to the source was varied between the experiments although the forcing is baroclinic the flows have a significant barotropic component because rapid rotation enforces vertical homogeneity of the horizontal velocity field via the taylor proudman effect vallis 2017 both the baroclinic and barotropic components of the velocity can be measured in two layer flows using techniques of optical thickness and altimetry e g afanasyev et al 2012 matulka et al 2016 afanasyev 2019 although we employed both techniques in some of the experiments only barotropic measurements performed with altimetry are reported here the reason is that in this article we focus on the dynamics of rossby waves which are present in the barotropic component only it is important to quantify some control parameters in our experiments the barotropic radius of deformation defined as r d g h f 0 varies between approximately 16 cm in the shallow area at the center and 25 cm in the deeper area at the wall of the tank the burger number can then be introduced as b u r d r t 2 at midlatitudes of the tank at r r 0 b u 0 13 the values of b u in the experiments are of the same order of magnitude as those in the ocean the burger number for the basin scale circulation can be estimated to be b u r d l 2 0 12 where l 6000 km is the zonal scale of the npsg and r d g h f 0 2100 km is the barotropic deformation radius with h 4500 m the ocean depth and f 0 1 0 4 s 1 the coriolis parameter at midlatitudes viscous dissipation in a rotating layer of water is usually interpreted in terms of ordinary viscosity in the bulk of the layer and bottom friction bottom friction is described by the ekman layer theory e g vallis 2017 where the ekman number is defined as e k ν ω h 2 in our experiments e k r 0 5 7 1 0 5 using the kinematic viscosity of water at temperature 20 c ν 1 0 1 0 2 cm 2 s the altimetric imaging velocimetry aiv technique measures the gradient η η x η y of the surface elevation η in the entire tank by matching the color of each pixel in the images obtained by a video camera with the reference color in the color mask 7 in fig 2 a note that η is measured with respect to the geoid defined by eq 2 the aiv technique is described in detail in afanasyev et al 2009 afanasyev 2015 the horizontal velocity is then computed using the quasi geostrophic equation 4 u g f 0 n η g f 0 2 t η g γ f 0 2 η g 2 f 0 3 j η η where n is the unit vector in the vertical direction γ ω ν 1 2 h e k 1 2 ω is the ekman friction coefficient and j is the jacobian operator j a b a x b y a y b x the first term on the right hand side is the geostrophic balance the rest of the terms approximate u beyond geostrophy to the second order in rossby number ζ f 0 in the second term the temporal derivative or tendency is calculated via finite difference between two successive frames in the video sequence with a time interval of approximately 0 15 s in the third term ekman friction at the bottom of the tank is taken into account finally the jacobian in the fourth term represents non linear advection the rossby number was below r o 0 2 everywhere in the flow 3 theory consider the evolution of a β plume a flow induced by a localized forcing on the β plane the shallow water continuity equation e g gill and adrian 1982 can be used to introduce forcing in the right hand side of the equation 5 η t h u w f where u is the horizontal velocity in the quasi geostrophic approximation given by eq 4 and h is the depth given by eq 2 the term on the right hand side is the forced local upwelling velocity substituting eqs 2 and 4 into eq 5 and introducing the stream function ψ g η f 0 we obtain 6 t 2 k d 2 ψ j ψ 2 ψ β ψ x γ 2 ψ q where k d is the reciprocal of the radius of deformation and the forcing term on the right hand side is q f 0 w f h 0 the nonlinear term in eq 6 can be neglected when the rossby number is small following davey and killworth 1989 we solve the linearized equation using fourier series 7 k 2 k d 2 ψ t i k x β ψ γ k 2 ψ q where the tilde hat denotes the fourier transform and k k x k y is the wavenumber vector whose magnitude is k k x 2 k y 2 integrating eq 7 in time with the initial condition ψ t 0 0 we obtain 8 ψ a 1 exp i ω t where the amplitude a is 9 a a k x k y q k x k y γ k 2 i k x β and the frequency ω is given by the dispersion relation 10 ω k x β i γ k 2 k 2 k d 2 the inverse fourier transform of eq 8 then gives the stream function in the physical domain 11 ψ x y t k x k y a 1 exp i ω t exp i k x x k y y when a barrier is placed to the west of the source longer rossby waves which propagate to the west are reflected at the barrier the total solution of the wave equation is then a superposition of the incident and reflected waves just as for the incident wave the reflected wave ψ r satisfies eq 11 with the same frequency 12 ψ r x y t k x k y a r 1 exp i ω t exp i k x r x k y r y note that the wavenumbers k x r and k y r are functions of the wavenumbers of the incident wave they can be found using the free slip boundary condition at the barrier given by the linear equation x b y b tan α where α is the angle measured clockwise with respect to the y axis fig 3 the total stream function is a constant say zero without loss of generality at the barrier such that 13 ψ ψ r 1 e i ω t k x k y a exp i k x x b k y y b a r exp i k x r x b k y r y b 0 this condition is satisfied when 14a a a r 14b k x sin α k y cos α k x r sin α k y r cos α these equations show that the amplitudes of the reflected and incident waves are equal in magnitude and so are their along barrier wavenumbers longuet higgins 1964 the components of the wavevector perpendicular and parallel to the barrier are defined as 15 k k cos α sin α sin α cos α k x k y the original components are given by the inverse rotation 16 k x k y cos α sin α sin α cos α k k substituting eq 16 into the dispersion relation eq 10 we obtain a quadratic equation for k its two roots give k for the incident and reflected waves noting that k r k k x sin α k y cos α the sum of the two roots is 17 k k r β cos α ω i γ this equation gives the wavenumber of the reflected wave as a function of that of the incident wave finally equations for the original components of the wavevector are obtained using eq 16 18a k x r β k 2 k d 2 cos 2 α β k x

our experiments the algorithm is based on the vorticity streamfunction equation eq 6 where a term ν 4 ψ is added on the right hand side this term describes horizontal viscous friction and as a bonus contributes to numerical stability of the algorithm weinan and liu 1996 in addition the β parameter was allowed to vary radially as specified by eq 3 a cartesian computational grid of dimensions 500 500 is used in our simulations since stream function ψ is the only variable to solve in eq 6 no stagger grid is needed an explicit fourth order runge kutta scheme is used in temporal discretization the adaptive time step δ t δ x 2 u m a x where u m a x is the maximum speed at a given time is calculated using the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition for stability implicit and explicit schemes are employed for the friction term and viscosity terms respectively weinan and liu 1996 the jacobian in eq 6 is discretized using the arakawa scheme eq 46 in arakawa 1966 this scheme conserves both the energy and enstrophy of the system the other terms use the second order central differencing scheme a thin barrier was inserted in the domain similar to that used in the experiments simulations with either no slip or free slip conditions were performed the latter are used for comparison with theory in section 3 the forcing term q is given by 19 q x y w f f 0 h 0 exp x x f 2 y y f 2 r f 2 where x f y f is the position of the center of the forcing area of radius r f r f was chosen to be in the range between 2 cm and 10 cm the upwelling velocity w f was varied between 1 0 1 0 3 cm s and 1 8 1 0 2 cm s in different runs 5 results in this section we describe the results of our laboratory experiments numerical simulations and linear theory and compare them to each other 5 1 laboratory experiments analyses of the video sequences reveal the emergence and evolution of a variety of eddies waves and plumes fig 4 shows snapshots of the flow during a period spanning 30 rotations the supplementary video showing the relative vorticity field is in file videofig4 when the source is turned on fresh water upwells to the surface of the salty layer and spreads horizontally acquiring an anticyclonic rotation due to the coriolis force fig 4 a and b the rossby number in the core of the anticyclonic vortex reaches approximately 0 3 as pumping of fresh water continues the first anticyclone detaches from the source and moves westward clockwise drifting slightly southward at the same time note that the southward displacement is due to the so called beta drift reznik 2010 the process repeats and a chain of eddies eventually forms and advances toward the barrier the eddies are surrounded by filaments of positive cyclonic vorticity these filaments are unstable and curl up into smaller vortices eddies emit inertial waves during their initial adjustment these waves can be seen as pale thin stripes around eddies inertial waves also known as gyroscopic waves have frequency less than 2 ω and are an important component of the dynamics of oceans and planetary atmospheres kelvin 1880 maas 2001 rabitti and maas 2013 these waves are routinely observed in our experiments with altimetry most often they spontaneously occur during adjustment or interaction of eddies e g afanasyev et al 2008 yet another type of waves observed in our experiments is rossby waves they are in fact modes of inertial waves that respond to the varying depth of water in the tank or to the varying coriolis parameter on a rotating planet phillips 1965 when forcing is initiated and then maintained at constant magnitude a spectrum of rossby waves is emitted long waves have almost zonal crests they form a β plume to the west of the forcing area the plume can be seen most clearly in fig 4 a d as wide zonal bands of different colors blue and red in panels a and c and yellow and blue in panels b and d originating at the source and extending all the way to the barrier by that time fresh water delivered by the source has not propagated far from the source as can be seen by the location of eddies since any baroclinic effects associated with the fresh water do not extend beyond the area occupied by the eddies the β plume extending to the barrier is unaffected by the eddies and is purely barotropic sufficiently short rossby waves propagate eastward they areslower than longer waves and their patterns only reveals themselves later in the experiment fig 5 shows a later phase of the evolution when the flow reaches an almost steady state on the short wave side to the east of the source the wave looks like a chain of large alternating vortices fig 5 c f the vortices eventually extend all the way to the barrier fig 5 e and f this pattern suggests what a short rossby wave looks like in this flow which is useful to keep in mind for the following discussion of rossby wave reflection at the barrier long barotropic rossby waves which propagate westward toward the barrier are very fast they reach the barrier well before the turbulent baroclinic flow gets there these waves create a β plume consisting of two zonal jets the southern jet flowing westward from the source to the barrier and the northern one flowing eastward back to the source the zonal jets are connected at the barrier the presence of a barrier in a gyre results in a strong current along the barrier the western boundary current the boundary current first becomes visible in the relative vorticity image in fig 4 d as very thin yellow and blue stripes along the barrier note that positive cyclonic vorticity is generated due to a no slip condition at the barrier the current separates from the barrier to join the eastward flowing jet and thus continues its circulation in the β plume gyre the most interesting feature of the boundary current is the meanders it creates right after its separation these meanders are quasi permanent they maintain their location and shape during the entire experiment in other experiments not shown here where we varied experimental parameters including the distance between the barrier and the source the salinity of water and the magnitude of forcing the meanders were a robust feature the wavelength of the meander λ m is defined as the distance between two successive crests as shown in fig 5 d in all experiments λ m was measured in a sequence of 180 aiv images spanning a period of approximately 10 rotations and was temporally averaged fig 6 compares the measured λ m with the wavelength of a stationary rossby wave in an eastward current given by eq 1 u was determined by averaging the velocity in the eastward flowing half of the β plume in the area including the two meanders fig 5 shows the flow at later times baroclinic eddies now fill the entire area of the gyre however the general pattern of the circulation including the meanders eastward of the separation point remains the same in the vicinity of the source the flow is unstable with respect to baroclinic and frontal instabilities and generates a rich variety of small vortices and thin filaments note that baroclinic flows tend to become more barotropic with time via a process of barotropization involving a cascade of energy to the barotropic mode charney 1971 smith and vallis 2001 fu and flierl 1980 hua and haidvogel 1986 this tendency was also demonstrated by direct measurements of the ratio of the barotropic to baroclinic components in rotating tank experiments with a forcing similar to the one used here matulka and afanasyev 2015 on a related note it was shown that during its evolution a baroclinic instability can result in the creation of zonal jets via a secondary instability of so called noodles alternating meridional currents berloff et al 2009a b radko et al 2014 in this experiment however smaller scale baroclinic eddies are rather passive and follow the large scale barotropic β plume 5 2 linear theory solutions of the linearized eq 6 described in section 3 give β plumes composed of rossby waves emitted by a spatially localized forcing and waves reflected from the barrier in the west visualizations of the total wavefield and its incident and reflected components allow us to understand their role in the creation of quasi permanent meanders fig 7 shows the surface elevation field η ψ ψ r f 0 g corresponding to the total stream function of the flow as well as its incident and reflected components where ψ and ψ r are computed using eqs 11 and 12 together with eq 18 fig 7 shows snapshots of these fields at t 13 rotations when the β plume elevated η yellow color stretched all the way to the barrier the supplementary video is in file videofig7 at the barrier the amplitude of the reflected wave must be of the opposite sign to that of the incident wave such that the total field vanishes η 0 the reflected wave then forms a crest just off the barrier crescent shaped yellow in fig 7 g h i it contributes to the incident wave to form a local maximum near the barrier top row in fig 7 this wave pattern is of fixed phase and is a linear precursor of a boundary current which develops between the barrier and the wave crest the current according to geostrophy flows to the north beyond the crest a trough forms and the process repeats the video sequences show that the phase of the reflected wave propagates westward while the energy propagates eastward the snapshot in fig 7 h shows a pattern of crescent shaped crests and troughs this pattern is similar to that observed eastward of the forcing area in the experiments as seen in fig 5 near the barrier a compressed fixed phase pattern of the reflected wave is established this pattern creates undulations in the total field see the top row in fig 7 and is a linear basis for quasi permanent meanders it is important to show that the reflected wave pattern is robust not just for a north south barrier but also when the barrier is at an angle to the meridional direction a case of an inclined barrier is shown in the left column of fig 7 the near wall pattern is asymmetric but still has similar structure to that of the straight barrier case the far field of the reflected wave however is quite different the wave is mainly reflected to the south east rather than straight to the east 5 3 numerical simulations laboratory experiments show the dynamics of a real fluid numerical simulations on the other hand deal with an idealized virtual fluid one advantage of numerical simulations however is the ability to expand the range of parameter values in our case the barotropic radius of deformation r d is one parameter that is very difficult to vary experimentally because it requires changing either the depth of water in the tank or the rate of rotation both of them can be varied only within a very limited range here we use a relatively simple 1 1 2 layer numerical model to explore a wider range of r d or in non dimensional form b u we also investigate the case with a free slip boundary condition at the barrier in order to see how it affects the boundary current separation and the creation of meanders yet another of our numerical runs is performed for parameters simulating those in the ocean first we start with a numerical run for which the laboratory parameters were simulated in particular the value of r d 20 cm as in midlatitudes of the tank in this simulation we do not include the baroclinic flow which is used for forcing the circulation in the experiments instead we force our virtual flow with the forcing term q given by eq 19 which approximates an anticyclonic vortex generated by the source in the experiments thus this run simulates the barotropic component of the laboratory flow only fig 8 shows the surface elevation field η with velocity vectors left column and the relative vorticity normalized by the coriolis parameter right column the supplementary video is in file videofig8 comparison of fig 8 with experimental figs 4 and 5 demonstrates that the simulated flow in the absence of baroclinic motions appears to be a rectified version of the experimental flow yet the simulated flow contains all of the main elements of the barotropic dynamics including i alternating vortices due to a short rossby wave eastward of the source ii elongated almost zonal circulation in the β plume iii the wbc and most importantly iv meanders eastward of the separation point in order to test to what extent the boundary condition at the barrier affects the boundary current separation and the creation of meanders we run a simulation with the same laboratory like parameters as the first one but with a free slip condition at the barrier fig 9 shows the same main features of the flow as in the no slip run in fig 8 except that there no positive yellow vorticity is created at the barrier and the boundary current or at least a part of it continues to flow along the barrier and separates only at its tip the supplementary video is in file videofig9 however the meanders still occur at approximately the same location where the eastward jet start its flow back to the source the meanders are similar in shape and size to those observed in the previous run with the no slip condition these results suggest that a no slip boundary condition can contribute to an earlier separation of wbc but it is not necessary for the creation of the quasi steady meanders to investigate the dependence of the wavelength of meanders λ m on the main control parameters we performed a series of 20 simulations where both the radius of deformation and the size of the forcing were varied 2 cm r d 20 cm and 2 cm r f 10 cm measured values of λ m are plotted in fig 6 as a function of the theoretical estimate eq 1 the speed of the eastward current u was determined in the same manner as in the experiments by averaging over the area containing the meanders fig 6 shows that λ m measured both in the simulations and in the experiments agrees well with the theoretical estimate a visual comparison of the flows observed in the experiments fig 4 or simulations fig 8 with linear flows with a north south barrier as shown in the middle column of fig 7 shows that while the linear flows are symmetric flows in the experiments or simulations develop an asymmetry with respect to the y 0 axis in particular meanders occur only in the northern branch of gyres the reason for the asymmetry is clearly an advection in the gyres to demonstrate a gradual transition of flows from the linear to non linear regimes we performed a series of 4 simulations where the amplitude of forcing was varied from relatively low to higher values 1 1 0 3 cm s w f 2 1 0 2 cm s fig 10 shows the relative vorticity fields in these simulations when the gyres are fully developed at t 80 rotations each gyre consists of westward and eastward jets in their southern and northern branches respectively in the relative vorticity images the axes of the jets are in between the positive yellow and negative blue bands of vorticity rossby waves reflected from the barrier carry energy eastward but their phase still propagates westward the westward current in the southern branch then carries the wave phase even faster toward the barrier the boundary current which can be identified as bright yellow and blue strips of vorticity next to the barrier becomes compressed at the southern flank of the gyre the situation is reversed at the northern flank where waves propagate upstream of the eastward current as a consequence a certain wavelength is selected according to eq 1 panel a in fig 10 is closest to a purely linear flow as shown in fig 7 the effects of advection become increasingly more significant with larger forcing see panels b d in fig 10 it is also interesting that when the amplitude of forcing is larger the flow becomes unstable at the forcing area the flow breaks into a chain of alternating vortices as seen in fig 10 d which then propagate westward within the southern branch of the gyre the supplementary videos are in files videofig10a videofig10b videofig10c and videofig10d respectively 6 conclusions the laboratory experiments described herein model basin scale subtropical gyres where the flow is driven by the wind stress due to high pressure atmospheric systems in the experiments the forcing is modeled by a spatially localized source the lab flows have all of the key elements of the gyre dynamics including β plumes envelopes of rossby waves and western boundary currents these experiments demonstrate the evolution of gyres starting from time zero when the forcing is turned on this process is difficult if even possible to observe in the ocean but it can be observed in great detail in our laboratory using an optical altimetry system these observations give insight into how certain features of the circulation in particular the quasi permanent meanders are formed the experiments were supplemented by numerical simulations using a 1 1 2 layer model to explore a wider range of control parameters in particular the radius of deformation r d the results of our experiments and simulations are as follows 1 quasi permanent meanders are a robust feature of the flows and were observed in all of our flows typically two distinct meanders are created similar to those observed in the kuroshio extension 2 the meanders are caused by a fixed phase pattern of rossby waves reflected from the barrier as shown by the linear theory described in section 5 2 3 the meanders occur only in the northern branch of the gyre in the eastward jet as in the kuroshio extension the reason for this asymmetry is advection by a mean flow as shown by the experiments and simulations described in sections 5 1 and 5 3 in the southern branch of the gyre in the westward current rossby waves reflected from the barrier are swept by the current toward the barrier while the envelopes and hence energy of the reflected waves propagate to the east their phase still propagates to the west thus in the southern branch phase locking with the mean current is not possible the situation is reversed in the northern branch where the phase propagates upstream 4 the wavelength of meanders is selected from the rossby wave spectrum under the condition of stationarity of the westward propagating phase in an eastward current which is in agreement with mizuno and white 1983 who demonstrated this for the kuroshio extension 5 contrary to the interpretation by mizuno and white 1983 that the meanders of the kuroshio extension are lee wave meanders occurring in the current flowing over the izu ridge we believe that the mechanism is more general and these meanders are due to rossby waves reflected from a western boundary in all of our experiments and simulations meanders were observed without a current flowing over topography the wavelength selection mechanism however works just the same in this case the izu ridge is likely to be responsible for the reflection of rossby waves especially barotropic ones to a greater extent than the coast of japan in this region finally our results point out why similar quasi permanent meanders are not observed in the kuroshio s twin in the atlantic ocean the gulf stream path of the gulf stream after it passes the cape hatteras still follows quite closely the continental shelf break such that the current only truly separates after the grand banks at that point the coast and the bottom topography which act as barriers reflecting rossby waves are northward of the gulf stream and are mainly zonal rather than meridional as in the case of the kuroshio declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

23797,tide gauge data indicated that ocean waves were generated by the eruption of the hunga tonga hunga ha apai volcano on january 15 2022 these high amplitude waves reached the japanese coast earlier than expected for free ocean waves these fluctuations in sea level were reasonably reproduced by an ocean model with realistic bottom topography forced by sea level pressure perturbations well reproduced by atmospheric general circulation models while early arrival times are associated with atmospheric lamb waves the amplitude of the sea level changes cannot be fully explained by the resonance mechanism associated with sea level pressure fluctuations of lamb and pekeris waves alone rather resonance due to atmospheric waves in conjunction with the amplification effects caused by a steep continental slope is required in order to reproduce sea level fluctuations along the japanese coast in particular the deep northwest pacific basin to the east of japan is important for strengthening the amplitude of the meteorological tsunami keywords meteorological tsunami pekeris wave lamb wave volcanic eruption proudman resonance numerical simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a massive eruption of the hunga tonga hunga ha apai volcano in tonga on january 15 2022 caused atmospheric pressure waves to travel around the globe e g adam 2022 otsuka 2022 and ocean waves to propagate across the pacific ocean e g gusman and roger 2022 kubo et al 2022 less than 8 hours after the eruption the first pressure pulses were observed along the japanese archipelago approximately 8000 km away from the volcano this arrival time was approximately two hours earlier than the free wave expected for tsunami propagation similar phenomena were reported for the 1883 eruption of the krakatoa volcano in indonesia symons 1888 where the first pressure pulse was identified as a lamb wave with a phase velocity of 310 m s taylor 1929 to explain the variations in sea level associated with that eruption an amplification mechanism for ocean waves coupled with atmospheric waves was proposed e g harkrider and press 1967 press and harkrider 1966 during the 2022 eruption in tonga the sea level pressure slp anomaly measured over japan was approximately 2 hpa which as a purely hydrostatic response is equivalent to a change in water level of 2 cm however the actual change in sea level on the japanese coast was considerably larger sekizawa and kohyama 2022 examined the amplification of sea surface fluctuations caused by the tonga eruption based on one dimensional 1d calculations their study showed the importance of amplification due to near proudman resonance over deep basins and the shoaling effect over the continental slope tanioka et al 2022 also performed 1d simulations and showed that the wavelength of the atmospheric pressure pulse crossing the japan trench was sensitive to the amplification of the air sea coupled waves however it is not clear whether such wave amplifications occur in a more realistic situation the present study aims to clarify why significant changes in sea level were observed using more realistic estimates of bottom topography and sea level pressure perturbations following the eruption which are reproduced by atmospheric general circulation models to explain the variations observed in sea level along japanese coast we focus on two amplification mechanisms of ocean waves which have been discussed in previous studies first we address the resonant coupling to slp perturbations that excite an ocean wave hibiya and kajiura 1982 saito et al 2021 in particular when the phase speed of atmospheric waves approaches that of ocean waves the ocean waves increase significantly in size this type of phenomenon has been referred to as a meteorological tsunami or a meteo tsunami e g rabinovich and monserrat 1996 vilibic et al 2016 heidarzadeh et al 2020 in the tonga eruption an atmospheric gravity wave referred to as a pekeris wave which has slower phase velocities than a lamb wave was also observed watanabe et al 2022 although the amplitude of the observed pekeris wave was smaller than that of the lamb wave its phase speed was approximately 230 m s watanabe et al 2022 which is very close to the average phase speed of free waves in the ocean at approximately 5300 m depth in the shallow water equation therefore pekeris waves may contribute significantly to the amplification of meteorological tsunamis in the northwest pacific basin east of japan at a depth of roughly 5000 to 6000 m fig 1 we also examined the transmitted and reflected free waves associated with incoming meteorological tsunamis due to the step like continental slope garrett 1970 suggested that waves that are transmitted into the shallow continental shelf played a central role in the increased amplitude of the sea level fluctuations observed during the 1883 krakatoa volcanic eruption two atmospheric general circulation models the japanese atmospheric general circulation model for upper atmosphere research jaguar and the nonhydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model nicam have been shown to reproduce the slp perturbations in lamb and pekeris waves due to the major eruption of the volcano in tonga reasonably well watanabe et al 2022 nakano et al in preparation in this study we applied the slp disturbances during the tonga eruption reproduced by these atmospheric models as forcings to drive the ocean model and clarify the underlying mechanisms related to the meteorological tsunami that reached the japanese coastal region focusing on the steep continental slopes the atmospheric disturbances from tonga cross the sea of japan beyond the japanese archipelago e g dolgikh et al 2022 watanabe et al 2022 and may generate similar meteorological tsunamis in the sea of japan however this study focuses on the pacific side of japan which faces a deep ocean basin where the amplification of meteorological tsunamis is expected to be significant 2 model and experiments this study used the ocean component model coco5 hasumi 2006 the basic equations consist of momentum equations using boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations tracer equations for temperature and salinity the equation of state for seawater and the continuity equation representing the conservation of fluid volume uniform seawater density is assumed and the tracer calculations are omitted in this study their discretization is based on the arakawa b grid system horizontally and the z coordinate system vertically the model covers the global oceans using a tri polar horizontal coordinate system and has a nominal horizontal resolution of 10 km to resolve the continental shelves the vertical levels number 62 with partial step representation in the z coordinate the model topography data were derived from data with a 1 minute spatial resolution etopo1 ngdc 2009 the northwest pacific basin which has a depth of 6000 m to the east of japan and the izu ogasawara i o ridge which extends southward from japan are both represented in the model topography fig 1 to reproduce the sea surface height ssh fluctuations we integrated the ocean model for 12 hours from an initial resting state at 4 15 on january 15 2022 utc with only slp perturbations due to the volcanic eruption computed in jaguar and nicam as forcing jaguar has a horizontal resolution of approximately 5 km 340 vertical levels and a model top height of 150 km while nicam has a horizontal resolution of approximately 7 km 181 vertical levels and a model top height of 85 km these atmospheric experiments have initially set a temperature anomaly with a magnitude of 100 k in the troposphere above the volcano as a thermal disturbance of the eruption details of volcanic eruption experiments on the atmospheric model are described in watanabe et al 2022 the slp perturbation fields are calculated every minute from the difference between the cases with and without the initial thermal disturbance at the time of the eruption watanabe et al 2022 nakano et al in preparation figs 2 and 3 show the propagation of slp anomalies in the two atmospheric models from tonga to kushiro station 1 in fig 1 and kushimoto station 3 in japan both models are able to represent the lamb and pekeris waves reaching japan fig 4 shows the vertical structure of the wavefronts we have identified as the lamb and pekeris waves in jaguar and nicam specifically shown in the figure are instantaneous vertical profiles at about 5 h after the eruption for the wind velocity anomaly away from tonga v scaled by p p s 2 7 where p s and p are sea surface pressure and atmospheric pressure respectively the scaling in the vertical we applied is based on the idealized inviscid lamb wave solution for an isothermal mean state lamb mode has a nearly constant magnitude throughout the troposphere and the stratosphere by contrast the pekeris mode profile has a node at about 60 80 hpa and has an amplitude which is stronger in the stratosphere and mesosphere than in the troposphere these features are basically consistent with those of the pekeris mode obtained by the theoretical solution as a ducted mode surrounded by two temperature minima at the tropopause and mesopause salby 1979 1980 watanabe et al 2022 the phase velocity of the lamb wave is approximately 300 m s for both models the two solid lines indicate the lamb wave in figs 2 and 3 with trends of 300 m s and 305 m s obtained for the upper and lower lines respectively meanwhile the phase velocity of the pekeris wave is slightly faster for jaguar than for nicam the two dashed lines in figs 2 and 3 show pekeris waves where the upper and lower lines correspond to phase velocities of 230 m s and 250 m s for jaguar and 220 m s and 240 m s for nicam respectively the atmospheric model also shows the propagation of atmospheric signals slower than pekeris waves but this is not the subject of this study and will not be discussed further the differences in the phase velocity and vertical structure of the pekeris wave between the two models are probably due to the differences in the top height of the models the top elevation of nicam is lower than that of jaguar and the temperature minima of the mesopause are not fully reproduced in nicam therefore nicam may have a shallower vertical structure equivalent depth and a slightly slower propagation velocity of the pekeris wave compared with jaguar it is useful to understand the range of uncertainty in the characteristics of pekeris waves and the meteorological tsunamis they produce due to differences in the structure of atmospheric models hereafter experiments driven by jaguar are referred to as exp jaguar and those driven by nicam as exp nicam the propagation of slp anomalies for the two great circle paths are similar but the ocean topography through which they pass differs significantly for the pathway to kushiro the water depth suddenly becomes shallower from the deep northeast pacific basin with a depth of 6000 m to the coastal shelf of japan fig 1 on the other hand the path toward kushimoto crosses more uneven topography around the izu ogasawara i o ridge and the shikoku basin which has a depth of 4000 m fig 1 we conducted an additional experiment using a 500 km smoothed topography to investigate the effect of steep continental slopes on coastal sea level fluctuations this horizontal smoothing scale is comparable to the scale in the direction of propagation of atmospheric pressure anomalies of approximately 200 km no transmitted or reflected free waves would be generated on a scale much larger than a wavelength of the atmospheric pressure pulse garrett 1970 these experiments are referred to as exp jaguar smooth and exp nicam smooth in addition to the above experiments to investigate the response of free ocean waves we also performed experiments without the sea level pressure perturbations and with sea level anomaly of the gaussian distribution f r a 1 2 π e x p r 2 2 r 2 as an initial condition where r is the distance from the volcano a 30 m r 30 km where a is the magnitude of the initial sea level anomaly and r is the horizontal width of the signal this experiment is referred to as exp fw 3 results 3 1 coastal sea level fluctuations the model simulated changes in sea level and ocean bottom pressure around the japanese coast fit after the 2022 eruption in tonga reasonably well with the fluctuations with a period of about one hour observed by coastal tide gauges and ocean bottom pressure gauges except at a few sites fig 5 the tide gauge data were obtained from a preliminary report of sea level observations conducted by the japan meteorological agency and the ocean bottom pressure data were obtained from s net nied 2019b and donet nied 2019a we have selected two stations far enough off the coast of kushiro and kushimoto for comparison with the model from the ocean bottom observation networks a and b in fig 1 kubo et al 2022 have detected the propagation of two significant ocean disturbances in relation to the atmospheric disturbance due to the tonga eruption from the ocean bottom pressure data of s net and donet l and p in fig 5 these two ocean disturbances are also seen in the model results fig 5 the arrival time of the first signal for the simulations is approximately 10 20 min earlier than observed l in fig 5 which could be attributed to uncertainties regarding the time of the eruption in the atmospheric model the free waves arrive several hours after the first sea level change indicating that this meteorological tsunami arrived earlier than normal tsunamis depending on the amplitudes of atmospheric forcing of the lamb waves the first signal of the associated ocean wave for exp jaguar is larger than that for exp nicam but both are comparable to field observations however the amplitude of sea level fluctuations associated with the pekeris wave which arrives two to three hours after the first wave is well reproduced at two tide gauge stations of kushiro st 1 and miyako st 2 and the bottom pressure gauge stations p in fig 5 fig 6 shows the sea level fluctuations obtained for the 500 km smoothed topography focusing on waves faster than the free waves the arrival time of the waves is almost the same as in the original case but the amplitudes of coastal sea level fluctuations become smaller than those obtained for the original topography suggesting that the steep coastal topography is essential for reproducing the observed variations in sea level meanwhile the arrival time of free ocean waves was faster for the smoothed topography likely because the phase speed of ocean waves depends on the square root of depth fig 6 the observed 15 to 30 min period fluctuations observed at kushimoto st 3 and tosa shimizu st 4 are consistent with the secondary undulations constrained by the intrinsic period of the fine scale topography such as bays which is not reproduced by the model resolution employed in this study the tide station at kushiro st 1 faces the open ocean and the tide station at miyako st 2 is located at the mouth of miyako bay which means that it is less affected by secondary undulations since this study aims to understand the mechanism of meteorological tsunamis reaching the coast secondary oscillations due to complicated coastal topography will not be further discussed in the next section we address the simulated meteorological tsunami from tonga to kushiro st 1 and kushimoto st 3 3 2 the propagation of the meteorological tsunami from tonga fig 7 shows the distance time cross section of the simulated ssh anomaly from tonga to kushiro st 1 forced by the jaguar and nicam slp anomalies in addition to the atmospheric waves the pulse like signals of ssh can be seen propagating away from tonga more than approximately 5000 km from tonga significant wave propagation can be seen from tonga and reflected wave propagation from the kushiro coast on the other hand within approximately 4000 km from tonga more complex wave propagation characteristics can be observed closer to tonga which might be attributed to complex bottom topography under both slp boundary conditions the phase speed of the first signals arriving at the japanese coast is approximately 300 m s which corresponds to the speed of lamb waves l in fig 7 between the two dashed lines shown in fig 6 we can also observe the propagation of ocean waves with a phase velocity corresponding to that of atmospheric pekeris waves p in fig 7 this phase speed is approximately 240 m s in exp jaguar and approximately 230 m s in exp nicam the ssh signals travel faster than the phase speed of the free waves and can be considered to indicate a meteorological tsunami free waves reached kushiro at about 0 30 on january 16 2022 utc in exp jaguar f in fig 7a the arrival time shifts earlier in the case of the smoothed topography the lack of similar features in exp nicam may be due to differences in slps in the early stages of the eruption fig 2 on the path from tonga to kushimoto st 3 the meteorological tsunami appears to be disturbed by the complex uneven ocean bottom topography near japan fig 8 for both the exp jaguar and exp nicam experiments free oceanic waves are separated from meteorological tsunamis associated with lamb waves approximately 7000 km from tonga s in fig 8 these findings suggest that the free transmitted waves were generated by the step like topographic structure corresponding to the i o ridge focusing on pekeris waves the propagation of meteorological tsunamis appears to be intermittent especially for exp jaguar conversely no such free wave generation is observed in the smoothed topography scenario and the meteorological tsunami reaches kushimoto directly 3 3 amplitude of meteorological tsunamis figs 9 and 10 show the amplitudes of the lamb and the pekeris waves along the paths from tonga to kushiro st 1 in figs 2 and 3 these amplitudes are defined by the maximum absolute value between the two solid lines for the lamb waves and the two dashed lines for the pekeris waves as mentioned in section 3 2 accurately assessing ocean wave variations around tonga is complex and challenging consequently these amplitudes were assessed at locations more than 5000 km away from tonga the amplitude of the lamb wave reaching kushiro is approximately 2 4 hpa for jaguar and approximately 0 9 hpa for nicam which is equivalent to a 2 4 cm and 0 9 cm drop in ssh in the hydrostatic pressure response respectively however the corresponding ocean wave amplitudes in the northwest pacific basin are 4 7 cm for exp jaguar and 1 8 cm for exp nicam before increasing to 11 4 cm and 4 7 cm at kushiro respectively table 1 meanwhile the amplitudes of the pekeris waves obtained for jaguar and nicam are 0 2 hpa and 0 42 hpa respectively which is approximately half to one order of magnitude smaller than those of the lamb waves fig 10 the amplitudes of the ocean waves related to the pekeris waves are 1 9 cm for exp jaguar and 2 3 cm for exp nicam in the northwest pacific basin increasing to 18 6 cm and 18 6 cm for exp jaguar and exp nicam at kushiro respectively table 1 fig 10 these amplitudes are more significant than ocean waves caused by the lamb waves the abrupt increase in size of ocean waves off kushiro as seen in the two atmospheric wave responses is not observed in the smoothed topography experiment table 1 figs 9 10 suggesting the influence of a steep continental slope in the sea level fluctuation at kushiro next we focus on the great circle path from tonga to kushimoto st 3 which reaches the japanese coast via the i o ridge and the 4000 m deep shikoku basin the amplitudes of the lamb waves to kushimoto are almost the same as those to kushiro meanwhile the amplitudes of the pekeris waves are approximately 0 24 hpa for jaguar and 0 27 hpa for nicam differences in the amplitude of pekeris waves by different paths may depend on differences in the atmospheric background field watanabe et al 2022 the amplitudes of the meteorological tsunami for lamb waves are 2 2 cm for exp jaguar and 0 7 cm for exp nicam in the shikoku basin table 2 the amplitudes of these tsunamis increased further to 9 6 cm and 3 4 cm for exp jaguar and exp nicam at kushimoto respectively the amplitude of ocean waves related to pekeris waves is approximately 1 5 to 2 cm for both boundary conditions in the shikoku basin increasing to 5 7 cm for jaguar and 4 8 cm for nicam at kushimoto the abrupt increase in ssh in the coastal area could indicate that the steep continental slope plays a considerable role in coastal sea level fluctuations 4 discussion 4 1 amplification of meteorological tsunamis the atmospheric pressure disturbance generates a meteorological tsunami as simulated by the ocean model in the case of 1d propagation in the x direction a traveling slp perturbation p s p 0 f t x v generates an ocean wave with an ssh perturbation e g proudman 1929 as follows 4 1 η 1 1 v 2 c 2 p 0 ρ g f t x v where p 0 is the amplitude of the slp perturbation t is time v is the phase velocity of slp perturbation and c denotes the phase velocity of free wave given as g h under the shallow water approximation h is ocean depth ρ is ocean density and g is the gravity acceleration the ratio of the amplitude of the excited ocean waves to the atmospheric perturbation is defined as an amplification factor and estimated as follows 4 2 η η 0 1 1 v 2 c 2 where η 0 is p 0 ρ g in the hydrostatic response applying this equation to waves propagating from tonga to japan the phase speed of lamb waves is estimated to be approximately 300 m s for both jaguar and nicam and the depth of the northwest pacific basin is about 5770 m on the way to kushiro and the depth of the shikoku basin is about 3960 m on the way to kushimoto therefore the amplification factors of meteorological tsunamis due to the lamb wave are 1 9 in the northwest pacific basin and 0 8 for kushimoto respectively these values are consistent with ocean model simulations for the pathway to kushiro and kushimoto figs 9d 11d since the phase velocities of lamb waves in jaguar and nicam are the same these amplification factors for exp jaguar are in good agreement with those of exp nicam regardless of the amplitude of the lamb waves on the other hand the phase speeds of the pekeris waves in jaguar and nicam are different and their amplification factors do not match each other the average phase speed of the pekeris wave is approximately 240 m s for jaguar and approximately 230 m s for nicam the estimated amplification factor for meteorological tsunamis toward kushiro is 25 for jaguar and 8 4 for nicam in the 6000 m deep northwest pacific basin the estimated amplification factor agrees well with the result in exp nicam but not so well for exp jaguar table 1 fig 10d the phase velocity of the pekeris wave 240 cm s in jagaur is very close to the phase velocity of free waves in the northwest pacific basin thus the resonance condition is expected to be satisfied in this case we need to consider the temporal evolution of the amplitude of meteorological tsunamis as an initial value problem the model simulated amplification factor increases from 8 9 to 13 5 for exp jaguar and 7 5 to 17 0 for exp jaguar smooth when passing over the northwest pacific basin table 1 fig 10 hibiya and kajiura 1982 estimated the maximum elevation of ssh δ η in the case of resonance as follows 4 3 δ η δ η 0 l x f 2 where x f is the travel distance of the wave and l is the distance between the front and the maximum pressure when l of the pekeris wave is 100 km and x f is 3000 km the amplification factor is 15 which is consistent with the amplification factor crossing northwest pacific basin in exp jaguar focusing on the meteorological tsunami from tonga to kushimoto due to pekeris waves the amplification factor estimated by eq 4 2 varies significantly depending on the ocean depth the model simulation shows that the amplification factor is approximately 6 in the shikoku basin table 2 fig 12d 4 2 effects of the steep continental slope in both exp jaguar and exp nicam the amplitude of ocean waves becomes very large just before they reach kushiro and kushimoto on the other hand the results from exp jaguar smooth and exp nicam smooth show no such amplification in the coastal region to explain the amplification of ocean waves in steep topography we discuss reflected and transmitted waves when meteorological tsunamis are incident on steep continental slopes we consider a 1d step like continental slope that becomes shallow abruptly from h 1 to h 2 in depth at x 0 following garrett 1970 as the direction of propagation of the atmospheric wave is positive the ssh and barotropic ocean velocity perturbations in an ocean basin with a depth of h 1 x 0 can be obtained as follows 4 4 η c 1 2 η 0 c 1 2 v 2 f t x v a f t x c 1 4 5 u c 1 g η 0 c 1 2 v 2 f t x v g a c 1 f t x c 1 and in a continental shelf with a depth of h 2 x 0 as follows 4 6 η c 1 2 η 0 c 1 2 v 2 f t x v b f t x c 2 4 7 u c 2 g η 0 c 2 2 v 2 f t x v g b c 2 f t x c 2 where c 1 and c 2 are the phase velocity of free wave given as g h 1 and g h 2 the first term on the right hand side of these equations represents a meteorological tsunami as in eq 4 1 the second term on the right hand side of these equations represents the reflected and transmitted free waves respectively with only the latter reaching the japanese coast since the horizontal water transport uh and ssh deviation are continuous at a continental slope x 0 the amplification factor of the transmitted wave to the hydrostatic pressure response is as follows 4 8 b η 0 v 2 c 1 c 2 v c 1 v 2 c 2 2 if a meteorological tsunami due to a lamb wave with a phase velocity of 300 m s is incident on a continental shelf at a depth of 100 700 m from a 6000 m deep ocean basin then the amplification factor of the transmitted free wave is 3 91 3 18 meanwhile if the meteorological tsunami is incident on a continental shelf at a depth of 100 700 m from a 4000 m deep ocean basin then the amplification factor of the transmitted free wave is 1 70 to 1 26 such amplification near the coast is also shown in the model results the amplification factor at kushiro due to lamb waves is 4 8 for exp jaguar and 5 7 for exp nicam meanwhile the amplification factor becomes 1 8 for exp jaguar smooth and 2 4 for exp nicam smooth when the steep continental slopes are smoothed table 1 fig 9d at kushimoto which faces the shikoku basin with a depth of 4000 m the amplification factor is 3 9 for exp jaguar and 3 7 for exp nicam but the amplification factor becomes 0 7 for exp jaguar smooth and 0 8 for exp nicam smooth table 2 fig 11d although garret s theory could explain much of the amplification observed in coastal sea levels it may not be sufficient since the coast in the model is a free end the reflection of free waves at the coast should also explain some of the large amplitude focusing on the pekeris wave if the phase velocity is 240 m s which is seen in jaguar the depth of the continental shelf is 200 m and the depth of the ocean basin is 6000 m the amplification factor can be estimated by eq 4 8 to be 41 9 meanwhile if the phase velocity is 230 m s seen in nicam the depth of the continental shelf is 200 m and the depth of the ocean basin is 6000 m then the amplification factor can be estimated to be 13 9 the amplification factor at kushiro is 100 5 for exp jaguar and 45 6 for exp nicam however the amplification factor becomes 44 4 for exp jaguar smooth and 24 1 for exp nicam smooth table 1 fig 10d suggesting that the steep topography appears to be responsible for the increase in the amplitude of coastal sea level fluctuations the discrepancy seen in the estimate obtained using eq 4 8 may be due to amplification of the resonance of the meteorological tsunami furthermore the amplification factor at kushimoto is 23 3 for exp jaguar and 16 6 for exp nicam becoming 12 5 for exp jaguar smooth and 12 7 for exp nicam smooth table 2 fig 12d the sharp uneven topography of the i o ridge seems to disrupt the resonant amplification of meteorological tsunamis to kushimoto caused by pekeris waves 5 conclusions in this study we show that the propagation of both pekeris and lamb waves was essential for the meteorological tsunamis that reached japan following the major eruption of the tongan volcano in 2022 the ocean model simulations show that proudman resonances in the deep northwest pacific basin near japan and the steep topography of the continental slope play critical roles in amplifying meteorological tsunamis the amplification of meteorological tsunamis associated with pekeris waves requires solving the initial value problem and the magnitude of the amplification depends on the propagation distance the amplitude of the meteorological tsunami associated with the lamb wave is explained by the propagation of the slp perturbation near japan whereas reproducing the amplitude of the meteorological tsunami associated with the pekeris wave requires a propagation distance of approximately 3000 km in addition the steep topography of the izu ogasawara ridge may have weakened the amplification of the meteorological tsunamis due to resonance credit authorship contribution statement tatsuo suzuki conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original

23797,tide gauge data indicated that ocean waves were generated by the eruption of the hunga tonga hunga ha apai volcano on january 15 2022 these high amplitude waves reached the japanese coast earlier than expected for free ocean waves these fluctuations in sea level were reasonably reproduced by an ocean model with realistic bottom topography forced by sea level pressure perturbations well reproduced by atmospheric general circulation models while early arrival times are associated with atmospheric lamb waves the amplitude of the sea level changes cannot be fully explained by the resonance mechanism associated with sea level pressure fluctuations of lamb and pekeris waves alone rather resonance due to atmospheric waves in conjunction with the amplification effects caused by a

adam 2022 otsuka 2022 and ocean waves to propagate across the pacific ocean e g gusman and roger 2022 kubo et al 2022 less than 8 hours after the eruption the first pressure pulses were observed along the japanese archipelago approximately 8000 km away from the volcano this arrival time was approximately two hours earlier than the free wave expected for tsunami propagation similar phenomena were reported for the 1883 eruption of the krakatoa volcano in indonesia symons 1888 where the first pressure pulse was identified as a lamb wave with a phase velocity of 310 m s taylor 1929 to explain the variations in sea level associated with that eruption an amplification mechanism for ocean waves coupled with atmospheric waves was proposed e g harkrider and press 1967 press and harkrider 1966 during the 2022 eruption in tonga the sea level pressure slp anomaly measured over japan was approximately 2 hpa which as a purely hydrostatic response is equivalent to a change in water level of 2 cm however the actual change in sea level on the japanese coast was considerably larger sekizawa and kohyama 2022 examined the amplification of sea surface fluctuations caused by the tonga eruption based on one dimensional 1d calculations their study showed the importance of amplification due to near proudman resonance over deep basins and the shoaling effect over the continental slope tanioka et al 2022 also performed 1d simulations and showed that the wavelength of the atmospheric pressure pulse crossing the japan trench was sensitive to the amplification of the air sea coupled waves however it is not clear whether such wave amplifications occur in a more realistic situation the present study aims to clarify why significant changes in sea level were observed using more realistic estimates of bottom topography and sea level pressure perturbations following the eruption which are reproduced by atmospheric general circulation models to explain the variations observed in sea level along japanese coast we focus on two amplification mechanisms of ocean waves which have been discussed in previous studies first we address the resonant coupling to slp perturbations that excite an ocean wave hibiya and kajiura 1982 saito et al 2021 in particular when the phase speed of atmospheric waves approaches that of ocean waves the ocean waves increase significantly in size this type of phenomenon has been referred to as a meteorological tsunami or a meteo tsunami e g rabinovich and monserrat 1996 vilibic et al 2016 heidarzadeh et al 2020 in the tonga eruption an atmospheric gravity wave referred to as a pekeris wave which has slower phase velocities than a lamb wave was also observed watanabe et al 2022 although the amplitude of the observed pekeris wave was smaller than that of the lamb wave its phase speed was approximately 230 m s watanabe et al 2022 which is very close to the average phase speed of free waves in the ocean at approximately 5300 m depth in the shallow water equation therefore pekeris waves may contribute significantly to the amplification of meteorological tsunamis in the northwest pacific basin east of japan at a depth of roughly 5000 to 6000 m fig 1 we also examined the transmitted and reflected free waves associated with incoming meteorological tsunamis due to the step like continental slope garrett 1970 suggested that waves that are transmitted into the shallow continental shelf played a central role in the increased amplitude of the sea level fluctuations observed during the 1883 krakatoa volcanic eruption two atmospheric general circulation models the japanese atmospheric general circulation model for upper atmosphere research jaguar and the nonhydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model nicam have been shown to reproduce the slp perturbations in lamb and pekeris waves due to the major eruption of the volcano in tonga reasonably well watanabe et al 2022 nakano et al in preparation in this study we applied the slp disturbances during the tonga eruption reproduced by these atmospheric models as forcings to drive the ocean model and clarify the underlying mechanisms related to the meteorological tsunami that reached the japanese coastal region focusing on the steep continental slopes the atmospheric disturbances from tonga cross the sea of japan beyond the japanese archipelago e g dolgikh et al 2022 watanabe et al 2022 and may generate similar meteorological tsunamis in the sea of japan however this study focuses on the pacific side of japan which faces a deep ocean basin where the amplification of meteorological tsunamis is expected to be significant 2 model and experiments this study used the ocean component model coco5 hasumi 2006 the basic equations consist of momentum equations using boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations tracer equations for temperature and salinity the equation of state for seawater and the continuity equation representing the conservation of fluid volume uniform seawater density is assumed and the tracer calculations are omitted in this study their discretization is based on the arakawa b grid system horizontally and the z coordinate system vertically the model covers the global oceans using a tri polar horizontal coordinate system and has a nominal horizontal resolution of 10 km to resolve the continental shelves the vertical levels number 62 with partial step representation in the z coordinate the model topography data were derived from data with a 1 minute spatial resolution etopo1 ngdc 2009 the northwest pacific basin which has a depth of 6000 m to the east of japan and the izu ogasawara i o ridge which extends southward from japan are both represented in the model topography fig 1 to reproduce the sea surface height ssh fluctuations we integrated the ocean model for 12 hours from an initial resting state at 4 15 on january 15 2022 utc with only slp perturbations due to the volcanic eruption computed in jaguar and nicam as forcing jaguar has a horizontal resolution of approximately 5 km 340 vertical levels and a model top height of 150 km while nicam has a horizontal resolution of approximately 7 km 181 vertical levels and a model top height of 85 km these atmospheric experiments have initially set a temperature anomaly with a magnitude of 100 k in the troposphere above the volcano as a thermal disturbance of the eruption details of volcanic eruption experiments on the atmospheric model are described in watanabe et al 2022 the slp perturbation fields are calculated every minute from the difference between the cases with and without the initial thermal disturbance at the time of the eruption watanabe et al 2022 nakano et al in preparation figs 2 and 3 show the propagation of slp anomalies in the two atmospheric models from tonga to kushiro station 1 in fig 1 and kushimoto station 3 in japan both models are able to represent the lamb and pekeris waves reaching japan fig 4 shows the vertical structure of the wavefronts we have identified as the lamb and pekeris waves in jaguar and nicam specifically shown in the figure are instantaneous vertical profiles at about 5 h after the eruption for the wind velocity anomaly away from tonga v scaled by p p s 2 7 where p s and p are sea surface pressure and atmospheric pressure respectively the scaling in the vertical we applied is based on the idealized inviscid lamb wave solution for an isothermal mean state lamb mode has a nearly constant magnitude throughout the troposphere and the stratosphere by contrast the pekeris mode profile has a node at about 60 80 hpa and has an amplitude which is stronger in the stratosphere and mesosphere than in the troposphere these features are basically consistent with those of the pekeris mode obtained by the theoretical solution as a ducted mode surrounded by two temperature minima at the tropopause and mesopause salby 1979 1980 watanabe et al 2022 the phase velocity of the lamb wave is approximately 300 m s for both models the two solid lines indicate the lamb wave in figs 2 and 3 with trends of 300 m s and 305 m s obtained for the upper and lower lines respectively meanwhile the phase velocity of the pekeris wave is slightly faster for jaguar than for nicam the two dashed lines in figs 2 and 3 show pekeris waves where the upper and lower lines correspond to phase velocities of 230 m s and 250 m s for jaguar and 220 m s and 240 m s for nicam respectively the atmospheric model also shows the propagation of atmospheric signals slower than pekeris waves but this is not the subject of this study and will not be discussed further the differences in the phase velocity and vertical structure of the pekeris wave between the two models are probably due to the differences in the top height of the models the top elevation of nicam is lower than that of jaguar and the temperature minima of the mesopause are not fully reproduced in nicam therefore nicam may have a shallower vertical structure equivalent depth and a slightly slower propagation velocity of the pekeris wave compared with jaguar it is useful to understand the range of uncertainty in the characteristics of pekeris waves and the meteorological tsunamis they produce due to differences in the structure of atmospheric models hereafter experiments driven by jaguar are referred to as exp jaguar and those driven by nicam as exp nicam the propagation of slp anomalies for the two great circle paths are similar but the ocean topography through which they pass differs significantly for the pathway to kushiro the water depth suddenly becomes shallower from the deep northeast pacific basin with a depth of 6000 m to the coastal shelf of japan fig 1 on the other hand the path toward kushimoto crosses more uneven topography around the izu ogasawara i o ridge and the shikoku basin which has a depth of 4000 m fig 1 we conducted an additional experiment using a 500 km smoothed topography to investigate the effect of steep continental slopes on coastal sea level fluctuations this horizontal smoothing scale is comparable to the scale in the direction of propagation of atmospheric pressure anomalies of approximately 200 km no transmitted or reflected free waves would be generated on a scale much larger than a wavelength of the atmospheric pressure pulse garrett 1970 these experiments are referred to as exp jaguar smooth and exp nicam smooth in addition to the above experiments to investigate the response of free ocean waves we also performed experiments without the sea level pressure perturbations and with sea level anomaly of the gaussian distribution f r a 1 2 π e x p r 2 2 r 2 as an initial condition where r is the distance from the volcano a 30 m r 30 km where a is the magnitude of the initial sea level anomaly and r is the horizontal width of the signal this experiment is referred to as exp fw 3 results 3 1 coastal sea level fluctuations the model simulated changes in sea level and ocean bottom pressure around the japanese coast fit after the 2022 eruption in tonga reasonably well with the fluctuations with a period of about one hour observed by coastal tide gauges and ocean bottom pressure gauges except at a few sites fig 5 the tide gauge data were obtained from a preliminary report of sea level observations conducted by the japan meteorological agency and the ocean bottom pressure data were obtained from s net nied 2019b and donet nied 2019a we have selected two stations far enough off the coast of kushiro and kushimoto for comparison with the model from the ocean bottom observation networks a and b in fig 1 kubo et al 2022 have detected the propagation of two significant ocean disturbances in relation to the atmospheric disturbance due to the tonga eruption from the ocean bottom pressure data of s net and donet l and p in fig 5 these two ocean disturbances are also seen in the model results fig 5 the arrival time of the first signal for the simulations is approximately 10 20 min earlier than observed l in fig 5 which could be attributed to uncertainties regarding the time of the eruption in the atmospheric model the free waves arrive several hours after the first sea level change indicating that this meteorological tsunami arrived earlier than normal tsunamis depending on the amplitudes of atmospheric forcing of the lamb waves the first signal of the associated ocean wave for exp jaguar is larger than that for exp nicam but both are comparable to field observations however the amplitude of sea level fluctuations associated with the pekeris wave which arrives two to three hours after the first wave is well reproduced at two tide gauge stations of kushiro st 1 and miyako st 2 and the bottom pressure gauge stations p in fig 5 fig 6 shows the sea level fluctuations obtained for the 500 km smoothed topography focusing on waves faster than the free waves the arrival time of the waves is almost the same as in the original case but the amplitudes of coastal sea level fluctuations become smaller than those obtained for the original topography suggesting that the steep coastal topography is essential for reproducing the observed variations in sea level meanwhile the arrival time of free ocean waves was faster for the smoothed topography likely because the phase speed of ocean waves depends on the square root of depth fig 6 the observed 15 to 30 min period fluctuations observed at kushimoto st 3 and tosa shimizu st 4 are consistent with the secondary undulations constrained by the intrinsic period of the fine scale topography such as bays which is not reproduced by the model resolution employed in this study the tide station at kushiro st 1 faces the open ocean and the tide station at miyako st 2 is located at the mouth of miyako bay which means that it is less affected by secondary undulations since this study aims to understand the mechanism of meteorological tsunamis reaching the coast secondary oscillations due to complicated coastal topography will not be further discussed in the next section we address the simulated meteorological tsunami from tonga to kushiro st 1 and kushimoto st 3 3 2 the propagation of the meteorological tsunami from tonga fig 7 shows the distance time cross section of the simulated ssh anomaly from tonga to kushiro st 1 forced by the jaguar and nicam slp anomalies in addition to the atmospheric waves the pulse like signals of ssh can be seen propagating away from tonga more than approximately 5000 km from tonga significant wave propagation can be seen from tonga and reflected wave propagation from the kushiro coast on the other hand within approximately 4000 km from tonga more complex wave propagation characteristics can be observed closer to tonga which might be attributed to complex bottom topography under both slp boundary conditions the phase speed of the first signals arriving at the japanese coast is approximately 300 m s which corresponds to the speed of lamb waves l in fig 7 between the two dashed lines shown in fig 6 we can also observe the propagation of ocean waves with a phase velocity corresponding to that of atmospheric pekeris waves p in fig 7 this phase speed is approximately 240 m s in exp jaguar and approximately 230 m s in exp nicam the ssh signals travel faster than the phase speed of the free waves and can be considered to indicate a meteorological tsunami free waves reached kushiro at about 0 30 on january 16 2022 utc in exp jaguar f in fig 7a the arrival time shifts earlier in the case of the smoothed topography the lack of similar features in exp nicam may be due to differences in slps in the early stages of the eruption fig 2 on the path from tonga to kushimoto st 3 the meteorological tsunami appears to be disturbed by the complex uneven ocean bottom topography near japan fig 8 for both the exp jaguar and exp nicam experiments free oceanic waves are separated from meteorological tsunamis associated with lamb waves approximately 7000 km from tonga s in fig 8 these findings suggest that the free transmitted waves were generated by the step like topographic structure corresponding to the i o ridge focusing on pekeris waves the propagation of meteorological tsunamis appears to be intermittent especially for exp jaguar conversely no such free wave generation is observed in the smoothed topography scenario and the meteorological tsunami reaches kushimoto directly 3 3 amplitude of meteorological tsunamis figs 9 and 10 show the amplitudes of the lamb and the pekeris waves along the paths from tonga to kushiro st 1 in figs 2 and 3 these amplitudes are defined by the maximum absolute value between the two solid lines for the lamb waves and the two dashed lines for the pekeris waves as mentioned in section 3 2 accurately assessing ocean wave variations around tonga is complex and challenging consequently these amplitudes were assessed at locations more than 5000 km away from tonga the amplitude of the lamb wave reaching kushiro is approximately 2 4 hpa for jaguar and approximately 0 9 hpa for nicam which is equivalent to a 2 4 cm and 0 9 cm drop in ssh in the hydrostatic pressure response respectively however the corresponding ocean wave amplitudes in the northwest pacific basin are 4 7 cm for exp jaguar and 1 8 cm for exp nicam before increasing to 11 4 cm and 4 7 cm at kushiro respectively table 1 meanwhile the amplitudes of the pekeris waves obtained for jaguar and nicam are 0 2 hpa and 0 42 hpa respectively which is approximately half to one order of magnitude smaller than those of the lamb waves fig 10 the amplitudes of the ocean waves related to the pekeris waves are 1 9 cm for exp jaguar and 2 3 cm for exp nicam in the northwest pacific basin increasing to 18 6 cm and 18 6 cm for exp jaguar and exp nicam at kushiro respectively table 1 fig 10 these amplitudes are more significant than ocean waves caused by the lamb waves the abrupt increase in size of ocean waves off kushiro as seen in the two atmospheric wave responses is not observed in the smoothed topography experiment table 1 figs 9 10 suggesting the influence of a steep continental slope in the sea level fluctuation at kushiro next we focus on the great circle path from tonga to kushimoto st 3 which reaches the japanese coast via the i o ridge and the 4000 m deep shikoku basin the amplitudes of the lamb waves to kushimoto are almost the same as those to kushiro meanwhile the amplitudes of the pekeris waves are approximately 0 24 hpa for jaguar and 0 27 hpa for nicam differences in the amplitude of pekeris waves by different paths may depend on differences in the atmospheric background field watanabe et al 2022 the amplitudes of the meteorological tsunami for lamb waves are 2 2 cm for exp jaguar and 0 7 cm for exp nicam in the shikoku basin table 2 the amplitudes of these tsunamis increased further to 9 6 cm and 3 4 cm for exp jaguar and exp nicam at kushimoto respectively the amplitude of ocean waves related to pekeris waves is approximately 1 5 to 2 cm for both boundary conditions in the shikoku basin increasing to 5 7 cm for jaguar and 4 8 cm for nicam at kushimoto the abrupt increase in ssh in the coastal area could indicate that the steep continental slope plays a considerable role in coastal sea level fluctuations 4 discussion 4 1 amplification of meteorological tsunamis the atmospheric pressure disturbance generates a meteorological tsunami as simulated by the ocean model in the case of 1d propagation in the x direction a traveling slp perturbation p s p 0 f t x v generates an ocean wave with an ssh perturbation e g proudman 1929 as follows 4 1 η 1 1 v 2 c 2 p 0 ρ g f t x v where p 0 is the amplitude of the slp perturbation t is time v is the phase velocity of slp perturbation and c denotes the phase velocity of free wave given as g h under the shallow water approximation h is ocean depth ρ is ocean density and g is the gravity acceleration the ratio of the amplitude of the excited ocean waves to the atmospheric perturbation is defined as an amplification factor and estimated as follows 4 2 η η 0 1 1 v 2 c 2 where η 0 is p 0 ρ g in the hydrostatic response applying this equation to waves propagating from tonga to japan the phase speed of lamb waves is estimated to be approximately 300 m s for both jaguar and nicam and the depth of the northwest pacific basin is about 5770 m on the way to kushiro and the depth of the shikoku basin is about 3960 m on the way to kushimoto therefore the amplification factors of meteorological tsunamis due to the lamb wave are 1 9 in the northwest pacific basin and 0 8 for kushimoto respectively these values are consistent with ocean model simulations for the pathway to kushiro and kushimoto figs 9d 11d since the phase velocities of lamb waves in jaguar and nicam are the same these amplification factors for exp jaguar are in good agreement with those of exp nicam regardless of the amplitude of the lamb waves on the other hand the phase speeds of the pekeris waves in jaguar and nicam are different and their amplification factors do not match each other the average phase speed of the pekeris wave is approximately 240 m s for jaguar and approximately 230 m s for nicam the estimated amplification factor for meteorological tsunamis toward kushiro is 25 for jaguar and 8 4 for nicam in the 6000 m deep northwest pacific basin the estimated amplification factor agrees well with the result in exp nicam but not so well for exp jaguar table 1 fig 10d the phase velocity of the pekeris wave 240 cm s in jagaur is very close to the phase velocity of free waves in the northwest pacific basin thus the resonance condition is expected to be satisfied in this case we need to consider the temporal evolution of the amplitude of meteorological tsunamis as an initial value problem the model simulated amplification factor increases from 8 9 to 13 5 for exp jaguar and 7 5 to 17 0 for exp jaguar smooth when passing over the northwest pacific basin table 1 fig 10 hibiya and kajiura 1982 estimated the maximum elevation of ssh δ η in the case of resonance as follows 4 3 δ η δ η 0 l x f 2 where x f is the travel distance of the wave and l is the distance between the front and the maximum pressure when l of the pekeris wave is 100 km and x f is 3000 km the amplification factor is 15 which is consistent with the amplification factor crossing northwest pacific basin in exp jaguar focusing on the meteorological tsunami from tonga to kushimoto due to pekeris waves the amplification factor estimated by eq 4 2 varies significantly depending on the ocean depth the model simulation shows that the amplification factor is approximately 6 in the shikoku basin table 2 fig 12d 4 2 effects of the steep continental slope in both exp jaguar and exp nicam the amplitude of ocean waves becomes very large just before they reach kushiro and kushimoto on the other hand the results from exp jaguar smooth and exp nicam smooth show no such amplification in the coastal region to explain the amplification of ocean waves in steep topography we discuss reflected and transmitted waves when meteorological tsunamis are incident on steep continental slopes we consider a 1d step like continental slope that becomes shallow abruptly from h 1 to h 2 in depth at x 0 following garrett 1970 as the direction of propagation of the atmospheric wave is positive the ssh and barotropic ocean velocity perturbations in an ocean basin with a depth of h 1 x 0 can be obtained as follows 4 4 η c 1 2 η 0 c 1 2 v 2 f t x v a f t x c 1 4 5 u c 1 g η 0 c 1 2 v 2 f t x v g a c 1 f t x c 1 and in a continental shelf with a depth of h 2 x 0 as follows 4 6 η c 1 2 η 0 c 1 2 v 2 f t x v b f t x c 2 4 7 u c 2 g η 0 c 2 2 v 2 f t x v g b c 2 f t x c 2 where c 1 and c 2 are the phase velocity of free wave given as g h 1 and g h 2 the first term on the right hand side of these equations represents a meteorological tsunami as in eq 4 1 the second term on the right hand side of these equations represents the reflected and transmitted free waves respectively with only the latter reaching the japanese coast since the horizontal water transport uh and ssh deviation are continuous at a continental slope x 0 the amplification factor of the transmitted wave to the hydrostatic pressure response is as follows 4 8 b η 0 v 2 c 1 c 2 v c 1 v 2 c 2 2 if a meteorological tsunami due to a lamb wave with a phase velocity of 300 m s is incident on a continental shelf at a depth of 100 700 m from a 6000 m deep ocean basin then the amplification factor of the transmitted free wave is 3 91 3 18 meanwhile if the meteorological tsunami is incident on a continental shelf at a depth of 100 700 m from a 4000 m deep ocean basin then the amplification factor of the transmitted free wave is 1 70 to 1 26 such amplification near the coast is also shown in the model results the amplification factor at kushiro due to lamb waves is 4 8 for exp jaguar and 5 7 for exp nicam meanwhile the amplification factor becomes 1 8 for exp jaguar smooth and 2 4 for exp nicam smooth when the steep continental slopes are smoothed table 1 fig 9d at kushimoto which faces the shikoku basin with a depth of 4000 m the amplification factor is 3 9 for exp jaguar and 3 7 for exp nicam but the amplification factor becomes 0 7 for exp jaguar smooth and 0 8 for exp nicam smooth table 2 fig 11d although garret s theory could explain much of the amplification observed in coastal sea levels it may not be sufficient since the coast in the model is a free end the reflection of free waves at the coast should also explain some of the large amplitude focusing on the pekeris wave if the phase velocity is 240 m s which is seen in jaguar the depth of the continental shelf is 200 m and the depth of the ocean basin is 6000 m the amplification factor can be estimated by eq 4 8 to be 41 9 meanwhile if the phase velocity is 230 m s seen in nicam the depth of the continental shelf is 200 m and the depth of the ocean basin is 6000 m then the amplification factor can be estimated to be 13 9 the amplification factor at kushiro is 100 5 for exp jaguar and 45 6 for exp nicam however the amplification factor becomes 44 4 for exp jaguar smooth and 24 1 for exp nicam smooth table 1 fig 10d suggesting that the steep topography appears to be responsible for the increase in the amplitude of coastal sea level fluctuations the discrepancy seen in the estimate obtained using eq 4 8 may be due to amplification of the resonance of the meteorological tsunami furthermore the amplification factor at kushimoto is 23 3 for exp jaguar and 16 6 for exp nicam becoming 12 5 for exp jaguar smooth and 12 7 for exp nicam smooth table 2 fig 12d the sharp uneven topography of the i o ridge seems to disrupt the resonant amplification of meteorological tsunamis to kushimoto caused by pekeris waves 5 conclusions in this study we show that the propagation of both pekeris and lamb waves was essential for the meteorological tsunamis that reached japan following the major eruption of the tongan volcano in 2022 the ocean model simulations show that proudman resonances in the deep northwest pacific basin near japan and the steep topography of the continental slope play critical roles in amplifying meteorological tsunamis the amplification of meteorological tsunamis associated with pekeris waves requires solving the initial value problem and the magnitude of the amplification depends on the propagation distance the amplitude of the meteorological tsunami associated with the lamb wave is explained by the propagation of the slp perturbation near japan whereas reproducing the amplitude of the meteorological tsunami associated with the pekeris wave requires a propagation distance of approximately 3000 km in addition the steep topography of the izu ogasawara ridge may have weakened the amplification of the meteorological tsunamis due to resonance credit authorship contribution statement tatsuo suzuki conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original

23798,langmuir circulation lc plays an important role in deepening the mixed layer especially when the ocean is weakly stratified lc parameterization has been known to improve the accuracy of the mixed layer depth sea surface temperature and ocean ventilation in the southern ocean however changes in ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes owing to lc mixing have rarely been investigated in this study we implemented lc parameterization to a physical biogeochemical coupled model and examined the changes in water properties and circulation and their effects on biogeochemical processes in the southern ocean the lc effect enhances the turbulent mixing length scale and turbulent kinetic energy especially in the subantarctic region resulting in the deepening of the mixed layer increased vertical mixing causes deeper warm and saline water to reach the surface layer and weakens the surface meridional velocity by transferring momentum deeper the weakening of the meridional velocity decreases equatorward freshwater transport causing the surface water to become saltier and denser north of 50 s adjacent to the formation site of subantarctic mode water which enhances ocean ventilation eventually additionally the weak equatorward velocity drives the retreat of sea ice south of 60 s leading to cooler and fresher water in the southern region of 60 s changes in the sea ice distribution mixed layer depth and dissolved inorganic carbon distribution alter the air sea co2 exchange suggesting that the lc parameterization in the model can ameliorate 10 of the air sea co2 exchange the lc effects on biogeochemical tracers such as iron fe and dissolved inorganic carbon are mainly determined by changes in ocean circulation and the modest improvement in primary productivity is mainly attributed to the changes in the fe distribution in the high nutrient low chlorophyll region where fe availability limits primary production although the direct lc effects occur near the surface the altered meridional circulation spreads the effects to a deeper layer and improves the overall representation of physical biogeochemical tracers and air sea co 2 exchange in the southern ocean suggesting that a simple lc parameterization can improve the ocean model keywords langmuir circulation global climate model vertical mixing freshwater transport air sea co2 exchange southern ocean data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the surface mixed layer of the ocean is an important portal for the exchange of gases and heat between the atmosphere and the ocean in particular the thick mixed layer of the southern ocean o 100 m in winter de boyer montégut et al 2004 dong et al 2008 associated with intense winds and enormous surface buoyancy fluxes plays a critical role in these exchanges as approximately 40 of the anthropogenic carbon uptake by the global ocean occurs in the southern ocean south of 40 s sabine et al 2004 sallée et al 2012 devries 2014 caldeira and duffy 2000 mikaloff fletcher et al 2006 thus an accurate estimation of the mixed layer depth mld over the southern ocean in global climate models is required for better predictability of future climate change sallée et al 2013 frölicher et al 2015 previous studies have reported that climate models generally underestimate the mld over the southern ocean causing weakening of ventilation sallée et al 2013 li et al 2016 rodgers et al 2014 noh et al 2016 one of the possible causes for the shallow mld bias during austral winters in climate models is the abnormally strong stratification by excessive freshwater input associated with ekman transport and air sea fluxes sallée et al 2013 the shallow mld bias in climate models was distinct where subantarctic mode water samw is formed and it could hinder the formation of mode water and the uptake of co2 into the interior ocean sallée et al 2013 langmuir circulation lc occurs in the form of horizontal roll vortices parallel to the wind the enhanced length and velocity scales associated with lc are known to significantly enhance vertical mixing within the mixed layer and also provide one of the most potent mechanisms for the deepening of the mixed layer leibovich 1983 hamlington et al 2014 d asaro et al 2014 kantha and clayson 2004 it has motivated studies on the effects of lc on the mld and the implementation of lc mixing into mixing schemes to improve the accuracy of mld determination over the southern ocean noh et al 2011 li et al 2016 rodgers et al 2014 noh et al 2016 for example noh et al 2011 investigated the lc effect using a large eddy simulation les and showed a significant deepening of the mld by lc under the condition of weak stratification and shallow mld the inclusion of lc parameterization in the ocean global climate model is shown to help predict the mld and sea surface temperature more accurately in the high latitude ocean while leaving the low latitude ocean relatively unaffected noh et al 2016 li et al 2016 additionally lc mixing transfers momentum deeper enabling a more realistic simulation of the antarctic circumpolar current acc noh et al 2016 fan and griffies 2014 the inclusion of lc parameterization also improves the simulation of ocean ventilation the intensity of ocean ventilation in models is often measured using chlorofluorocarbons cfcs whose concentrations in the oceans are reflective of ocean circulation and mixing england 1995 dixon et al 1996 england and hirst 1997 england and maier reimer 2001 müller et al 2006 trossman et al 2012 because the intense vertical mixing and formation of the samw in the southern ocean are the major mechanisms of the uptake and storage of chlorofluorocarbon 11 cfc 11 their underestimation can lead to a negative bias in the cfc 11 concentration as compared with observations long et al 2013 the inclusion of lc parameterization could help improve this situation li et al 2016 inclusion of lc parameterization has also been shown to increase the atlantic meridional overturning circulation through the deepening of the mld in the high latitude ocean li et al 2016 fan and griffies 2014 however effects on the other aspects of the southern ocean such as meridional circulation and freshwater transport remain unclear there have been various attempts to incorporate lc effects into the ocean mixed layer model one approach is to modify the kpp model large et al 1994 with the enhancement of velocity scale in the k profile li et al 1995 li and garrett 1997 smith 1998 mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 grant and belcher 2009 janssen 2012 harcourt 2013 2015 li et al 2013 in some models the tke equation is modified to include the contribution from lc d alessio et al 1998 axell 2002 meanwhile noh et al 2011 2016 suggested the model in which both the modification of tke equation and the enhancement of the mixing length scale are considered for the lc effects here the enhancement of the mixing length scale plays a dominant role in the effect of lc and it is equivalent to the parameterization of lc effects in the bulk mixed layer model by price et al 1986 pwp model suggested by li et al 1995 and smith 1998 the improved mld and ventilation are also expected to affect the biogeochemistry in the southern ocean in rodgers et al 2014 using an ad hoc parameterization of wind stirring the effects of mld deepening on biogeochemical processes in the southern ocean were explored using a global climate model mld deepening was found to have significant impacts on carbon uptake a seasonal phase of the carbon cycle and entrainment of nutrients this implies that the enhanced mixing by lc may promote biogeochemical processes over the southern ocean and possibly over the entire southern hemisphere as nutrients entrained into samw spread throughout the southern hemisphere sarmiento et al 2004 although it is evident that the lc can deepen the mixed layer over the southern ocean in global climate models its effects on other aspects such as changes in ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes over the southern ocean and interior ocean of the southern hemisphere have not yet been thoroughly explored in this study the lc parameterization proposed by noh et al 2016 n16 hereafter was implemented to a turbulent kinetic energy model in a global ocean model and subsequent changes in physical properties and ocean dynamics were examined in addition changes in biogeochemical processes including carbon uptake and primary production over the southern ocean were investigated 2 parameterization of langmuir circulation 2 1 mixed layer model the mixed layer model used for the parameterization of lc effects in this present work was originally proposed by gaspar et al 1990 g90 hereafter and simplified by blanke and delecluse 1993 bd93 hereafter this model solves a prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy tke which is defined as e 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 0 5 q 2 and is used to estimate the vertical eddy viscosity k m or diffusivity k h 1 k m c k l k e 1 2 2 k h k m p r t where c k denotes a constant l k denotes the turbulent mixing length scale and p r t denotes the turbulent prandtl number following g90 c k and p t r were set to 0 1 and 1 respectively the estimation of k m and k h is highly dependent on the turbulent mixing length scale l k g90 adopts the length scale from bougeault and lacarrére 1989 that is expressed as 3 l k m i n l u l d where l u and l d represent the distances a fluid parcel needs to move in the upward and downward directions respectively to convert all tke into potential energy however the calculation for l u and l d is expensive as it includes an iterative algorithm a simpler method for estimating l k was proposed by bd93 in which the length scales in the stratified fluid are written as 4 l k l u l d q n where n is the brunt väisälä frequency at the depth of the fluid parcel under locally unstable stratification l k is not allowed to exceed the distance from the depth of the fluid parcel to the surface or to the ocean floor h so that l k min q n z h z the length scale can also be bounded such that the vertical variation in the turbulent length δ l k cannot be greater than the variation in the depth δ z madec et al 1998 under the horizontally homogeneous condition the tke equation can be written as 5 e t z e w ρ 0 1 p w u h w u h z b w ϵ z k e e z k m u z 2 v z 2 k h n 2 ϵ where p is the pressure u h u v is the horizontal velocity w is the vertical velocity b is the buoyancy ϵ is the dissipation and k e is the mixing coefficient of the tke the and represent the mean and fluctuating values respectively following bd93 k e is computed as 30 k m and the dissipation ϵ is expressed as 6 ϵ c ϵ e 3 2 l ϵ 1 the dissipation length scale l ϵ is set to be the same as l k and c ϵ to 0 7 as in g90 and bd93 then tke can be integrated in time with the terms on the right hand side of 5 and the eddy viscosity and diffusivity at the next time step can be determined using the new tke and mixing length scale 2 2 langmuir circulation parameterization in n16 n16 proposed a simple parameterization of the lc effects using the results from a series of les when implemented in the noh mixed layer model noh and kim 1999 noh et al 2002 an improved representation of the mld particularly in the high latitudes was observed here the lc effects were parameterized in terms of the modifications of the mixing length scale and the tke equation g90 and noh mixed layer models share many common features both models are one and half closure models in which the tke equation is used to calculate the velocity scale furthermore the mixing length scales vary in a similar pattern therefore the effects of lc which are realized by the modification of the mixing length scale and the tke equation in n16 are likely to be valid in g90 as well hence we first briefly review the lc parameterization used in n16 before presenting the effects of lc parameterization on g90 the noh model defines the turbulent mixing length scale l k as 7 l k l 0 1 α r t where r t n l 0 q 2 α is a constant and l 0 is the turbulent mixing length scale of the neutrally stratified fluid l 0 can be expressed as 8 1 l 0 1 κ z z 0 1 h where κ is the von kármán constant z 0 is the scale representing the sea surface roughness and h is the depth at which e drops below 10 4 times the surface e the mixing length scales in n16 are analogous to that in bd93 particularly near the surface under weak stratification and near the base of the mixed layer bounded by strong stratification that is l k z near the surface under weak stratification and l k q n under strong stratification n16 adds the effects of lc by modifying l 0 as 9 1 l 0 1 κ γ z z 0 1 h where γ represents the amplification of the mixing length scale in the presence of lc it is 1 in the absence of lc effects and increases with the turbulent langmuir number la u u s 1 2 where u and u s are the frictional velocity and stokes drift velocity at the surface respectively mcwilliams et al 1997b if n is sufficiently large to make 1 α r t α r t or α r t 1 according to 7 then 10 l k l 0 1 α q n l 0 1 α q n in this case the turbulent mixing length scale l k does not depend on l 0 and thus the parameter γ hence lc has little effect on the eddy viscosity diffusivity in the highly stratified fluid if the fluid is weakly stratified as α r t 1 then l k in 7 asymptotically approaches l 0 11 l k l 0 1 κ γ z z 0 1 h 1 this expression for l k can be further simplified through scale analysis if the first term in 11 is much greater than the second term then l k is approximated as 12 l k κ γ z z 0 in other words if z satisfies z h κ γ z 0 h in an unstratified fluid the lc effects increase l k by a factor of γ on the other hand when κ γ z z 0 h it leads to l h hence the effects of lc in n16 are apparent only near the surface when the fluid is weakly stratified additionally the lc parameterization adds additional terms to momentum and tke equations associated with the stokes drift d alessio et al 1998 as a result the coriolis term in the momentum equation f u h becomes f u h u s where u s u s v s is the stokes velocity and tke equations becomes 13 e t z k e e z k m u z 2 v z 2 k m u z d u s d z v z d v s d z k h n 2 ϵ one can refer to n16 for a more detailed explanation 2 3 implementation of the langmuir circulation effects to g90 under an unstable fluid near the surface the turbulent mixing length scale can be bounded by the distance to the surface as in bd93 or its vertical variations can be limited by the variations in depth madec et al 1998 in either case the upper limit of the turbulent mixing length scale converges to local depth z near the surface hence the equivalent modification of the mixing length scale for the lc effects in g90 can be expressed as min 2 e n γ z h z γ increases with la 1 and analysis of les results suggested that γ 10 at la 0 32 noh et al 2011 la 0 32 represents the typical values in the southern ocean belcher et al 2012 so we have assumed that γ 10 in the present work the contribution of stokes force to tke and momentum equations are also included in the parameterization the vertical profile of the stokes velocity is estimated as u s z u s exp π z λ where u s is the surface stokes velocity and λ is the wavelength the u s is obtained from the definition of l a u u s mcwilliams et al 1997a with l a 0 32 and λ was set to 40 following n16 this stokes velocity is also included in the coriolis forcing term in the momentum equation 3 model experiments we examined the effects of lc on both physical and biogeochemical properties using the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997b a adcroft et al 1997 marshall et al 1998 adcroft et al 2004 adcroft and campin 2004 the global domain was partitioned into five faces one covering the arctic and the others enclosing the rest the horizontal resolution was approximately 1 and there were 53 levels with increasing downward thickness the so called lat lon cap grid used in this study was similar to that used in estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean version 4 release 4 eccov4r4 forget et al 2015 fukumori et al 2019 except that four layers two 2 m thick and two 3 m thick replaced the first layer 10 m thick used in eccov4r4 vertical mixing was computed by g90 where the effects of lc are controlled by γ the global ocean model was spun up for 335 years with the normal year common ocean ice reference experiments version 2 core ii surface forcing then the simulation with the lc parameterization diverges from here and two simulations the control cfcs ctl and the one with the lc parameterization cfcs lc were integrated for 100 years after assuming that the end of the spin up is the year 1932 they were integrated for another 16 years with the cfcs introduced as the surface forcing until 1948 when the surface forcing switched from the normal year version to the inter annual version fig 1 the atmospheric cfc 11 forcing started in 1939 cfc 11 behaves as an inert tracer in the ocean after being taken up by the sea surface and serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the ventilation of the ocean e g england 1995 fine et al 2001 dutay et al 2002 it is particularly useful for quantifying the enhanced ocean ventilation by lc li et al 2016 2017 the cfc 11 concentration was calculated following the ocean carbon cycle model intercomparison project second phase ocmip 2 up to 1994 and the last five years were converted to partial pressure for cfc 11 p cfc 11 using the solubilities by warner and weiss 1985 to remove the effect of temperature bias then the simulated p cfc 11 was compared with observations made in the 1990s as a part of the world ocean circulation experiment it is noted that these simulations were used only for quantifying the lc parameterization on ocean ventilation we also evaluated the impact of lc on the carbon cycle for this purpose a simple biogeochemical model computes dissolved inorganic carbon dic along with alkalinity phosphate dissolved organic phosphorus oxygen and fe dutkiewicz et al 2005 parekh et al 2005 biological activity which depends on light and nutrients acts as a major sink for dic whose concentrations are altered by the air sea carbon exchange this biogeochemical model is subject to atmospheric p co 2 of 278 ppm and the iron input from aeolian dust luo et al 2008 additionally climatological monthly mean chlorophyll a concentration was imposed to consider the self shading effect by phytoplankton which was derived from the sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs the configuration of these biogeochemical processes is the same as that of the model proposed by song et al 2016 the model is integrated for 600 years under the normal year core ii forcing before the simulation with the lc parameterization branched out these two simulations exp ctl for the control run and exp lc for the one with lc parameterization were then integrated for 100 years where the last 10 years of the simulations were analyzed fig 1 3 1 meridional freshwater transport we analyzed the freshwater cycle in the southern ocean as it regulates the formation of samw playing a crucial role in circulation and biogeochemical processes sloyan and rintoul 2001 terhaar et al 2021 the meridional freshwater transport f t r unit kg s 1 is calculated as follows wijffels et al 1992 talley 2008 14 f t r d 0 ρ w s 0 s s 0 v d z d x where d ρ w s s 0 and v are the lower depth of integration seawater density salinity reference salinity and meridional velocity respectively seawater density ρ w and reference salinity s 0 were set to 1025 kg m 3 and 35 psu respectively meijers et al 2011 freshwater transport was estimated from sea level to 150 m because the formation of samw mainly fluctuates with the surface ocean conditions then we compared the meridional freshwater transport between exp ctl and exp lc to understand the changes in circulation and biogeochemical processes owing to lc mixing 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes in surface mixing a comparison of the turbulent mixing length scales and tkes between exp ctl and exp lc can reveal the effects of the lc parameterization on the vertical mixing fig 2 shows the zonally averaged turbulent mixing length scale which increases in exp lc the changes take place mainly from the surface to 50 m with a maximum occurring between 50 s and 60 s where the wind speed is strongest in the global ocean risien and chelton 2008 it suggests that in the presence of lc the upper ocean becomes more uniform and the tke is also transmitted to a deeper level leading to an increase in the tke fig 2 f meanwhile more effective downward transport of tke in exp lc makes the tke level near the surface smaller the increases in the turbulent mixing length scale and tke at the subsurface layer result in a deeper mld in exp lc than in exp ctl fig 3 mld is calculated as the depth where the potential density increases by 0 03 kg m 3 relative to its surface value mld distribution from observation shows mld is mainly thick between 45 60 s and the mixed layer is especially deep near 120 w in the pacific sector and relatively shallow in the atlantic sector fig 3 a although distributions from model experiments also show mld is thick between 45 60 s difference among sectors is insignificant the biggest gap between observation and model experiment occurs in the atlantic sector but the lc parameterization mainly improves mld in the atlantic and indian sectors it proposes that the lc effects are one of many sources for the mld bias and the lc parameterization tends to bring the numerical simulation closer to the observed state but a considerable bias still exists indicating that other factors to induce model discrepancy should be further investigated although the mld in exp lc is still shallower than the climatology de boyer montégut et al 2004 the differences in mld between exp lc and exp ctl indicate that the lc effects can deepen the mld by approximately 10 30 m the latitudinal band with the mld increase in exp lc is approximately from 50 s to 60 s fig 3 d where the enhancement in both the mixing length scale and tke are the largest lc effects are also shown to improve ocean ventilation a previous study showed that the negative bias of p cfc 11 was improved by parameterizing the lc effects for example the root mean square difference was reduced by up to 20 in the southern ocean li et al 2016 the p cfc 11 bias in cfcs ctl is negative in the subsurface layer north of 60 s fig 4 b the largest bias is approximately 40 s at the 500 m level where p cfc 11 is 60 patm lower than the observations fig 4 a b the bias is reduced in cfcs lc indicating that lc parameterization improves vertical mixing and enhances ventilation fig 4 c comparison between cfcs ctl and cfcs lc shows that the lc parameterization mainly increases the capacity absorbing cfc 11 above 200 m indicating that increased tke and turbulent mixing length scale enhance the uptake of cfc 11 into the surface mixed layer and increase the p cfc 11 fig 4 d interestingly the increment spreads into the subsurface layer beyond 40 s in which the lc effect on vertical mixing is insignificant fig 2 it can be also identified in the column inventory of p cfc 11 fig s1 a d in supplementary material this implies that the effects of lc parameterization are not limited to the mixed layer with enhanced vertical mixing instead they can secondarily influence the ocean environment over a broader region through ocean circulation 4 2 changes in water properties enhanced ventilation and surface mixing can redistribute water properties fig 5 in the southern region at 50 s a cold and fresh water mass is formed at the surface layer owing to surface cooling precipitation and sea ice melting with a relatively warm and salty water mass under the surface layer fig 5 a b thus the stronger vertical mixing by the lc effects can cause the surface ocean to become warmer and saltier and the subsurface to be cooler and fresher potentially creating dipole patterns in the vertical profiles of temperature and salinity anomalies doddridge et al 2021 in the area south of 60 s the water mass below the mixed layer near 100 m becomes cooler and fresher on account of lc this signal tends to spread downward north of 50 s suggesting stronger subduction of a relatively fresh water mass advected from the polar region fig 5 d e this statement can be supported by a hodograph in the space of temperature changes along the isopycnals and isobaths bindoff and mcdougall 1994 a hodograph using the vertical profile near 50 s suggests that the lc parameterization leads to the temperature changes at the isopycnals of 26 7 kg m 3 and 27 kg m 3 by shoaling and deepening respectively which indicates the increased volume in that layer by the subduction of relatively fresh water from the south fig s3 in supplementary material the combined effect of temperature and salinity anomalies is manifested as the potential density anomalies which show opposite signs across the 27 kg m 3 isopycnal fig 5 f a water mass heavier than 27 kg m 3 becomes lighter whereas that lighter than 27 kg m 3 gains density in the region north of 50 s the size of the positive surface density anomaly was greater than that below approximately 100 m the upper ocean south of 60 s also becomes thicker because the decrease in density is greater near 50 m indicating that the upper ocean in the southern ocean becomes deeper under the lc effect the positive density anomaly signal owing to the lc effects approximately corresponds to the samw as the potential density of the water mass σ θ ranges from 26 0 to 27 0 kg m 3 donners et al 2005 provost et al 1999 feucher et al 2019 cerovečki et al 2013 the samw is slightly heavier in exp lc mainly because of the increased salinity near σ θ 26 5 kg m 3 and the decreased temperature near σ θ 27 kg m 3 fig 5 d f the positive density anomaly in the samw reaches 600 m near 40 s where both the temperature and salinity anomalies contribute to the increase in density this suggests that lc can modify the water properties below the mixed layer through the formation of samw in other words the distribution of the positive density anomaly represents the areas under the influence of the lc effects indeed the improvement of the subsurface p cfc 11 bias with the inclusion of lc parameterization effectively corresponds to the spatial distribution of the positive density anomaly fig 4 4 3 changes in ocean dynamics the increase in the tke can modify the current structures by transferring momentum to a deeper layer a zonally averaged vertical section of the zonal velocity shows a surface acc near 50 s to 60 s the speed of which is reduced by the effects of lc fig 6 a c n16 suggested that the downward momentum flux can reduce an overestimated acc in a global numerical model through lc parameterization enhanced downward momentum flux owing to the lc effects can also modify the vertical structure of the meridional velocity ekman dynamics create surface poleward and equatorward flows in the subtropical and subantarctic zones respectively fig 6 b the lc effects spread the momentum concentrated near the surface downward and reduce the vertical shear of these flows as suggested by the dipole pattern of the velocity anomalies in the differences in the meridional velocity between exp lc and exp ctl fig 6 d the increase in downward momentum flux also changes the volume transport near the surface the zonally averaged residual meridional streamfunctions show upwelling caused by divergence and downwelling caused by convergence at the latitudinal bands of 50 70 s and 30 50 s respectively fig 7 a convergence in the 30 50 s region is associated with the subduction of samw the differences in the streamfunctions between exp lc and exp ctl indicate the influence of lc parameterization on the meridional overturning circulation that mainly appears in the top 100 m fig 7 b negative and positive anomalies of approximately 6 and 1 5 sv 1 0 6 m3 s 1 respectively occur at 30 60 s and 10 30 s indicating a decrease in equatorward and poleward volume transport respectively the negative anomaly of the streamfunction at 30 60 s in exp lc indicates a decrease in equatorward freshwater transport in the subantarctic region fig 5 b the difference in meridional freshwater transport from the surface to a depth of 150 m between exp lc and exp ctl clearly shows a 10 reduction in freshwater transport fig 8 the reduced freshwater transport in exp lc is in accordance with the positive anomalies of salinity and density appearing in the band of 30 60 s fig 5 e f which are transferred downward by the meridional circulation shown in fig 7 a thus a reduction in freshwater transport and an increase in surface density can potentially increase the formation of samw sloyan and rintoul 2001 mignone et al 2006 terhaar et al 2021 according to sallée et al 2013 climate models tend to overestimate equatorward freshwater transport resulting in artificially strong stratification over the subantarctic region where samw forms during austral winter it means that lc parameterization can alleviate erroneous freshwater transport and enhance the formation of samw in the climate models 4 4 biogeochemical processes over the southern ocean the changes in the physical states caused by the lc effects lead to an adjustment in biogeochemical tracers and their processes such as the air sea co2 exchange primary productivity concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and fe as well as sea ice which imposes a constraint on the air sea co 2 exchange the annually averaged sea ice extent retreats to the south particularly near the prime meridian line owing to the effects of lc fig 9 a b however exp lc generally has a higher sea ice fraction showing an increase of greater than 20 in the south atlantic sector the total sea ice area a product of the sea ice fraction and the areas of individual grid cells is increased by 8 48 1 0 4 km 2 in the presence of lc since the sea ice area in exp ctl is near the upper bound of the observation exp lc slightly overestimates the sea ice area near the antarctica fig s2 in supplementary material however the lc parameterization is expected to ease the bias of the overestimated sea ice extent and underestimated sea ice area in most climate models maksym et al 2012 roach et al 2020 the retreat of the sea ice extent can be attributed to the reduced equatorward meridional velocity at the surface layer caused by the greater downward momentum flux the retreat can induce the convergence of sea ice south of 60 s thereby creating a greater sea ice fraction under these conditions the water mass becomes cooler and fresher by reflecting the solar radiation and accumulating freshwater during the ice melting period in the upper ocean respectively resulting in negative temperature and salinity anomalies south of 60 s fig 5 the decrease in density in the polar upper ocean owing to the negative salinity anomaly hinders deep convection near antarctica and induces a warm anomaly near 80 s in the subsurface layer a positive p cfc 11 anomaly near 80 s in the subsurface layer fig 4 indirectly indicates that global models overestimate deep convection and lc parameterization can mitigate this overestimation dutay et al 2002 li et al 2016 because a sea ice module used in the model only considers thermodynamic of sea ice formation interaction between wave and sea ice dynamics is excluded in model results although the wave interaction could play an important role in changes in sea ice distribution our model results proposed that changes in physical dynamics owing to the lc effects are also influential to changes in sea ice area the annual mean co2 exchange between the atmosphere and ocean computed in the model indicates outgassing blue shading near antarctica and uptake red shading in a broad area between 30 s and 60 s fig 9 c the lc effects generally reduce the size of the co 2 exchange in the southern ocean by suppressing both outgassing and uptake fig 9 d in the area where sea ice is present fig 9 a the reduced outgassing can be attributed to both the increased sea ice fraction and the decreased dic except for near the coast in east antarctica where enhanced co 2 outgassing decreased sea ice fraction and elevated dic levels occur figs 9 b and 10 b on the other hand the reduction in co 2 uptake is evident in the south atlantic and indian oceans where the lc effects deepen the mld and increase the surface dic figs 3 d and 10 b the vertical section of the dic difference between exp lc and exp ctl presents a dipole pattern of the anomaly centered at the 27 kg m 3 isopycnal fig 10 d the spatial distribution of the dic anomaly resembles that of the potential density fig 5 f suggesting that the physical processes altered by the lc effects drive the dic changes the negative dic anomaly near the top 100 m south of 60 s is particularly large and possibly associated with a relatively large dic gradient overall the effects of lc improve the representation of the air sea co 2 exchange in the southern ocean the oceanic co2 uptake over the 44 58 s region is suppressed from 0 39 to 0 35 pg c yr 1 owing to the lc effects this changes in co2 flux is closer to the observational estimate of 0 32 0 16 pg c yr 1 lenton et al 2013 the lc effects alter the nutrient supply and primary productivity as well the southern ocean is the largest high nutrient low chlorophyll region in the global ocean and fe is the main limiting factor for primary productivity boyd et al 2000 bakker et al 2005 martin 1990 smetacek et al 2012 the horizontal and vertical distributions of fe concentration in exp lc show fe depleted conditions near the surface in most parts of the southern ocean fig 11 a the lc effects leave heterogeneous responses at the surface fig 11 b a positive fe anomaly in exp lc mainly occurs in the indian sector north of 45 s which is nearly consistent with the distribution of the positive salinity anomaly not shown in addition the changes in the vertical section of the fe concentration owing to the lc effects are nearly consistent with those in salinity fig 11 d this suggests that the spread of the fe anomaly is driven by meridional circulation changes the positive and negative anomalies are relevant to the weakening of the equatorward freshwater transport with low fe concentration which spreads downward with enhanced ventilation of samw because the formation of samw can play an important role in the global marine environment by distributing nutrients over most of the global upper ocean sarmiento et al 2004 ribbe 2004 lc parameterization in climate models potentially influences the physical and biogeochemical processes not only in the high latitude region but also the global ocean the annual mean primary productivity is elevated in the latitudinal band between 45 s and 60 s fig 12 a which reflects two mechanisms vertical mixing near the acc where the mld is relatively deep fig 3 and dust deposition in the atlantic sector tagliabue et al 2014 song et al 2018 the increase in primary productivity caused by lc mixing occurs over the subantarctic region within 200 m depth because of the increase in fe concentration fig 12 b d the positive fe anomaly does not change the primary productivity over the subtropical region suggesting that fe is not a limiting factor in contrast the primary productivity is reduced by a decrease in the fe concentration near 60 s overall the changes caused by lc mixing slightly increase the primary productivity in 30 50 s from 5 93 to 6 27 gt c yr 1 a comparison with the annual primary productivity of 11 32 gt c yr 1 estimated by an algorithm model suggests minor advances in accuracy in primary production with the use of lc parameterization moore and abbott 2000 although the quantitative change in primary productivity is less than 10 lc parameterization pushes the model in the direction of improving accuracy as the model does not reach equilibrium we argue that the improvement will be greater when a longer integration time is considered 5 summary and conclusions we investigated the effects of lc on vertical mixing water properties ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes using a global ocean model the lc effects are included in the existing mixing model by gaspar et al 1990 and blanke and delecluse 1993 in mitgcm as proposed by n16 the core change in the vertical mixing model is the introduction of a new parameter γ to the maximum turbulent mixing length scale and stokes velocity a comparison between the control simulation without lc parameterization exp ctl and the simulation with lc parameterization exp lc indicates the followings the lc effects enhance the turbulent mixing length scale and tke leading to the deepening of the mixed layer particularly in the subantarctic regions where the wind speed is relatively high the lc effects transfer the momentum to a deeper level reducing the surface velocity including the acc the water mass becomes anomalously cold and fresh to the south of 60 s and warm and salty to the north of that due to the weakening of equatorward velocity near the surface with the lc effects the reduced equatorward velocity moves the sea ice edge southwards and increases its concentration south of 60 s the increase in the sea ice stabilizes the upper ocean and reduces deep convection the changes in the meridional overturning circulation by the lc effects alter distributions of co2 exchange and biogeochemical variables such as cfcs dic and fe the lc effects increase the downward momentum flux and modify the vertical profiles of meridional and zonal velocities resulting in the weakening of the acc and equatorward volume transport in the upper 150 m the reduced equatorward transport at the surface creates convergence which can be confirmed by the reduced volume of freshwater transport in exp lc starting near 60 s the weakening of the volume transport of cold and fresh water in exp lc results in a cold and fresh anomaly south of 60 s and a warm and salty anomaly north of that near the surface the water mass with the cold and salty anomaly spreads downward by meridional circulation along with the isopycnal layers of 25 5 to 27 kg m 3 suggesting enhanced samw formation in exp lc stronger samw formation can be confirmed by a smaller negative p cfc 11 bias at the subsurface in the simulation with the lc effects the lc effects also lead to changes in the sea ice the reduction in the equatorward velocity at the surface layer leads to the retreat of the sea ice edge and an increase in the sea ice area south of 60 s the water mass in the area with increased sea ice becomes cooler and fresher by reflecting more solar radiation and accumulating more freshwater respectively the accumulation of freshwater mass in the sea ice region in exp lc eventually stabilizes the upper ocean and hampers deep convection near antarctica slightly improving the positive p cfc 11 bias in the model the lc parameterization affects biogeochemical processes in the southern ocean the effects of lc reduce the co 2 uptake in the south atlantic and indian oceans where the dissolved inorganic carbon dic level at the surface increases owing to enhanced vertical mixing south of that region co 2 outgassing is weakened by the lc effects which is due to the increase in the sea ice fraction and decrease in the dic concentration the spatial distribution of dic anomalies resembles that in physical states such as salinity and potential density the changes in the air sea co2 exchange owing to the lc effects make the simulated co 2 exchange more comparable with observed data suggesting that the lc parameterization in the models can simulate the carbon cycle more accurately by reproducing ocean circulation more realistically nutrient supply and primary productivity are also affected by lc mixing primary productivity in the high nutrient low chlorophyll southern ocean relies on the supply of fe the decrease in equatorward transport at the surface ocean reduces the advection of water mass depleted with fe consequently under the influence of lc the region north of 50 s has a positive fe anomaly whereas that south of 50 s generally has a lower fe concentration fe anomalies lead to changes in primary productivity the region between 50 s and 40 s has higher primary productivity with the lc effects and a slight decrease in primary productivity is observed where a negative fe anomaly exists the primary productivity north of 40 s is barely changes even with increased fe because fe is not a limiting nutrient in that region although the changes in fe and primary productivity are not significant generally less than a 10 change further integration of the model may strengthen these changes as the model still drifts after 100 years of integration the lc parameterization helps the physical biogeochemical coupled model simulate the observed features better for examples the inclusion of lc parameterization in the vertical mixing model alleviates the shallow mld bias commonly found in the southern ocean in many ocean models the lc parameterization can alleviate erroneous freshwater transport in the climate models the p cfc 11 bias in the ocean model is improved the air sea co 2 exchange becomes closer to the observation the lc effects tend to ease the bias of the overestimated sea ice extent and underestimated sea ice area in most climate models maksym et al 2012 roach et al 2020 the primary production is slightly improved by change in fe distribution moore and abbott 2000 the lc effects appear near the surface and when the ocean is weakly stratified in other words the lc effects may not directly appear in the subsurface and highly stratified ocean hence it is not possible to correct the shallow mixed layer bias completely using the lc effects in these situations nevertheless this study revealed that simple lc parameterization can improve not only mld estimation in the subantarctic region but also the presentation of water properties and biogeochemical processes such as air sea co2 exchange and primary productivity considering the importance of the southern ocean to global climate the inclusion of the lc effects in the climate model

23798,langmuir circulation lc plays an important role in deepening the mixed layer especially when the ocean is weakly stratified lc parameterization has been known to improve the accuracy of the mixed layer depth sea surface temperature and ocean ventilation in the southern ocean however changes in ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes owing to lc mixing have rarely been investigated in this study we implemented lc parameterization to a physical biogeochemical coupled model and examined the changes in water properties and circulation and their effects on biogeochemical processes in the southern ocean the lc effect enhances the turbulent mixing length scale and turbulent kinetic energy especially in the subantarctic region resulting in the deepening of the mixed layer increased vertical mixing causes deeper warm and saline water to reach the surface layer and weakens the surface meridional velocity by transferring momentum deeper the weakening of the meridional velocity decreases equatorward freshwater transport causing the surface water to become saltier and denser north of 50 s adjacent to the formation site of subantarctic mode water which enhances ocean ventilation eventually additionally the weak equatorward velocity drives the retreat of sea ice south of 60 s leading to cooler and fresher water in the southern region of 60 s changes in the sea ice distribution mixed layer depth and dissolved inorganic carbon distribution alter the air sea co2 exchange suggesting that the lc parameterization in the model can ameliorate 10 of the air sea co2 exchange the lc effects on biogeochemical tracers such as iron fe and dissolved inorganic carbon are mainly determined by changes in ocean circulation and the modest improvement in primary productivity is mainly attributed to the changes in the fe distribution in the high nutrient low chlorophyll region where fe availability limits primary production although the direct lc effects occur near the surface the altered meridional circulation spreads the effects to a deeper layer and improves the overall representation of physical biogeochemical tracers and air sea co 2 exchange in the southern ocean suggesting that a simple lc parameterization can improve the ocean model keywords langmuir circulation global climate model vertical mixing freshwater transport air sea co2 exchange southern ocean data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the surface mixed layer of the ocean is an important portal for the exchange of gases and heat between the atmosphere and the ocean in particular the thick mixed layer of the southern ocean o 100 m in winter de boyer montégut et al 2004 dong et al 2008 associated with intense winds and enormous surface buoyancy fluxes plays a critical role in these exchanges as approximately 40 of the anthropogenic carbon uptake by the global ocean occurs in the southern ocean south of 40 s sabine et al 2004 sallée et al 2012 devries 2014 caldeira and duffy 2000 mikaloff fletcher et al 2006 thus an accurate estimation of the mixed layer depth mld over the southern ocean in global climate models is required for better predictability of future climate change sallée et al 2013 frölicher et al 2015 previous studies have reported that climate models generally underestimate the mld over the southern ocean causing weakening of ventilation sallée et al 2013 li et al 2016 rodgers et al 2014 noh et al 2016 one of the possible causes for the shallow mld bias during austral winters in climate models is the abnormally strong stratification by excessive freshwater input associated with ekman transport and air sea fluxes sallée et al 2013 the shallow mld bias in climate models was distinct where subantarctic mode water samw is formed and it could hinder the formation of mode water and the uptake of co2 into the interior ocean sallée et al 2013 langmuir circulation lc occurs in the form of horizontal roll vortices parallel to the wind the enhanced length and velocity scales associated with lc are known to significantly enhance vertical mixing within the mixed layer and also provide one of the most potent mechanisms for the deepening of the mixed layer leibovich 1983 hamlington et al 2014 d asaro et al 2014 kantha and clayson 2004 it has motivated studies on the effects of lc on the mld and the implementation of lc mixing into mixing schemes to improve the accuracy of mld determination over the southern ocean noh et al 2011 li et al 2016 rodgers et al 2014 noh et al 2016 for example noh et al 2011 investigated the lc effect using a large eddy simulation les and showed a significant deepening of the mld by lc under the condition of weak stratification and shallow mld the inclusion of lc parameterization in the ocean global climate model is shown to help predict the mld and sea surface temperature more accurately in the high latitude ocean while leaving the low latitude ocean relatively unaffected noh et al 2016 li et al 2016 additionally lc mixing transfers momentum deeper enabling a more realistic simulation of the antarctic circumpolar current acc noh et al 2016 fan and griffies 2014 the inclusion of lc parameterization also improves the simulation of ocean ventilation the intensity of ocean ventilation in models is often measured using chlorofluorocarbons cfcs whose concentrations in the oceans are reflective of ocean circulation and mixing england 1995 dixon et al 1996 england and hirst 1997 england and maier reimer 2001 müller et al 2006 trossman et al 2012 because the intense vertical mixing and formation of the samw in the southern ocean are the major mechanisms of the uptake and storage of chlorofluorocarbon 11 cfc 11 their underestimation can lead to a negative bias in the cfc 11 concentration as compared with observations long et al 2013 the inclusion of lc parameterization could help improve this situation li et al 2016 inclusion of lc parameterization has also been shown to increase the atlantic meridional overturning circulation through the deepening of the mld in the high latitude ocean li et al 2016 fan and griffies 2014 however effects on the other aspects of the southern ocean such as meridional circulation and freshwater transport remain unclear there have been various attempts to incorporate lc effects into the ocean mixed layer model one approach is to modify the kpp model large et al 1994 with the enhancement of velocity scale in the k profile li et al 1995 li and garrett 1997 smith 1998 mcwilliams and sullivan 2000 smyth et al 2002 grant and belcher 2009 janssen 2012 harcourt 2013 2015 li et al 2013 in some models the tke equation is modified to include the contribution from lc d alessio et al 1998 axell 2002 meanwhile noh et al 2011 2016 suggested the model in which both the modification of tke equation and the enhancement of the mixing length scale are considered for the lc effects here the enhancement of the mixing length scale plays a dominant role in the effect of lc and it is equivalent to the parameterization of lc effects in the bulk mixed layer model by price et al 1986 pwp model suggested by li et al 1995 and smith 1998 the improved mld and ventilation are also expected to affect the biogeochemistry in the southern ocean in rodgers et al 2014 using an ad hoc parameterization of wind stirring the effects of mld deepening on biogeochemical processes in the southern ocean were explored using a global climate model mld deepening was found to have significant impacts on carbon uptake a seasonal phase of the carbon cycle and entrainment of nutrients this implies that the enhanced mixing by lc may promote biogeochemical processes over the southern ocean and possibly over the entire southern hemisphere as nutrients entrained into samw spread throughout the southern hemisphere sarmiento et al 2004 although it is evident that the lc can deepen the mixed layer over the southern ocean in global climate models its effects on other aspects such as changes in ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes over the southern ocean and interior ocean of the southern hemisphere have not yet been thoroughly explored in this study the lc parameterization proposed by noh et al 2016 n16 hereafter was implemented to a turbulent kinetic energy model in a global ocean model and subsequent changes in physical properties and ocean dynamics were examined in addition changes in biogeochemical processes including carbon uptake and primary production over the southern ocean were investigated 2 parameterization of langmuir circulation 2 1 mixed layer model the mixed layer model used for the parameterization of lc effects in this present work was originally proposed by gaspar et al 1990 g90 hereafter and simplified by blanke and delecluse 1993 bd93 hereafter this model solves a prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy tke which is defined as e 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 0 5 q 2 and is used to estimate the vertical eddy viscosity k m or diffusivity k h 1 k m c k l k e 1 2 2 k h k m p r t where c k denotes a constant l k denotes the turbulent mixing length scale and p r t denotes the turbulent prandtl number following g90 c k and p t r were set to 0 1 and 1 respectively the estimation of k m and k h is highly dependent on the turbulent mixing length scale l k g90 adopts the length scale from bougeault and lacarrére 1989 that is expressed as 3 l k m i n l u l d where l u and l d represent the distances a fluid parcel needs to move in the upward and downward directions respectively to convert all tke into potential energy however the calculation for l u and l d is expensive as it includes an iterative algorithm a simpler method for estimating l k was proposed by bd93 in which the length scales in the stratified fluid are written as 4 l k l u l d q n where n is the brunt väisälä frequency at the depth of the fluid parcel under locally unstable stratification l k is not allowed to exceed the distance from the depth of the fluid parcel to the surface or to the ocean floor h so that l k min q n z h z the length scale can also be bounded such that the vertical variation in the turbulent length δ l k cannot be greater than the variation in the depth δ z madec et al 1998 under the horizontally homogeneous condition the tke equation can be written as 5 e t z e w ρ 0 1 p w u h w u h z b w ϵ z k e e z k m u z 2 v z 2 k h n 2 ϵ where p is the pressure u h u v is the horizontal velocity w is the vertical velocity b is the buoyancy ϵ is the dissipation and k e is the mixing coefficient of the tke the and represent the mean and fluctuating values respectively following bd93 k e is computed as 30 k m and the dissipation ϵ is expressed as 6 ϵ c ϵ e 3 2 l ϵ 1 the dissipation length scale l ϵ is set to be the same as l k and c ϵ to 0 7 as in g90 and bd93 then tke can be integrated in time with the terms on the right hand side of 5 and the eddy viscosity and diffusivity at the next time step can be determined using the new tke and mixing length scale 2 2 langmuir circulation parameterization in n16 n16 proposed a simple parameterization of the lc effects using the results from a series of les when implemented in the noh mixed layer model noh and kim 1999 noh et al 2002 an improved representation of the mld particularly in the high latitudes was observed here the lc effects were parameterized in terms of the modifications of the mixing length scale and the tke equation g90 and noh mixed layer models share many common features both models are one and half closure models in which the tke equation is used to calculate the velocity scale furthermore the mixing length scales vary in a similar pattern therefore the effects of lc which are realized by the modification of the mixing length scale and the tke equation in n16 are likely to be valid in g90 as well hence we first briefly review the lc parameterization used in n16 before presenting the effects of lc parameterization on g90 the noh model defines the turbulent mixing length scale l k as 7 l k l 0 1 α r t where r t n l 0 q 2 α is a constant and l 0 is the turbulent mixing length scale of the neutrally stratified fluid l 0 can be expressed as 8 1 l 0 1 κ z z 0 1 h where κ is the von kármán constant z 0 is the scale representing the sea surface roughness and h is the depth at which e drops below 10 4 times the surface e the mixing length scales in n16 are analogous to that in bd93 particularly near the surface under weak stratification and near the base of the mixed layer bounded by strong stratification that is l k z near the surface under weak stratification and l k q n under strong stratification n16 adds the effects of lc by modifying l 0 as 9 1 l 0 1 κ γ z z 0 1 h where γ represents the amplification of the mixing length scale in the presence of lc it is 1 in the absence of lc effects and increases with the turbulent langmuir number la u u s 1 2 where u and u s are the frictional velocity and stokes drift velocity at the surface respectively mcwilliams et al 1997b if n is sufficiently large to make 1 α r t α r t or α r t 1 according to 7 then 10 l k l 0 1 α q n l 0 1 α q n in this case the turbulent mixing length scale l k does not depend on l 0 and thus the parameter γ hence lc has little effect on the eddy viscosity diffusivity in the highly stratified fluid if the fluid is weakly stratified as α r t 1 then l k in 7 asymptotically approaches l 0 11 l k l 0 1 κ γ z z 0 1 h 1 this expression for l k can be further simplified through scale analysis if the first term in 11 is much greater than the second term then l k is approximated as 12 l k κ γ z z 0 in other words if z satisfies z h κ γ z 0 h in an unstratified fluid the lc effects increase l k by a factor of γ on the other hand when κ γ z z 0 h it leads to l h hence the effects of lc in n16 are apparent only near the surface when the fluid is weakly stratified additionally the lc parameterization adds additional terms to momentum and tke equations associated with the stokes drift d alessio et al 1998 as a result the coriolis term in the momentum equation f u h becomes f u h u s where u s u s v s is the stokes velocity and tke equations becomes 13 e t z k e e z k m u z 2 v z 2 k m u z d u s d z v z d v s d z k h n 2 ϵ one can refer to n16 for a more detailed explanation 2 3 implementation of the langmuir circulation effects to g90 under an unstable fluid near the surface the turbulent mixing length scale can be bounded by the distance to the surface as in bd93 or its vertical variations can be limited by the variations in depth madec et al 1998 in either case the upper limit of the turbulent mixing length scale converges to local depth z near the surface hence the equivalent modification of the mixing length scale for the lc effects in g90 can be expressed as min 2 e n γ z h z γ increases with la 1 and analysis of les results suggested that γ 10 at la 0 32 noh et al 2011 la 0 32 represents the typical values in the southern ocean belcher et al 2012 so we have assumed that γ 10 in the present work the contribution of stokes force to tke and momentum equations are also included in the parameterization the vertical profile of the stokes velocity is estimated as u s z u s exp π z λ where u s is the surface stokes velocity and λ is the wavelength the u s is obtained from the definition of l a u u s mcwilliams et al 1997a with l a 0 32 and λ was set to 40 following n16 this stokes velocity is also included in the coriolis forcing term in the momentum equation 3 model experiments we examined the effects of lc on both physical and biogeochemical properties using the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm marshall et al 1997b a adcroft et al 1997 marshall et al 1998 adcroft et al 2004 adcroft and campin 2004 the global domain was partitioned into five faces one covering the arctic and the others enclosing the rest the horizontal resolution was approximately 1 and there were 53 levels with increasing downward thickness the so called lat lon cap grid used in this study was similar to that used in estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean version 4 release 4 eccov4r4 forget et al 2015 fukumori et al 2019 except that four layers two 2 m thick and two 3 m thick replaced the first layer 10 m thick used in eccov4r4 vertical mixing was computed by g90 where the effects of lc are controlled by γ the global ocean model was spun up for 335 years with the normal year common ocean ice reference experiments version 2 core ii surface forcing then the simulation with the lc parameterization diverges from here and two simulations the control cfcs ctl and the one with the lc parameterization cfcs lc were integrated for 100 years after assuming that the end of the spin up is the year 1932 they were integrated for another 16 years with the cfcs introduced as the surface forcing until 1948 when the surface forcing switched from the normal year version to the inter annual version fig 1 the atmospheric cfc 11 forcing started in 1939 cfc 11 behaves as an inert tracer in the ocean after being taken up by the sea surface and serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the ventilation of the ocean e g england 1995 fine et al 2001 dutay et al 2002 it is particularly useful for quantifying the enhanced ocean ventilation by lc li et al 2016 2017 the cfc 11 concentration was calculated following the ocean carbon cycle model intercomparison project second phase ocmip 2 up to 1994 and the last five years were converted to partial pressure for cfc 11 p cfc 11 using the solubilities by warner and weiss 1985 to remove the effect of temperature bias then the simulated p cfc 11 was compared with observations made in the 1990s as a part of the world ocean circulation experiment it is noted that these simulations were used only for quantifying the lc parameterization on ocean ventilation we also evaluated the impact of lc on the carbon cycle for this purpose a simple biogeochemical model computes dissolved inorganic carbon dic along with alkalinity phosphate dissolved organic phosphorus oxygen and fe dutkiewicz et al 2005 parekh et al 2005 biological activity which depends on light and nutrients acts as a major sink for dic whose concentrations are altered by the air sea carbon exchange this biogeochemical model is subject to atmospheric p co 2 of 278 ppm and the iron input from aeolian dust luo et al 2008 additionally climatological monthly mean chlorophyll a concentration was imposed to consider the self shading effect by phytoplankton which was derived from the sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs the configuration of these biogeochemical processes is the same as that of the model proposed by song et al 2016 the model is integrated for 600 years under the normal year core ii forcing before the simulation with the lc parameterization branched out these two simulations exp ctl for the control run and exp lc for the one with lc parameterization were then integrated for 100 years where the last 10 years of the simulations were analyzed fig 1 3 1 meridional freshwater transport we analyzed the freshwater cycle in the southern ocean as it regulates the formation of samw playing a crucial role in circulation and biogeochemical processes sloyan and rintoul 2001 terhaar et al 2021 the meridional freshwater transport f t r unit kg s 1 is calculated as follows wijffels et al 1992 talley 2008 14 f t r d 0 ρ w s 0 s s 0 v d z d x where d ρ w s s 0 and v are the lower depth of integration seawater density salinity reference salinity and meridional velocity respectively seawater density ρ w and reference salinity s 0 were set to 1025 kg m 3 and 35 psu respectively meijers et al 2011 freshwater transport was estimated from sea level to 150 m because the formation of samw mainly fluctuates with the surface ocean conditions then we compared the meridional freshwater transport between exp ctl and exp lc to understand the changes in circulation and biogeochemical processes owing to lc mixing 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes in surface mixing a comparison of the turbulent mixing length scales and tkes between exp ctl and exp lc can reveal the effects of the lc parameterization on the vertical mixing fig 2 shows the zonally averaged turbulent mixing length scale which increases in exp lc the changes take place mainly from the surface to 50 m with a maximum occurring between 50 s and 60 s where the wind speed is strongest in the global ocean risien and chelton 2008 it suggests that in the presence of lc the upper ocean becomes more uniform and the tke is also transmitted to a deeper level leading to an increase in the tke fig 2 f meanwhile more effective downward transport of tke in exp lc makes the tke level near the surface smaller the increases in the turbulent mixing length scale and tke at the subsurface layer result in a deeper mld in exp lc than in exp ctl fig 3 mld is calculated as the depth where the potential density increases by 0 03 kg m 3 relative to its surface value mld distribution from observation shows mld is mainly thick between 45 60 s and the mixed layer is especially deep near 120 w in the pacific sector and relatively shallow in the atlantic sector fig 3 a although distributions from model experiments also show mld is thick between 45 60 s difference among sectors is insignificant the biggest gap between observation and model experiment occurs in the atlantic sector but the lc parameterization mainly improves mld in the atlantic and indian sectors it proposes that the lc effects are one of many sources for the mld bias and the lc parameterization tends to bring the numerical simulation closer to the observed state but a considerable bias still exists indicating that other factors to induce model discrepancy should be further investigated although the mld in exp lc is still shallower than the climatology de boyer montégut et al 2004 the differences in mld between exp lc and exp ctl indicate that the lc effects can deepen the mld by approximately 10 30 m the latitudinal band with the mld increase in exp lc is approximately from 50 s to 60 s fig 3 d where the enhancement in both the mixing length scale and tke are the largest lc effects are also shown to improve ocean ventilation a previous study showed that the negative bias of p cfc 11 was improved by parameterizing the lc effects for example the root mean square difference was reduced by up to 20 in the southern ocean li et al 2016 the p cfc 11 bias in cfcs ctl is negative in the subsurface layer north of 60 s fig 4 b the largest bias is approximately 40 s at the 500 m level where p cfc 11 is 60 patm lower than the observations fig 4 a b the bias is reduced in cfcs lc indicating that lc parameterization improves vertical mixing and enhances ventilation fig 4 c comparison between cfcs ctl and cfcs lc shows that the lc parameterization mainly increases the capacity absorbing cfc 11 above 200 m indicating that increased tke and turbulent mixing length scale enhance the uptake of cfc 11 into the surface mixed layer and increase the p cfc 11 fig 4 d interestingly the increment spreads into the subsurface layer beyond 40 s in which the lc effect on vertical mixing is insignificant fig 2 it can be also identified in the column inventory of p cfc 11 fig s1 a d in supplementary material this implies that the effects of lc parameterization are not limited to the mixed layer with enhanced vertical mixing instead they can secondarily influence the ocean environment over a broader region through ocean circulation 4 2 changes in water properties enhanced ventilation and surface mixing can redistribute water properties fig 5 in the southern region at 50 s a cold and fresh water mass is formed at the surface layer owing to surface cooling precipitation and sea ice melting with a relatively warm and salty water mass under the surface layer fig 5 a b thus the stronger vertical mixing by the lc effects can cause the surface ocean to become warmer and saltier and the subsurface to be cooler and fresher potentially creating dipole patterns in the vertical profiles of temperature and salinity anomalies doddridge et al 2021 in the area south of 60 s the water mass below the mixed layer near 100 m becomes cooler and fresher on account of lc this signal tends to spread downward north of 50 s suggesting stronger subduction of a relatively fresh water mass advected from the polar region fig 5 d e this statement can be supported by a hodograph in the space of temperature changes along the isopycnals and isobaths bindoff and mcdougall 1994 a hodograph using the vertical profile near 50 s suggests that the lc parameterization leads to the temperature changes at the isopycnals of 26 7 kg m 3 and 27 kg m 3 by shoaling and deepening respectively which indicates the increased volume in that layer by the subduction of relatively fresh water from the south fig s3 in supplementary material the combined effect of temperature and salinity anomalies is manifested as the potential density anomalies which show opposite signs across the 27 kg m 3 isopycnal fig 5 f a water mass heavier than 27 kg m 3 becomes lighter whereas that lighter than 27 kg m 3 gains density in the region north of 50 s the size of the positive surface density anomaly was greater than that below approximately 100 m the upper ocean south of 60 s also becomes thicker because the decrease in density is greater near 50 m indicating that the upper ocean in the southern ocean becomes deeper under the lc effect the positive density anomaly signal owing to the lc effects approximately corresponds to the samw as the potential density of the water mass σ θ ranges from 26 0 to 27 0 kg m 3 donners et al 2005 provost et al 1999 feucher et al 2019 cerovečki et al 2013 the samw is slightly heavier in exp lc mainly because of the increased salinity near σ θ 26 5 kg m 3 and the decreased temperature near σ θ 27 kg m 3 fig 5 d f the positive density anomaly in the samw reaches 600 m near 40 s where both the temperature and salinity anomalies contribute to the increase in density this suggests that lc can modify the water properties below the mixed layer through the formation of samw in other words the distribution of the positive density anomaly represents the areas under the influence of the lc effects indeed the improvement of the subsurface p cfc 11 bias with the inclusion of lc parameterization effectively corresponds to the spatial distribution of the positive density anomaly fig 4 4 3 changes in ocean dynamics the increase in the tke can modify the current structures by transferring momentum to a deeper layer a zonally averaged vertical section of the zonal velocity shows a surface acc near 50 s to 60 s the speed of which is reduced by the effects of lc fig 6 a c n16 suggested that the downward momentum flux can reduce an overestimated acc in a global numerical model through lc parameterization enhanced downward momentum flux owing to the lc effects can also modify the vertical structure of the meridional velocity ekman dynamics create surface poleward and equatorward flows in the subtropical and subantarctic zones respectively fig 6 b the lc effects spread the momentum concentrated near the surface downward and reduce the vertical shear of these flows as suggested by the dipole pattern of the velocity anomalies in the differences in the meridional velocity between exp lc and exp ctl fig 6 d the increase in downward momentum flux also changes the volume transport near the surface the zonally averaged residual meridional streamfunctions show upwelling caused by divergence and downwelling caused by convergence at the latitudinal bands of 50 70 s and 30 50 s respectively fig 7 a convergence in the 30 50 s region is associated with the subduction of samw the differences in the streamfunctions between exp lc and exp ctl indicate the influence of lc parameterization on the meridional overturning circulation that mainly appears in the top 100 m fig 7 b negative and positive anomalies of approximately 6 and 1 5 sv 1 0 6 m3 s 1 respectively occur at 30 60 s and 10 30 s indicating a decrease in equatorward and poleward volume transport respectively the negative anomaly of the streamfunction at 30 60 s in exp lc indicates a decrease in equatorward freshwater transport in the subantarctic region fig 5 b the difference in meridional freshwater transport from the surface to a depth of 150 m between exp lc and exp ctl clearly shows a 10 reduction in freshwater transport fig 8 the reduced freshwater transport in exp lc is in accordance with the positive anomalies of salinity and density appearing in the band of 30 60 s fig 5 e f which are transferred downward by the meridional circulation shown in fig 7 a thus a reduction in freshwater transport and an increase in surface density can potentially increase the formation of samw sloyan and rintoul 2001 mignone et al 2006 terhaar et al 2021 according to sallée et al 2013 climate models tend to overestimate equatorward freshwater transport resulting in artificially strong stratification over the subantarctic region where samw forms during austral winter it means that lc parameterization can alleviate erroneous freshwater transport and enhance the formation of samw in the climate models 4 4 biogeochemical processes over the southern ocean the changes in the physical states caused by the lc effects lead to an adjustment in biogeochemical tracers and their processes such as the air sea co2 exchange primary productivity concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and fe as well as sea ice which imposes a constraint on the air sea co 2 exchange the annually averaged sea ice extent retreats to the south particularly near the prime meridian line owing to the effects of lc fig 9 a b however exp lc generally has a higher sea ice fraction showing an increase of greater than 20 in the south atlantic sector the total sea ice area a product of the sea ice fraction and the areas of individual grid cells is increased by 8 48 1 0 4 km 2 in the presence of lc since the sea ice area in exp ctl is near the upper bound of the observation exp lc slightly overestimates the sea ice area near the antarctica fig s2 in supplementary material however the lc parameterization is expected to ease the bias of the overestimated sea ice extent and underestimated sea ice area in most climate models maksym et al 2012 roach et al 2020 the retreat of the sea ice extent can be attributed to the reduced equatorward meridional velocity at the surface layer caused by the greater downward momentum flux the retreat can induce the convergence of sea ice south of 60 s thereby creating a greater sea ice fraction under these conditions the water mass becomes cooler and fresher by reflecting the solar radiation and accumulating freshwater during the ice melting period in the upper ocean respectively resulting in negative temperature and salinity anomalies south of 60 s fig 5 the decrease in density in the polar upper ocean owing to the negative salinity anomaly hinders deep convection near antarctica and induces a warm anomaly near 80 s in the subsurface layer a positive p cfc 11 anomaly near 80 s in the subsurface layer fig 4 indirectly indicates that global models overestimate deep convection and lc parameterization can mitigate this overestimation dutay et al 2002 li et al 2016 because a sea ice module used in the model only considers thermodynamic of sea ice formation interaction between wave and sea ice dynamics is excluded in model results although the wave interaction could play an important role in changes in sea ice distribution our model results proposed that changes in physical dynamics owing to the lc effects are also influential to changes in sea ice area the annual mean co2 exchange between the atmosphere and ocean computed in the model indicates outgassing blue shading near antarctica and uptake red shading in a broad area between 30 s and 60 s fig 9 c the lc effects generally reduce the size of the co 2 exchange in the southern ocean by suppressing both outgassing and uptake fig 9 d in the area where sea ice is present fig 9 a the reduced outgassing can be attributed to both the increased sea ice fraction and the decreased dic except for near the coast in east antarctica where enhanced co 2 outgassing decreased sea ice fraction and elevated dic levels occur figs 9 b and 10 b on the other hand the reduction in co 2 uptake is evident in the south atlantic and indian oceans where the lc effects deepen the mld and increase the surface dic figs 3 d and 10 b the vertical section of the dic difference between exp lc and exp ctl presents a dipole pattern of the anomaly centered at the 27 kg m 3 isopycnal fig 10 d the spatial distribution of the dic anomaly resembles that of the potential density fig 5 f suggesting that the physical processes altered by the lc effects drive the dic changes the negative dic anomaly near the top 100 m south of 60 s is particularly large and possibly associated with a relatively large dic gradient overall the effects of lc improve the representation of the air sea co 2 exchange in the southern ocean the oceanic co2 uptake over the 44 58 s region is suppressed from 0 39 to 0 35 pg c yr 1 owing to the lc effects this changes in co2 flux is closer to the observational estimate of 0 32 0 16 pg c yr 1 lenton et al 2013 the lc effects alter the nutrient supply and primary productivity as well the southern ocean is the largest high nutrient low chlorophyll region in the global ocean and fe is the main limiting factor for primary productivity boyd et al 2000 bakker et al 2005 martin 1990 smetacek et al 2012 the horizontal and vertical distributions of fe concentration in exp lc show fe depleted conditions near the surface in most parts of the southern ocean fig 11 a the lc effects leave heterogeneous responses at the surface fig 11 b a positive fe anomaly in exp lc mainly occurs in the indian sector north of 45 s which is nearly consistent with the distribution of the positive salinity anomaly not shown in addition the changes in the vertical section of the fe concentration owing to the lc effects are nearly consistent with those in salinity fig 11 d this suggests that the spread of the fe anomaly is driven by meridional circulation changes the positive and negative anomalies are relevant to the weakening of the equatorward freshwater transport with low fe concentration which spreads downward with enhanced ventilation of samw because the formation of samw can play an important role in the global marine environment by distributing nutrients over most of the global upper ocean sarmiento et al 2004 ribbe 2004 lc parameterization in climate models potentially influences the physical and biogeochemical processes not only in the high latitude region but also the global ocean the annual mean primary productivity is elevated in the latitudinal band between 45 s and 60 s fig 12 a which reflects two mechanisms vertical mixing near the acc where the mld is relatively deep fig 3 and dust deposition in the atlantic sector tagliabue et al 2014 song et al 2018 the increase in primary productivity caused by lc mixing occurs over the subantarctic region within 200 m depth because of the increase in fe concentration fig 12 b d the positive fe anomaly does not change the primary productivity over the subtropical region suggesting that fe is not a limiting factor in contrast the primary productivity is reduced by a decrease in the fe concentration near 60 s overall the changes caused by lc mixing slightly increase the primary productivity in 30 50 s from 5 93 to 6 27 gt c yr 1 a comparison with the annual primary productivity of 11 32 gt c yr 1 estimated by an algorithm model suggests minor advances in accuracy in primary production with the use of lc parameterization moore and abbott 2000 although the quantitative change in primary productivity is less than 10 lc parameterization pushes the model in the direction of improving accuracy as the model does not reach equilibrium we argue that the improvement will be greater when a longer integration time is considered 5 summary and conclusions we investigated the effects of lc on vertical mixing water properties ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes using a global ocean model the lc effects are included in the existing mixing model by gaspar et al 1990 and blanke and delecluse 1993 in mitgcm as proposed by n16 the core change in the vertical mixing model is the introduction of a new parameter γ to the maximum turbulent mixing length scale and stokes velocity a comparison between the control simulation without lc parameterization exp ctl and the simulation with lc parameterization exp lc indicates the followings the lc effects enhance the turbulent mixing length scale and tke leading to the deepening of the mixed layer particularly in the subantarctic regions where the wind speed is relatively high the lc effects transfer the momentum to a deeper level reducing the surface velocity including the acc the water mass becomes anomalously cold and fresh to the south of 60 s and warm and salty to the north of that due to the weakening of equatorward velocity near the surface with the lc effects the reduced equatorward velocity moves the sea ice edge southwards and increases its concentration south of 60 s the increase in the sea ice stabilizes the upper ocean and reduces deep convection the changes in the meridional overturning circulation by the lc effects alter distributions of co2 exchange and biogeochemical variables such as cfcs dic and fe the lc effects increase the downward momentum flux and modify the vertical profiles of meridional and zonal velocities resulting in the weakening of the acc and equatorward volume transport in the upper 150 m the reduced equatorward transport at the surface creates convergence which can be confirmed by the reduced volume of freshwater transport in exp lc starting near 60 s the weakening of the volume transport of cold and fresh water in exp lc results in a cold and fresh anomaly south of 60 s and a warm and salty anomaly north of that near the surface the water mass with the cold and salty anomaly spreads downward by meridional circulation along with the isopycnal layers of 25 5 to 27 kg m 3 suggesting enhanced samw formation in exp lc stronger samw formation can be confirmed by a smaller negative p cfc 11 bias at the subsurface in the simulation with the lc effects the lc effects also lead to changes in the sea ice the reduction in the equatorward velocity at the surface layer leads to the retreat of the sea ice edge and an increase in the sea ice area south of 60 s the water mass in the area with increased sea ice becomes cooler and fresher by reflecting more solar radiation and accumulating more freshwater respectively the accumulation of freshwater mass in the sea ice region in exp lc eventually stabilizes the upper ocean and hampers deep convection near antarctica slightly improving the positive p cfc 11 bias in the model the lc parameterization affects biogeochemical processes in the southern ocean the effects of lc reduce the co 2 uptake in the south atlantic and indian oceans where the dissolved inorganic carbon dic level at the surface increases owing to enhanced vertical mixing south of that region co 2 outgassing is weakened by the lc effects which is due to the increase in the sea ice fraction and decrease in the dic concentration the spatial distribution of dic anomalies resembles that in physical states such as salinity and potential density the changes in the air sea co2 exchange owing to the lc effects make the simulated co 2 exchange more comparable with observed data suggesting that the lc parameterization in the models can simulate the carbon cycle more accurately by reproducing ocean circulation more realistically nutrient supply and primary productivity are also affected by lc mixing primary productivity in the high nutrient low chlorophyll southern ocean relies on the supply of fe the decrease in equatorward transport at the surface ocean reduces the advection of water mass depleted with fe consequently under the influence of lc the region north of 50 s has a positive fe anomaly whereas that south of 50 s generally has a lower fe concentration fe anomalies lead to changes in primary productivity the region between 50 s and 40 s has higher primary productivity with the lc effects and a slight decrease in primary productivity is observed where a negative fe anomaly exists the primary productivity north of 40 s is barely changes even with increased fe because fe is not a limiting nutrient in that region although the changes in fe and primary productivity are not significant generally less than a 10 change further integration of the model may strengthen these changes as the model still drifts after 100 years of integration the lc parameterization helps the physical biogeochemical coupled model simulate the observed features better for examples the inclusion of lc parameterization in the vertical mixing model alleviates the shallow mld bias commonly found in the southern ocean in many ocean models the lc parameterization can alleviate erroneous freshwater transport in the climate models the p cfc 11 bias in the ocean model is improved the air sea co 2 exchange becomes closer to the observation the lc effects tend to ease the bias of the overestimated sea ice extent and underestimated sea ice area in most climate models maksym et al 2012 roach et al 2020 the primary production is slightly improved by change in fe distribution moore and abbott 2000 the lc effects appear near the surface and when the ocean is weakly stratified in other words the lc effects may not directly appear in the subsurface and highly stratified ocean hence it is not possible to correct the shallow mixed layer bias completely using the lc effects in these situations nevertheless this study revealed that simple lc parameterization can improve not only mld estimation in the subantarctic region but also the presentation of water properties and biogeochemical processes such as air sea co2 exchange and primary productivity considering the importance of the southern ocean to global climate the inclusion of the lc effects in the climate model

23799,low mode internal waves are able to propagate across ocean basins and modulate ocean dynamics thousands of kilometers away from their generation sites in this study the impact of remotely generated internal waves on the internal wave energetics near the u s west coast is investigated with realistically forced regional ocean simulations at the open boundaries we impose high frequency oceanic state variables obtained from a global ocean simulation with realistic atmospheric and astronomical tidal forcing we use the discrete fourier transform dft technique in separating ingoing and outgoing internal tide energy fluxes at the open boundaries in order to quantify internal tide reflections although internal tide reflections are reduced with increasing sponge viscosity and or sponge layer width reflection coefficients λ can be as high as 73 in the presence of remote internal waves the model variance and spatial correlations become more in agreement with both mooring and altimetry datasets the results confirm that an improved internal wave continuum can be achieved in regional models with remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries however care should be taken to avoid excessive reflections of internal waves from the interior at these boundaries keywords regional ocean modeling high frequency boundary forcing internal waves open boundary sensitivity model data

their footprints into oceanographic measurements in situ e g waterhouse et al 2014 remotely sensed e g ray and zaron 2011 2016 and acoustic measurements e g dushaw et al 1995 li et al 2009 these baroclinic motions play a key role in multiple oceanic processes including diapycnal mixing e g kunze et al 2002 transport of sediments e g sinnett et al 2018 and transport of high nutrient waters from the deep part of the ocean to the surface e g tuerena et al 2019 the dissipation of barotropic tides by means of scattering into internal tides at rough bathymetry in the open ocean has been suggested to be responsible for half of the power required to maintain the meridional overturning circulation munk and wunsch 1998 egbert and ray 2000 2003 this demonstrates how important it is to track internal wave energy pathways from generation to dissipation to better understand the large scale ocean circulation and ocean climate although there is a growing effort directed towards increasing the resolution of oceanographic measurements one of which is the upcoming surface water and ocean topography swot altimeter mission fu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the large spatio temporal resolution of numerical ocean models cannot be matched however the ability of numerical ocean circulation models to resolve physical processes at smaller spatio temporal scales such as sub mesoscale eddies and internal waves requires relatively fine horizontal and or vertical grid resolutions van haren et al 2004 implementation of these resolutions in global ocean circulation models may incur a significant computational expense to overcome this problem regional ocean circulation models with resolutions much higher than are feasible in global simulations are used e g buijsman et al 2012 kelly et al 2012 kumar et al 2019 nelson et al 2020 regional models are forced at the lateral open boundaries with data from climatologies and global or basin scale model simulations e g chassignet et al 2007 zamudio et al 2008 buijsman et al 2012 chen et al 2013 to prevent significant drift away from the realistic ocean state choosing the right open boundary conditions obcs is also important in mitigating discontinuities at the open boundaries marchesiello et al 2001 over the past decades it has been a conventional practice to force regional models at the open boundaries with only sub inertial fields and barotropic tides and significant progress has been made towards developing appropriate obcs for these motions e g flather 1976 marchesiello et al 2001 mason et al 2010 however in past studies of global internal tides and near inertial waves niws it has been shown that these waves reach the coastal margins e g arbic et al 2004 simmons et al 2004 simmons and alford 2012 waterhouse et al 2014 buijsman et al 2016 2020 raja et al 2022 hence it may also be important to include remote super inertial internal gravity waves from global internal wave models such as those cited above at the regional model open boundaries it has been shown that the frequency spectra for regional models lack energy at super tidal frequencies compared to observations e g kumar et al 2019 mazloff et al 2020 to obtain better agreement between regional models and observations for the high frequency continuum spectra remotely generated internal wave forcing should be included at the open boundaries nelson et al 2020 nelson et al 2020 and gong et al 2021 forced their regional simulations with high frequency baroclinic fields acquired from the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm llc4320 global simulation rocha et al 2016 and the high resolution empirical tide hret model an altimeter constrained internal tide model zaron 2019 respectively nelson et al 2020 found that the regional model frequency spectra agreed better with observations and the predictions of the garrett and munk 1975 spectrum up to 72 cycles per day cpd over what is seen in the global mitgcm llc4320 simulation although these recent studies were able to obtain improved internal wave dynamics in their regional simulations little attention was paid to the possibility of internal wave reflections at the open boundaries in this study we provide evidence that energy build up can occur in the domain due to internal tide reflections at the open boundaries we look at how well orlanski and specified obcs in combination with sponge layers mitigate boundary reflections of internal tides from the interior we also assess how much the regional simulation with remote internal wave forcing improves when compared to observations we choose to model the california current system ccs region because it contains a strong internal tide generator i e the mendocino escarpment and the local internal wave energetics are affected by remotely generated internal tides e g from hawaii and equatorward propagating niws the eddy rich ccs region is also an ideal site to study internal wave eddy interactions to be examined in a future paper lastly the ccs region will be one of the sites for the swot calibration and validation cal val experiment wang et al 2018 the

wave reflection analysis and the validation datasets we present our results on open boundary sensitivity analysis and model data comparisons in section 3 in section 4 we discuss our findings finally our conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 model setup we use the regional ocean modeling system roms to simulate the internal wave energetics near the u s west coast uswc roms is a 3 dimensional primitive equation free surface and split explicit regional ocean model it makes use of an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system in the horizontal plane and a topography following σ vertical coordinate system its forward backward feedback time stepping algorithms based hydrodynamic computational kernel adopts a novel temporally averaging filter which ensures that slow baroclinic motions are not contaminated via aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 we use the roms configuration of renault et al 2021 our roms regional simulations of the uswc feature a 4 km horizontal resolution defined on a c grid fig 1 our computational grid covers a significant portion of the uswc with the northernmost and southernmost vertices at 51 08 n and 22 71 n respectively the grid has 437 x 662 cells with a total area of approximately 1744 x 2644 km 2 the curvilinear grid is rotated at an angle of 28 7 in an anticlockwise manner relative to the eastward direction along the vertical direction our regional simulations feature 60 σ levels the surface and bottom refinement stretching parameters θ s and θ b and pycnocline depth h c are 6 3 and 250 m respectively shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 the bathymetry for the regional simulations is taken from the 30 arc second resolution srtm30 plus global topography grid becker et al 2009 except for the eastern boundary the other three boundaries of our computational domain are open to minimize depth mismatches at the open boundaries between the child and parent domains we modify the child s topography using 1 h c m α h c 1 α h p where h c m h c and h p are the modified child grid original child grid and parent grid topography respectively and 0 α 1 over a narrow strip in the vicinity of the open boundaries the parent grid is from a global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom simulation which is described in section 2 1 1 at the open boundaries we specify high frequency ω 0 67 cpd oceanic state variables extracted from the global hycom simulation oceanic low frequency ω 0 67 cpd forcing fields are also specified at the open boundaries but they are obtained from a 12 km horizontal resolution roms simulation of the north east pacific low frequency oceanic processes such as subtidal and mesoscale flows have temporal scales smaller than 1 cpd to retain these motions and minimize the leakage of tidal energy to the subtidal band we choose a 36 h 0 67 cpd cutoff period an extensive validation of the low frequency fields for our domain is documented in renault et al 2021 atmospheric forcing for all our simulations is derived from a 6 km horizontal resolution uncoupled regional version of the weather research and forecast wrf model skamarock et al 2008 renault et al 2016 the wrf model uses a bulk formula core large 2006 with a parameterization of the current feedback to the atmosphere to estimate the surface evaporation and turbulent heat and momentum fluxes renault et al 2020 we use hourly fields of 10 m wind air temperature and humidity at 2 m shortwave radiation longwave radiation and precipitation to force the roms simulations 2 1 1 high frequency boundary forcing remote high frequency boundary forcing with ω 0 67 cpd for our regional simulations is derived from a simulation of global hycom bleck et al 2002 wallcraft et al 2003 that includes realistic atmospheric and tidal forcing e g arbic et al 2010 2018 shriver et al 2012 hycom uses a hybrid vertical coordinate system with z coordinates in the surface mixed layer isopycnal layers in the open ocean and σ coordinates over the coastal shelf we force our roms domain with the global hycom expt 06 1 simulation buijsman et al 2017 2020 which has a nominal 8 km horizontal resolution and 41 hybrid layers in the vertical direction the expt 06 1 bathymetry is based on the gebco 08 topographic database https www gebco net in conjunction with astronomical tidal forcing for the k 1 o 1 m 2 s 2 and n 2 tidal constituents the non data assimilative expt 06 1 simulation utilizes realistic atmospheric forcing from the u s navy global environmental model navgem hogan et al 2014 to account for the generation and dissipation of unresolved internal wave modes expt 06 1 adopts a linear topographic wave drag scheme jayne and st laurent 2001 expt 06 1 has been exclusively validated against moorings and altimetry e g arbic et al 2018 buijsman et al 2020 luecke et al 2020 hourly model output of zonal and meridional velocity components u and v temperature t salinity s and sea surface height η for the period from 01 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 are obtained from hycom expt 06 1 we apply a 5th order butterworth filter with a 36 h cutoff to extract the high frequency components of these fields for every time step we employ roms pre processing matlab tools for the horizontal and vertical interpolation of hycom fields to the roms open boundaries before forcing our model with the interpolated hycom fields we ensure that the interpolation schemes perform satisfactorily see fig 2 our initialization file consists of roms low frequency hycom high frequency oceanic state variables for 01 october 2011 the weblinks to the matlab scripts for hycom to roms interpolation and all other relevant code scripts and datasets we use in this study are listed in the acknowledgments 2 1 2 open boundary conditions we conduct open boundary condition obc sensitivity experiments that use specified or flather obc flather 1976 mason et al 2010 for barotropic velocities and sea surface height and specified or modified orlanski obc marchesiello et al 2001 for baroclinic velocities and tracers based on the type of obc adopted for barotropic baroclinic fields we categorize our simulations into three groups specified specified ss flather specified fs and flather orlanski fo simulations table 1 the flather obc flather 1976 is a radiation obc based on the sommerfeld condition chapman 1985 the mathematical expression for the flather obc is 2 u u e x t g h η η e x t where u is the normal barotropic velocity at the open boundary u e x t is the corresponding external u η e x t is the external sea surface height h is the depth of the water column and g is the acceleration due to gravity the flather obc allows for mismatches between external barotropic information and interior solutions to be radiated out of the domain with the speed of a shallow water surface gravity wave g h a modified version of the flather obc suitable for staggered c grid models such as roms whose velocities and sea surface height are not co located is extensively described in mason et al 2010 the modified orlanski obc marchesiello et al 2001 uses a radiative relaxation numerical scheme the mathematical expression for this adaptive numerical scheme is 3 ϕ t c x ϕ x c y ϕ y 1 τ ϕ ϕ e x t where ϕ represents any of the baroclinic variables tracers in the domain ϕ e x t is the corresponding external variable at the open boundaries τ is the nudging coefficient and c x and c y are the dominating wave phase speeds in the x and y directions respectively eq 4 is a modified version of the orlanski obc orlanski 1976 with the addition of the nudging term 1 τ ϕ ϕ e x t during the active state i e ingoing fluxes ocean state variables in the nudging layer are relaxed towards the boundary forcing fields and the open boundary switches to the radiative type when fluxes are directed outwards i e passive the open boundary becomes active when the computed normal phase speed c x close to the boundary is negative and vice versa when it is passive we choose a relatively weak nudging coefficient for the passive state τ o u t 30 days and consider a stronger coefficient for the active state τ i n 0 005 day we observe that τ i n 0 01 day limits the radiation of remotely generated internal waves at the open boundaries i e under specification while we choose τ o u t such that τ o u t τ i n marchesiello et al 2001 unlike the flather and orlanski obcs that have radiation components in their numerical schemes the specified obc is a clamped obc at the open boundaries oceanic state variables at every time step are set to those of the parent grid for the specified obc 4 ϕ ϕ e x t where ϕ is any oceanic state variable and ϕ e x t is the corresponding external value for all our simulations we add sponge layers at the open boundaries previous studies have shown that the inclusion of these buffer zones at the open boundaries can assist in preventing over specification issues that may arise due to artificial reflections e g palma and matano 1998 marchesiello et al 2001 nycander and doos 2003 to better understand the effect of the sponge layer on our simulations we consider different sponge layer widths and horizontal viscosity values a h the shape function for our sponge layers follows that of a half cosine function with viscosity increasing from zero at the sponge interior to a maximum value at the open boundaries table 1 shows the sponge width and maximum viscosity values for all the simulations and nudging time scales for simulations with the flather and modified orlanski obcs i e the fo simulations 2 2 internal tide energetics to examine the internal tide generation radiation and dissipation within our computational domain we apply the depth integrated and time mean baroclinic energy balance equation carter et al 2008 kelly et al 2010 kang and fringer 2012 5 d e d t h f c d where e represents the total depth integrated baroclinic energy h f is the pressure flux divergence c is the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion and d is dissipation h x i ˆ y j ˆ and represents time averaging the total depth integrated baroclinic energy e is the sum of the depth integrated baroclinic horizontal kinetic energy h k e and the available potential energy a p e for a water column of depth h h k e and a p e can be expressed as 6 h k e ρ 0 2 h 0 u z 2 v z 2 d z 7 a p e ρ 0 2 h 0 n z 2 ξ z 2 d z where ρ 0 1027 4 kg m 3 u z u z i ˆ v z j ˆ is the baroclinic velocity vector n z is the buoyancy frequency and ξ z is the isopycnal displacement at depth z the baroclinic velocities are defined such that 8 u u u where u is the total velocity and u 1 h η h η u z d z is the barotropic velocity we compute the depth integrated baroclinic flux as nash et al 2005 9 f h 0 u z p z d z where p is the pressure perturbation the depth integration of the baroclinic velocities and pressure perturbations are equal to 0 we compute barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion as 10 c p z h u h h where p z h is the near bottom pressure perturbation we do not compute dissipation explicitly it is the residual of the sum of all other terms in eq 5 2 3 estimation of internal wave reflections we quantify internal wave reflections at the open boundaries with a discrete fourier transform dft technique which separates ingoing and outgoing waves gong et al 2021 in combination with an internal wave energy budget of the sponge layer in the appendix we illustrate the good performance of the dft technique on an analytical mode 1 standing wave and on a complex wave field from hycom we apply the dft technique to u v and p along transects perpendicular to the open boundaries and repeat this process for the 60 vertical layers each transect along which the dft technique is applied is 320 km long and equals two mode 1 m 2 internal tide wavelengths in the uswc buijsman et al 2020 the total baroclinic flux can be expressed as 11 f h 0 p i n p o u t u i n u o u t d z h 0 p i n u i n d z f i n h 0 p o u t u o u t d z f o u t h 0 p i n u o u t d z h 0 p o u t u i n d z f c r o s s where f i n and f o u t represent the depth integrated ingoing and outgoing flux components respectively and the last two terms are the cross terms f c r o s s a schematic showing the different fluxes that contribute to the semidiurnal internal wave energy budget of the sponge layer is presented in fig 3 we obtain f i n and f o u t by depth integrating unidirectional ingoing and outgoing fluxes at the sponge interior edges we do not consider the cross terms in eq 11 because they are very small after time averaging f h y c o m represents the depth integrated unidirectional ingoing flux from hycom f c o n is the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion in the sponge layer normalized by the length of the interior sponge boundary and f r is the depth integrated unidirectional reflected flux into the interior of the domain in the absence of reflections at the open boundaries neglecting dissipation of f h y c o m and assuming that the flux due to the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion in the sponge layer propagates into the interior of the domain we expect f o u t to balance f h y c o m f c o n in this study we treat the excess in f o u t as reflected flux and a deficit in f o u t as an indication of the over damping of f h y c o m due to the sponge layer because the sponge layer is expected to dampen some of the internal tide signals and we are not sure what fraction of the dissipation in this buffer zone comes from f h y c o m f i n and or the local conversion we create ranges for our reflection estimates f r 1 f r f r 4 based on the following assumptions 1 all dissipation in the sponge layer comes from f i n f r 1 f o u t f h y c o m f c o n 2 f c o n is completely dissipated in the sponge layer and the remaining dissipation in the sponge layer is from f i n f r 2 f o u t f h y c o m 3 one third of the dissipation in the sponge layer is from f h y c o m f r 3 f o u t f c o n f h y c o m 1 3 d 4 f c o n is completely dissipated in the sponge layer and one third of the remaining dissipation in the sponge layer is from f h y c o m f r 4 f o u t f h y c o m 1 3 d f c o n we choose one third of the dissipation in the third and fourth assumptions because f i n is expected to travel twice the distance than f h y c o m through the sponge layer before entering the interior we compute the reflection coefficient as λ f r f i n 2 4 model validation a year long solution of the simulation judged best is compared to observations after conducting the sensitivity analysis of the boundary forcing to quantify the improvements in model data comparisons with high frequency baroclinic forcing we also compare the simulation without remote internal wave forcing to observations 2 4 1 barotropic tides we validate the simulated barotropic tides in our domain with the tpxo9 atlas egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 we conduct harmonic analysis with the utide matlab package codiga 2011 on a year long roms η time series to extract the o 1 k 1 n 2 m 2 and s 2 tidal constituents we compute root mean square errors r m s e s for tidal elevations η the r m s e expression considers errors due to deviations in both simulated amplitude a and phase ϕ with respect to those of tpxo shriver et al 2012 i e 12 r m s e 1 2 a r cos ϕ r a x cos ϕ x 2 a r sin ϕ r a x sin ϕ x 2 where subscripts r and x stand for roms and tpxo respectively to determine how large the errors are relative to the simulated tidal signals we estimate the area averaged coefficient of determination arbic et al 2004 13 r η 2 1 r m s e σ η x 2 2 100 where σ η x 2 0 5 a x 2 is the tpxo sea surface height variance and represents area averaging 2 4 2 moorings we validate our model simulations with eulerian temperature and velocity measurements of the global multi archive current meter database gmacmd scott et al 2010 luecke et al 2020 we also consider temperature mooring instruments of the california current ecosystem cce database ohman et al 2013 for the gmacmd moorings we exclude mooring instruments that fall outside our domain and in the sponge layers we also eliminate moorings at locations where the depth of the sea floor is 500 m none of the cce moorings lie in the sponge or shallow regions the geographical locations and the distribution of the mooring instruments with depth in our domain are shown in fig 4 a total of 483 334 velocity and 149 temperature mooring instruments are considered the depth for the moorings ranges from 6 1 to 4300 m and approximately 58 of these moorings lie in the upper 1000 m of the water column we perform frequency spectral analysis on the mooring temperature and velocity datasets to achieve smooth frequency spectra we divide each time series into 30 days long segments with 50 overlaps prior to applying the fast fourier transform fft we remove the mean and the linear trend and we multiply each detrended time series by a tukey window with a taper length to total length ratio of 0 2 to preserve total variance we apply a variance preserving correction factor we then compute temperature variance σ t 2 and the velocity variance σ v e l 2 and integrate over three frequency bands semidiurnal 1 86 2 05 cpd super tidal 2 06 12 cpd and near inertial 0 9 f 1 74 cpd f is the local coriolis frequency for the near inertial band we account for remotely generated near inertial waves from the gulf of alaska whose northernmost latitude of 60 4 1 n corresponds to f 1 74 cpd the expressions for temperature and velocity variance are 14 σ t 2 2 δ t n ω m i n ω m a x t ω 2 d ω 15 σ v e l 2 δ t n ω m i n ω m a x u ω 2 v ω 2 d ω where n is the number of data points in a time series spaced at uniform δ t time intervals t ω u ω and v ω are the fourier coefficients for temperature eastward velocity u and northward velocity v respectively and ω m i n and ω m a x represent the lower and the upper frequency limits for each frequency band for model mooring comparisons we use the same statistics as adopted by luecke et al 2020 for all frequency bands we compute the ratio of the mean of the model variance to that of the moorings for velocity and temperature 16 γ σ m 2 σ o 2 where subscripts m and o refer to the simulated and observed variable respectively lastly we compute correlation coefficients r between simulations and observations 2 4 3 altimetry finally we compare baroclinic m 2 η amplitudes of one year roms simulations with those extracted from a 17 year long altimetry dataset which was used by shriver et al 2012 and buijsman et al 2020 in their global studies we extract complex harmonic η amplitudes for m 2 tides from the roms simulations using the utide package following shriver et al 2012 we interpolate the complex amplitudes to along track positions that fall in our domain we then apply a 50 400 km bandpass filter along ascending and descending tracks for roms and altimeter datasets to extract low mode internal tide complex amplitudes we apply the spatially varying correction factor of buijsman et al 2020 to the roms internal tide amplitudes the variance correction factor is the ratio of the equilibrium stationary variance to that of the simulated time series because the stationary internal tide variance obtained from a time series decreases with its duration ansong et al 2015 the variance correction factor is necessary to allow for the comparison of the stationary internal tide signals of the one year long roms simulations with those obtained from the much longer altimetry record the average variance correction factor for our domain is 0 81 finally we compute root mean square amplitude r m s a for both altimetry and the roms simulations and then ratios and correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 high frequency baroclinic fluxes at the open boundaries we compute the high frequency ω 0 67 cpd depth integrated and time averaged hycom baroclinic fluxes at the open boundaries for the period 01 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 fig 5a approximately 541 mw 93 w m of net high frequency baroclinic power enters our computational domain which is of similar magnitude as that of mazloff et al 2020 our northern 403 mw 210 w m and western 270 mw 102 w m boundaries act as sources while the southern boundary is a sink 132 mw 87 w m of high frequency baroclinic energy at the western and northern boundaries respectively 177 w m and 93 w m of net semidiurnal internal tidal flux enters the domain one of the origins of these remote fluxes is the hawaiian island chain to the west of our domain this is shown with the presence of internal tidal beams crossing the western northern boundaries fig 5a the southern boundary acts as a sink of approximately 37 w m of semidiurnal internal tidal flux as expected our analysis shows equatorward propagation of niws fig 5a niws 0 9 f 1 74 cpd enter our domain through the northern boundary and exit via the western and southern boundaries niws contribute more than 50 of the net high frequency baroclinic fluxes at the northern 117 w m and southern 50 w m boundaries this shows that niws make up a significant fraction of the high frequency barolinic forcing at the western boundary 75 w m of niws flux exits our domain 3 2 generation radiation and dissipation of semidiurnal internal tides the spatial pattern of the time mean 01 july 2012 31 august 2012 semidiurnal internal tide generation in our domain for fs800a without remote internal wave forcing is shown in fig 6a the mendocino escarpment fig 1 is an important generation site featuring c 10 mw m 2 other rough topographic features such as the continental margin and the spiess seamount chain fig 1 contribute to the total area integrated conversion of 1 87 gw 0 61 mw m 2 in our domain table 1 areas with c 0 are regions where the barotropic velocity and the near bottom baroclinic pressure field are out of phase with remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries internal tide generation in the interior of the domain increases area integrated conversion for the twin solution fs800b with remote internal wave forcing is 2 08 gw 0 68 mw m 2 this is an indication that the remote internal tides alter the magnitude and or phase of the near bottom pressure perturbation field in the domain buijsman et al 2010 kelly and nash 2010 kerry et al 2013 the radiation of internal tides away from the generation sites in our domain is determined by computing the time mean flux divergence h f the spatial pattern of the time mean flux divergence in fig 6b resembles that of conversion and is positive in areas of strong generation in some locations the flux divergence is negative e g in the sponge layer and on the continental margin this is an indication that the internal tide dissipation exceeds local generation we estimate internal tide dissipation as the residual of conversion and flux divergence following eq 5 the contributions of the time mean energy tendency and advection terms are very small not shown the plot of time mean internal tide dissipation fig 6c demonstrates that dissipation occurs throughout the domain with higher dissipation on the continental margin and in the sponge layer the internal tide dissipation in the sponge layer increases towards the open boundaries in agreement with the increase in horizontal viscosity see section 2 1 2 3 3 sensitivity of internal wave energetics to open boundary conditions in this section we conduct an obc sensitivity analysis for the semidiurnal band 1 60 cpd ω 2 67 cpd we choose 01 july 2012 31 august 2012 for our analysis because the semidiurnal internal tides that enter the domain from hawaii are strongest and niws are weakest during these months we initialized our trial simulations on 01 june 2012 allowing enough time for spin up 3 3 1 interior energetics the differences in semidiurnal baroclinic energy flux magnitude and direction between simulations without fs800a and with fs800b remote internal tides are large fig 5b and c with remote semidiurnal baroclinic forcing our domain becomes more energetic we list the area integrated depth integrated and time mean baroclinic h k e estimates for the 11 boundary sensitivity simulations and that of fs800a in table 1 we do not include the sponge layer in the computation of the reported h k e values to ensure an apples to apples comparison between the simulations we mask cells that fall within the larger sponge width i e 1 12th of the domain s width before computing the area integrated h k e of all the simulations fs800a has the lowest h k e estimate we record the highest baroclinic h k e estimates for fo100 and ss100 which feature the weakest sponge viscosity as we increase sponge viscosity and or sponge width the baroclinic h k e is reduced in the interior of the domain the question is are we reducing reflections in our domain and or are we over damping the incoming hycom fluxes at the open boundaries with increasing sponge viscosity and or sponge width we provide an answer to this question by estimating reflection coefficients in section 3 3 2 for simulations with similar sponge width and viscosity we obtain smaller h k e and c estimates for the ss group as compared to the fs and fo simulations table 1 we show in fig 7 the spatial h k e maps for ss600 fs600 and the difference between them although ss600 and fs600 have the same sponge width viscosity and obc for the baroclinic mode ss600 is less energetic over the entire domain as compared to fs600 simulations with specified obc for the barotropic fields have smaller conversion rates as compared to the simulations with flather obc we demonstrate in section 3 4 1 that the barotropic tide signals are more in agreement with tpxo for flather obc than for specified obc 3 3 2 internal tide reflections at the open boundaries to test our hypothesis that the increased h k e corresponding to lower sponge viscosities table 1 is due to increased reflections we carry out a baroclinic energy budget analysis of the sponge layer in table 2 we list the fluxes as defined in section 2 3 that contribute to the sponge s baroclinic energy budget for all the 11 trial simulations with remote internal wave forcing we also include dissipation estimates in the sponge layers for simulations with similar obcs and sponge widths e g ss100 ss400 the dissipation increases in the sponge layer with increasing viscosity values ss600 has a smaller dissipation estimate than ss400 because the latter has a wider sponge tables 1 and 2 fig 8a similarly the dissipation in fo300 is larger than in fo600 because fo300 has a larger sponge width than fo600 as the dissipation increases for increasing viscosity f o u t decreases table 2 fig 8b for all 11 trial simulations with remote internal wave forcing f o u t f h y c o m f c o n where f h y c o m 229 6 w m this indicates that interior energy is reflected in these simulations i e f r 0 as with f o u t the reflected flux f r decreases with increasing sponge viscosity fig 8c the impact of the increased viscosity on energy fluxes near the boundaries is shown in fig 9 at the open boundaries fo100 has higher depth integrated fluxes propagating into the domain compared to fo600 an indication of higher internal tide reflections due to smaller sponge viscosity in fig 9c there is more northeastward propagation of internal tides in fo100 as compared to fo600 almost everywhere in the domain this implies that reflected internal waves from the western boundary propagate into the domain over large distances similarly in fig 9f fo100 features more southeastward propagation of internal tides from the northern boundary and more northwestward propagation of internal tides from the southern boundary as compared to fo600 although ss600 and fs600 have similar boundary properties i e sponge width viscosity and specified obc for the baroclinic mode fs600 has stronger reflections fig 8c this is in agreement with our finding in the preceding section that larger surface tides and barotropic to baroclinic conversion is obtained for flather obc as compared to specified obc for barotropic tides we observe that orlanski obc causes more reflections than the specified obc table 2 this is an indication that the orlanski obc is not doing a better job in handling the highly dispersive outgoing wave packets from the interior of the domain to illustrate that reflections are enhanced in fo600 we show the spatial maps of h k e for fs600 fo600 and the difference between them in fig 10 while the h k e patterns for fs600 and fo600 are similar fig 10a and b fo600 is slightly more energetic in the majority of the domain fig 10c we compute a difference of 1619 7 1591 8 27 9 tj 9 2 j m 2 of area integrated averaged h k e between fo600 and fs600 see table 1 similar to f r λ diminishes with increasing sponge viscosity for simulations with a constant sponge width and similar obcs table 2 fig 8d λ attains its largest value of 73 for fo100 ss400 has the smallest reflection coefficient of 2 5 but the barotropic tides are less accurate for specified obc than for flather obc as will be discussed in section 3 4 1 λ is higher for simulations with baroclinic orlanski obc as compared to the simulations with specified obc we select fs800b as the best trial simulation because 1 the barotropic tides are well predicted with flather obc and 2 internal tide reflections at the open boundaries are minimized λ 17 5 9 9 when we use a combination of specified obc for the baroclinic mode and a 58 km wide sponge layer with a maximum viscosity of 800 m 2 s from our reflection analysis we conclude that it is necessary to include sponge layers at the open boundaries of internal wave resolving regional simulations to minimize reflections of internal waves from the interior when specifying remote internal waves at the open boundaries however one should be careful to prevent over damping of the remote internal wave signals 3 4 model data comparisons in this section we compare our best simulation fs800b λ 17 5 9 9 and its twin simulation with the same parameters but without remote internal wave forcing fs800a with observations we validate these simulations for the period from 08 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 we do not consider the first seven days after initialization 01 october 07 october 2011 to exclude any barotropic and or baroclinic spin up effects we present model validation results using tpxo in section 3 4 1 moorings in section 3 4 2 and altimetry in section 3 4 3 3 4 1 simulated barotropic tide validation using tpxo the area averaged r m s e eq 12 and the coefficient of determination r η 2 eq 13 for o 1 k 1 n 2 m 2 and s 2 tides for fs800b are given in table 3 we obtain similar estimates for fs800a because it also uses a flather obc for the barotropic tides overall the diurnal tidal constituents have the smallest area averaged r m s e s and the largest r η 2 compared to the semidiurnal tides the highest area weighted surface tidal error is for the m 2 tidal constituent 3 40 cm whereas s 2 has the smallest coefficient of determination of 97 71 the co tidal maps and r m s e for the two largest tidal constituents k 1 and m 2 are shown in fig 11 similar spatial distributions for amplitude and phase are observed in both the roms and tpxo9 co tidal maps however wiggles are present in the phase contours for roms these wiggles are due to internal tides for both the k 1 and m 2 tidal constituents we observe the highest r m s e s at the southeastern portion of our domain fig 11c f while the rmse for m 2 shows a decreasing trend with increasing distance away from the shoreline a more complex pattern exists for k 1 to determine if specified or flather obc is best for barotropic tidal forcing we compare r m s e and r η 2 values obtained for two month η time series for ss600 and fs600 table 4 area averaged r m s e and r η 2 estimates are poorer for ss600 as compared to fs600 in particular for the semidiurnal constituents 3 4 2 model validation using moorings we present the variance ratio γ between the simulations and the observations for the velocity variance in three frequency bands for the hycom simulation and roms simulations without fs800a and with fs800b remote internal wave forcing in table 5 and fig 12 across all frequency bands fs800a and fs800b have higher γ estimates compared to hycom because the higher horizontal and vertical resolution in roms allows for an improved generation and resolution of smaller scale internal wave and eddy features for both hycom and roms the super tidal band has the smallest γ estimates while the semidiurnal band has the highest γ estimates with remote internal wave forcing fs800b the velocity variance is larger than without remote internal wave forcing fs800a because internal tides from hawaii make up most of the remote semidiurnal internal tides in our domain it is not surprising that the velocity variance for the semidiurnal band increases in fs800b the largest increase in velocity variance is for the super tidal band with γ f s 800 b γ f s 800 a 1 8 with remote internal wave forcing the correlation r between roms and observations for the velocity variance increases table 5 however roms has poorer correlation with the observations than hycom for the semidiurnal band the smaller correlation in roms is attributed to a set of mooring measurements located on top of one of the spiess seamount chain 127 8100 e 32 4790 n the correlation estimate for roms for the semidiurnal band improves greatly after removing these outlying mooring data in addition the roms and hycom velocity variances also move closer to the observed variance similar to the velocity variance γ statistics for the hycom simulation are the poorest over all frequency bands for the temperature variance table 6 fig 12 we record improvements in γ across all frequency bands in fs800b with the presence of remote internal wave forcing γ is highest for the semidiurnal band γ 0 60 although we obtain the highest correlation between model and moorings for the super tidal band the super tidal band has the smallest γ estimates we attribute this to the coarse resolution in our simulations luecke et al 2020 which does not resolve the wave wave interactions required to obtain the observed high frequency variance we anticipate that as we nest down to finer resolutions γ will improve for the super tidal band 3 4 3 simulated m 2 internal tide validation using altimetry finally we compare the m 2 internal tide η amplitudes for roms simulations without fs800a and with fs800b remote internal wave forcing with the m 2 internal tide η amplitudes inferred from altimetry along track m 2 internal tide amplitudes for altimetry fs800a and fs800b are shown in fig 13a b and c the internal tide signals are stronger in the center of the domain the mendocino escarpment and seamounts such as the spiess seamount chain fig 1 are likely responsible for these strong signals with the inclusion of remote internal wave forcing the along track amplitudes increase almost everywhere in our domain fig 13d and e the ratio between roms and altimetry becomes closer and larger than unity the r m s a s before and after the stationary variance corrections see section 2 4 3 for fs800a and fs800b and the rmsa for altimetry are listed in table 7 r m s a s for fs800a and fs800b are 0 30 and 0 40 cm respectively before correction after correction the r m s a s for fs800a and fs800b are 0 28 and 0 36 cm respectively the r m s a for the altimetry is 0 37 cm with remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries the r m s a improves by 28 0 36 0 28 0 28 but is still 3 smaller than the rmsa of the altimetry data the roms spatial correlation r with altimetry also improves with remote internal wave forcing table 7 the along track spatial correlation increases from 0 83 to 0 98 in the presence of remote internal tides in summary both mooring and altimetry validations show that with remote internal wave forcing model data comparison statistics in the regional model simulations improve 4 discussion while we also demonstrate improvement in model data comparison with the presence of remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries this study serves as a precautionary tale for future studies that will consider remote internal wave forcing of regional simulations we show that the reflections of internal waves generated from the interior can lead to energy buildup and hence an apparent improvement of internal wave energetics as much as 178 9 w m λ 73 of internal tidal energy generated in the interior gets reflected at the open boundaries for fo100 a simulation with low viscosity values in the sponge layer we expect internal tide reflections to become worse in regions with a strong outgoing flux and without proper damping at the open boundaries in one way nested solutions of the three open boundaries only the southern boundary features net outgoing fluxes this boundary also has the worst reflections this may be attributed to the finer grid resolution in roms that allows internal tidal motions to be better resolved in the ccs than in hycom from which we are nesting one way to mitigate reflections is by adopting sponge layers at the open boundaries these buffers are expected to absorb internal waves generated from the interior but will also dampen ingoing internal wave fluxes at the open boundaries to some extent a solution would be to turn on the sponge layers during outgoing flow conditions only alternatively it may be useful to consider two way nesting for parent and child simulations with the same model e g debreu and blayo 2008 debreu et al 2012 to help reduce parent child grid mismatches at the open boundaries the application of flather or specified obc for the barotropic tidal forcing affects the surface tide amplitude and phase and the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion in the domain the agreement with tpxo in the uswc is less when we impose barotropic velocities and sea surface height from hycom as hard constraints i e specified obcs at the open boundaries unlike the flather obc which allows for the mismatch between the interior and exterior solutions to radiate out of the domain the poor performance of specified obc is due to the lack of volume conservation and the presence of reflections at the open boundaries when we clamp the depth averaged currents and sea surface height chapman 1985 marchesiello et al 2001 mason et al 2010 this causes a reduction in the surface tide amplitude 10 2 and in the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion rates 33 3 for the ss simulations compared to the other simulations with flather obc table 1 for the one year simulations we capture about 99 of the sea surface elevation variance of tpxo for the o 1 k 1 n 2 m 2 and s 2 tidal constituents this confirms that the barotropic tides in the east pacific in hycom are well predicted arbic et al 2010 buijsman et al 2015 2020 ngodock et al 2016 and the flather obc does a good job in propagating external barotropic tidal information while our model predictions for the barotropic tides are close to those of tpxo some differences are observed fig 11 errors in the barotropic tidal predictions could be the result of errors inherited from the parent hycom tidal solution the largest errors in our simulations occur in areas with complex topography such as the southeastern region and the shallow coastal shelf areas see fig 11c f these errors may be attributed to the relatively coarse grid and low bathymetry resolution as well as the omission of coastal estuaries and tidal straits wang et al 2006 jeon et al 2019 zaron and elipot 2021 small scale perturbations to amplitudes and phases are also observed e g in fig 11e unlike tpxo which is strictly a barotropic tidal model our roms simulations allow for the generation of internal tides the stripy patterns at the southernmost corner of the domain in fig 11c and the westernmost corner in fig 11f are due to reflected internal tide signals the distance between the stripes is 80 km which is half the wavelength of a mode one m 2 internal tide near the uswc this is in agreement with a standing wave pattern in which antinodes nodes are separated by half wavelength finally janekovic and powell 2012 showed that tidal errors increase for lower boundary forcing frequencies however the 1 cycle per hour barotropic forcing frequency that is used in this study does not cause significant errors according to figure a2 of janekovic and powell 2012 while the roms simulations use finer horizontal and vertical resolutions compared to the parent hycom solution the roms simulations have less agreement with the moorings on top of one of the spiess seamount chain 127 8100 e 32 4790 n as compared to the hycom simulation although the vertical profiles of semidiurnal horizontal kinetic energy in hycom and roms have the same spatial patterns these patterns are offset at the mooring depths 453 629 m results not shown this offset is due to the differences in the stratification profiles over this seamount in the roms and hycom simulations the different stratification profiles cause different eigenfunction shapes of the internal wave modes causing different vertical internal tide kinetic energy distributions in addition to loosing energy due to topographic scattering and nonlinear wave wave interactions kelly et al 2012 2013 olbers et al 2020 low mode internal tides are likely to become non phase locked when they interact with time varying stratification mean background currents and vorticity along their propagation paths rainville and pinkel 2006 zaron and egbert 2014 buijsman et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 while forcing regional models with phase locked internal tides e g from hret zaron 2019 gong et al 2021 may be sufficient for domains close to internal tide generation sites it may be insufficient for model domains located thousands of km from generation sites at the uswc phase locked internal tides extracted from a one year simulation contribute only 34 of the total semidiurnal baroclinic flux into the domain hence such forcing would underestimate the internal tide energy in the domain in addition niws may be an important fraction of high frequency baroclinic forcing of regional simulations for instance niws contribute more than half of the high frequency baroclinic fluxes at our domain s northern and southern boundaries fig 5 hence depending on the region of interest it may be important to include non phase locked internal tides and niws when considering high frequency baroclinic forcing of regional simulations to conclude our discussion we note that the performance of the remote internal waves in the regional simulation also depends on which global model simulation is used for the remote forcing for instance buijsman et al 2020 obtained a 34 increase in mode 1 m 2 internal tide energy for their 4 km horizontal resolution global hycom simulation h25 compared to the 8 km expt 06 1 simulation we use in this study they also observed better agreement to observations for the h25 simulation they attributed the increase in internal tide energy in h25 to increased topographic conversion and reduced wave drag strength hence it is possible that the model data comparison statistics reported in this study would improve if we were to force our model with the high frequency fields from h25 however we do not have a 1 year simulation of h25 at our disposal 5 summary and conclusions in this study in addition to astronomical tidal forcing we force realistic regional roms simulations of the u s west coast with subtidal fields from a basin scale roms simulation and with surface tides and remote internal waves from a global ocean hycom simulation with realistic tidal and atmospheric forcing the global model includes remotely generated internal tides and near inertial waves that propagate over long distances we test specified and flather open boundary conditions obcs for the barotropic mode and specified and modified orlanski obcs for the baroclinic mode to control the reflections of internal waves from the interior of the domain we add sponge layers of varying width and viscosities at the open boundaries we quantify internal tide reflections at the open boundaries using a discrete fourier transform dft technique in combination with an internal wave energy budget for the sponge layer lastly we compare simulations with minimum internal tide reflections against observations simulated barotropic tide amplitudes and phases are closer to those of tpxo9 atlas when flather instead of specified obc is used for barotropic tides we also find that the modified orlanski obc is less efficient in handling dispersive outgoing internal waves as compared to the specified obc furthermore our reflection analysis reveals a decrease in internal tide reflections at the open boundaries with an increase in sponge viscosity and or sponge width we find that the flather specified barotropic baroclinic obc combination with a 58 km wide sponge layer with a maximum viscosity of 800 m 2 s is the most optimal open boundary setup for remote internal wave forcing this setup yields a reflection coefficient λ 17 5 9 9 asides from the obc sensitivity tests we report improvements in model data comparisons with the presence of remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries with remote high frequency baroclinic forcing the simulated variance in velocity and temperature increases for the tidal near inertial and super tidal frequency bands and approaches the variance in the mooring data moreover the correlations also improve while the 4 km horizontal resolution adopted in this study does a relatively good job in resolving mesoscale near inertial and tidal motions super tidal motions are still poorly resolved hence the lowest simulated variance as a fraction of the observed variance γ is observed in the super tidal frequency band the semidiurnal band variance in the simulation with remote internal wave forcing is closest to observations also about 97 0 36 c m 0 37 c m of altimetry m 2 internal tide sea surface height root mean square amplitude r m s a is captured in the simulation with remote internal wave forcing finally along track correlation with altimetry increases from 0 83 to 0 98 when remote internal wave forcing is included in accordance with nelson et al 2020 and mazloff et al 2020 this study confirms that the model data agreement improves when remote internal wave forcing is included hence it may be important for future regional ocean simulation studies to consider adding realistic high frequency baroclinic forcing at the open boundaries however these studies should also consider implementing the best open boundary conditions to minimize excessive reflections of internal waves from the interior which may incorrectly increase internal wave energy levels credit authorship contribution statement oladeji q siyanbola conceptualization formal analysis visualization writing original draft writing review

oladeji17 matlab tree main h2r respectively appendix unidirectional separation technique at the open boundaries we separate baroclinic fluxes into ingoing and outgoing components using the discrete fourier transform dft technique we follow similar steps to those outlined in section 2 1 of gong et al 2021 in this appendix we demonstrate how effective the dft technique is when applied to an analytical standing wave comprising leftward and rightward propagating mode 1 sinusoidal waves we use the dft technique to separate the leftward and rightward components of our standing wave the length of our time series is 60 m 2 tidal cycles for this analysis the brünt v a isäl a frequency n the coriolis frequency f and the water depth h are similar to those used on page 76 of gerkema and zimmerman 2008 our mode 1 waves are generated using equation 5 23 of gerkema and zimmerman 2008 time snapshots of the results are shown in fig a 14 the difference between the separated fields obtained using the dft technique and the original wave signals are very small we also demonstrate that the dft separation technique is accurate when applied to a complex wave field the ingoing and outgoing flux vectors at the open boundaries of our regional domain obtained with the dft code for the global hycom simulation are shown in fig a 15 the internal tide beams in fig 5a are well represented by the dft technique e g beams at 36 n at the western boundary and 42 n at the northern boundary the boundaries that act as sources of internal tide energy west and north feature ingoing fluxes that are larger than the outgoing fluxes in contrast outgoing fluxes are larger than the ingoing fluxes at the southern boundary as a check we compare the net fluxes using the dft technique ingoing outgoing cross terms with the undecomposed fluxes and find them to be equal table a 8 because our decomposition technique is based on the dft amplitude and phase errors will be present at the tails when the original signal is not periodic in space this is expected to happen when applying the dft technique to realistic simulations we illustrate this phenomenon by considering the superposition of two non periodic signals propagating in opposite directions fig a 16 although there is a good agreement between the dft and the original standing wave signals the leftward and rightward constituents from the dft technique are not in good agreement with those of the original signals at the tail ends this is reflected in the decreasing r 2 values near the tail ends fig a 16 we obtain spurious fluxes at the tail ends of our chosen transects when we apply the dft code however the sponge interior edges along which we obtain our estimates for f i n and f o u t are farther away from the tail ends where amplitude and phase errors are likely to be significant lastly the lengths of the transects that are perpendicular to the boundary should be chosen such that they are not smaller than the wavelength of a mode 1 internal wave in the region of consideration 
23799,low mode internal waves are able to propagate across ocean basins and modulate ocean dynamics thousands of kilometers away from their generation sites in this study the impact of remotely generated internal waves on the internal wave energetics near the u s west coast is investigated with realistically forced regional ocean simulations at the open boundaries we impose high frequency oceanic state variables obtained from a global ocean simulation with realistic atmospheric and astronomical tidal forcing we use the discrete fourier transform dft technique in separating ingoing and outgoing internal tide energy fluxes at the open boundaries in order to quantify internal tide reflections although internal tide reflections are reduced with increasing sponge viscosity and or sponge layer width reflection coefficients λ can be as high as 73 in the presence of remote internal waves the model variance and spatial correlations become more in agreement with both mooring and altimetry datasets the results confirm that an improved internal wave continuum can be achieved in regional models with remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries however care should be taken to avoid excessive reflections of internal waves from the interior at these boundaries keywords regional ocean modeling high frequency boundary forcing internal waves open boundary sensitivity model data

their footprints into oceanographic measurements in situ e g waterhouse et al 2014 remotely sensed e g ray and zaron 2011 2016 and acoustic measurements e g dushaw et al 1995 li et al 2009 these baroclinic motions play a key role in multiple oceanic processes including diapycnal mixing e g kunze et al 2002 transport of sediments e g sinnett et al 2018 and transport of high nutrient waters from the deep part of the ocean to the surface e g tuerena et al 2019 the dissipation of barotropic tides by means of scattering into internal tides at rough bathymetry in the open ocean has been suggested to be responsible for half of the power required to maintain the meridional overturning circulation munk and wunsch 1998 egbert and ray 2000 2003 this demonstrates how important it is to track internal wave energy pathways from generation to dissipation to better understand the large scale ocean circulation and ocean climate although there is a growing effort directed towards increasing the resolution of oceanographic measurements one of which is the upcoming surface water and ocean topography swot altimeter mission fu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the large spatio temporal resolution of numerical ocean models cannot be matched however the ability of numerical ocean circulation models to resolve physical processes at smaller spatio temporal scales such as sub mesoscale eddies and internal waves requires relatively fine horizontal and or vertical grid resolutions van haren et al 2004 implementation of these resolutions in global ocean circulation models may incur a significant computational expense to overcome this problem regional ocean circulation models with resolutions much higher than are feasible in global simulations are used e g buijsman et al 2012 kelly et al 2012 kumar et al 2019 nelson et al 2020 regional models are forced at the lateral open boundaries with data from climatologies and global or basin scale model simulations e g chassignet et al 2007 zamudio et al 2008 buijsman et al 2012 chen et al 2013 to prevent significant drift away from the realistic ocean state choosing the right open boundary conditions obcs is also important in mitigating discontinuities at the open boundaries marchesiello et al 2001 over the past decades it has been a conventional practice to force regional models at the open boundaries with only sub inertial fields and barotropic tides and significant progress has been made towards developing appropriate obcs for these motions e g flather 1976 marchesiello et al 2001 mason et al 2010 however in past studies of global internal tides and near inertial waves niws it has been shown that these waves reach the coastal margins e g arbic et al 2004 simmons et al 2004 simmons and alford 2012 waterhouse et al 2014 buijsman et al 2016 2020 raja et al 2022 hence it may also be important to include remote super inertial internal gravity waves from global internal wave models such as those cited above at the regional model open boundaries it has been shown that the frequency spectra for regional models lack energy at super tidal frequencies compared to observations e g kumar et al 2019 mazloff et al 2020 to obtain better agreement between regional models and observations for the high frequency continuum spectra remotely generated internal wave forcing should be included at the open boundaries nelson et al 2020 nelson et al 2020 and gong et al 2021 forced their regional simulations with high frequency baroclinic fields acquired from the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm llc4320 global simulation rocha et al 2016 and the high resolution empirical tide hret model an altimeter constrained internal tide model zaron 2019 respectively nelson et al 2020 found that the regional model frequency spectra agreed better with observations and the predictions of the garrett and munk 1975 spectrum up to 72 cycles per day cpd over what is seen in the global mitgcm llc4320 simulation although these recent studies were able to obtain improved internal wave dynamics in their regional simulations little attention was paid to the possibility of internal wave reflections at the open boundaries in this study we provide evidence that energy build up can occur in the domain due to internal tide reflections at the open boundaries we look at how well orlanski and specified obcs in combination with sponge layers mitigate boundary reflections of internal tides from the interior we also assess how much the regional simulation with remote internal wave forcing improves when compared to observations we choose to model the california current system ccs region because it contains a strong internal tide generator i e the mendocino escarpment and the local internal wave energetics are affected by remotely generated internal tides e g from hawaii and equatorward propagating niws the eddy rich ccs region is also an ideal site to study internal wave eddy interactions to be examined in a future paper lastly the ccs region will be one of the sites for the swot calibration and validation cal val experiment wang et al 2018 the layout of this paper is as follows in section 2 we describe the setup of our ocean circulation model the boundary forcing the open boundary conditions the internal wave energy equations the internal wave reflection analysis and the validation datasets we present our results on open boundary sensitivity analysis and model data comparisons in section 3 in section 4 we discuss our findings finally our conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 model setup we use the regional ocean modeling system roms to simulate the internal wave energetics near the u s west coast uswc roms is a 3 dimensional primitive equation free surface and split explicit regional ocean model it makes use of an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system in the horizontal plane and a topography following σ vertical coordinate system its forward backward feedback time stepping algorithms based hydrodynamic computational kernel adopts a novel temporally averaging filter which ensures that slow baroclinic motions are not contaminated via aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 we use the roms configuration of renault et al 2021 our roms regional simulations of the uswc feature a 4 km horizontal resolution defined on a c grid fig 1 our computational grid covers a significant portion of the uswc with the northernmost and southernmost vertices at 51 08 n and 22 71 n respectively the grid has 437 x 662 cells with a total area of approximately 1744 x 2644 km 2 the curvilinear grid is rotated at an angle of 28 7 in an anticlockwise manner relative to the eastward direction along the vertical direction our regional simulations feature 60 σ levels the surface and bottom refinement stretching parameters θ s and θ b and pycnocline depth h c are 6 3 and 250 m respectively shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 the bathymetry for the regional simulations is taken from the 30 arc second resolution srtm30 plus global topography grid becker et al 2009 except for the eastern boundary the other three boundaries of our computational domain are open to minimize depth mismatches at the open boundaries between the child and parent domains we modify the child s topography using 1 h c m α h c 1 α h p where h c m h c and h p are the modified child grid original child grid and parent grid topography respectively and 0 α 1 over a narrow strip in the vicinity of the open boundaries the parent grid is from a global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom simulation which is described in section 2 1 1 at the open boundaries we specify high frequency ω 0 67 cpd oceanic state variables extracted from the global hycom simulation oceanic low frequency ω 0 67 cpd forcing fields are also specified at the open boundaries but they are obtained from a 12 km horizontal resolution roms simulation of the north east pacific low frequency oceanic processes such as subtidal and mesoscale flows have temporal scales smaller than 1 cpd to retain these motions and minimize the leakage of tidal energy to the subtidal band we choose a 36 h 0 67 cpd cutoff period an extensive validation of the low frequency fields for our domain is documented in renault et al 2021 atmospheric forcing for all our simulations is derived from a 6 km horizontal resolution uncoupled regional version of the weather research and forecast wrf model skamarock et al 2008 renault et al 2016 the wrf model uses a bulk formula core large 2006 with a parameterization of the current feedback to the atmosphere to estimate the surface evaporation and turbulent heat and momentum fluxes renault et al 2020 we use hourly fields of 10 m wind air temperature and humidity at 2 m shortwave radiation longwave radiation and precipitation to force the roms simulations 2 1 1 high frequency boundary forcing remote high frequency boundary forcing with ω 0 67 cpd for our regional simulations is derived from a simulation of global hycom bleck et al 2002 wallcraft et al 2003 that includes realistic atmospheric and tidal forcing e g arbic et al 2010 2018 shriver et al 2012 hycom uses a hybrid vertical coordinate system with z coordinates in the surface mixed layer isopycnal layers in the open ocean and σ coordinates over the coastal shelf we force our roms domain with the global hycom expt 06 1 simulation buijsman et al 2017 2020 which has a nominal 8 km horizontal resolution and 41 hybrid layers in the vertical direction the expt 06 1 bathymetry is based on the gebco 08 topographic database https www gebco net in conjunction with astronomical tidal forcing for the k 1 o 1 m 2 s 2 and n 2 tidal constituents the non data assimilative expt 06 1 simulation utilizes realistic atmospheric forcing from the u s navy global environmental model navgem hogan et al 2014 to account for the generation and dissipation of unresolved internal wave modes expt 06 1 adopts a linear topographic wave drag scheme jayne and st laurent 2001 expt 06 1 has been exclusively validated against moorings and altimetry e g arbic et al 2018 buijsman et al 2020 luecke et al 2020 hourly model output of zonal and meridional velocity components u and v temperature t salinity s and sea surface height η for the period from 01 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 are obtained from hycom expt 06 1 we apply a 5th order butterworth filter with a 36 h cutoff to extract the high frequency components of these fields for every time step we employ roms pre processing matlab tools for the horizontal and vertical interpolation of hycom fields to the roms open boundaries before forcing our model with the interpolated hycom fields we ensure that the interpolation schemes perform satisfactorily see fig 2 our initialization file consists of roms low frequency hycom high frequency oceanic state variables for 01 october 2011 the weblinks to the matlab scripts for hycom to roms interpolation and all other relevant code scripts and datasets we use in this study are listed in the acknowledgments 2 1 2 open boundary conditions we conduct open boundary condition obc sensitivity experiments that use specified or flather obc flather 1976 mason et al 2010 for barotropic velocities and sea surface height and specified or modified orlanski obc marchesiello et al 2001 for baroclinic velocities and tracers based on the type of obc adopted for barotropic baroclinic fields we categorize our simulations into three groups specified specified ss flather specified fs and flather orlanski fo simulations table 1 the flather obc flather 1976 is a radiation obc based on the sommerfeld condition chapman 1985 the mathematical expression for the flather obc is 2 u u e x t g h η η e x t where u is the normal barotropic velocity at the open boundary u e x t is the corresponding external u η e x t is the external sea surface height h is the depth of the water column and g is the acceleration due to gravity the flather obc allows for mismatches between external barotropic information and interior solutions to be radiated out of the domain with the speed of a shallow water surface gravity wave g h a modified version of the flather obc suitable for staggered c grid models such as roms whose velocities and sea surface height are not co located is extensively described in mason et al 2010 the modified orlanski obc marchesiello et al 2001 uses a radiative relaxation numerical scheme the mathematical expression for this adaptive numerical scheme is 3 ϕ t c x ϕ x c y ϕ y 1 τ ϕ ϕ e x t where ϕ represents any of the baroclinic variables tracers in the domain ϕ e x t is the corresponding external variable at the open boundaries τ is the nudging coefficient and c x and c y are the dominating wave phase speeds in the x and y directions respectively eq 4 is a modified version of the orlanski obc orlanski 1976 with the addition of the nudging term 1 τ ϕ ϕ e x t during the active state i e ingoing fluxes ocean state variables in the nudging layer are relaxed towards the boundary forcing fields and the open boundary switches to the radiative type when fluxes are directed outwards i e passive the open boundary becomes active when the computed normal phase speed c x close to the boundary is negative and vice versa when it is passive we choose a relatively weak nudging coefficient for the passive state τ o u t 30 days and consider a stronger coefficient for the active state τ i n 0 005 day we observe that τ i n 0 01 day limits the radiation of remotely generated internal waves at the open boundaries i e under specification while we choose τ o u t such that τ o u t τ i n marchesiello et al 2001 unlike the flather and orlanski obcs that have radiation components in their numerical schemes the specified obc is a clamped obc at the open boundaries oceanic state variables at every time step are set to those of the parent grid for the specified obc 4 ϕ ϕ e x t where ϕ is any oceanic state variable and ϕ e x t is the corresponding external value for all our simulations we add sponge layers at the open boundaries previous studies have shown that the inclusion of these buffer zones at the open boundaries can assist in preventing over specification issues that may arise due to artificial reflections e g palma and matano 1998 marchesiello et al 2001 nycander and doos 2003 to better understand the effect of the sponge layer on our simulations we consider different sponge layer widths and horizontal viscosity values a h the shape function for our sponge layers follows that of a half cosine function with viscosity increasing from zero at the sponge interior to a maximum value at the open boundaries table 1 shows the sponge width and maximum viscosity values for all the simulations and nudging time scales for simulations with the flather and modified orlanski obcs i e the fo simulations 2 2 internal tide energetics to examine the internal tide generation radiation and dissipation within our computational domain we apply the depth integrated and time mean baroclinic energy balance equation carter et al 2008 kelly et al 2010 kang and fringer 2012 5 d e d t h f c d where e represents the total depth integrated baroclinic energy h f is the pressure flux divergence c is the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion and d is dissipation h x i ˆ y j ˆ and represents time averaging the total depth integrated baroclinic energy e is the sum of the depth integrated baroclinic horizontal kinetic energy h k e and the available potential energy a p e for a water column of depth h h k e and a p e can be expressed as 6 h k e ρ 0 2 h 0 u z 2 v z 2 d z 7 a p e ρ 0 2 h 0 n z 2 ξ z 2 d z where ρ 0 1027 4 kg m 3 u z u z i ˆ v z j ˆ is the baroclinic velocity vector n z is the buoyancy frequency and ξ z is the isopycnal displacement at depth z the baroclinic velocities are defined such that 8 u u u where u is the total velocity and u 1 h η h η u z d z is the barotropic velocity we compute the depth integrated baroclinic flux as nash et al 2005 9 f h 0 u z p z d z where p is the pressure perturbation the depth integration of the baroclinic velocities and pressure perturbations are equal to 0 we compute barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion as 10 c p z h u h h where p z h is the near bottom pressure perturbation we do not compute dissipation explicitly it is the residual of the sum of all other terms in eq 5 2 3 estimation of internal wave reflections we quantify internal wave reflections at the open boundaries with a discrete fourier transform dft technique which separates ingoing and outgoing waves gong et al 2021 in combination with an internal wave energy budget of the sponge layer in the appendix we illustrate the good performance of the dft technique on an analytical mode 1 standing wave and on a complex wave field from hycom we apply the dft technique to u v and p along transects perpendicular to the open boundaries and repeat this process for the 60 vertical layers each transect along which the dft technique is applied is 320 km long and equals two mode 1 m 2 internal tide wavelengths in the uswc buijsman et al 2020 the total baroclinic flux can be expressed as 11 f h 0 p i n p o u t u i n u o u t d z h 0 p i n u i n d z f i n h 0 p o u t u o u t d z f o u t h 0 p i n u o u t d z h 0 p o u t u i n d z f c r o s s where f i n and f o u t represent the depth integrated ingoing and outgoing flux components respectively and the last two terms are the cross terms f c r o s s a schematic showing the different fluxes that contribute to the semidiurnal internal wave energy budget of the sponge layer is presented in fig 3 we obtain f i n and f o u t by depth integrating unidirectional ingoing and outgoing fluxes at the sponge interior edges we do not consider the cross terms in eq 11 because they are very small after time averaging f h y c o m represents the depth integrated unidirectional ingoing flux from hycom f c o n is the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion in the sponge layer normalized by the length of the interior sponge boundary and f r is the depth integrated unidirectional reflected flux into the interior of the domain in the absence of reflections at the open boundaries neglecting dissipation of f h y c o m and assuming that the flux due to the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion in the sponge layer propagates into the interior of the domain we expect f o u t to balance f h y c o m f c o n in this study we treat the excess in f o u t as reflected flux and a deficit in f o u t as an indication of the over damping of f h y c o m due to the sponge layer because the sponge layer is expected to dampen some of the internal tide signals and we are not sure what fraction of the dissipation in this buffer zone comes from f h y c o m f i n and or the local conversion we create ranges for our reflection estimates f r 1 f r f r 4 based on the following assumptions 1 all dissipation in the sponge layer comes from f i n f r 1 f o u t f h y c o m f c o n 2 f c o n is completely dissipated in the sponge layer and the remaining dissipation in the sponge layer is from f i n f r 2 f o u t f h y c o m 3 one third of the dissipation in the sponge layer is from f h y c o m f r 3 f o u t f c o n f h y c o m 1 3 d 4 f c o n is completely dissipated in the sponge layer and one third of the remaining dissipation in the sponge layer is from f h y c o m f r 4 f o u t f h y c o m 1 3 d f c o n we choose one third of the dissipation in the third and fourth assumptions because f i n is expected to travel twice the distance than f h y c o m through the sponge layer before entering the interior we compute the reflection coefficient as λ f r f i n 2 4 model validation a year long solution of the simulation judged best is compared to observations after conducting the sensitivity analysis of the boundary forcing to quantify the improvements in model data comparisons with high frequency baroclinic forcing we also compare the simulation without remote internal wave forcing to observations 2 4 1 barotropic tides we validate the simulated barotropic tides in our domain with the tpxo9 atlas egbert et al 1994 egbert and erofeeva 2002 we conduct harmonic analysis with the utide matlab package codiga 2011 on a year long roms η time series to extract the o 1 k 1 n 2 m 2 and s 2 tidal constituents we compute root mean square errors r m s e s for tidal elevations η the r m s e expression considers errors due to deviations in both simulated amplitude a and phase ϕ with respect to those of tpxo shriver et al 2012 i e 12 r m s e 1 2 a r cos ϕ r a x cos ϕ x 2 a r sin ϕ r a x sin ϕ x 2 where subscripts r and x stand for roms and tpxo respectively to determine how large the errors are relative to the simulated tidal signals we estimate the area averaged coefficient of determination arbic et al 2004 13 r η 2 1 r m s e σ η x 2 2 100 where σ η x 2 0 5 a x 2 is the tpxo sea surface height variance and represents area averaging 2 4 2 moorings we validate our model simulations with eulerian temperature and velocity measurements of the global multi archive current meter database gmacmd scott et al 2010 luecke et al 2020 we also consider temperature mooring instruments of the california current ecosystem cce database ohman et al 2013 for the gmacmd moorings we exclude mooring instruments that fall outside our domain and in the sponge layers we also eliminate moorings at locations where the depth of the sea floor is 500 m none of the cce moorings lie in the sponge or shallow regions the geographical locations and the distribution of the mooring instruments with depth in our domain are shown in fig 4 a total of 483 334 velocity and 149 temperature mooring instruments are considered the depth for the moorings ranges from 6 1 to 4300 m and approximately 58 of these moorings lie in the upper 1000 m of the water column we perform frequency spectral analysis on the mooring temperature and velocity datasets to achieve smooth frequency spectra we divide each time series into 30 days long segments with 50 overlaps prior to applying the fast fourier transform fft we remove the mean and the linear trend and we multiply each detrended time series by a tukey window with a taper length to total length ratio of 0 2 to preserve total variance we apply a variance preserving correction factor we then compute temperature variance σ t 2 and the velocity variance σ v e l 2 and integrate over three frequency bands semidiurnal 1 86 2 05 cpd super tidal 2 06 12 cpd and near inertial 0 9 f 1 74 cpd f is the local coriolis frequency for the near inertial band we account for remotely generated near inertial waves from the gulf of alaska whose northernmost latitude of 60 4 1 n corresponds to f 1 74 cpd the expressions for temperature and velocity variance are 14 σ t 2 2 δ t n ω m i n ω m a x t ω 2 d ω 15 σ v e l 2 δ t n ω m i n ω m a x u ω 2 v ω 2 d ω where n is the number of data points in a time series spaced at uniform δ t time intervals t ω u ω and v ω are the fourier coefficients for temperature eastward velocity u and northward velocity v respectively and ω m i n and ω m a x represent the lower and the upper frequency limits for each frequency band for model mooring comparisons we use the same statistics as adopted by luecke et al 2020 for all frequency bands we compute the ratio of the mean of the model variance to that of the moorings for velocity and temperature 16 γ σ m 2 σ o 2 where subscripts m and o refer to the simulated and observed variable respectively lastly we compute correlation coefficients r between simulations and observations 2 4 3 altimetry finally we compare baroclinic m 2 η amplitudes of one year roms simulations with those extracted from a 17 year long altimetry dataset which was used by shriver et al 2012 and buijsman et al 2020 in their global studies we extract complex harmonic η amplitudes for m 2 tides from the roms simulations using the utide package following shriver et al 2012 we interpolate the complex amplitudes to along track positions that fall in our domain we then apply a 50 400 km bandpass filter along ascending and descending tracks for roms and altimeter datasets to extract low mode internal tide complex amplitudes we apply the spatially varying correction factor of buijsman et al 2020 to the roms internal tide amplitudes the variance correction factor is the ratio of the equilibrium stationary variance to that of the simulated time series because the stationary internal tide variance obtained from a time series decreases with its duration ansong et al 2015 the variance correction factor is necessary to allow for the comparison of the stationary internal tide signals of the one year long roms simulations with those obtained from the much longer altimetry record the average variance correction factor for our domain is 0 81 finally we compute root mean square amplitude r m s a for both altimetry and the roms simulations and then ratios and correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 high frequency baroclinic fluxes at the open boundaries we compute the high frequency ω 0 67 cpd depth integrated and time averaged hycom baroclinic fluxes at the open boundaries for the period 01 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 fig 5a approximately 541 mw 93 w m of net high frequency baroclinic power enters our computational domain which is of similar magnitude as that of mazloff et al 2020 our northern 403 mw 210 w m and western 270 mw 102 w m boundaries act as sources while the southern boundary is a sink 132 mw 87 w m of high frequency baroclinic energy at the western and northern boundaries respectively 177 w m and 93 w m of net semidiurnal internal tidal flux enters the domain one of the origins of these remote fluxes is the hawaiian island chain to the west of our domain this is shown with the presence of internal tidal beams crossing the western northern boundaries fig 5a the southern boundary acts as a sink of approximately 37 w m of semidiurnal internal tidal flux as expected our analysis shows equatorward propagation of niws fig 5a niws 0 9 f 1 74 cpd enter our domain through the northern boundary and exit via the western and southern boundaries niws contribute more than 50 of the net high frequency baroclinic fluxes at the northern 117 w m and southern 50 w m boundaries this shows that niws make up a significant fraction of the high frequency barolinic forcing at the western boundary 75 w m of niws flux exits our domain 3 2 generation radiation and dissipation of semidiurnal internal tides the spatial pattern of the time mean 01 july 2012 31 august 2012 semidiurnal internal tide generation in our domain for fs800a without remote internal wave forcing is shown in fig 6a the mendocino escarpment fig 1 is an important generation site featuring c 10 mw m 2 other rough topographic features such as the continental margin and the spiess seamount chain fig 1 contribute to the total area integrated conversion of 1 87 gw 0 61 mw m 2 in our domain table 1 areas with c 0 are regions where the barotropic velocity and the near bottom baroclinic pressure field are out of phase with remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries internal tide generation in the interior of the domain increases area integrated conversion for the twin solution fs800b with remote internal wave forcing is 2 08 gw 0 68 mw m 2 this is an indication that the remote internal tides alter the magnitude and or phase of the near bottom pressure perturbation field in the domain buijsman et al 2010 kelly and nash 2010 kerry et al 2013 the radiation of internal tides away from the generation sites in our domain is determined by computing the time mean flux divergence h f the spatial pattern of the time mean flux divergence in fig 6b resembles that of conversion and is positive in areas of strong generation in some locations the flux divergence is negative e g in the sponge layer and on the continental margin this is an indication that the internal tide dissipation exceeds local generation we estimate internal tide dissipation as the residual of conversion and flux divergence following eq 5 the contributions of the time mean energy tendency and advection terms are very small not shown the plot of time mean internal tide dissipation fig 6c demonstrates that dissipation occurs throughout the domain with higher dissipation on the continental margin and in the sponge layer the internal tide dissipation in the sponge layer increases towards the open boundaries in agreement with the increase in horizontal viscosity see section 2 1 2 3 3 sensitivity of internal wave energetics to open boundary conditions in this section we conduct an obc sensitivity analysis for the semidiurnal band 1 60 cpd ω 2 67 cpd we choose 01 july 2012 31 august 2012 for our analysis because the semidiurnal internal tides that enter the domain from hawaii are strongest and niws are weakest during these months we initialized our trial simulations on 01 june 2012 allowing enough time for spin up 3 3 1 interior energetics the differences in semidiurnal baroclinic energy flux magnitude and direction between simulations without fs800a and with fs800b remote internal tides are large fig 5b and c with remote semidiurnal baroclinic forcing our domain becomes more energetic we list the area integrated depth integrated and time mean baroclinic h k e estimates for the 11 boundary sensitivity simulations and that of fs800a in table 1 we do not include the sponge layer in the computation of the reported h k e values to ensure an apples to apples comparison between the simulations we mask cells that fall within the larger sponge width i e 1 12th of the domain s width before computing the area integrated h k e of all the simulations fs800a has the lowest h k e estimate we record the highest baroclinic h k e estimates for fo100 and ss100 which feature the weakest sponge viscosity as we increase sponge viscosity and or sponge width the baroclinic h k e is reduced in the interior of the domain the question is are we reducing reflections in our domain and or are we over damping the incoming hycom fluxes at the open boundaries with increasing sponge viscosity and or sponge width we provide an answer to this question by estimating reflection coefficients in section 3 3 2 for simulations with similar sponge width and viscosity we obtain smaller h k e and c estimates for the ss group as compared to the fs and fo simulations table 1 we show in fig 7 the spatial h k e maps for ss600 fs600 and the difference between them although ss600 and fs600 have the same sponge width viscosity and obc for the baroclinic mode ss600 is less energetic over the entire domain as compared to fs600 simulations with specified obc for the barotropic fields have smaller conversion rates as compared to the simulations with flather obc we demonstrate in section 3 4 1 that the barotropic tide signals are more in agreement with tpxo for flather obc than for specified obc 3 3 2 internal tide reflections at the open boundaries to test our hypothesis that the increased h k e corresponding to lower sponge viscosities table 1 is due to increased reflections we carry out a baroclinic energy budget analysis of the sponge layer in table 2 we list the fluxes as defined in section 2 3 that contribute to the sponge s baroclinic energy budget for all the 11 trial simulations with remote internal wave forcing we also include dissipation estimates in the sponge layers for simulations with similar obcs and sponge widths e g ss100 ss400 the dissipation increases in the sponge layer with increasing viscosity values ss600 has a smaller dissipation estimate than ss400 because the latter has a wider sponge tables 1 and 2 fig 8a similarly the dissipation in fo300 is larger than in fo600 because fo300 has a larger sponge width than fo600 as the dissipation increases for increasing viscosity f o u t decreases table 2 fig 8b for all 11 trial simulations with remote internal wave forcing f o u t f h y c o m f c o n where f h y c o m 229 6 w m this indicates that interior energy is reflected in these simulations i e f r 0 as with f o u t the reflected flux f r decreases with increasing sponge viscosity fig 8c the impact of the increased viscosity on energy fluxes near the boundaries is shown in fig 9 at the open boundaries fo100 has higher depth integrated fluxes propagating into the domain compared to fo600 an indication of higher internal tide reflections due to smaller sponge viscosity in fig 9c there is more northeastward propagation of internal tides in fo100 as compared to fo600 almost everywhere in the domain this implies that reflected internal waves from the western boundary propagate into the domain over large distances similarly in fig 9f fo100 features more southeastward propagation of internal tides from the northern boundary and more northwestward propagation of internal tides from the southern boundary as compared to fo600 although ss600 and fs600 have similar boundary properties i e sponge width viscosity and specified obc for the baroclinic mode fs600 has stronger reflections fig 8c this is in agreement with our finding in the preceding section that larger surface tides and barotropic to baroclinic conversion is obtained for flather obc as compared to specified obc for barotropic tides we observe that orlanski obc causes more reflections than the specified obc table 2 this is an indication that the orlanski obc is not doing a better job in handling the highly dispersive outgoing wave packets from the interior of the domain to illustrate that reflections are enhanced in fo600 we show the spatial maps of h k e for fs600 fo600 and the difference between them in fig 10 while the h k e patterns for fs600 and fo600 are similar fig 10a and b fo600 is slightly more energetic in the majority of the domain fig 10c we compute a difference of 1619 7 1591 8 27 9 tj 9 2 j m 2 of area integrated averaged h k e between fo600 and fs600 see table 1 similar to f r λ diminishes with increasing sponge viscosity for simulations with a constant sponge width and similar obcs table 2 fig 8d λ attains its largest value of 73 for fo100 ss400 has the smallest reflection coefficient of 2 5 but the barotropic tides are less accurate for specified obc than for flather obc as will be discussed in section 3 4 1 λ is higher for simulations with baroclinic orlanski obc as compared to the simulations with specified obc we select fs800b as the best trial simulation because 1 the barotropic tides are well predicted with flather obc and 2 internal tide reflections at the open boundaries are minimized λ 17 5 9 9 when we use a combination of specified obc for the baroclinic mode and a 58 km wide sponge layer with a maximum viscosity of 800 m 2 s from our reflection analysis we conclude that it is necessary to include sponge layers at the open boundaries of internal wave resolving regional simulations to minimize reflections of internal waves from the interior when specifying remote internal waves at the open boundaries however one should be careful to prevent over damping of the remote internal wave signals 3 4 model data comparisons in this section we compare our best simulation fs800b λ 17 5 9 9 and its twin simulation with the same parameters but without remote internal wave forcing fs800a with observations we validate these simulations for the period from 08 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 we do not consider the first seven days after initialization 01 october 07 october 2011 to exclude any barotropic and or baroclinic spin up effects we present model validation results using tpxo in section 3 4 1 moorings in section 3 4 2 and altimetry in section 3 4 3 3 4 1 simulated barotropic tide validation using tpxo the area averaged r m s e eq 12 and the coefficient of determination r η 2 eq 13 for o 1 k 1 n 2 m 2 and s 2 tides for fs800b are given in table 3 we obtain similar estimates for fs800a because it also uses a flather obc for the barotropic tides overall the diurnal tidal constituents have the smallest area averaged r m s e s and the largest r η 2 compared to the semidiurnal tides the highest area weighted surface tidal error is for the m 2 tidal constituent 3 40 cm whereas s 2 has the smallest coefficient of determination of 97 71 the co tidal maps and r m s e for the two largest tidal constituents k 1 and m 2 are shown in fig 11 similar spatial distributions for amplitude and phase are observed in both the roms and tpxo9 co tidal maps however wiggles are present in the phase contours for roms these wiggles are due to internal tides for both the k 1 and m 2 tidal constituents we observe the highest r m s e s at the southeastern portion of our domain fig 11c f while the rmse for m 2 shows a decreasing trend with increasing distance away from the shoreline a more complex pattern exists for k 1 to determine if specified or flather obc is best for barotropic tidal forcing we compare r m s e and r η 2 values obtained for two month η time series for ss600 and fs600 table 4 area averaged r m s e and r η 2 estimates are poorer for ss600 as compared to fs600 in particular for the semidiurnal constituents 3 4 2 model validation using moorings we present the variance ratio γ between the simulations and the observations for the velocity variance in three frequency bands for the hycom simulation and roms simulations without fs800a and with fs800b remote internal wave forcing in table 5 and fig 12 across all frequency bands fs800a and fs800b have higher γ estimates compared to hycom because the higher horizontal and vertical resolution in roms allows for an improved generation and resolution of smaller scale internal wave and eddy features for both hycom and roms the super tidal band has the smallest γ estimates while the semidiurnal band has the highest γ estimates with remote internal wave forcing fs800b the velocity variance is larger than without remote internal wave forcing fs800a because internal tides from hawaii make up most of the remote semidiurnal internal tides in our domain it is not surprising that the velocity variance for the semidiurnal band increases in fs800b the largest increase in velocity variance is for the super tidal band with γ f s 800 b γ f s 800 a 1 8 with remote internal wave forcing the correlation r between roms and observations for the velocity variance increases table 5 however roms has poorer correlation with the observations than hycom for the semidiurnal band the smaller correlation in roms is attributed to a set of mooring measurements located on top of one of the spiess seamount chain 127 8100 e 32 4790 n the correlation estimate for roms for the semidiurnal band improves greatly after removing these outlying mooring data in addition the roms and hycom velocity variances also move closer to the observed variance similar to the velocity variance γ statistics for the hycom simulation are the poorest over all frequency bands for the temperature variance table 6 fig 12 we record improvements in γ across all frequency bands in fs800b with the presence of remote internal wave forcing γ is highest for the semidiurnal band γ 0 60 although we obtain the highest correlation between model and moorings for the super tidal band the super tidal band has the smallest γ estimates we attribute this to the coarse resolution in our simulations luecke et al 2020 which does not resolve the wave wave interactions required to obtain the observed high frequency variance we anticipate that as we nest down to finer resolutions γ will improve for the super tidal band 3 4 3 simulated m 2 internal tide validation using altimetry finally we compare the m 2 internal tide η amplitudes for roms simulations without fs800a and with fs800b remote internal wave forcing with the m 2 internal tide η amplitudes inferred from altimetry along track m 2 internal tide amplitudes for altimetry fs800a and fs800b are shown in fig 13a b and c the internal tide signals are stronger in the center of the domain the mendocino escarpment and seamounts such as the spiess seamount chain fig 1 are likely responsible for these strong signals with the inclusion of remote internal wave forcing the along track amplitudes increase almost everywhere in our domain fig 13d and e the ratio between roms and altimetry becomes closer and larger than unity the r m s a s before and after the stationary variance corrections see section 2 4 3 for fs800a and fs800b and the rmsa for altimetry are listed in table 7 r m s a s for fs800a and fs800b are 0 30 and 0 40 cm respectively before correction after correction the r m s a s for fs800a and fs800b are 0 28 and 0 36 cm respectively the r m s a for the altimetry is 0 37 cm with remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries the r m s a improves by 28 0 36 0 28 0 28 but is still 3 smaller than the rmsa of the altimetry data the roms spatial correlation r with altimetry also improves with remote internal wave forcing table 7 the along track spatial correlation increases from 0 83 to 0 98 in the presence of remote internal tides in summary both mooring and altimetry validations show that with remote internal wave forcing model data comparison statistics in the regional model simulations improve 4 discussion while we also demonstrate improvement in model data comparison with the presence of remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries this study serves as a precautionary tale for future studies that will consider remote internal wave forcing of regional simulations we show that the reflections of internal waves generated from the interior can lead to energy buildup and hence an apparent improvement of internal wave energetics as much as 178 9 w m λ 73 of internal tidal energy generated in the interior gets reflected at the open boundaries for fo100 a simulation with low viscosity values in the sponge layer we expect internal tide reflections to become worse in regions with a strong outgoing flux and without proper damping at the open boundaries in one way nested solutions of the three open boundaries only the southern boundary features net outgoing fluxes this boundary also has the worst reflections this may be attributed to the finer grid resolution in roms that allows internal tidal motions to be better resolved in the ccs than in hycom from which we are nesting one way to mitigate reflections is by adopting sponge layers at the open boundaries these buffers are expected to absorb internal waves generated from the interior but will also dampen ingoing internal wave fluxes at the open boundaries to some extent a solution would be to turn on the sponge layers during outgoing flow conditions only alternatively it may be useful to consider two way nesting for parent and child simulations with the same model e g debreu and blayo 2008 debreu et al 2012 to help reduce parent child grid mismatches at the open boundaries the application of flather or specified obc for the barotropic tidal forcing affects the surface tide amplitude and phase and the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion in the domain the agreement with tpxo in the uswc is less when we impose barotropic velocities and sea surface height from hycom as hard constraints i e specified obcs at the open boundaries unlike the flather obc which allows for the mismatch between the interior and exterior solutions to radiate out of the domain the poor performance of specified obc is due to the lack of volume conservation and the presence of reflections at the open boundaries when we clamp the depth averaged currents and sea surface height chapman 1985 marchesiello et al 2001 mason et al 2010 this causes a reduction in the surface tide amplitude 10 2 and in the barotropic to baroclinic tide conversion rates 33 3 for the ss simulations compared to the other simulations with flather obc table 1 for the one year simulations we capture about 99 of the sea surface elevation variance of tpxo for the o 1 k 1 n 2 m 2 and s 2 tidal constituents this confirms that the barotropic tides in the east pacific in hycom are well predicted arbic et al 2010 buijsman et al 2015 2020 ngodock et al 2016 and the flather obc does a good job in propagating external barotropic tidal information while our model predictions for the barotropic tides are close to those of tpxo some differences are observed fig 11 errors in the barotropic tidal predictions could be the result of errors inherited from the parent hycom tidal solution the largest errors in our simulations occur in areas with complex topography such as the southeastern region and the shallow coastal shelf areas see fig 11c f these errors may be attributed to the relatively coarse grid and low bathymetry resolution as well as the omission of coastal estuaries and tidal straits wang et al 2006 jeon et al 2019 zaron and elipot 2021 small scale perturbations to amplitudes and phases are also observed e g in fig 11e unlike tpxo which is strictly a barotropic tidal model our roms simulations allow for the generation of internal tides the stripy patterns at the southernmost corner of the domain in fig 11c and the westernmost corner in fig 11f are due to reflected internal tide signals the distance between the stripes is 80 km which is half the wavelength of a mode one m 2 internal tide near the uswc this is in agreement with a standing wave pattern in which antinodes nodes are separated by half wavelength finally janekovic and powell 2012 showed that tidal errors increase for lower boundary forcing frequencies however the 1 cycle per hour barotropic forcing frequency that is used in this study does not cause significant errors according to figure a2 of janekovic and powell 2012 while the roms simulations use finer horizontal and vertical resolutions compared to the parent hycom solution the roms simulations have less agreement with the moorings on top of one of the spiess seamount chain 127 8100 e 32 4790 n as compared to the hycom simulation although the vertical profiles of semidiurnal horizontal kinetic energy in hycom and roms have the same spatial patterns these patterns are offset at the mooring depths 453 629 m results not shown this offset is due to the differences in the stratification profiles over this seamount in the roms and hycom simulations the different stratification profiles cause different eigenfunction shapes of the internal wave modes causing different vertical internal tide kinetic energy distributions in addition to loosing energy due to topographic scattering and nonlinear wave wave interactions kelly et al 2012 2013 olbers et al 2020 low mode internal tides are likely to become non phase locked when they interact with time varying stratification mean background currents and vorticity along their propagation paths rainville and pinkel 2006 zaron and egbert 2014 buijsman et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 while forcing regional models with phase locked internal tides e g from hret zaron 2019 gong et al 2021 may be sufficient for domains close to internal tide generation sites it may be insufficient for model domains located thousands of km from generation sites at the uswc phase locked internal tides extracted from a one year simulation contribute only 34 of the total semidiurnal baroclinic flux into the domain hence such forcing would underestimate the internal tide energy in the domain in addition niws may be an important fraction of high frequency baroclinic forcing of regional simulations for instance niws contribute more than half of the high frequency baroclinic fluxes at our domain s northern and southern boundaries fig 5 hence depending on the region of interest it may be important to include non phase locked internal tides and niws when considering high frequency baroclinic forcing of regional simulations to conclude our discussion we note that the performance of the remote internal waves in the regional simulation also depends on which global model simulation is used for the remote forcing for instance buijsman et al 2020 obtained a 34 increase in mode 1 m 2 internal tide energy for their 4 km horizontal resolution global hycom simulation h25 compared to the 8 km expt 06 1 simulation we use in this study they also observed better agreement to observations for the h25 simulation they attributed the increase in internal tide energy in h25 to increased topographic conversion and reduced wave drag strength hence it is possible that the model data comparison statistics reported in this study would improve if we were to force our model with the high frequency fields from h25 however we do not have a 1 year simulation of h25 at our disposal 5 summary and conclusions in this study in addition to astronomical tidal forcing we force realistic regional roms simulations of the u s west coast with subtidal fields from a basin scale roms simulation and with surface tides and remote internal waves from a global ocean hycom simulation with realistic tidal and atmospheric forcing the global model includes remotely generated internal tides and near inertial waves that propagate over long distances we test specified and flather open boundary conditions obcs for the barotropic mode and specified and modified orlanski obcs for the baroclinic mode to control the reflections of internal waves from the interior of the domain we add sponge layers of varying width and viscosities at the open boundaries we quantify internal tide reflections at the open boundaries using a discrete fourier transform dft technique in combination with an internal wave energy budget for the sponge layer lastly we compare simulations with minimum internal tide reflections against observations simulated barotropic tide amplitudes and phases are closer to those of tpxo9 atlas when flather instead of specified obc is used for barotropic tides we also find that the modified orlanski obc is less efficient in handling dispersive outgoing internal waves as compared to the specified obc furthermore our reflection analysis reveals a decrease in internal tide reflections at the open boundaries with an increase in sponge viscosity and or sponge width we find that the flather specified barotropic baroclinic obc combination with a 58 km wide sponge layer with a maximum viscosity of 800 m 2 s is the most optimal open boundary setup for remote internal wave forcing this setup yields a reflection coefficient λ 17 5 9 9 asides from the obc sensitivity tests we report improvements in model data comparisons with the presence of remote internal wave forcing at the open boundaries with remote high frequency baroclinic forcing the simulated variance in velocity and temperature increases for the tidal near inertial and super tidal frequency bands and approaches the variance in the mooring data moreover the correlations also improve while the 4 km horizontal resolution adopted in this study does a relatively good job in resolving mesoscale near inertial and tidal motions super tidal motions are still poorly resolved hence the lowest simulated variance as a fraction of the observed variance γ is observed in the super tidal frequency band the semidiurnal band variance in the simulation with remote internal wave forcing is closest to observations also about 97 0 36 c m 0 37 c m of altimetry m 2 internal tide sea surface height root mean square amplitude r m s a is captured in the simulation with remote internal wave forcing finally along track correlation with altimetry increases from 0 83 to 0 98 when remote internal wave forcing is included in accordance with nelson et al 2020 and mazloff et al 2020 this study confirms that the model data agreement improves when remote internal wave forcing is included hence it may be important for future regional ocean simulation studies to consider adding realistic high frequency baroclinic forcing at the open boundaries however these studies should also consider implementing the best open boundary conditions to minimize excessive reflections of internal waves from the interior which may incorrectly increase internal wave energy levels credit authorship contribution statement oladeji q siyanbola conceptualization formal analysis visualization writing original draft writing review

fourier transform dft technique we follow similar steps to those outlined in section 2 1 of gong et al 2021 in this appendix we demonstrate how effective the dft technique is when applied to an analytical standing wave comprising leftward and rightward propagating mode 1 sinusoidal waves we use the dft technique to separate the leftward and rightward components of our standing wave the length of our time series is 60 m 2 tidal cycles for this analysis the brünt v a isäl a frequency n the coriolis frequency f and the water depth h are similar to those used on page 76 of gerkema and zimmerman 2008 our mode 1 waves are generated using equation 5 23 of gerkema and zimmerman 2008 time snapshots of the results are shown in fig a 14 the difference between the separated fields obtained using the dft technique and the original wave signals are very small we also demonstrate that the dft separation technique is accurate when applied to a complex wave field the ingoing and outgoing flux vectors at the open boundaries of our regional domain obtained with the dft code for the global hycom simulation are shown in fig a 15 the internal tide beams in fig 5a are well represented by the dft technique e g beams at 36 n at the western boundary and 42 n at the northern boundary the boundaries that act as sources of internal tide energy west and north feature ingoing fluxes that are larger than the outgoing fluxes in contrast outgoing fluxes are larger than the ingoing fluxes at the southern boundary as a check we compare the net fluxes using the dft technique ingoing outgoing cross terms with the undecomposed fluxes and find them to be equal table a 8 because our decomposition technique is based on the dft amplitude and phase errors will be present at the tails when the original signal is not periodic in space this is expected to happen when applying the dft technique to realistic simulations we illustrate this phenomenon by considering the superposition of two non periodic signals propagating in opposite directions fig a 16 although there is a good agreement between the dft and the original standing wave signals the leftward and rightward constituents from the dft technique are not in good agreement with those of the original signals at the tail ends this is reflected in the decreasing r 2 values near the tail ends fig a 16 we obtain spurious fluxes at the tail ends of our chosen transects when we apply the dft code however the sponge interior edges along which we obtain our estimates for f i n and f o u t are farther away from the tail ends where amplitude and phase errors are likely to be significant lastly the lengths of the transects that are perpendicular to the boundary should be chosen such that they are not smaller than the wavelength of a mode 1 internal wave in the region of consideration
