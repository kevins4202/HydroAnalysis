8375,study region part of the lake tana sub basin of the blue nile ethiopia study focus this study is aimed to identify and locate the groundwater potential zones of megech watershed using geographic information system gis and remote sensing lithology lineament density slope geomorphology soil land use and land cover rainfall drainage density and elevation were used as proxy data to map the groundwater potential zones of the watershed weights were assigned for each thematic layer and thematic layer classes using the priest analytical hierarchy process ahp tool suitably arcgis overlay analysis was conducted to obtain the groundwater potential map geology lineament density slope and geomorphology were found to be the dominant and sensitive factors for groundwater zoning as portrayed in the map removal analysis new hydrological insights for the region three groundwater potential zones were identified in the study area namely low moderate and high these groundwater potential zones were compared with an independent set of groundwater inventory data to validate the results the validation analysis showed 78 5 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the qualitative results use of proxy data can serve as a credible source of information for groundwater potential zoning and could greatly help in the groundwater development and management of a region keywords ahp gis and remote sensing groundwater potential overlay analysis proxy data 1 introduction water is the primary source of all life and it should be available sufficiently for all the required demands like domestic agriculture industrial recreational and ecological demands groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources supporting human health and economic development because of its continuous availability and excellent natural quality groundwater gw becomes an important source of water supply in many urban and rural areas of the world todd and mays 2005 in ethiopia most towns and villages get their domestic water supply from groundwater sources through developed springs bore wells and shallow wells according to the international atomic energy agency iaea 2013 over 70 of ethiopia s water supply comes from groundwater and only 34 of the population has access to an improved water supply this indicates that there is a large demand for groundwater development and utilization in the country however there is lack of in depth understanding of the groundwater potential of ethiopia there is high disparity between the estimates of groundwater reserve in ethiopia earlier reports show that the annual replenishable groundwater reserve of ethiopia was around 2 6 bm3 mowr 2002 in the very recent past however this figure was deemed to be underestimated studies show that the groundwater storage in areas like adda becho central ethiopia kabo granna vallay and raya northern ethiopia alone is significantly more than the earlier estimation of 2 6bm3 mowr and gw mate 2011 best estimates of the usable groundwater potential of the country falls between 12 and 30bm3 agwater 2012 belete et al 2014 yet other studies show a different figure of groundwater potential in ethiopia 40bm3 haile et al 2019 moreover there were very limited attempts of studies on groundwater potentials of smaller catchments therefore there is a pressing need for the study and development of groundwater resources of the nation so that many especially the rural population have access to an improved water supply on the other hand there are also very limited studies on the use of groundwater for irrigation purpose in ethiopia this may be attributed to lack of understanding of the available groundwater resource and need of large initial investment for groundwater development for irrigation in the country groundwater potential investigation may therefore be an indispensable approach to ensure the sustainable use of groundwater in the nation for various demands including domestic agricultural and industrial purposes however extensive use of groundwater based on only limited information may cause unsustainable use of the resource in ethiopian condition subsurface studies are often carried out when there arises a need for local specific developments of groundwater exists including borehole spring shallow or hand dug wells for domestic water supply hussein et al 2017 reported that the issue of unsustainable groundwater utilization is becoming an evident problem and the key concern for many developing countries one of these problems is the absence of updated spatial information on the quantity and distribution of groundwater resource nowadays there is a strong need to use groundwater for the socio economic development in ethiopia especially for rural areas this indeed requires the knowledge of groundwater resource potential assessment before using and managing it tesfaye 2015 there are several methods available for investigation of groundwater exploration or its availability in sub surface environment they range from the oldest traditional water dowsing methods to the recent electromagnetic resonance emr technologies in general all the methods can be categorized into two broad classes surface and sub surface the surface methods of groundwater exploration or potential assessment are the least costly and easy to undertake these methods include esoteric geomorphologic geological soil and micro biological remote sensing techniques and surface geophysical methods the sub surface methods mainly consist of test drilling of boreholes and geophysical logging techniques although the sub surface methods are accurate for groundwater exploration they incur large investment since drilling completing and development of wells may be needed for the effective application of these methods therefore it is a usual practice to undertake thorough surface investigation methods for locating potential groundwater sources remote sensing technique integrated with gis is becoming a powerful tool for the identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones in time and cost effective manner moore et al 1991 krishnamurty et al 2000 jha et al 2012 arkoprovo et al 2012 hammuori et al 2012 lee et al 2012 davoodi et al 2015 das and pardeshi 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 gis and remote sensing approaches often use spatial data to analyze and characterize required information in fact for studying sub surface phenomena or object the geographic information system utilizes some proxy data from the ground surface geology or lithology geomorphology or landforms drainage density rainfall geological structures or lineaments slope land use land cover lulc and soil characteristics are often the groundwater controlling parameters used to identify groundwater potential zones in a given area of interest these data were used as proxy data for groundwater potential mapping in this study use of such data for assessing groundwater potential for ethiopian conditions is immensely useful where there are very limited direct observations of groundwater particularly for smaller catchments the megech watershed is not exceptional to this limitation and there were no earlier studies on the groundwater potential study in the watershed therefore the aim of this study was to employ gis and rs techniques to identify and map the groundwater potential zones using the groundwater proxy data in the megech watershed the study also attempted to verify the validity of the qualitative analysis obtained from the gis and remote sensing techniques the identified and organized groundwater potential maps may provide information about productive well location in the study area the results of the analysis may also be used as geo database which may enable decision makers and responsible stakeholders to properly use and manage groundwater resources in the study area 1 1 description of the study area megech watershed is located in the north west part of ethiopia amhara national regional state running between 12 16 55 n to 12 45 40 n latitude and 37 18 7 e to 37 37 26 e longitude with an approximate altitude ranging between 1755 m and 2983 m average mean sea level a m s l the watershed covers a total surface area of 689 3km2 according to the meteorological data from 1995 to 2016 the annual rainfall of the study area ranges between 980 mm and 1140 mm the monthly maximum temperature is ranging between 18 4 c and 29 2 c while the monthly minimum temperature is falling between 8 3 c and 13 1 c the area generally falls in between dega cool and humid and woinedega cool sub humid agro climatic regions the land use of the area is dominantly agricultural followed by woody and shrub lands the megech watershed has large irrigation potential and currently there is a construction of large irrigation scheme underway on the megech river the project is also aimed to supply water for the nearby towns and villages from a storage dam upon completion the dam may enable to develop 17 000 ha of land around lake tana besides securing water supply for the gondar town the zonal capital the megech river originates from the semen mountains and then flows to southern direction and terminates into lake tana the source of blue nile river it is one of the main streams flowing into lake tana from the northern part of ethiopia the northern part of megech watershed is characterized by a mountainous wedge shaped steep slopes whereas the lower part around lake tana is characterized by flat low lying land with poor drainage conditions wwdse and tahal group 2008 according to the ethiopian geological survey of ethiopia gse 2011 the area is possesed by upper lava flows basalts trachiytes and lacustrine sedments the population in the watershed is mainly dependent on the subsistence agriculture for the livilehood income and potable water supplies mainly come from groundwater sources fig 1 shows the location map of megech watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of input database input data for groundwater potential mapping of the study area was determined through field survey analysis of available information literature and combined professional expert judgment sar et al 2015 based on the available information literature nine groundwater controlling factors were identified as proxy data these were rainfall elevation slope drainage density geomorphology geology lithology lineament density land use cover and soil type these data are necessary for the analysis and groundwater inventory data for comparison purpose were also collected from different and reliable sources the type of data sources and the functions the data are presented in table 1 the long term average point rainfall values were used to generate areal rainfall map theissen polygon approach was used to interpolate the areal rainfall map seven stations data were employed table 2 for the preparation of areal rainfall of the study area the data for elevation was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem 30 m x 30 m resolution data for its better accuracy both in its vertical and horizontal resolution odutola et al 2012 then the elevation map of the megech watershed was mapped using arc gis further the elevation data was used to generate the slope raster data in each grid cell in the elevation raster slope was measured by the identification of maximum rate of change in value from each cell to neighboring cells waikar and nilawar 2014 the slope classes in the watershed were identified using slope spatial analyst tool in the gis package on the other hand the data related to drainage density were generated indirectly from the watershed slope data drainage density is defined as the closeness of spacing of stream channels sar et al 2015 according to rahmati et al 2014 drainage density dd is the measure of the total length of the stream segment of all orders per unit area which may be given as 1 d d i 1 n d i a where σdi is the total length of all streams in stream order i km and a is the area of the watershed km2 the drainage line delineation process was undertaken considering the stream lengths of 1000 units value 1000 and then the drainage density was computed using eq 1 the geomorphological map of the study area was prepared following the hammond landform classification technique as suggested by skye 2016 the geology or lithology thematic map of the study area was prepared by merging the two recent 2011 and 2013 years geologic maps of north gondar and yifag published by the geological survey of ethiopia gse 2013 the thematic layer for lineament density ld can be defined as the total length of all recorded lineaments divided by the area of the catchment under consideration which is given as edet et al 1998 2 l d i 1 n l i a where li is the length of the ith lineament and σli is the total length of all lineaments in kilometer and a is the area of the grid in square kilometers lineaments can be extracted from satellite images either by automatic or manual extraction methods in this study automatic lineament extraction method was used due to its effectiveness and user friendliness compared to the manual extraction weerasekera et al 2014 the lineaments of the study area were extracted from the landsat 8 oli tirs image path 170 row 51 with zero cloud cover using automated processing line tool in pci geomatica 2017 the use of line tool in pci geomatica was witnessed by umikaltuma and felix 2012 out of the 11 bands of the landsat 8 oli tirs images the lineaments were extracted from band 5 due to its quality and the highest number of lineaments delineated after the lineaments were extracted further processes of editing the watershed divide line and road features were done in gis to ensure the quality of the extracted lineaments the recent 2014 land use land cover lulc map of the study area reproduced from the lulc map of tana sub basin earlier prepared by amhara design and supervision works enterprise was used the soil map of megech watershed was modified from the fao 2003 soil map of ethiopia which was collected from mowie table 3 3 the analytical hierarchy process ahp the occurrence of groundwater in an area is influenced by several factors including the hydrological geological topographical environmental and climatic variables in such a case it is tempting to decide which factor or parameter is influencing more or less among the several available methods yeh et al 2016 hussein et al 2017 singh et al 2017 das and pardeshi 2018 razavi termeh et al 2019 the analytical hierarchy process ahp helps a lot to systematically identify the most influencing parameters the analytical hierarchy process ahp was used in this study ahp is mainly suitable for complex decisions which consist of the comparison of decision elements which are difficult to quantify it involves building a hierarchy of decision elements and then making comparisons between each possible pair in each cluster as a matrix the ahp approach relays on the hierarchal structuring of the decision criteria which is incorporated in decision making problem the hierarchy includes the knowledge experience and intuition of the decision maker anagnostopoulos et al 2007 ahp uses the pairwise comparison matrix eq 3 to evaluate the hierarchy for instance to compare two alternatives ai and aj using a criterion based on the fundamental scale of values ranging from 1 to 9 the definition of the ranks according to satty 1995 are given in table 4 the pair wise matrix is given by saaty 1995 3 a k a1 a2 an a1 1 a12 a1n a2 1 a12 1 a2n an 1 a1n 1 a2n 1 where a is a pair wise comparison matrix of alternatives ai i 1 2 3 n with respect to criteria k ahp incorporates an effective technique for checking the consistency of the evaluations made by the decision maker when building each of the pairwise comparison matrix a eq 3 involved in the process computation of a suitable consistency index ci is then obtained by first computing the scalar x as the average of the elements of the vector whose j th element is the ratio of the j th element of the vector a multiplied by weight vector to the corresponding element of the vector w the consistency index may be expressed as satty 1995 4 ci x m m 1 where m is the number of evaluation criteria thematic layers in the case of this study a perfectly consistent decision maker should always obtain ci 0 but small values of inconsistency may be tolerated if the consistency ratio cr 0 1 saaty 1990 and malczewski 1999 the consistency ratio may be defined as 5 cr ci ri where ri is the random index whose values for m number of evaluation criteria are given in table 5 according to saaty 1990 later on saaty 1995 suggested different cr value for different consistent pair wise comparison matrix size recommended cr value for a 3 3 matrix is less than 0 05 a 4 4 matrix is 0 09 and for larger matrices it is is 0 1 saaty 1995 4 priority estimation tool priest priority estimation tool priest was used to identify dominant groundwater occurrence and distribution factors in this study unlike other decision support tools based on ahp priest has the ability to visualize the inconsistency among a given set of pairwise comparison matrix siraj et al 2015 priest also provides the consistency measures for example dissonance congruence etc which are recommended for pairwise comparison based on decision support tools siraj et al 2015 priest enables to select the different elicitation methods in this study eigen vector ev method was used to derive a priority vector from a set of pairwise judgments saaty 1977 there are two types of consistency measures in pair wise comparison matrix to arrive at a judgment these are the ordinal and the cardinal consistency measures the judgments given by the decision maker in the pair wise comparison matrix a is said to be ordinally consistent if a1 is preferred to a2 and a2 is preferred to a3 then a1 is preferred to a3 where a1 a2 and a3 are elements of the decision criteria in comparison matrix for example lithology lineament density and slope were some of the elements considered in this study on the other hand the judgments are said to be cardinally consistent if aij 1 aji and ai j aikakj for all i j and k siraj et al 2015 siraj 2011 proposed different measures to determine the ordinal as well as the cardinal consistency and to detect outlying judgments these measures are dissonance ψ congruence θ and logarithmic mean square l dissonance ψ is proposed for ordinal consistency measure while congruence θ is the cardinal consistency measure in pairwise comparison matrix when the value of ψ is zero it reveals no latent violation of priorities in the pairwise comparison matrix pcm whereas when ψ is a non zero value there is latent violation l indicates whether the pcm is transitive or not when l is equal to zero pcm is transitive and when l is not equal to zero pcm is intransitive the dissonance and congruence inconsistency measures are given by siraj et al 2015 5 θ i j 1 n 2 k 1 n log a i j log

potential index gwpi gwpi can be defined as a dimensionless quantity that helps to predict the groundwater potential zones in an area a weighted linear combination method was used to estimate the gwpi malczewski 1999 shekhar and pandey 2014 which may be expressed as 7 gwpi j 1 m i 1 n wj xi where wj is the normalized weight of the j thematic layer xi is the rank rate value of each class with respect to the j layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of classes in each thematic layer 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis reveals how much each thematic map and the weights assigned for them influence the output map the sensitivity analysis was essentially conducted using the map removal analysis according to lodwick et al 1990 the map removal sensitivity analysis shows that which thematic map s is are the most or the least influential on determining the groundwater potential zone sensitivity analysis uses the index number s to measure the influence of each thematic layer the sensitivity index s was computed using 8 s gwpi n gwpi n gwpi where gwpi and gwpi are the output of groundwater potential map index of all the thematic layers and when one of the thematic layers is removed respectively n is the number of the full thematic layers used to compute gwpi and n is the number of thematic layers used to compute gwpi 4 3 validation process the identified groundwater potential zones using the gis and rs techniques were compared with the existing ground data from boreholes springs and hand dug wells in the study watershed to validate the credibility of the qualitative result this would build more confidence on the use of qualitative results such as the one obtained from gis and rs analysis the general framework for data processing and analysis is shown in fig 2 4 4 results and discussions in the following sections the results of the analysis are presented for each of the factors controlling groundwater recharge and thereby the groundwater potential 4 5 rainfall rainfall plays an important role in the hydrologic cycle and controls groundwater potential knowing the nature and characteristics of rainfall may enable one to conceptualize and predict its effects on runoff infiltration and groundwater recharge ramu et al 2010 the possibility of groundwater recharge would be high at the place where the rainfall is high and is low where rainfall is low zomlot et al 2015 kotchoni et al 2019 shakya et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it can also be noted that the groundwater recharge phenomena is the result of the long term effect than incidental highs or lows particularly for humid environments therefore it is more plausible to consider long term influence of rainfall than the short term precipitation values to determine the influence of rainfall on groundwater recharge fig 3 shows the areal average rainfall of the watershed the mean annual rainfall of the watershed ranges from 979 8 to 1140 2 mm the highest rainfall 1140 2 mm was recorded at shembekit station while the lowest 1102 6 mm was recorded at gondar stations which are covering 46 0 and 40 3 of the study area respectively this may be attributed to the orographic effect arising from altitude difference mezga et al 2014 it is evident that more rainfall may cause more recharge potential although that potential is challenged by other constraining factors such as slope geology land use cover drainage density lineament density and others therefore high recharge area does not necessarily imply high groundwater potential areas kotchoni et al 2019 4 6 elevation elevation or altitude can have an indirect and inverse effect on the groundwater potential of a given area it relates mainly to the rainfall occurrence and thereby the recharge therefore high altitudes favor more recharge and ensure the availability groundwater in lowland areas in a watershed mountainous areas are often favorable for recharge in deep seated confined aquifers situated at low land areas duffy and al hassan 1988 todd and mays 2005 in some instances highland areas can also serve for storage of some recharge and then contribute to the groundwater potential of an area depicted mainly through the presence of springs water tends to store at lower topography than at the higher topography ramu et al 2010 therefore higher the elevation lesser the groundwater potential and vice versa hence elevation or altitude data is needed to be considered in the groundwater potential studies elevation altitude ranges were arbitrarily created for qualitative assignment of values as shown in fig 4 evidently the watershed has higher elevation 2543 2978 m at the northern part and lower elevation 1784 2004 m at the southern part of the study area bordering lake tana fig 4 provides the topographic map of the megech watershed which is included in the weighted overlay analysis in this study 4 7 slope the land surface slope is another factor which influences the hydrology of a given watershed it mainly affects the surface runoff process and hence partially determines the groundwater recharge of a watershed the lower slope values indicate the flatter terrain gentle slope and the higher slope values indicate steep and undulating terrain the lower slope areas of the flat terrain allow rainfall infiltration and percolation while the higher slope areas generate quick runoff from the terrain and hence offer little volume of water for groundwater recharge within a watershed the effect of topographic gradient has significant influence on the groundwater flux than the groundwater depth and hence the hydraulic gradient grinevskii 2014 condon and maxwell 2015 this may be attributed to scale issue where the effect of groundwater hydraulic gradient may be negligible but the effect of topographic gradient cannot be disregarded however slope exposure is more influencing factor than the slope gradient for groundwater recharge and thereby for the groundwater potential grinevskii 2014 rukundo and dogan 2019 as can be depicted from fig 5 there are four classes of slopes identified in megech watershed using slope spatial analyst tool in the gis package there is indeed no hard and fast rule for slope classification for groundwater recharge or runoff generation however slope classes were identified based on their level of importance to groundwater recharge in gis yeh et al 2016 andualem and demeke 2019 four classes of slope were extracted ranging from plain gentle slope areas to extremely steep slopes the gentle slopes 0 7 is observed in the southern part of the watershed near lake tana covering an area of nearly 47 showing significant area of the watershed available for groundwater recharge with respect to slope on the other hand areas having extremely steep slopes 28 77 are located at the north and northeastern part of the watershed the steepest slope portion covers a small area of around 8 the other two classifications of the slopes 7 16 medium and 16 28 steep respectively cover approximately 31 and 14 of the total watershed area fig 5 4 8 drainage density drainage density is the total length of streams per unit area it is one of the factors which play an important role in potential groundwater zoning high drainage density favors high runoff through the dissected channels and thus provides less opportunity to infiltration into the ground and percolation thereafter on the other hand low drainage density areas have less surface runoff and consequently favor more infiltration jenifer and jha 2017 thomas and duraisamy 2017 although large drainage density depicts less groundwater recharge it may come to happen that the stream beds and banks may contribute to substantial amount of groundwater recharge which needs further assessment das and pardeshi 2018 yeh et al 2009 furthermore in perennial and seasonal streams the water contact time with the bed and banks is long that it provides good opportunity for percolation therefore areas nearby drainage channels water courses may have good groundwater potential todd and mays 2005 drainage density enables to visualize high groundwater recharge areas the drainage density map of megech watershed fig 6 is produced by employing the line density tool in arcgis das and pardeshi 2018 the drainage density of the study area is ranging from 0 083 to 4 024 km km2 the drainage densities of the megech watershed were classified into four classes as very low 0 083 0 995 km km2 moderately low 0 995 1 536 km km2 high 1 536 2 216 km km2 and very high 2 216 4 024 km km2 as shown in fig 6 the lowest drainage density areas are mainly located on the northwestern boundaries of the watershed fig 6 on the other hand the highest drainage density areas are scattered in the central and southern portions of the watershed this may be due to the presence of closely spaced stream networks or drainage lines in these areas 4 9 geomorphology geomorphology is the study of earth structures and also depicts the various landforms related to the groundwater occurrence and structural features ramu and vinay 2010 geomorphology controls the subsurface movement of groundwater it is one of the most important features in evaluating the groundwater potential and prospect therefore geomorphology can be utilized for management of groundwater resources kumar and kumar 2011 valliammai et al 2013 the hammond landform classification technique revised by skye 2016 was used to prepare the geomorphological map there are seven major land forms sub classes identified which include flat or nearly flat plains smooth plains with some local relief plains with high hills low hills high hills low maintains and high mountains fig 7 the flat or nearly flat plains are found mostly in the southern portions of the study area on the other hand the highly mountainous areas are observed at the northern end of the study area fig 7 accordingly flat or nearly flat plains comprise of 29 smooth plains with some relief equal to 28 plains with high hills comprising 14 low hills equal to 13 high hills equal to 8 low mountains equal to 5 and high mountains equal to 3 of the total watershed high and low hills linear ridge landforms are considered as very low groundwater potential zones while flat and smooth plains with local relief are high groundwater potential prospect zones valley plains and flat lands provide good opportunity for groundwater recharge and show good groundwater potential zones ramaiah et al 2012 rajaveni et al 2017 4 10 geology geology influences both the porosity and permeability of the aquifer material yazi et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2010 geology or lithology is one of the groundwater controlling parameters considered in ground water studies which play a significant role in the distribution and occurrence of groundwater there are four major lithology types identified in the study area namely tertiary plateau basalts and pyroclasts tertiary upper basalts and trachyte quaternary lacustrine sediments and tertiary upper lava flows fig 8 tertiary plateau basalts and pyroclasts are the tertiary period lithological formations characterized by dark grey mostly coarse grained and sometimes fine to medium grained rock at some places the tertiary plateau basalts are occurring as massive hard dense and slightly weathered rocks it consists of plagioclase phyric olivine phyric and aphanitic basalts its thickness can reach up to 800 m gse 2013 the geological survey of ethiopia gse 2013 found out that the tertiary plateau basalts and pyroclasts are extensive and moderately to low productive fissured aquifers categorized under the hydraulic properties permeability k 100 km² transmissivity t 1 100 m² d unit flow rate and q 0 01 1 l s m and discharge q 0 5 5 l s tertiary upper basalts and trachytes are the tertiary period lithological formations which behave like aphanitic dark grey fine grained formation materials and characterized by jointing fracturing and spheroidal weathering these are rarely columnar and mainly massive in structure dense 300 m thick and exhibit compact flows according to gse 2013 tertiary upper basalts and trachyte are extensive and highly productive fissured aquifer systems with the hydraulic properties whose permeability can go above 100 km² transmissivity varying from 100 to 500 m² d and well yields vary from 5 to 25 l s quaternary lacustrine sediments are the young lithological formations which have a property of thick brownish clayey soil and light grey soil material assumed to have developed from lake sediments quaternary lacustrine sediments have the highest water bearing capacity among the lithological units of the study area this may be witnessed by the borehole yield data falling in the range of 20 l s to 35 l s from groundwater inventory data these lithological units are categorized under the extensive and highly productive porous aquifer systems which have the permeability values over 100km2 transmissivity values ranging between 100 500 m2 d and well yields can go up to 25 l s and not less than 5 l sec gse 2013 these are mainly covering the lowland areas of dembia area in the neighborhood of lake tana fig 8 the tertiary upper lava flows are the miocene age lithological formations structurally characterized by massive less columnar horizontal and deeply weathered faults gse 2011 these comprise of mainly basalts and lesser scoriaceous basalts and scoria falls in view of groundwater bearing capacity these are preferably more important than the basaltic formations consisting of pyroclasts and trachyte this is because the tertiary upper lava flows include scoriaceous basalts in which groundwater can occur seifu 2013 these geologic units are covering the highland areas of lay armachew and stretching to the plateau of dembia the tertiary upper lava flows have the highest areal coverage 45 7 among the lithological units of the study area fig 8 4 11 lineament density a lineament may represent a fault fracture and master joint a long and linear geological formation topographic linearity valleys or straight course of streams boundaries between the different lithological units vegetation cover or artificial objects such as road bridge etc pradhan 2009 adiri et al 2017 in the megech watershed there are few road networks these road networks were extracted and excluded during the map overlay process and hence only actual lineaments were considered pradhan 2009 also stated that the presence of lineaments usually signify a permeable zone therefore lineament density of an area can ultimately explain the groundwater potential in the area fig 9 shows the lineament density of megech watershed divided into four classes namely 1st class 0 0 5 km km2 2nd class 0 5 1 1 km km2 3rd class 1 1 1 9 km km2 and 4th class 1 9 3 9 km km2 fig 9 it is evident that areas having higher lineament density have higher groundwater potential and vice versa das et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 as can be depicted in the lineament map of the study watershed areas having highest groundwater prospect zones have lineament density ranging between 1 9 3 9 km km2 andualem and demeke 2019 covering an area of 45 of the total land scape the other classes of lineament density 1 1 1 19 km km2 0 5 1 1 km km2 and 0 0 5 km km2 respectively cover nearly 26 17 and 12 of the overall watershed 4 12 land use cover the surface covered by vegetation like forests and agriculture traps and holds the water in root of plants whereas the built up and rocky land use affects the recharge of groundwater by increasing runoff during rainfall shaban et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to study which features have covered the study area in order to carry out the groundwater potential studies fig 10 shows the lulc of the megech watershed overall 7 main classes of lulc units were identified which are further detailed to 17 sub classes the study area mainly comprises of cultivated land grassland woody shrub land forest areas water bodies and wetlands residential areas and few afro alpine vegetation cover the dominant lulc units are the cultivated lands covering an area of about 73 28 of the total megech watershed followed by settlement and residential areas 9 76 this may be attributed to the intensive agricultural practice in the area for satisfying the growing food demand in the watershed built up and rocky surfaces have less probability of groundwater potential occurrence whereas the surfaces covered by vegetation like agricultural plants and forests have higher chance of groundwater water probability singh et al 2010 fenta et al 2015 li et al 2018 the priorities for lulc units were given following fenta et al 2015 where water body forest shrub land cultivated land grassland bare land for groundwater occurrence suitability land use and cover conditions affect the hydrologic cycle in many ways primarily by altering the surface runoff behavior and thereby the groundwater recharge in fact the lulc also affects the other hydrologic processes such as evapotranspiration transpiration infiltration evaporation and interception due to population increase and other anthropogenic influences in many watersheds there is change of land use and cover from one form to the other scanlon et al 2005 kenji et al 2009 pan et al 2011 owuor et al 2016 riley et al 2019 some land uses favor groundwater recharge and potential while others are bringing negative consequence to groundwater recharge for example settlement and urban areas mainly generate the runoff process and hence have reduced recharge pan et al 2011 owuor et al 2016 agricultural areas may or may not positively contribute to the groundwater depending on the management procedures taken for soil and water conservation extensive review on the effect of land use and land cover change on groundwater recharge and then the groundwater availability was conducted by owuor et al 2016 forests were observed to lower groundwater recharge rates compared to others while the conversion of the other lulc to cropland or grassland increases groundwater recharge owuor et al 2016 however this may not be taken as a universal truth and site specific conditions may prevail in the groundwater recharge process yeh et al 2009 singh et al 2010 pan et al 2011 li et al 2018 on the other hand forests and grasslands are reducing the runoff process and thereby provide better opportunity for groundwater recharge wetlands and water bodies are the foremost contributors for groundwater augmentation in particular cases of irrigated areas there may be an incidental recharge from the irrigation areas and this may contribute to aquifer replenishment pan et al 2011 the effects of the other land uses and cover conditions can be separately seen since lulc not only controls the groundwater recharge alone but the other hydrological processes too 4 13 soil soil is an important factor for delineating the groundwater potential zones the water holding capacity of an area depends upon the soil types and their permeability kumar et al 2016 the dominant soil types of the study area were eutric cambisols chromic vertisol and eutric regosols which covered 46 14 18 40 and 15 90 of the total area of megech watershed respectively the remaining soil types contribute very limited portions fig 11 illustrates the soil types of the watershed the permeability of the soil types depends up on their texture therefore the identified soil types of the study area were slightly modified from fao 2003 for this study to relate it with the usda soil textural class soil affects the process of groundwater recharge besides its effect on the other hydrologic processes soil mainly affects the infiltration and percolation processes which ultimately influence the groundwater recharge and then the groundwater potential of a given area anuraga et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 rukundo and dogan 2019 alluvial soils favor recharge and hence more potential for groundwater availability on the other hand compacted soil environments and fine textured soils have very low permeability and hence favor surface runoff than sub surface flow rukundo and dogan 2019 soil type may be more important than the land use for groundwater recharge particularly course textured soils anuraga et al 2006 however specific studies on individual soil texture and comparative land use cover conditions were not studied in detail 4 14 weighted thematic maps and their classes weighting the thematic maps was carried out using priest software package by employing the pairwise comparison pc method priest was developed to support the analytical hierarchy process in decision making and provides the opportunity to identify and revise inconsistent judgments based on consistency measures siraj et al 2015 the result of the analysis is shown in table 6 the dominant factors governing the groundwater potential in the watershed were determined using the weight vector three consistency measures dissonance logarithmic mean square and congruence were used to describe the consistency of the judgments as can be observed from priest result for the judgments cr value of less than 0 1 shows that the judgments are highly acceptable in addition to this the judgments do not involve the intransitive judgments since the value of logarithmic residual mean square l is equal to 0 and there are no latent priority during the pair wise comparison as the value of dissonance ψ is equal to 0 the priority vector computed in priest using eigen vector ev method table 6 showed the weighted value of nearly 30 for the lithology 23 for lineament density 15 for slope 10 for geomorphology 7 for soil 6 for lulc 4 for rainfall 3 for drainage density and finally 2 for elevation according to the calculated priority vector lithology is the most dominant groundwater governing parameter in the study area this is due to its capability in controlling groundwater potential as it can be inferred from the studies by gse 2011 2013 and the borehole yields in the study area on the other hand the elevation was prioritized ranked the last since it has the least influence among the parameters controlling groundwater potentiality considered in the study in the same fashion each thematic map classes were weighted and reclassified based on the weighted values of their classes after the weightages were determined for each thematic layer gis overlay analysis was carried out 4 15 gis overlay analysis all the thematic maps or layers were prepared in the reclassified raster format and were given the normalized weight in accordance with the groundwater potential controlling capability similarly each thematic layer s classes were given the normalized rank or weight then overlay analysis was carried out using the weight vectors from priest as described in the earlier section the gwpi was calculated using 9 gwpi 0 3 lithr 0 23 ldr 0 15 slopr 0 10 geomr 0 07 soilr 0 06 lulcr 0 04 rnflr 0 03 ddr 0 02 elvnr where lithr reclassified lithological map ldr reclassified lineament density map slopr reclassified slope map geomr reclassified geomorphological map soilr reclassified soil map lulcr reclassified land use cover map rnflr reclassified rainfall map ddr reclassified drainage density map elvnr reclassified elevation map and the numbers preceding the abbreviations are weights in gwpi is a dimensionless quantity computed considering the weights computed for each layer and sub classes in each thematic layer after the overlay process has been completed the groundwater potential zone map was classified as high gwpi 23 5 32 2 moderate gwpi 17 2 23 5 and low gwpi 9 7 17 2 the output map fig 12 indicates the high groundwater potential zone situated mostly near the lake tana dembia plain this is mainly attributed to the availability of the high water bearing quaternary lacustrine sediment aquifer in plain terrain few other patches of high groundwater potential zone areas are located where there are high to very high 1 1 3 9 km km2 lineament density with gentle slope 0 7 fig 12 the high groundwater potential zone covers an area of nearly 124 km2 18 of the total area of the megech watershed the groundwater potential zone designated as moderate is mostly found in the northwest part of megech watershed which covers part of the dembia plateau gondar town and lay armachew areas the moderate groundwater potential zone is distributed along the areas where there is tertiary upper lava flows the second higher water bearing geological unit and the moderately slopping areas 7 16 flat or nearly flat plains plains with high hills and the eutric regosols soil type a few portion of the moderate groundwater potential zone is also scattered along the northeast direction where the lineament density is very high 1 9 3 9 km km2 the moderate groundwater potential zone covers relatively higher area 320 1 km2or 46 of the megech watershed low groundwater potential areas are found along the northeast portion of the study area which covers lay armachew wogera and gondar zuria districts this may be due to the fact that the area exhibits high distribution of mountainous geomorphology and relatively less water bearing lithological formations upper basalts and trachytes and plateau basalts and pyroclasts on the other hand this groundwater potential zone is sparsely distributed along the northwest part of megech watershed which includes lay armachew gondar town and dembia the low groundwater potential zone covers nearly 245 km2 or 36 of the study area in general moderate to high groundwater potential zones are located in the north western and southern portions of the study area while the northeastern portions of the watershed possess low groundwater potential possible groundwater development works for water supply can take place in these areas while groundwater for extensive use such as irrigation may be considered in the dembia plain in the south of the watershed 4 16 sensitivity analysis of the groundwater potential zones map sensitivity analysis was conducted by the map removal procedure in this procedure one of the thematic layers was removed at a time and the other thematic layers involved in the processing of the output map the computed sensitivity index s values are indicated in table 7 in this particular study geology lithology was the first influential thematic layer s 2 8 to determine the output map of the groundwater potential zones of megech watershed the lineament density and the slope were observed to be the second and third influential thematic layers which account 1 41 and 1 38 sensitivity index respectively on the other hand the least influential factor for the output map determination was the drainage density thematic map s 0 69 the sensitivity analysis confirmed that the influence of thematic layers to alter the output map is directly related to the weights given to them in this study the map removal sensitivity analysis revealed that the generated output map was highly sensitive to the thematic layers having high weight and vice versa 4 17 validation of qualitative results an effort was paid to collect existing data from different sources for validation purpose a total of 135 existing groundwater inventory data including boreholes springs and hand dug wells were collected for the purpose of comparison or evaluation of the qualitative results of the groundwater potential zones well and spring yield were selected as a better candidate than other existing data however only 79 groundwater well points have the recorded yield data the highest yield among the collected groundwater data was 35 l s with 286 m well depth the least yield was observed from the springs having a yield of 0 01 l s although there is no general classification scheme well yields can be grouped into some classification schemes considering site specific conditions for example the aquifer yields in tana and beles sub basins were divided into four categories by sogreah 2013 as 0 3 l s low 3 6 l s moderate 6 20 l s high and more than 20 l s as very high groundwater potential zones on the other hand gse 2013 classified gondar and west gondar aquifer yields including other aquifer properties as 0 5 1 l s low 1 5 l s moderate to low and 5 25 l s high groundwater potential areas in this study since gondar and west gondar are part of the megech watershed and its aquifer properties the gse 2013 classification scheme was adopted with some modification areas where well spring yield lie between 0 and 1 l s were categorized as low 1 and 5 l s as moderate and more than 5 l s were classified as high potential groundwater regions based on this classification out of the 33 boreholes having yields over 5 l s 20 boreholes 60 6 have higher yield values range between 18 35 l s are falling on the high groundwater potential zone gwpz most of these are found in dembia plain out of the 41 boreholes yield data 38 92 7 of them are falling on the moderate gwpz whereas out of the 5 low yield 0 1 l s boreholes and springs data 80 is falling on the gwpz classified as low fig 12 in general the cross validation analysis revealed that 78 5 table 8 of the groundwater inventory data boreholes hand dug wells and springs agree to the corresponding groundwater potential zone classifications from qualitative analysis besides comparing with groundwater inventory data seifu 2013 also witnessed that there is high groundwater potential near the lake tana plains and low groundwater potential around the northern part of the study area this confirms that there is a very good agreement between the groundwater inventory data and groundwater potential zones delineated using gis and rs techniques plotting the inventory data over the groundwater potential map was also conducted it can be clearly seen that only few groundwater development works are appeared on the northeastern portion of the watershed where the qualitative results revealed low groundwater potential the better yielding wells and springs are located in the southern and northwestern portions of the watershed where moderate to high groundwater potential zones prevail fig 12 5 conclusion in this study an attempt was made to develop a spatial model for demarcating the groundwater potential zones making use of the nine thematic layers as proxy data for groundwater these were geology lithology lineament density slope geomorphology soil lulc rainfall drainage density and elevation the groundwater potential zones were produced by integrating these thematic layers in arcgis overlay analysis the identified gw potential zones are high moderate and low covering 18 46 and 36 of the megech watershed area respectively the three distinct groundwater potential zones were also validated using existing groundwater inventory data and the result portrayed nearly 78 5 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the qualitative groundwater potential analysis it can be concluded that gis and rs together with ahp decision making techniques are found to be time and cost effective approaches in groundwater potential mapping the results from ahp based priest software revealed that a weightage of 30 for geology lithology 23 for lineament density 15 for slope 10 for geomorphology 7 for soil 6 for lulc 4 for rainfall 3 for drainage density and 2 for elevation higher weightage of the contributing proxy parameters refers to high groundwater potential and vice versa it can be observed that the first four factors geology lineament density slope and geomorphology are dominantly contributing to the groundwater potential of the study areas this was also revealed using the map removal analysis procedure this study may provide stakeholders and decision makers important information on the groundwater potential of the megech watershed and the districts woredas in the watershed we recommend that this kind of studies is quite important for groundwater development schemes particularly in ethiopian conditions where observed data on groundwater is not available the developed groundwater potential map can be an aid to develop manage and wisely utilize the

8375,study region part of the lake tana sub basin of the blue nile ethiopia study focus this study is aimed to identify and locate the groundwater potential zones of megech watershed using geographic information system gis and remote sensing lithology lineament density slope geomorphology soil land use and land cover rainfall drainage density and elevation were used as proxy data to map the groundwater potential zones of the watershed weights were assigned for each thematic layer and thematic layer classes using the priest analytical hierarchy process ahp tool suitably arcgis overlay analysis was conducted to obtain the groundwater potential map geology lineament density slope and geomorphology were found to be the dominant and sensitive factors for groundwater zoning as portrayed in the map removal analysis new hydrological insights for the region three groundwater potential zones were identified in the study area namely low moderate and high these groundwater potential zones were compared with an independent set of groundwater inventory data to validate the results the validation analysis showed 78 5 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the qualitative results use of proxy data can serve as a credible source of information for groundwater potential zoning and could greatly help in the groundwater development and management of a region keywords ahp gis and remote sensing groundwater potential overlay analysis proxy data 1 introduction water is the primary source of all life and it should be available sufficiently for all the required demands like domestic agriculture industrial recreational and ecological demands groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources supporting human health and economic development because of its continuous availability and excellent natural quality groundwater gw becomes an important source of water supply in many urban and rural areas of the world todd and mays 2005 in ethiopia most towns and villages get their domestic water supply from groundwater sources through developed springs bore wells and shallow wells according to the international atomic energy agency iaea 2013 over 70 of ethiopia s water supply comes from groundwater and only 34 of the population has access to an improved water supply this indicates that there is a large demand for groundwater development and utilization in the country however there is lack of in depth understanding of the groundwater potential of ethiopia there is high disparity between the estimates of groundwater reserve in ethiopia earlier reports show that the annual replenishable groundwater reserve of ethiopia was around 2 6 bm3 mowr 2002 in the very recent past however this figure was deemed to be underestimated studies show that the groundwater storage in areas like adda becho central ethiopia kabo granna vallay and raya northern ethiopia alone is significantly more than the earlier estimation of 2 6bm3 mowr and gw mate 2011 best estimates of the usable groundwater potential of the country falls between 12 and 30bm3 agwater 2012 belete et al 2014 yet other studies show a different figure of groundwater potential in ethiopia 40bm3 haile et al 2019 moreover there were very limited attempts of studies on groundwater potentials of smaller catchments therefore there is a pressing need for the study and development of groundwater resources of the nation so that many especially the rural population have access to an improved water supply on the other hand there are also very limited studies on the use of groundwater for irrigation purpose in ethiopia this may be attributed to lack of understanding of the available groundwater resource and need of large initial investment for groundwater development for irrigation in the country groundwater potential investigation may therefore be an indispensable approach to ensure the sustainable use of groundwater in the nation for various demands including domestic agricultural and industrial purposes however extensive use of groundwater based on only limited information may cause unsustainable use of the resource in ethiopian condition subsurface studies are often carried out when there arises a need for local specific developments of groundwater exists including borehole spring shallow or hand dug wells for domestic water supply hussein et al 2017 reported that the issue of unsustainable groundwater utilization is becoming an evident problem and the key concern for many developing countries one of these problems is the absence of updated spatial information on the quantity and distribution of groundwater resource nowadays there is a strong need to use groundwater for the socio economic development in ethiopia especially for rural areas this indeed requires the knowledge of groundwater resource potential assessment before using and managing it tesfaye 2015 there are several methods available for investigation of groundwater exploration or its availability in sub surface environment they range from the oldest traditional water dowsing methods to the recent electromagnetic resonance emr technologies in general all the methods can be categorized into two broad classes surface and sub surface the surface methods of groundwater exploration or potential assessment are the least costly and easy to undertake these methods include esoteric geomorphologic geological soil and micro biological remote sensing techniques and surface geophysical methods the sub surface methods mainly consist of test drilling of boreholes and geophysical logging techniques although the sub surface methods are accurate for groundwater exploration they incur large investment since drilling completing and development of wells may be needed for the effective application of these methods therefore it is a usual practice to undertake thorough surface investigation methods for locating potential groundwater sources remote sensing technique integrated with gis is becoming a powerful tool for the identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones in time and cost effective manner moore et al 1991 krishnamurty et al 2000 jha et al 2012 arkoprovo et al 2012 hammuori et al 2012 lee et al 2012 davoodi et al 2015 das and pardeshi 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 gis and remote sensing approaches often use spatial data to analyze and characterize required information in fact for studying sub surface phenomena or object the geographic information system utilizes some proxy data from the ground surface geology or lithology geomorphology or landforms drainage density rainfall geological structures or lineaments slope land use land cover lulc and soil characteristics are often the groundwater controlling parameters used to identify groundwater potential zones in a given area of interest these data were used as proxy data for groundwater potential mapping in this study use of such data for assessing groundwater potential for ethiopian conditions is immensely useful where there are very limited direct observations of groundwater particularly for smaller catchments the megech watershed is not exceptional to this limitation and there were no earlier studies on the groundwater potential study in the watershed therefore the aim of this study was to employ gis and rs techniques to identify and map the groundwater potential zones using the groundwater proxy data in the megech watershed the study also attempted to verify the validity of the qualitative analysis obtained from the gis and remote sensing techniques the identified and organized groundwater potential maps may provide information about productive well location in the study area the results of the analysis may also be used as geo database which may enable decision makers and responsible stakeholders to properly use and manage groundwater resources in the study area 1 1 description of the study area megech watershed is located in the north west part of ethiopia amhara national regional state running between 12 16 55 n to 12 45 40 n latitude and 37 18 7 e to 37 37 26 e longitude with an approximate altitude ranging between 1755 m and 2983 m average mean sea level a m s l the watershed covers a total surface area of 689 3km2 according to the meteorological data from 1995 to 2016 the annual rainfall of the study area ranges between 980 mm and 1140 mm the monthly maximum temperature is ranging between 18 4 c and 29 2 c while the monthly minimum temperature is falling between 8 3 c and 13 1 c the area generally falls in between dega cool and humid and woinedega cool sub humid agro climatic regions the land use of the area is dominantly agricultural followed by woody and shrub lands the megech watershed has large irrigation potential and currently there is a construction of large irrigation scheme underway on the megech river the project is also aimed to supply water for the nearby towns and villages from a storage dam upon completion the dam may enable to develop 17 000 ha of land around lake tana besides securing water supply for the gondar town the zonal capital the megech river originates from the semen mountains and then flows to southern direction and terminates into lake tana the source of blue nile river it is one of the main streams flowing into lake tana from the northern part of ethiopia the northern part of megech watershed is characterized by a mountainous wedge shaped steep slopes whereas the lower part around lake tana is characterized by flat low lying land with poor drainage conditions wwdse and tahal group 2008 according to the ethiopian geological survey of ethiopia gse 2011 the area is possesed by upper lava flows basalts trachiytes and lacustrine sedments the population in the watershed is mainly dependent on the subsistence agriculture for the livilehood income and potable water supplies mainly come from groundwater sources fig 1 shows the location map of megech watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of input database input data for groundwater potential mapping of the study area was determined through field survey analysis of available information literature and combined professional expert judgment sar et al 2015 based on the available information literature nine groundwater controlling factors were identified as proxy data these were rainfall elevation slope drainage density geomorphology geology lithology lineament density land use cover and soil type these data are necessary for the analysis and groundwater inventory data for comparison purpose were also collected from different and reliable sources the type of data sources and the functions the data are presented in table 1 the long term average point rainfall values were used to generate areal rainfall map theissen polygon approach was used to interpolate the areal rainfall map seven stations data were employed table 2 for the preparation of areal rainfall of the study area the data for elevation was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem 30 m x 30 m resolution data for its better accuracy both in its vertical and horizontal resolution odutola et al 2012 then the elevation map of the megech watershed was mapped using arc gis further the elevation data was used to generate the slope raster data in each grid cell in the elevation raster slope was measured by the identification of maximum rate of change in value from each cell to neighboring cells waikar and nilawar 2014 the slope classes in the watershed were identified using slope spatial analyst tool in the gis package on the other hand the data related to drainage density were generated indirectly from the watershed slope data drainage density is defined as the closeness of spacing of stream channels sar et al 2015 according to rahmati et al 2014 drainage density dd is the measure of the total length of the stream segment of all orders per unit area which may be given as 1 d d i 1 n d i a where σdi is the total length of all streams in stream order i km and a is the area of the watershed km2 the drainage line delineation process was undertaken considering the stream lengths of 1000 units value 1000 and then the drainage density was computed using eq 1 the geomorphological map of the study area was prepared following the hammond landform classification technique as suggested by skye 2016 the geology or lithology thematic map of the study area was prepared by merging the two recent 2011 and 2013 years geologic maps of north gondar and yifag published by the geological survey of ethiopia gse 2013 the thematic layer for lineament density ld can be defined as the total length of all recorded lineaments divided by the area of the catchment under consideration which is given as edet et al 1998 2 l d i 1 n l i a where li is the length of the ith lineament and σli is the total length of all lineaments in kilometer and a is the area of the grid in square kilometers lineaments can be extracted from satellite images either by automatic or manual extraction methods in this study automatic lineament extraction method was used due to its effectiveness and user friendliness compared to the manual extraction weerasekera et al 2014 the lineaments of the study area were extracted from the landsat 8 oli tirs image path 170 row 51 with zero cloud cover using automated processing line tool in pci geomatica 2017 the use of line tool in pci geomatica was witnessed by umikaltuma and felix 2012 out of the 11 bands of the landsat 8 oli tirs images the lineaments were extracted from band 5 due to its quality and the highest number of lineaments delineated after the lineaments were extracted further processes of editing the watershed divide line and road features were done in gis to ensure the quality of the extracted lineaments the recent 2014 land use land cover lulc map of the study area reproduced from the lulc map of tana sub basin earlier prepared by amhara design and supervision works enterprise was used the soil map of megech watershed was modified from the fao 2003 soil map of ethiopia which was collected from mowie table 3 3 the analytical hierarchy process ahp the occurrence of groundwater in an area is influenced by several factors including the hydrological geological topographical environmental and climatic variables in such a case it is tempting to decide which factor or parameter is influencing more or less among the several available methods yeh et al 2016 hussein et al 2017 singh et al 2017 das and pardeshi 2018 razavi termeh et al 2019 the analytical hierarchy process ahp helps a lot to systematically identify the most influencing parameters the analytical hierarchy process ahp was used in this study ahp is mainly suitable for complex decisions which consist of the comparison of decision elements which are difficult to quantify it involves building a hierarchy of decision elements and then making comparisons between each possible pair in each cluster as a matrix the ahp approach relays on the hierarchal structuring of the decision criteria which is incorporated in decision making problem the hierarchy includes the knowledge experience and intuition of the decision maker anagnostopoulos et al 2007 ahp uses the pairwise comparison matrix eq 3 to evaluate the hierarchy for instance to compare two alternatives ai and aj using a criterion based on the fundamental scale of values ranging from 1 to 9 the definition of the ranks according to satty 1995 are given in table 4 the pair wise matrix is given by saaty 1995 3 a k a1 a2 an a1 1 a12 a1n a2 1 a12 1 a2n an 1 a1n 1 a2n 1 where a is a pair wise comparison matrix of alternatives ai i 1 2 3 n with respect to criteria k ahp incorporates an effective technique for checking the consistency of the evaluations made by the decision maker when building each of the pairwise comparison matrix a eq 3 involved in the process computation of a suitable consistency index ci is then obtained by first computing the scalar x as the average of the elements of the vector whose j th element is the ratio of the j th element of the vector a multiplied by weight vector to the corresponding element of the vector w the consistency index may be expressed as satty 1995 4 ci x m m 1 where m is the number of evaluation criteria thematic layers in the case of this study a perfectly consistent decision maker should always obtain ci 0 but small values of inconsistency may be tolerated if the consistency ratio cr 0 1 saaty 1990 and malczewski 1999 the consistency ratio may be defined as 5 cr ci ri where ri is the random index whose values for m number of evaluation criteria are given in table 5 according to saaty 1990 later on saaty 1995 suggested different cr value for different consistent pair wise comparison matrix size recommended cr value for a 3 3 matrix is less than 0 05 a 4 4 matrix is 0 09 and for larger matrices it is is 0 1 saaty 1995 4 priority estimation tool priest priority estimation tool priest was used to identify dominant groundwater occurrence and distribution factors in this study unlike other decision support tools based on ahp priest has the ability to visualize the inconsistency among a given set of pairwise comparison matrix siraj et al 2015 priest also provides the consistency measures for example dissonance congruence etc which are recommended for pairwise comparison based on decision support tools siraj et al 2015 priest enables to select the different elicitation methods in this study eigen vector ev method was used to derive a priority vector from a set of pairwise judgments saaty 1977 there are two types of consistency measures in pair wise comparison matrix to arrive at a judgment these are the ordinal and the cardinal consistency measures the judgments given by the decision maker in the pair wise comparison matrix a is said to be ordinally consistent if a1 is preferred to a2 and a2 is preferred to a3 then a1 is preferred to a3 where a1 a2 and a3 are elements of the decision criteria in comparison matrix for example lithology lineament density and slope were some of the elements considered in this study on the other hand the judgments are said to be cardinally consistent if aij 1 aji and ai j aikakj for all i j and k siraj et al 2015 siraj 2011 proposed different measures to determine the ordinal as well as the cardinal consistency and to detect outlying judgments these measures are dissonance ψ congruence θ and logarithmic mean square l dissonance ψ is proposed for ordinal consistency measure while congruence θ is the cardinal consistency measure in pairwise comparison matrix when the value of ψ is zero it reveals no latent violation of priorities in the pairwise comparison matrix pcm whereas when ψ is a non zero value there is latent violation l indicates whether the pcm is transitive or not when l is equal to zero pcm is transitive and when l is not equal to zero pcm is intransitive the dissonance and congruence inconsistency measures are given by siraj et al 2015 5 θ i j 1 n 2 k 1 n log a i j log

potential index gwpi gwpi can be defined as a dimensionless quantity that helps to predict the groundwater potential zones in an area a weighted linear combination method was used to estimate the gwpi malczewski 1999 shekhar and pandey 2014 which may be expressed as 7 gwpi j 1 m i 1 n wj xi where wj is the normalized weight of the j thematic layer xi is the rank rate value of each class with respect to the j layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of classes in each thematic layer 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis reveals how much each thematic map and the weights assigned for them influence the output map the sensitivity analysis was essentially conducted using the map removal analysis according to lodwick et al 1990 the map removal sensitivity analysis shows that which thematic map s is are the most or the least influential on determining the groundwater potential zone sensitivity analysis uses the index number s to measure the influence of each thematic layer the sensitivity index s was computed using 8 s gwpi n gwpi n gwpi where gwpi and gwpi are the output of groundwater potential map index of all the thematic layers and when one of the thematic layers is removed respectively n is the number of the full thematic layers used to compute gwpi and n is the number of thematic layers used to compute gwpi 4 3 validation process the identified groundwater potential zones using the gis and rs techniques were compared with the existing ground data from boreholes springs and hand dug wells in the study watershed to validate the credibility of the qualitative result this would build more confidence on the use of qualitative results such as the one obtained from gis and rs analysis the general framework for data processing and analysis is shown in fig 2 4 4 results and discussions in the following sections the results of the analysis are presented for each of the factors controlling groundwater recharge and thereby the groundwater potential 4 5 rainfall rainfall plays an important role in the hydrologic cycle and controls groundwater potential knowing the nature and characteristics of rainfall may enable one to conceptualize and predict its effects on runoff infiltration and groundwater recharge ramu et al 2010 the possibility of groundwater recharge would be high at the place where the rainfall is high and is low where rainfall is low zomlot et al 2015 kotchoni et al 2019 shakya et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it can also be noted that the groundwater recharge phenomena is the result of the long term effect than incidental highs or lows particularly for humid environments therefore it is more plausible to consider long term influence of rainfall than the short term precipitation values to determine the influence of rainfall on groundwater recharge fig 3 shows the areal average rainfall of the watershed the mean annual rainfall of the watershed ranges from 979 8 to 1140 2 mm the highest rainfall 1140 2 mm was recorded at shembekit station while the lowest 1102 6 mm was recorded at gondar stations which are covering 46 0 and 40 3 of the study area respectively this may be attributed to the orographic effect arising from altitude difference mezga et al 2014 it is evident that more rainfall may cause more recharge potential although that potential is challenged by other constraining factors such as slope geology land use cover drainage density lineament density and others therefore high recharge area does not necessarily imply high groundwater potential areas kotchoni et al 2019 4 6 elevation elevation or altitude can have an indirect and inverse effect on the groundwater potential of a given area it relates mainly to the rainfall occurrence and thereby the recharge therefore high altitudes favor more recharge and ensure the availability groundwater in lowland areas in a watershed mountainous areas are often favorable for recharge in deep seated confined aquifers situated at low land areas duffy and al hassan 1988 todd and mays 2005 in some instances highland areas can also serve for storage of some recharge and then contribute to the groundwater potential of an area depicted mainly through the presence of springs water tends to store at lower topography than at the higher topography ramu et al 2010 therefore higher the elevation lesser the groundwater potential and vice versa hence elevation or altitude data is needed to be considered in the groundwater potential studies elevation altitude ranges were arbitrarily created for qualitative assignment of values as shown in fig 4 evidently the watershed has higher elevation 2543 2978 m at the northern part and lower elevation 1784 2004 m at the southern part of the study area bordering lake tana fig 4 provides the topographic map of the megech watershed which is included in the weighted overlay analysis in this study 4 7 slope the land surface slope is another factor which influences the hydrology of a given watershed it mainly affects the surface runoff process and hence partially determines the groundwater recharge of a watershed the lower slope values indicate the flatter terrain gentle slope and the higher slope values indicate steep and undulating terrain the lower slope areas of the flat terrain allow rainfall infiltration and percolation while the higher slope areas generate quick runoff from the terrain and hence offer little volume of water for groundwater recharge within a watershed the effect of topographic gradient has significant influence on the groundwater flux than the groundwater depth and hence the hydraulic gradient grinevskii 2014 condon and maxwell 2015 this may be attributed to scale issue where the effect of groundwater hydraulic gradient may be negligible but the effect of topographic gradient cannot be disregarded however slope exposure is more influencing factor than the slope gradient for groundwater recharge and thereby for the groundwater potential grinevskii 2014 rukundo and dogan 2019 as can be depicted from fig 5 there are four classes of slopes identified in megech watershed using slope spatial analyst tool in the gis package there is indeed no hard and fast rule for slope classification for groundwater recharge or runoff generation however slope classes were identified based on their level of importance to groundwater recharge in gis yeh et al 2016 andualem and demeke 2019 four classes of slope were extracted ranging from plain gentle slope areas to extremely steep slopes the gentle slopes 0 7 is observed in the southern part of the watershed near lake tana covering an area of nearly 47 showing significant area of the watershed available for groundwater recharge with respect to slope on the other hand areas having extremely steep slopes 28 77 are located at the north and northeastern part of the watershed the steepest slope portion covers a small area of around 8 the other two classifications of the slopes 7 16 medium and 16 28 steep respectively cover approximately 31 and 14 of the total watershed area fig 5 4 8 drainage density drainage density is the total length of streams per unit area it is one of the factors which play an important role in potential groundwater zoning high drainage density favors high runoff through the dissected channels and thus provides less opportunity to infiltration into the ground and percolation thereafter on the other hand low drainage density areas have less surface runoff and consequently favor more infiltration jenifer and jha 2017 thomas and duraisamy 2017 although large drainage density depicts less groundwater recharge it may come to happen that the stream beds and banks may contribute to substantial amount of groundwater recharge which needs further assessment das and pardeshi 2018 yeh et al 2009 furthermore in perennial and seasonal streams the water contact time with the bed and banks is long that it provides good opportunity for percolation therefore areas nearby drainage channels water courses may have good groundwater potential todd and mays 2005 drainage density enables to visualize high groundwater recharge areas the drainage density map of megech watershed fig 6 is produced by employing the line density tool in arcgis das and pardeshi 2018 the drainage density of the study area is ranging from 0 083 to 4 024 km km2 the drainage densities of the megech watershed were classified into four classes as very low 0 083 0 995 km km2 moderately low 0 995 1 536 km km2 high 1 536 2 216 km km2 and very high 2 216 4 024 km km2 as shown in fig 6 the lowest drainage density areas are mainly located on the northwestern boundaries of the watershed fig 6 on the other hand the highest drainage density areas are scattered in the central and southern portions of the watershed this may be due to the presence of closely spaced stream networks or drainage lines in these areas 4 9 geomorphology geomorphology is the study of earth structures and also depicts the various landforms related to the groundwater occurrence and structural features ramu and vinay 2010 geomorphology controls the subsurface movement of groundwater it is one of the most important features in evaluating the groundwater potential and prospect therefore geomorphology can be utilized for management of groundwater resources kumar and kumar 2011 valliammai et al 2013 the hammond landform classification technique revised by skye 2016 was used to prepare the geomorphological map there are seven major land forms sub classes identified which include flat or nearly flat plains smooth plains with some local relief plains with high hills low hills high hills low maintains and high mountains fig 7 the flat or nearly flat plains are found mostly in the southern portions of the study area on the other hand the highly mountainous areas are observed at the northern end of the study area fig 7 accordingly flat or nearly flat plains comprise of 29 smooth plains with some relief equal to 28 plains with high hills comprising 14 low hills equal to 13 high hills equal to 8 low mountains equal to 5 and high mountains equal to 3 of the total watershed high and low hills linear ridge landforms are considered as very low groundwater potential zones while flat and smooth plains with local relief are high groundwater potential prospect zones valley plains and flat lands provide good opportunity for groundwater recharge and show good groundwater potential zones ramaiah et al 2012 rajaveni et al 2017 4 10 geology geology influences both the porosity and permeability of the aquifer material yazi et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2010 geology or lithology is one of the groundwater controlling parameters considered in ground water studies which play a significant role in the distribution and occurrence of groundwater there are four major lithology types identified in the study area namely tertiary plateau basalts and pyroclasts tertiary upper basalts and trachyte quaternary lacustrine sediments and tertiary upper lava flows fig 8 tertiary plateau basalts and pyroclasts are the tertiary period lithological formations characterized by dark grey mostly coarse grained and sometimes fine to medium grained rock at some places the tertiary plateau basalts are occurring as massive hard dense and slightly weathered rocks it consists of plagioclase phyric olivine phyric and aphanitic basalts its thickness can reach up to 800 m gse 2013 the geological survey of ethiopia gse 2013 found out that the tertiary plateau basalts and pyroclasts are extensive and moderately to low productive fissured aquifers categorized under the hydraulic properties permeability k 100 km² transmissivity t 1 100 m² d unit flow rate and q 0 01 1 l s m and discharge q 0 5 5 l s tertiary upper basalts and trachytes are the tertiary period lithological formations which behave like aphanitic dark grey fine grained formation materials and characterized by jointing fracturing and spheroidal weathering these are rarely columnar and mainly massive in structure dense 300 m thick and exhibit compact flows according to gse 2013 tertiary upper basalts and trachyte are extensive and highly productive fissured aquifer systems with the hydraulic properties whose permeability can go above 100 km² transmissivity varying from 100 to 500 m² d and well yields vary from 5 to 25 l s quaternary lacustrine sediments are the young lithological formations which have a property of thick brownish clayey soil and light grey soil material assumed to have developed from lake sediments quaternary lacustrine sediments have the highest water bearing capacity among the lithological units of the study area this may be witnessed by the borehole yield data falling in the range of 20 l s to 35 l s from groundwater inventory data these lithological units are categorized under the extensive and highly productive porous aquifer systems which have the permeability values over 100km2 transmissivity values ranging between 100 500 m2 d and well yields can go up to 25 l s and not less than 5 l sec gse 2013 these are mainly covering the lowland areas of dembia area in the neighborhood of lake tana fig 8 the tertiary upper lava flows are the miocene age lithological formations structurally characterized by massive less columnar horizontal and deeply weathered faults gse 2011 these comprise of mainly basalts and lesser scoriaceous basalts and scoria falls in view of groundwater bearing capacity these are preferably more important than the basaltic formations consisting of pyroclasts and trachyte this is because the tertiary upper lava flows include scoriaceous basalts in which groundwater can occur seifu 2013 these geologic units are covering the highland areas of lay armachew and stretching to the plateau of dembia the tertiary upper lava flows have the highest areal coverage 45 7 among the lithological units of the study area fig 8 4 11 lineament density a lineament may represent a fault fracture and master joint a long and linear geological formation topographic linearity valleys or straight course of streams boundaries between the different lithological units vegetation cover or artificial objects such as road bridge etc pradhan 2009 adiri et al 2017 in the megech watershed there are few road networks these road networks were extracted and excluded during the map overlay process and hence only actual lineaments were considered pradhan 2009 also stated that the presence of lineaments usually signify a permeable zone therefore lineament density of an area can ultimately explain the groundwater potential in the area fig 9 shows the lineament density of megech watershed divided into four classes namely 1st class 0 0 5 km km2 2nd class 0 5 1 1 km km2 3rd class 1 1 1 9 km km2 and 4th class 1 9 3 9 km km2 fig 9 it is evident that areas having higher lineament density have higher groundwater potential and vice versa das et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 as can be depicted in the lineament map of the study watershed areas having highest groundwater prospect zones have lineament density ranging between 1 9 3 9 km km2 andualem and demeke 2019 covering an area of 45 of the total land scape the other classes of lineament density 1 1 1 19 km km2 0 5 1 1 km km2 and 0 0 5 km km2 respectively cover nearly 26 17 and 12 of the overall watershed 4 12 land use cover the surface covered by vegetation like forests and agriculture traps and holds the water in root of plants whereas the built up and rocky land use affects the recharge of groundwater by increasing runoff during rainfall shaban et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to study which features have covered the study area in order to carry out the groundwater potential studies fig 10 shows the lulc of the megech watershed overall 7 main classes of lulc units were identified which are further detailed to 17 sub classes the study area mainly comprises of cultivated land grassland woody shrub land forest areas water bodies and wetlands residential areas and few afro alpine vegetation cover the dominant lulc units are the cultivated lands covering an area of about 73 28 of the total megech watershed followed by settlement and residential areas 9 76 this may be attributed to the intensive agricultural practice in the area for satisfying the growing food demand in the watershed built up and rocky surfaces have less probability of groundwater potential occurrence whereas the surfaces covered by vegetation like agricultural plants and forests have higher chance of groundwater water probability singh et al 2010 fenta et al 2015 li et al 2018 the priorities for lulc units were given following fenta et al 2015 where water body forest shrub land cultivated land grassland bare land for groundwater occurrence suitability land use and cover conditions affect the hydrologic cycle in many ways primarily by altering the surface runoff behavior and thereby the groundwater recharge in fact the lulc also affects the other hydrologic processes such as evapotranspiration transpiration infiltration evaporation and interception due to population increase and other anthropogenic influences in many watersheds there is change of land use and cover from one form to the other scanlon et al 2005 kenji et al 2009 pan et al 2011 owuor et al 2016 riley et al 2019 some land uses favor groundwater recharge and potential while others are bringing negative consequence to groundwater recharge for example settlement and urban areas mainly generate the runoff process and hence have reduced recharge pan et al 2011 owuor et al 2016 agricultural areas may or may not positively contribute to the groundwater depending on the management procedures taken for soil and water conservation extensive review on the effect of land use and land cover change on groundwater recharge and then the groundwater availability was conducted by owuor et al 2016 forests were observed to lower groundwater recharge rates compared to others while the conversion of the other lulc to cropland or grassland increases groundwater recharge owuor et al 2016 however this may not be taken as a universal truth and site specific conditions may prevail in the groundwater recharge process yeh et al 2009 singh et al 2010 pan et al 2011 li et al 2018 on the other hand forests and grasslands are reducing the runoff process and thereby provide better opportunity for groundwater recharge wetlands and water bodies are the foremost contributors for groundwater augmentation in particular cases of irrigated areas there may be an incidental recharge from the irrigation areas and this may contribute to aquifer replenishment pan et al 2011 the effects of the other land uses and cover conditions can be separately seen since lulc not only controls the groundwater recharge alone but the other hydrological processes too 4 13 soil soil is an important factor for delineating the groundwater potential zones the water holding capacity of an area depends upon the soil types and their permeability kumar et al 2016 the dominant soil types of the study area were eutric cambisols chromic vertisol and eutric regosols which covered 46 14 18 40 and 15 90 of the total area of megech watershed respectively the remaining soil types contribute very limited portions fig 11 illustrates the soil types of the watershed the permeability of the soil types depends up on their texture therefore the identified soil types of the study area were slightly modified from fao 2003 for this study to relate it with the usda soil textural class soil affects the process of groundwater recharge besides its effect on the other hydrologic processes soil mainly affects the infiltration and percolation processes which ultimately influence the groundwater recharge and then the groundwater potential of a given area anuraga et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 rukundo and dogan 2019 alluvial soils favor recharge and hence more potential for groundwater availability on the other hand compacted soil environments and fine textured soils have very low permeability and hence favor surface runoff than sub surface flow rukundo and dogan 2019 soil type may be more important than the land use for groundwater recharge particularly course textured soils anuraga et al 2006 however specific studies on individual soil texture and comparative land use cover conditions were not studied in detail 4 14 weighted thematic maps and their classes weighting the thematic maps was carried out using priest software package by employing the pairwise comparison pc method priest was developed to support the analytical hierarchy process in decision making and provides the opportunity to identify and revise inconsistent judgments based on consistency measures siraj et al 2015 the result of the analysis is shown in table 6 the dominant factors governing the groundwater potential in the watershed were determined using the weight vector three consistency measures dissonance logarithmic mean square and congruence were used to describe the consistency of the judgments as can be observed from priest result for the judgments cr value of less than 0 1 shows that the judgments are highly acceptable in addition to this the judgments do not involve the intransitive judgments since the value of logarithmic residual mean square l is equal to 0 and there are no latent priority during the pair wise comparison as the value of dissonance ψ is equal to 0 the priority vector computed in priest using eigen vector ev method table 6 showed the weighted value of nearly 30 for the lithology 23 for lineament density 15 for slope 10 for geomorphology 7 for soil 6 for lulc 4 for rainfall 3 for drainage density and finally 2 for elevation according to the calculated priority vector lithology is the most dominant groundwater governing parameter in the study area this is due to its capability in controlling groundwater potential as it can be inferred from the studies by gse 2011 2013 and the borehole yields in the study area on the other hand the elevation was prioritized ranked the last since it has the least influence among the parameters controlling groundwater potentiality considered in the study in the same fashion each thematic map classes were weighted and reclassified based on the weighted values of their classes after the weightages were determined for each thematic layer gis overlay analysis was carried out 4 15 gis overlay analysis all the thematic maps or layers were prepared in the reclassified raster format and were given the normalized weight in accordance with the groundwater potential controlling capability similarly each thematic layer s classes were given the normalized rank or weight then overlay analysis was carried out using the weight vectors from priest as described in the earlier section the gwpi was calculated using 9 gwpi 0 3 lithr 0 23 ldr 0 15 slopr 0 10 geomr 0 07 soilr 0 06 lulcr 0 04 rnflr 0 03 ddr 0 02 elvnr where lithr reclassified lithological map ldr reclassified lineament density map slopr reclassified slope map geomr reclassified geomorphological map soilr reclassified soil map lulcr reclassified land use cover map rnflr reclassified rainfall map ddr reclassified drainage density map elvnr reclassified elevation map and the numbers preceding the abbreviations are weights in gwpi is a dimensionless quantity computed considering the weights computed for each layer and sub classes in each thematic layer after the overlay process has been completed the groundwater potential zone map was classified as high gwpi 23 5 32 2 moderate gwpi 17 2 23 5 and low gwpi 9 7 17 2 the output map fig 12 indicates the high groundwater potential zone situated mostly near the lake tana dembia plain this is mainly attributed to the availability of the high water bearing quaternary lacustrine sediment aquifer in plain terrain few other patches of high groundwater potential zone areas are located where there are high to very high 1 1 3 9 km km2 lineament density with gentle slope 0 7 fig 12 the high groundwater potential zone covers an area of nearly 124 km2 18 of the total area of the megech watershed the groundwater potential zone designated as moderate is mostly found in the northwest part of megech watershed which covers part of the dembia plateau gondar town and lay armachew areas the moderate groundwater potential zone is distributed along the areas where there is tertiary upper lava flows the second higher water bearing geological unit and the moderately slopping areas 7 16 flat or nearly flat plains plains with high hills and the eutric regosols soil type a few portion of the moderate groundwater potential zone is also scattered along the northeast direction where the lineament density is very high 1 9 3 9 km km2 the moderate groundwater potential zone covers relatively higher area 320 1 km2or 46 of the megech watershed low groundwater potential areas are found along the northeast portion of the study area which covers lay armachew wogera and gondar zuria districts this may be due to the fact that the area exhibits high distribution of mountainous geomorphology and relatively less water bearing lithological formations upper basalts and trachytes and plateau basalts and pyroclasts on the other hand this groundwater potential zone is sparsely distributed along the northwest part of megech watershed which includes lay armachew gondar town and dembia the low groundwater potential zone covers nearly 245 km2 or 36 of the study area in general moderate to high groundwater potential zones are located in the north western and southern portions of the study area while the northeastern portions of the watershed possess low groundwater potential possible groundwater development works for water supply can take place in these areas while groundwater for extensive use such as irrigation may be considered in the dembia plain in the south of the watershed 4 16 sensitivity analysis of the groundwater potential zones map sensitivity analysis was conducted by the map removal procedure in this procedure one of the thematic layers was removed at a time and the other thematic layers involved in the processing of the output map the computed sensitivity index s values are indicated in table 7 in this particular study geology lithology was the first influential thematic layer s 2 8 to determine the output map of the groundwater potential zones of megech watershed the lineament density and the slope were observed to be the second and third influential thematic layers which account 1 41 and 1 38 sensitivity index respectively on the other hand the least influential factor for the output map determination was the drainage density thematic map s 0 69 the sensitivity analysis confirmed that the influence of thematic layers to alter the output map is directly related to the weights given to them in this study the map removal sensitivity analysis revealed that the generated output map was highly sensitive to the thematic layers having high weight and vice versa 4 17 validation of qualitative results an effort was paid to collect existing data from different sources for validation purpose a total of 135 existing groundwater inventory data including boreholes springs and hand dug wells were collected for the purpose of comparison or evaluation of the qualitative results of the groundwater potential zones well and spring yield were selected as a better candidate than other existing data however only 79 groundwater well points have the recorded yield data the highest yield among the collected groundwater data was 35 l s with 286 m well depth the least yield was observed from the springs having a yield of 0 01 l s although there is no general classification scheme well yields can be grouped into some classification schemes considering site specific conditions for example the aquifer yields in tana and beles sub basins were divided into four categories by sogreah 2013 as 0 3 l s low 3 6 l s moderate 6 20 l s high and more than 20 l s as very high groundwater potential zones on the other hand gse 2013 classified gondar and west gondar aquifer yields including other aquifer properties as 0 5 1 l s low 1 5 l s moderate to low and 5 25 l s high groundwater potential areas in this study since gondar and west gondar are part of the megech watershed and its aquifer properties the gse 2013 classification scheme was adopted with some modification areas where well spring yield lie between 0 and 1 l s were categorized as low 1 and 5 l s as moderate and more than 5 l s were classified as high potential groundwater regions based on this classification out of the 33 boreholes having yields over 5 l s 20 boreholes 60 6 have higher yield values range between 18 35 l s are falling on the high groundwater potential zone gwpz most of these are found in dembia plain out of the 41 boreholes yield data 38 92 7 of them are falling on the moderate gwpz whereas out of the 5 low yield 0 1 l s boreholes and springs data 80 is falling on the gwpz classified as low fig 12 in general the cross validation analysis revealed that 78 5 table 8 of the groundwater inventory data boreholes hand dug wells and springs agree to the corresponding groundwater potential zone classifications from qualitative analysis besides comparing with groundwater inventory data seifu 2013 also witnessed that there is high groundwater potential near the lake tana plains and low groundwater potential around the northern part of the study area this confirms that there is a very good agreement between the groundwater inventory data and groundwater potential zones delineated using gis and rs techniques plotting the inventory data over the groundwater potential map was also conducted it can be clearly seen that only few groundwater development works are appeared on the northeastern portion of the watershed where the qualitative results revealed low groundwater potential the better yielding wells and springs are located in the southern and northwestern portions of the watershed where moderate to high groundwater potential zones prevail fig 12 5 conclusion in this study an attempt was made to develop a spatial model for demarcating the groundwater potential zones making use of the nine thematic layers as proxy data for groundwater these were geology lithology lineament density slope geomorphology soil lulc rainfall drainage density and elevation the groundwater potential zones were produced by integrating these thematic layers in arcgis overlay analysis the identified gw potential zones are high moderate and low covering 18 46 and 36 of the megech watershed area respectively the three distinct groundwater potential zones were also validated using existing groundwater inventory data and the result portrayed nearly 78 5 agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the qualitative groundwater potential analysis it can be concluded that gis and rs together with ahp decision making techniques are found to be time and cost effective approaches in groundwater potential mapping the results from ahp based priest software revealed that a weightage of 30 for geology lithology 23 for lineament density 15 for slope 10 for geomorphology 7 for soil 6 for lulc 4 for rainfall 3 for drainage density and 2 for elevation higher weightage of the contributing proxy parameters refers to high groundwater potential and vice versa it can be observed that the first four factors geology lineament density slope and geomorphology are dominantly contributing to the groundwater potential of the study areas this was also revealed using the map removal analysis procedure this study may provide stakeholders and decision makers important information on the groundwater potential of the megech watershed and the districts woredas in the watershed we recommend that this kind of studies is quite important for groundwater development schemes particularly in ethiopian conditions where observed data on groundwater is not available the developed groundwater potential map can be an aid to develop manage and wisely utilize the

8376,study region the study considers 115 unregulated catchments in norway with areas from 6 to 15 449 km2 and flood generation regimes ranging from snowmelt dominated to mixed snowmelt and rainfall to fully rainfall driven study focus bias corrected euro cordex rcm output for rcp 8 5 is used to generate an ensemble of 500 hydrological simulations for assessing changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate flood estimates are based on three extreme value distributions evds gumbel generalised extreme value and generalised pareto with confidence intervals calculated using parametric bootstrapping and uncertainty introduced into the ensemble by the flood estimation is evaluated using variance decomposition changes in evd parameters under future conditions are also assessed new hydrologic insight for the region there are large differences in projected changes between catchments with median estimates ranging from 48 to 99 for the 200 year flood flood magnitudes in all catchments with rainfall dominant or mixed flood regimes are expected to increase evds with a shape parameter gev and gpd indicate larger increases in higher flood quantiles than the gumbel distribution e g by 5 8 percentage points for the 200 year flood flood frequency estimation contributes 30 52 of the total ensemble range in individual catchments location and scale parameters generally increase in catchments with increasing flood magnitudes and some catchments with mixed flood regimes also exhibit increases in the shape parameter under future conditions keywords climate change impacts nordic extreme value analysis ensemble uncertainty hbv hydrological model 1 introduction there is considerable interest in and a pressing need for assessments of likely changes in extreme flows under a future climate due to the potential impact of extreme flooding on critical infrastructure and on society e g hirabayashi et al 2013 winsemius et al 2016 as both housing and structures such as flood protection measures and hydropower related dams and reservoirs can have expected lifetimes of up to 100 years and the consequences of inundation or failure can be catastrophic estimates for high flows with long return periods are required for design purposes and for land use planning this task is a significant challenge even under the current climate as extrapolation beyond the length of a local streamflow record is almost always required in addition the extreme value analyses underlying this extrapolation entail fairly stringent assumptions as to the statistical properties of the observed data series i e that extreme events are independent identically distributed and stationary that are often not satisfied in practise rossi et al 1984 franks and kuczera 2002 read and vogel 2015 for estimates under a future climate observed time series are not available and estimates are often generated from simulated hydrological data derived from climate projections this leads to an even higher degree of uncertainty in flood estimates as several additional factors come into play including the reliability of downscaled climate projections maraun et al 2010 the need for and suitability of local bias adjustment of input climate data e g leander et al 2008 teutschbein et al 2011 the suitability of the hydrological model e g poulin et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 krysanova et al 2018 and its parameterisation e g vormoor et al 2018 dakhlaoui et al 2019 for modelling streamflows under changing conditions and the most likely greenhouse gas concentration pathway the general aim of the study presented here is therefore to investigate the uncertainty introduced by standard methods for statistical flood frequency estimation when applied to an ensemble of hydrological projections a comparison is made between estimates based on extreme value distributions with and without a shape parameter for describing the skewness of the distribution the study also presents projections for likely changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate in a region in which both snowmelt and rainfall contribute significantly to extreme high flows and in which the relative contributions of these factors are expected to change in a warmer climate a range of previous studies have analysed likely future changes in flooding using ensembles of hydrological simulations driven by precipitation and temperature time series from climate model outputs at catchment regional and global scales e g hirabayashi et al 2013 köplin et al 2014 vormoor et al 2015 alfieri et al 2015 arheimer and lindström 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 osuch et al 2016 meresa and romanowicz 2017 thober et al 2018 and for earlier examples see review in madsen et al 2014 three issues considered or arising from these published studies are particularly relevant for the work presented here 1 expected changes in regions where melt processes contribute to high flows 2 the target variables used to assess changes in high flows and methods for estimating these and 3 the components of the modelling chain considered in the ensemble analysis and these aspects are reviewed in the following paragraphs regions and catchments in which snowmelt clearly dominates flood generation in today s climate can in many cases expect both a decrease in flood magnitudes and an earlier spring flood e g veijalainen et al 2010 poulin et al 2011 an earlier spring flood is in fact one of the few statistically significant changes in flood regimes that already is observed in the present climate e g wilson et al 2010 arheimer and lindström 2015 vormoor et al 2016 blöschl et al 2017 expected future patterns of change are however more complex for catchments in which both snowmelt and rainfall contribute to flood generation as the competing trends of a decreasing winter snowpack vs increases in precipitation that falls as rain become important and can in some cases lead to a change in flood seasonality and in flood generating processes köplin et al 2014 vormoor et al 2015 projected changes in flood magnitudes and even the sign of the projected change can vary significantly with local factors such as catchment size and median elevation particularly in regions with complex topography e g musselman et al 2018 there is therefore little direct correspondence between changes in precipitation and in flood magnitudes sharma et al 2018 and in some cases projected percentage changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate are higher than the expected increases in precipitation extremes previous studies have used a variety of measures to assess changes in high flows typically applying the measure to two or more time slices e g 30 year periods representing simulations for present and future conditions and comparing the results to estimate the degree of change e g as a change factor or percentage change time slices of 30 years or less rather than the full length of the simulated series e g 1950 2100 are often used to avoid problems of non stationarity madsen et al 2014 widely applied indices include both quantities that can be estimated without extrapolation such as the mean annual flood e g lawrence and haddeland 2011 köplin et al 2014 thober et al 2018 average magnitude or number of over threshold values e g cloke et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 hundecha et al 2016 vormoor et al 2016 or empirical return levels based on the time slice considered e g steele dunne et al 2008 hundecha et al 2016 as well as estimates based on a fitted extreme value distribution evd for flood magnitudes of a given return period although extrapolation with an evd invariably leads to a more uncertain estimate knowledge of likely changes in these higher flood quantiles are often required in practise for climate change adaptation several earlier studies of climate change impacts on flooding e g dankers and feyen 2008 veijalainen et al 2010 lawrence and hisdal 2011 have applied a two parameter gumbel distribution to the simulated annual maximum series and in some cases have justified its use relative to a 3 parameter gev generalised extreme value distribution based on the likelihood ratio e g dankers and feyen 2008 the use of a gev distribution is more common in recent studies e g hattermann et al 2011 condon et al 2015 meresa and romanowicz 2017 soriano et al 2019 although the gumbel distribution is still frequently used e g hirabayashi et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 the choice of a particular extreme value distribution relative to other alternatives is generally not discussed in these studies the selection of the best methods for estimation of flood quantiles using extreme value analyses is a well established and advanced research topic and covers a range of issues including appropriate statistics for evaluating reliability and stability or robustness e g renard et al 2013 kochanek et al 2014 and goodness of fit e g laio 2004 as well as the most suitable methods for fitting the extreme value distributions some of these issues have recently been investigated for 526 norwegian catchments for local cf regional analyses using block maximum methods applied to observed data kobierska et al 2018 consistent with other studies the results indicate that the 3 parameter gev gives slightly more reliable but less stable estimates than the 2 parameter gumbel distribution for 30 year data records the results also favour the use of l moments or bayesian methods for fitting the evd for goodness of fit both the anderson darling test and the cramer von mises test are preferred for testing extreme value distributions laio 2004 relative to traditional tests such as the kolmogorov smirnov test due to the weighting they place on higher quantiles alternatives to the block maxima approach such as the fitting of over threshold values to a generalised pareto gp distribution are less commonly used in studies of climate change impacts on flooding although they also have been applied e g prudhomme et al 2003 2013 collet et al 2017 a recent study of flooding buchanan et al 2018 due to sea level rise has also investigated this approach and demonstrates its advantages relative to the fitting of a gumbel distribution for streamflow flooding a clear advantage of a peak over threshold series over an annual maximum series is that one potentially has a larger sample size and that the sample represents all of the highest flows during a given period including subannual maxima madsen et al 1997 lang et al 1999 this is relevant for norwegian catchments as many catchments exhibit mixed flood regimes including both snowmelt generated floods during spring and early summer and rainfall generated floods during the autumn under the current climate vormoor et al 2016 in some cases the largest observed floods have occurred in response to rainfall in the autumn although the annual maximum series is dominated by snowmelt floods during the spring and early summer roald 2013 as the balance between various types of flood generating processes can change gradually under a warming climate the use of a method that is not limited to sampling one event per year is more likely to detect insipient trends a principal drawback of peak over threshold evds is that a suitable threshold must be used to select the events comprising the series and ensuring that they in fact represent an extreme value series this is traditionally done using for example mean residual life plots see discussion in coles 2001 this approach is however unfeasible for a large ensemble of simulations derived from climate data such as is considered here an alternative is to use an assumed threshold that is high enough to ensure that the sampled events are in fact extreme values e g madsen et al 1997 such that the peak over threshold approach can be applied to a large number of data series without the need for an analysis of each individual data series different climate models downscaling methods and hydrological modelling techniques can produce widely varying estimates and it is not possible to select the combination of models and approaches that give the most reliable prognoses for extreme flows under unknown conditions towards the end of the 21st century a popular remedy for this is to use a so called ensemble method in which combinations of several models and methods are applied to generate multiple realizations of current and future conditions although the resulting ensembles of opportunity von storch and zwiers 2013 lack the statistical rigor of classic ensemble methods in which for example multiple realisations are generated based on perturbed initial conditions they are nevertheless useful for summarizing a range of possible future outcomes based on available methods and models numerous studies have investigated the uncertainty in such ensemble estimates corresponding in most cases to the ensemble range or variance due to various ensemble components including climate models post processing methods and hydrological models and their parameterisations the various analyses indicate that although uncertainty from differences between climate models makes a large contribution to the ensemble spread other factors such as statistical post processing methods hundecha et al 2016 osuch et al 2016 hydrological model structure poulin et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 steinschneider et al 2015 and hydrological model parameterization lawrence and haddeland 2011 can also make significant contributions in some cases uncertainty introduced by the methods used to estimate extreme flood quantiles has received very little attention in previous work exceptions to this are the recent study by meresa and romanowicz 2017 in which the uncertainty introduced by flood frequency estimation based on a gev distribution in estimates for future changes in both high flows and low flows is evaluated for a single catchment in poland they conclude that the flood frequency analysis contributes a considerable degree of uncertainty in the estimation of low flows but not in high flows in that catchment in contrast with this finding a recent study by collet et al 2017 found that the use of a gp or gev distribution represents 40 60 of the total ensemble uncertainty relative to climate models in estimates for changes in the 100 year flood in great britain to build on previous findings the objectives of this study are therefore to compare estimates for future changes in hydrological flooding in norway based on the application of 2 parameter gumbel vs 3 parameter gev and gp extreme value distributions to a large ensemble of simulations in particular the study considers the following research questions 1 do evds with a shape parameter gev and gp give significantly different estimates for projected changes in higher flood quantiles 2 do evds with a shape parameter give a better fit to the extreme value series 3 what is the average contribution of flood frequency estimation to the range of ensemble estimates for changes in higher flood quantiles 4 how do the average evd parameters change under a future climate and can this change be related to flood generating processes the study also presents results for projected changes in four flood quantiles with 10 100 200 and 1000 year return periods for 115 catchments representing a range of flood generation regimes from fully pluvial to predominantly nival the 200 year flood is used for flood hazard mapping in norway in conjunction with land use planning and the 1000 year flood is required for design flood analysis for dam safety investigations estimates for projected changes in these flood quantiles are therefore used in practice for work with climate change adaptation 2 study area catchment based hydrological modelling is applied in this study to develop hydrological projections for 115 near natural catchments distributed across norway all without significant streamflow regulation affecting high flows fleig et al 2013 the catchments represent a range of climate and hydrological regimes topographic conditions and landscape types and can be grouped into six regions for summarising and presenting results fig 1 and table 1 the boundaries between the six regions are based primarily on established runoff regions e g pettersson 2013 with a further grouping or subdivision of some regions to give a closer correspondence with administrative units i e county boundaries in all cases however the regions used here are based on catchment divides as boundaries between regions rather than county boundaries the adjustments to the runoff regions have been made to facilitate the presentation of summary results for regions that can be further used in planning related to climate change adaptation e g hanssen bauer et al 2017 the mean annual temperature for the whole of norway during the reference period used in this study 1971 2000 was 1 3 c hanssen bauer et al 2015 2017 there are however large regional variations with annual averages of over 6 c in coastal regions of vestlandet sørlandet and østlandet and as low as 2 8 c in finnmark and 4 c in the high mountain region of southern norway located near the boundary between vestlandet and østlandet in fig 1 annual precipitation also shows significant spatial variation with the driest regions in the inland zones of østlandet and finnmark receiving as little as 300 mm yr and the wettest regions in vestlandet and nordland over 4000 mm yr spatial patterns of annual runoff largely reflect regional temperature and precipitation patterns the average annual runoff in the 115 catchments used in this study together with the range of values for the catchments are given for each region in table 1 catchments with the highest annual runoff are found in vestlandet avg 2309 mm yr and in nordland avg 1890 mm yr and the lowest annual runoff is associated with catchments in finnmark avg 773 mm yr and østlandet avg 687 mm yr there is however considerable local variation in each of these regions the seasonal pattern of discharge leading to flooding is strongly controlled by both temperature and precipitation during the winter period as well as the catchment median elevation and hypsometry as they determine the potential for snow accumulation and melting the number of days during the winter half year 1st october 31st march with a temperature over 0 c the precipitation during the winter half year and the catchment median elevation and steepness are given as average values and ranges for each region in table 1 in finnmark troms and in inland østlandet winter conditions are favourable for significant snow storage and snow accumulation is only limited by relatively low precipitation values this leads to a seasonal pattern of runoff with high flows during the late spring to summer months and low flows during the winter in contrast vestlandet and sørlandet and to some extent coastal regions of nordland trøndelag and østlandet have relatively warmer winters with abundant precipitation these areas nevertheless can also experience colder periods with snow accumulation in addition catchments in some of these areas can be quite steep with snow storage and even glaciation in the upper reaches these factors produce a general pattern of high flows during the autumn and winter months with the heaviest precipitation although peak melt periods can also lead to elevated discharge values during spring and summer months and during transient periods of snow accumulation and melting during autumn and winter climate change projections for norway hanssen bauer et al 2015 2017 indicate changes in both temperature and precipitation under a future climate for the whole of norway temperature increases of 1 7 3 7 c under rcp 4 5 moderate greenhouse gas concentration pathway and 3 4 6 0 c under rcp 8 5 high concentration pathway are expected by 2071 2100 relative to a 1971 2000 reference period projected changes in annual precipitation are between 3 and 14 rcp 4 5 and 7 and 23 rcp 8 5 there are nevertheless large variations between regions and between seasons the largest absolute increases in mm in precipitation are expected to occur during the autumn and winter seasons in the regions vestlandet trøndelag and nordland see fig 1 while the largest relative increases in are expected during the spring and winter periods in østlandet and finnmark in addition the number of days with heavy precipitation is expected to increase over the entire country during all seasons in some cases the average number of days with heavy precipitation will be more than double by the end of the 21st century under rcp 8 5 the projected changes in temperature and precipitation regimes are expected to lead to changes in seasonal runoff that also vary significantly between regions due to a decrease in snow storage and an increase in precipitation that falls as rain in the winter under a future climate winter runoff is projected to increase in all regions under rcp 8 5 with the largest relative increases in nordland and finnmark and in inland and mountainous regions in the mid and southern norway hanssen bauer et al 2015 summer runoff is projected to decrease considerably in all regions as a result of increased evapotranspiration and an earlier snowmelt season due to warmer temperatures 3 data and methods 3 1 classification of flood regimes previous analyses of observed and projected future high flows in norway indicate that the dominant flood generation process fgp in a given catchment exerts a strong control on the direction and magnitude of changes vormoor et al 2015 2016 in this study we therefore use the simple categorisation of fgps proposed by vormoor et al 2015 2016 to describe the contribution of precipitation vs snowmelt to the generation of high flows in individual catchments the fgp represents the percentage of the independent events in the over threshold series based on a threshold corresponding to the 98 5th percentile of the flow duration curve comprised predominantly of rainfall see vormoor et al 2016 for further details and is quantified here as a percentage between 0 and 100 although more detailed classifications could be considered e g merz and blöschl 2003 we use the simple 3 member classification proposed by vormoor to broadly distinguish flood regimes and to characterise the spatial pattern of flood generation using this classification the categories snow dominated vs mixed vs rainfall dominated flood regimes shown in fig 1 highlight snowmelt as the main fgp in the inland regions of southern norway and in finnmark troms and rainfall as the dominant driver of high flows in vestlandet and sørlandet and in coastal regions of østlandet trøndelag and nordland mixed regimes are prominent in transitional areas between the two other regimes although actual changes in these flood regimes under a future climate are not analysed in this study the catchment fgp under the current climate is used to identify the types of catchments that are most susceptible to increases vs decreases in flood levels under changing climatic conditions 3 2 ensemble of hydrological projections 3 2 1 climate model data and bias adjustment the hydrological simulations analysed in this study are driven by data from 10 rcm regional climate model runs generated by the eurocordex initiative jacob et al 2014 for rcp 8 5 using the eur 11 grid with a spatial resolution of approximately 12 km table 2 rcp 8 5 is used here because the current national guidance for adaptation related to climate change in norway recommends that estimates for the likely effects of global warming are based on concentration pathways representing a high level of emissions miljøverndepartement 2012 the selection of the gcm rcm combinations shown in table 2 represents eurocordex runs available at the time of the most recent norwegian climate assessment report e g summarized in hanssen bauer et al 2015 2017 which were deemed suitable for analyses in the nordic region by the norwegian meteorological institute precipitation and temperature series were extracted from the eurocordex runs for 115 catchments distributed across norway for a reference period 1971 2000 and a future period 2071 2100 data from the rcm grid cells covering each catchment were used to develop area averaged values weighted according to the proportion of the catchment area covered by individual grid cells for bias adjustment precipitation time series from the rcms were bias adjusted using two alternative techniques a empirical quantile mapping gudmundsson et al 2012 and b a distribution based mapping using a double gamma function yang et al 2010 these two particular techniques were selected as they can give different corrections for the highest precipitation quantiles empirical quantile mapping extrapolates values beyond the highest observed values using a tri cubic spline and is therefore sensitive to the highest values this can however also undermine the robustness of the correction double gamma correction employs separate gamma functions for values above and below the 95th percentile of the cumulative distribution and assumes that the extreme values follow a thgamma distribution in each of the two segments in practice the use of a theoretical distribution such as a gamma function leads to more robust estimates of the highest quantiles although there can be deviations from the highest observed values temperature time series were adjusted using a normal distribution as this has previously been shown to be suitable for temperature distributions piani et al 2010 the data were bias adjusted relative to observed area averaged values for each catchment derived from senorge gridded precipitation and temperature data available at a 1 1 km scale from the norwegian meteorological institute see discussion in lussana et al 2019 daily values were adjusted using corrections for individual months developed by applying a 3 month moving window centered on the month of interest see wong et al 2016 for further details corrections were developed from and applied to residual values after trend removal following the procedures recommended by hempel et al 2013 this approach is used to ensure that the climate change signal is not altered significantly by the bias adjustment process 3 2 2 hydrological modelling the bias adjusted time series were used as input to the hbv hydrological model sælthun 1996 previously calibrated using observed precipitation and temperature series for each of the 115 catchments the observed time series used in the calibration are the same as those used for the bias correction of climate data discussed in the previous section calibration was performed using pest optimization routines lawrence et al 2009 to produce 150 possible parameter sets for each catchment with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion of at least 0 50 the 25 best fit parameter sets were then selected for each catchment such that the nse was within 2 percentage points of the maximum for the catchment both the nse criterion and the volumetric bias were used as objective functions in the model calibration and all daily values were given equal weight i e no weighting of peak flow values was used simulations used a daily time step and the average validation nse value for all 115 catchments was 0 76 and ranged from 0 54 to 0 93 in general better model fits are achieved in catchments with seasonal flow regimes dominated by snowmelt i e østlandet and finnmark troms regions in fig 1 relative to those obtained in areas dominated by rainfall this difference in model performance in catchments with differing flood regimes appears to primarily reflect the higher variance in the streamflow series in rainfall dominated catchments as compared with the relatively smooth annual pattern of flow found in snowmelt dominated catchments the 25 best fit parameter sets selected from the model calibration and validation are used to assess some of the uncertainty introduced by the parameterization of the hbv hydrological model to the total ensemble considered in this study a full assessment of the uncertainty introduced by model parameterization would however require a significantly larger number of parameter sets e g lawrence and haddeland 2011 but is not the focus of the work presented here 3 3 flood frequency analysis methods previously published catchment based hydrological projections for future changes in flood frequency in norway e g lawrence and hisdal 2011 lawrence 2016 apply a 2 parameter gumbel distribution for estimating return levels for the 200 year flood in a reference and a future period the gumbel distribution is used primarily due to its relative robustness for extreme value series of limited length this ensures that small differences in subsequent analyses based on newer climate projections do not lead to unduly large changes in projected estimates changes in the tail of the distribution are however also of interest in climate change studies and such changes are better captured using an extreme value function which also accounts for the skewness of the distribution estimates for the projected changes in flood quantiles developed using a 2 parameter gumbel distribution and a 3 parameter gev distribution based on block maxima i e the annual maximum series are therefore compared in this study in addition a gp distribution is applied to the over threshold series representing independent high flow events this approach has the advantage of a potentially larger sample of events for fitting the distribution in that case a fixed threshold corresponding to the 98 5 percentile of the partial duration series is used to select events events were assumed to be independent if they were separated by at least 6 days a value which has previously been shown to be suitable for the 115 catchments considered here with the exception of two large catchments with an area 10 000 km2 and having a predominantly snowmelt flood regime this procedure gave on average 1 5 2 events per year for most of the catchments considered in order to compare the goodness of fit of the three alternative evds considered the anderson darling laio 2004 test has been used this test was implemented using the gnfit r package saeb 2018 that includes extensions of the anderson darling a d test originally developed for testing of normality to extreme value distributions the cramer von mises test was also applied but as this gave very similar results to the a d test those results are not reported here in principle both the reliability and robustness of the flood estimates based on the three evds could also be evaluated for the cases considered here this has not been undertaken as it is deemed unlikely that the results would differ from those previously reported i e that the 2 parameter gumbel distribution is more stable but slightly less reliable than the 3 parameter gev for record lengths of 30 years kobierska et al 2018 3 4 quantification of uncertainty in return level estimates the 10 climate projections table 2 the 2 bias correction procedures sec 3 2 1 and the 25 hbv parameter sets sec 3 2 2 yield 500 simulations for each of the two time periods considered 1971 2000 and 2071 2100 for each of the 115 catchments for each simulation the 10 100 200 and 1000 year return levels were estimated based on evds fitted with the l moments method implemented in r using the lmomco package asquith 2017 parametric bootstrapping following the procedure described in kuczera and franks 2006 was then used to quantify the 5 and 95 confidence intervals for each return level using 2500 resamples an example of the results for one ensemble member after bootstrapping is shown in fig 2 for the estimated return levels for the 200 year flood for the reference and future periods for the gumbel the gev and the gp distributions this example illustrates the large spread in the estimates for a given simulation period particularly for the gev and gp distributions and the significant overlap between the reference and future periods for those distributions to generate estimates for changes in flood levels between the two periods 100 random samples with replacement were drawn from the distributions for each period and used to estimate the percentage change between the two periods 3 5 ensemble modelling and variance decomposition an ensemble consisting of 50 000 estimates i e 500 ensemble members each with 100 samples for the percentage change in each of the flood quantiles considered was generated for each of the three extreme value functions for each of the 115 catchments the contributions of each of three factors differences between climate model data hydrological model parameterization and uncertainty in the extreme flood estimate to the total spread in the ensemble of results for a given catchment were analysed using variance decomposition see déqué et al 2007 or sunyer et al 2015 for full details the decomposition procedure uses an anova linear model for the ensemble variance and estimates the variance introduced by individual factors and the so called interaction terms between the factors the interaction terms arise when the variance introduced by two or more factors cannot be explained using a simple linear combination of the individual factors in order to produce an ensemble for the analysis of variance in which all components are equally represented bosshard et al 2013 the results for the hydrological parameters sets and for the flood frequency analysis were resampled using a uniform distribution on the 5 95 range to produce 20 subsamples for each component results for the 10 climate models with the 2 bias correction techniques were also combined to produce 20 samples representing climate data the variance decomposition was then performed on the resulting ensemble comprised of 60 members for each catchment in which the three components climate data hydrological model parameterisation and flood frequency analysis are equally represented and in which the decomposition is effectively performed on the ensemble range this is the only decomposition approach that can be justified given that the full distributions of climate data and hydrological parameterisation are unknown 4 results 4 1 projected changes in the flood magnitudes the median values of the 500 member ensemble of estimated changes in the 200 year flood magnitude are illustrated in fig 3 for each of the 115 catchments for the gumbel gev and gp distributions the estimated median change based on the 2 parameter gumbel distribution ranges from 48 to 99 and the spatial distribution of projected changes indicate a regional pattern of decreases or small increases i e 20 in northernmost norway finnmark in mid norway trøndelag and in inland regions of southern norway larger increases are projected for western norway nordland in northern norway and in some catchments in coastal regions in southern and eastern norway although a somewhat similar regional pattern can be seen in the results based on the gev and gp distributions estimated increases are generally larger in most regions and especially along the southwestern coast of norway it is only in the northernmost region i e finnmark that projected decreases or small increases continue to dominate the regional pattern when the gev and gp distributions are applied the results also show a high degree of correspondence between the results for the gev and gp distributions in that areas with higher estimates for the gev such as in coastal southwestern norway also indicate higher estimates for the gp distribution the projected percentage changes in the 200 year flood magnitude estimated using the three evds are shown as a function of the flood generating process fgp in fig 4 the figure confirms the general tendency for the gev and gp distributions to give slightly higher estimates for the estimated change seen in fig 3 both for catchments with projected increases and decreases the results also indicate that virtually all median ensemble estimates are positive for catchments with an fgp of 40 or higher it is only in catchments with flood regimes dominated by snowmelt under the current climate that decreases in the 200 year flood are projected by all three evds and in that case less than half of the catchments are projected to decrease fig 4 also indicates that there are larger differences between catchments with similar fgps when the fgp is 50 or less differences in the projected median changes given by the three distributions for each catchment are shown for the 10 200 and 1000 year return periods in fig 5 the differences are plotted relative to the projected median change for the catchment based on a gumbel distribution for each return period the mean difference of all the values for each case are shown as solid lines and the mean value for that case is given in text at the bottom of the diagram the 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution of the mean values are also shown for the 200 year and 1000 year return levels the values at the bottom of each diagram give the mean difference between each case and its significance level the results indicate that for a return level of 10 years there is on average no significant difference between the estimates based on the three different evds there is however a significance difference between the distribution of values for the 200 year and 1000 year return levels estimated by the evds with a shape parameter gev and gp and those estimated using a gumbel evd the evds with a shape parameter give on average higher estimates the figure also confirms that the gev and gp distribution give on average similar estimates in that there is only a small difference between the two and this is difference is not statistically significant to further compare the three evd distributions the anderson darling a d statistic was calculated for each case i e ensemble member for the fits to the series representing the reference and future periods and the p value indicating the significance level was determined for each case an average p value was then calculated based on the average of all cases for a given catchment for each of the 3 evds the results indicate that it is only for the gp distribution that one can reject the null hypothesis i e that the time series do not come for the distribution indicated at the 0 05 significance level in most catchments based on the average p value for that catchment for the case of the gev and gumbel distributions there were no catchments with average p values indicating that the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 0 05 level although the average p values based on the gev distribution tend to be slightly lower i e slightly better and closer to the 0 05 level than those based on the gumbel distribution 4 2 uncertainty in ensemble projections for changes in flood magnitudes the total ensemble variance decomposed into four components climate data flood frequency analysis hydrological model parameterization and interaction terms is shown in fig 6 a as an average value for all 115 catchments for three return periods 10 100 and 1000 year for each of the three evds the component climate models represents the variance introduced by the use of 10 different climate models and 2 different bias adjustment methods to process the climate data before it is used in hydrological modelling the component ffa i e flood frequency analysis is the ensemble variance derived from the fitting of a given evd the component hydro model represents the variance associated with the use of differing parameterisations of the hbv model for individual catchments the component interaction is the sum of several interaction terms identified in the variance decomposition including both interactions between two individual components e g climate models and ffa and between all components the results illustrated in fig 6a indicate that for the 10 year return period the three evds give a similar average total variance although the gumbel distribution has a slightly higher average value for the 100 year return level the total variance is 2 3 times larger for the gev and gp distributions in comparison with the gumbel distribution and for the 1000 year return level they are an order of magnitude larger the average total variance is however in all cases greater for the gev than the gp distribution the contribution of the four components to the total variance indicates that for the case of the gev and the gp distributions the contribution of the climate models and the flood frequency analysis is of a similar magnitude and much larger than the contribution of the hydrological model parameterization for all evds and return periods this is further illustrated in fig 6b which shows the fraction of the total variance contributed by the four ensemble components for the case of the gumbel distribution gmb climate data contributes on average approximately two thirds of the ensemble variance for all return periods this increases to over 70 for the gp distribution for the 10 year return period in general the contribution of the ffa component increases slightly with return period for all evds the largest change however is in the increase in the interaction terms for the 100 year and 1000 year return periods for the gev and gp distributions fig 6c illustrates the contributions of the individual terms comprising the lumped interaction term shown in fig 6b as a total rather than fractional variance the figure confirms that the interaction terms are negligible when the gumbel distribution is used relative to the two other evds for the case of the gev and gpd the climate model ffa term comprises over 70 of the portion of the variance due to the interaction of two or more factors for both the 100 year and the 1000 year return periods thus the results suggest that for the gev and gp distributions the relative contribution of ffa to the ensemble variance is indeed higher for these distributions at the higher quantiles if one assumes that the interaction between the climate model and ffa terms can be divided equally between the two components then fig 6b and c also indicate that the relative contribution of ffa to the ensemble variance is similar to that of climate models for the gev and gp distributions for the higher quantiles 4 3 changes in evd parameters in a future climate the projected changes illustrated in figs 3 and 4 suggest systematic changes in the evd parameters between the reference and future periods average changes in the three evd parameters location scale and shape are therefore shown for each evd in fig 7 as in figs 3 5 values are shown for the 115 catchments and in this case each point is an average of 50 000 parameter estimates for the catchment derived from 500 ensemble members each with 100 samples from the distribution of boot strapped parameter values the average parameter values are shown relative to the dominant fgp in the current climate in a particular catchment as in fig 4 changes in the location parameter correspond to a shift in the distribution e g to a higher or lower mean value and changes in the scale parameter correspond to an expansion or contraction of the distribution i e to a higher or lower gradient of values as a function of return period changes in the shape parameter represent a change in the skewness of the distribution i e in the heaviness in the tails of the distribution it should also be noted that although a fixed threshold representing the 98 5th quantile is used to set the location parameter for the gp distribution the value of the location parameter will nevertheless vary between periods as the cumulative distribution function of discharge varies the results shown in fig 7 indicate that in most catchments the location and scale parameters are expected to increase for all three evds with the exception of some catchments with lower values of fgp e g 55 or less representing catchments in which snowmelt plays a significant role in flood generation under the current climate for these snow dominated catchments the majority of catchments show a decrease in the location parameter and about half are associated with a decrease in the scale parameter the three evds indicate similar changes although the average change in the scale parameter is slightly larger for the gumbel distribution and it is slightly less for the gp distribution the results also indicate that the average shape parameter decreases in most catchments for both the gev and the gp distribution an exception however to this general decrease is seen for a number of catchments with fgps between 42 and 84 these are catchments with a mixed flood generation regime under the current climate and the increase is consistent with a likely transition to a more rainfall dominated flood regime in the future period the spatial distribution of the direction of change in the shape parameter is shown in fig 8 and indicates a high degree of spatial coherency among the catchments exhibiting an increase in the shape parameter between the reference and future periods most of these catchments are found in western norway vestlandet and in nordland and several of them correspond with the catchments exhibiting the highest percentage change in the 200 year flood shown in fig 3 5 discussion estimated changes in the 200 year flood based on the ensemble median indicate both increases and decreases fig 3 in the catchments considered the direction of change is related to the dominant flood generation process fig 4 in that only catchments with an fgp of 40 or less are associated with projected decreases simultaneously fig 4 also illustrates that the majority of snow dominated catchments exhibit small to large increases in the projected median value of the 200 year flood level the largest median increases are actually seen in catchments with fgps of 50 or less above this fgp value the results are less variable between individual catchments indicating a more consistent response to the effect of projected increases in precipitation the variable response of flood magnitudes in snow dominated catchments most likely reflects the competing effects of precipitation and temperature both of which are projected to increase during the winter season throughout norway hanssen bauer et al 2017 these increases can lead to an increase in winter snow storage and a larger albeit earlierspring snowmelt or to an increase in rain on snow events throughout the winter half year depending on the latitude and the elevation of the catchment such variable responses have also been reported for catchments in the alpine region of europe köplin et al 2014 and in the western region of north america musselman et al 2018 the three evds give similar projected increases for the 10 year flood magnitude but for the 200 and 1000 year return periods the evds with a shape parameter gev and gp give larger increases than the gumbel distribution fig 5 the mean difference between the distributions of results for evds with a shape parameter and those generated by the gumbel distribution is statistically significant at the at least 0 05 significance level for the two higher flood quantiles i e 200 and 1000 year return periods this is not entirely surprising and suggests that distributions that also model the skewness of the extreme values indicate larger changes in the most extreme flood levels the gev and gp evds give similar but not identical estimates for the higher return periods although they represent analyses on somewhat different time series annual maxima vs partial duration series this result concurs with a recent study comparing the use of a gev vs a gp distribution to assess future changes in the 100 year flood for catchments in the uk collet et al 2017 this suggests that despite the potential problems of stability associated with fitting an evd with a shape parameter to a time series of limited length renard et al 2013 kobierska et al 2018 the average values obtained from the ensemble analyses used here give consistent results for the evds with a shape parameter the goodness of fit statistic indicates however that it is only in the case of the gp that the null hypothesis can be rejected for most catchments that the gp distribution has much lower p values than the gev is due at least in part to the larger number of observations available for each time period i e typically 50 60 as compared with the 30 annual maximum values used for fitting the gev and gumbel distributions in addition the threshold value i e that determines the location parameter is fixed to correspond to the 98 5 level of the cumulative distribution of daily runoff values leading to only 2 parameters scale and location fitted from the partial duration series although the selection of this value is somewhat arbitrary in that thresholds should be tailored to each individual partial duration series coles 2001 the similarity in the results for the gev and gp evds shown in fig 5 support the use of this approach at least for the case when average ensemble values rather than individual cases are of interest the analysis of the ensemble variance fig 6 indicates that flood frequency analysis introduces a high degree of uncertainty into the range of estimated changes particularly for the highest flood quantiles for the case of the gev and gp distributions the total variance is for example 8 9 times larger for the 1000 year flood estimated with a gev distribution relative to a gumbel distribution fig 6a at first glance it might be concluded that the use of a gumbel distribution is preferable as it does not entail the fitting of a shape parameter and the additional uncertainty introduced by this estimation however given that the a d statistic suggests a better fit for the evds with a shape parameter it is more likely that for the higher flood quantiles the much larger spread in the ensemble of estimates is a realistic depiction of the high degree of uncertainty associated with projections for changes in these flood quantiles it is also noteworthy that for the case of the 10 year flood the gp distribution gives on average the lowest total variance of all 3 evds thus supporting the use of this distribution for the full range of flood quantiles the fractional contribution of ffa to the total ensemble variance is higher for the gev and gp distributions and is on average equal to the contribution from the differences between climate models the role of hydrological model parameterisation is clearly secondary to these other factors and in most cases the uncertainty introduced by this factor is on average for all catchments almost an order of magnitude less than the combined effects of climate models and flood frequency analyses it should be emphasised however that the decomposition analysis considers estimates for the flood frequency analysis based on an exhaustive parametric bootstrapping procedure and a resampling to arrive at 20 subsamples representing the full range of estimates for the case of the climate models the full distribution of models is unknown and the 10 gcm rcm combinations considered are not necessarily independent models i e they represent in many cases the same gcm run with a different rcm table 2 similarly a complete investigation of the uncertainty introduced by hydrological model parameterisation would need to include a much larger sample of parameter sets if it were possible to identify the range of estimates from a complete distribution of climate models and hydrological model parameterisations then these two factors would presumably make a larger overall contribution to the ensemble range than is shown here in addition only one hydrological model has been considered and previous studies indicate that hydrological model structure is also a considerable source of uncertainty in hydrological projections for extreme flows poulin et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 however the ensemble analysed here represents that which is available in practise for climate change adaptation in norway e g lawrence 2016 hanssen bauer et al 2017 given this ensemble it can be concluded from fig 6 that statistical flood frequency analysis makes a considerable contribution to the total ensemble variance if uncertainty associated with fitting an evd is taken into account this result agrees with the findings of collet et al 2017 for estimates of the 100 year flood in great britain changes in the average evd location parameter reflecting changes in the mean discharge level in the flood series between the reference and future periods fig 7 have a high degree of correspondence with projected changes in the 200 year flood fig 4 an exception are the several snow dominated catchments which show large increases in the 200 year flood level but apparently have decreases or only small increases in the location parameter it appears that in these catchments the increase in flood level is associated with an increased value of the scale parameter such that flood levels increase as a function of return period although the mean flood discharge level is actually lower in the future period it is also the change in the scale parameter that varies most between evds and between catchments the projected changes in this parameter are on average largest for the gumbel distribution and this is most likely due to the lack of a shape parameter i e a higher gradient is required to accommodate changes in the tail of the distribution that otherwise would be described by the shape parameter most catchments show a decrease in the shape parameter and this is initially somewhat surprising particularly given the results shown in fig 5 which indicate larger increases for the gp and gev distributions for the higher return periods one might assume for example that the larger increases in the estimated changes at the higher return periods reflect increases in the shape parameter fig 7 however indicates that this may only be the case in a subset of catchments i e several catchments with a mixed snow regime in the current climate an increase in rainfall dominated events in this catchments may well contribute to an increase in the positive skewness of the distribution i e reflecting an increase in the probability of the most extreme events catchments with a decrease in the shape parameter under a future climate on the other hand will most likely have an increase in the events that are extreme in today s climate but have lower return intervals under a future climate such that resulting distribution is actually less skewed although the average flood levels are higher similar patterns are seen in the results for changes in flood regimes associated with sea level rise presented by buchanan et al 2018 that the catchments which exhibit a positive increase in the shape parameter are only found in two well defined geographic areas fig 8 rather than in all catchments with mixed flood regimes suggests possible links to changes in climatological drivers this is beyond the scope of the current study but such linkages between changes in climatic variables flood generating processes and the flood quantiles that are affected deserve investigation in further work an additional factor that can influence the changes in the evd parameters but is beyond the scope of the work presented here is the method used for fitting the extreme value function in this work we have applied the l moments methods although other methods such as maximum likelihood estimation or bayesian estimation could be used and may lead to somewhat different conclusions particularly regarding changes in the scale vs the shape parameter the results presented in this study indicate that evds with a shape parameter project somewhat larger increases in higher flood quantiles particularly for the 1000 year flood than does the 2 parameter gumbel distribution in practice adaptation to likely future changes flood hazard in norway is based on projections developed using a 2 parameter gumbel distribution following these projections a climate change allowance of 0 20 or 40 is used lawrence 2016 depending on local conditions i e types of catchments in which flood levels are projected to decrease vs expected to have moderate or large increases for the case of the 200 year flood level the average difference between the gumbel and gev gp distributions is 5 8 this is not a large difference but does suggest that in some cases a higher category e g 40 instead of 20 might be chosen for an individual catchment if the gev or gp distribution were used to develop the estimates the results also indicate that the use of 40 as the highest standard allowance is not excessively conservative in that many catchments actually have a higher projected increase for all three evds for the case of the 1000 year flood level the differences between the gumbel and gev gp distributions is much larger 13 15 in addition there is a high degree of uncertainty in these estimates due in part to the fitting of the shape parameter to a data series of limited length the comparison of the gev and gp distributions point to a preference for the gp distribution due to a better fit and a lower ensemble uncertainty 6 conclusions and recommendations for further work this study has analysed projections for changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate using a large ensemble of hydrological simulations representing differing gcm rcm combinations bias correction methods hydrological model parameterisations and evds for estimating flood return levels consistent with earlier work the median ensemble values indicate an increase in flood hazard under a future climate in all catchments having rainfall dominated or mixed flood regimes under the current climate snowmelt dominated catchments show a wider range of responses with some catchments projected to have a decrease in flood magnitudes and others to have an increase the results also indicate that uncertainty introduced by flood frequency analyses in these estimates is considerable and is of the same magnitude as differences between gcm rcm combinations this is a source of uncertainty that has largely been neglected in previous analyses of ensemble uncertainty there are also differences in estimated changes as a function of the extreme value distribution used for the statistical flood estimation in addition to the uncertainty underlying estimates based on a given distribution in particular the application of evds with a shape parameter gev and gp generally leads to larger projected increases in the 200 and 1000 year flood in comparison with the 2 parameter gumbel distribution there are several relevant sources of uncertainty that have not been considered in this study but which are suitable for further work the analysis presented here for example has assumed stationarity during each of the 30 year time slices representing the current vs the future period although this is consistent with previous work and can be partly justified due to the short period considered a depiction of how flood probabilities change as a continuous function over time would be useful both in climate change adaptation planning and in enhancing our understanding of how flood processes respond to changes in climatological variables non stationary flood frequency methods however require the fitting of additional parameters to account for changes in the evd parameters over time the comparison of average evd parameter values between the two time slices presented here indicate both clear patterns e g changes in the location parameter as related to projected changes in flooding and more complex issues e g changes in the shape parameter as a function of changes in flood generation processes applications of non stationary methods should therefore seek to interrogate the physical factors behind this complexity e g condon et al 2015 rather than simply fitting a non stationary evd with additional parameters in addition this study has evaluated sources of ensemble uncertainty in hydrological projections for 115 gauged catchments where it is possible to calibrate a hydrological model in most cases however flood estimates based on a calibrated hydrological model are not available for the sites where they are needed in practical applications as these sites often represent ungauged catchments in current practice in norway climate change allowances are selected for ungauged catchments based on a qualitative assessment and comparison of the hydrological and climatological characteristics of the catchment of interest relative to published results for the 115 catchments this informal transfer of information between gauged and ungauged catchment also introduces an element of subjectivity and inherent uncertainty methods for regionalising catchment based hydrological projections for likely changes in flood levels and flood regimes to ungauged catchments are therefore also required if one is to improve the reliability of estimates available for climate change adaptation credit authorship contribution statement deborah lawrence conceptualization methodology software

to fully rainfall driven study focus bias corrected euro cordex rcm output for rcp 8 5 is used to generate an ensemble of 500 hydrological simulations for assessing changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate flood estimates are based on three extreme value distributions evds gumbel generalised extreme value and generalised pareto with confidence intervals calculated using parametric bootstrapping and uncertainty introduced into the ensemble by the flood estimation is evaluated using variance decomposition changes in evd parameters under future conditions are also assessed new hydrologic insight for the region there are large differences in projected changes between catchments with median estimates ranging from 48 to 99 for the 200 year flood flood magnitudes in all

generally increase in catchments with increasing flood magnitudes and some catchments with mixed flood regimes also exhibit increases in the shape parameter under future conditions keywords climate change impacts nordic extreme value analysis ensemble uncertainty hbv hydrological model 1 introduction there is considerable interest in and a pressing need for assessments of likely changes in extreme flows under a future climate due to the potential impact of extreme flooding on critical infrastructure and on society e g hirabayashi et al 2013 winsemius et al 2016 as both housing and structures such as flood protection measures and hydropower related dams and reservoirs can have expected lifetimes of up to 100 years and the consequences of inundation or failure can be catastrophic estimates for high flows with long return periods are required for design purposes and for land use planning this task is a significant challenge even under the current climate as extrapolation beyond the length of a local streamflow record is almost always required in addition the extreme value analyses underlying this extrapolation entail fairly stringent assumptions as to the statistical properties of the observed data series i e that extreme events are independent identically distributed and stationary that are often not satisfied in practise rossi et al 1984 franks and kuczera 2002 read and vogel 2015 for estimates under a future climate observed time series are not available and estimates are often generated from simulated hydrological data derived from climate projections this leads to an even higher degree of uncertainty in flood estimates as several additional factors come into play including the reliability of downscaled climate projections maraun et al 2010 the need for and suitability of local bias adjustment of input climate data e g leander et al 2008 teutschbein et al 2011 the suitability of the hydrological model e g poulin et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 krysanova et al 2018 and its parameterisation e g vormoor et al 2018 dakhlaoui et al 2019 for modelling streamflows under changing conditions and the most likely greenhouse gas concentration pathway the general aim of the study presented here is therefore to investigate the uncertainty introduced by standard methods for statistical flood frequency estimation when applied to an ensemble of hydrological projections a comparison is made between estimates based on extreme value distributions with and without a shape parameter for describing the skewness of the distribution the study also presents projections for likely changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate in a region in which both snowmelt and rainfall contribute significantly to extreme high flows and in which the relative contributions of these factors are expected to change in a warmer climate a range of previous studies have analysed likely future changes in flooding using ensembles of hydrological simulations driven by precipitation and temperature time series from climate model outputs at catchment regional and global scales e g hirabayashi et al 2013 köplin et al 2014 vormoor et al 2015 alfieri et al 2015 arheimer and lindström 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 osuch et al 2016 meresa and romanowicz 2017 thober et al 2018 and for earlier examples see review in madsen et al 2014 three issues considered or arising from these published studies are particularly relevant for the work presented here 1 expected changes in regions where melt processes contribute to high flows 2 the target variables used to assess changes in high flows and methods for estimating these and 3 the components of the modelling chain considered in the ensemble analysis and these aspects are reviewed in the following paragraphs regions and catchments in which snowmelt clearly dominates flood generation in today s climate can in many cases expect both a decrease in flood magnitudes and an earlier spring flood e g veijalainen et al 2010 poulin et al 2011 an earlier spring flood is in fact one of the few statistically significant changes in flood regimes that already is observed in the present climate e g wilson et al 2010 arheimer and lindström 2015 vormoor et al 2016 blöschl et al 2017 expected future patterns of change are however more complex for catchments in which both snowmelt and rainfall contribute to flood generation as the competing trends of a decreasing winter snowpack vs increases in precipitation that falls as rain become important and can in some cases lead to a change in flood seasonality and in flood generating processes köplin et al 2014 vormoor et al 2015 projected changes in flood magnitudes and even the sign of the projected change can vary significantly with local factors such as catchment size and median elevation particularly in regions with complex topography e g musselman et al 2018 there is therefore little direct correspondence between changes in precipitation and in flood magnitudes sharma et al 2018 and in some cases projected percentage changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate are higher than the expected increases in precipitation extremes previous studies have used a variety of measures to assess changes in high flows typically applying the measure to two or more time slices e g 30 year periods representing simulations for present and future conditions and comparing the results to estimate the degree of change e g as a change factor or percentage change time slices of 30 years or less rather than the full length of the simulated series e g 1950 2100 are often used to avoid problems of non stationarity madsen et al 2014 widely applied indices include both quantities that can be estimated without extrapolation such as the mean annual flood e g lawrence and haddeland 2011 köplin et al 2014 thober et al 2018 average magnitude or number of over threshold values e g cloke et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 hundecha et al 2016 vormoor et al 2016 or empirical return levels based on the time slice considered e g steele dunne et al 2008 hundecha et al 2016 as well as estimates based on a fitted extreme value distribution evd for flood magnitudes of a given return period although extrapolation with an evd invariably leads to a more uncertain estimate knowledge of likely changes in these higher flood quantiles are often required in practise for climate change adaptation several earlier studies of climate change impacts on flooding e g dankers and feyen 2008 veijalainen et al 2010 lawrence and hisdal 2011 have applied a two parameter gumbel distribution to the simulated annual maximum series and in some cases have justified its use relative to a 3 parameter gev generalised extreme value distribution based on the likelihood ratio e g dankers and feyen 2008 the use of a gev distribution is more common in recent studies e g hattermann et al 2011 condon et al 2015 meresa and romanowicz 2017 soriano et al 2019 although the gumbel distribution is still frequently used e g hirabayashi et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 the choice of a particular extreme value distribution relative to other alternatives is generally not discussed in these studies the selection of the best methods for estimation of flood quantiles using extreme value analyses is a well established and advanced research topic and covers a range of issues including appropriate statistics for evaluating reliability and stability or robustness e g renard et al 2013 kochanek et al 2014 and goodness of fit e g laio 2004 as well as the most suitable methods for fitting the extreme value distributions some of these issues have recently been investigated for 526 norwegian catchments for local cf regional analyses using block maximum methods applied to observed data kobierska et al 2018 consistent with other studies the results indicate that the 3 parameter gev gives slightly more reliable but less stable estimates than the 2 parameter gumbel distribution for 30 year data records the results also favour the use of l moments or bayesian methods for fitting the evd for goodness of fit both the anderson darling test and the cramer von mises test are preferred for testing extreme value distributions laio 2004 relative to traditional tests such as the kolmogorov smirnov test due to the weighting they place on higher quantiles alternatives to the block maxima approach such as the fitting of over threshold values to a generalised pareto gp distribution are less commonly used in studies of climate change impacts on flooding although they also have been applied e g prudhomme et al 2003 2013 collet et al 2017 a recent study of flooding buchanan et al 2018 due to sea level rise has also investigated this approach and demonstrates its advantages relative to the fitting of a gumbel distribution for streamflow flooding a clear advantage of a peak over threshold series over an annual maximum series is that one potentially has a larger sample size and that the sample represents all of the highest flows during a given period including subannual maxima madsen et al 1997 lang et al 1999 this is relevant for norwegian catchments as many catchments exhibit mixed flood regimes including both snowmelt generated floods during spring and early summer and rainfall generated floods during the autumn under the current climate vormoor et al 2016 in some cases the largest observed floods have occurred in response to rainfall in the autumn although the annual maximum series is dominated by snowmelt floods during the spring and early summer roald 2013 as the balance between various types of flood generating processes can change gradually under a warming climate the use of a method that is not limited to sampling one event per year is more likely to detect insipient trends a principal drawback of peak over threshold evds is that a suitable threshold must be used to select the events comprising the series and ensuring that they in fact represent an extreme value series this is traditionally done using for example mean residual life plots see discussion in coles 2001 this approach is however unfeasible for a large ensemble of simulations derived from climate data such as is considered here an alternative is to use an assumed threshold that is high enough to ensure that the sampled events are in fact extreme values e g madsen et al 1997 such that the peak over threshold approach can be applied to a large number of data series without the need for an analysis of each individual data series different climate models downscaling methods and hydrological modelling techniques can produce widely varying estimates and it is not possible to select the combination of models and approaches that give the most reliable prognoses for extreme flows under unknown conditions towards the end of the 21st century a popular remedy for this is to use a so called ensemble method in which combinations of several models and methods are applied to generate multiple realizations of current and future conditions although the resulting ensembles of opportunity von storch and zwiers 2013 lack the statistical rigor of classic ensemble methods in which for example multiple realisations are generated based on perturbed initial conditions they are nevertheless useful for summarizing a range of possible future outcomes based on available methods and models numerous studies have investigated the uncertainty in such ensemble estimates corresponding in most cases to the ensemble range or variance due to various ensemble components including climate models post processing methods and hydrological models and their parameterisations the various analyses indicate that although uncertainty from differences between climate models makes a large contribution to the ensemble spread other factors such as statistical post processing methods hundecha et al 2016 osuch et al 2016 hydrological model structure poulin et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 steinschneider et al 2015 and hydrological model parameterization lawrence and haddeland 2011 can also make significant contributions in some cases uncertainty introduced by the methods used to estimate extreme flood quantiles has received very little attention in previous work exceptions to this are the recent study by meresa and romanowicz 2017 in which the uncertainty introduced by flood frequency estimation based on a gev distribution in estimates for future changes in both high flows and low flows is evaluated for a single catchment in poland they conclude that the flood frequency analysis contributes a considerable degree of uncertainty in the estimation of low flows but not in high flows in that catchment in contrast with this finding a recent study by collet et al 2017 found that the use of a gp or gev distribution represents 40 60 of the total ensemble uncertainty relative to climate models in estimates for changes in the 100 year flood in great britain to build on previous findings the objectives of this study are therefore to compare estimates for future changes in hydrological flooding in norway based on the application of 2 parameter gumbel vs 3 parameter gev and gp extreme value distributions to a large ensemble of simulations in particular the study considers the following research questions 1 do evds with a shape parameter gev and gp give significantly different estimates for projected changes in higher flood quantiles 2 do evds with a shape parameter give a better fit to the extreme value series 3 what is the average contribution of flood frequency estimation to the range of ensemble estimates for changes in higher flood quantiles 4 how do the average evd parameters change under a future climate and can this change be related to flood generating processes the study also presents results for projected changes in four flood quantiles with 10 100 200 and 1000 year return periods for 115 catchments representing a range of flood generation regimes from fully pluvial to predominantly nival the 200 year flood is used for flood hazard mapping in norway in conjunction with land use planning and the 1000 year flood is required for design flood analysis for dam safety investigations estimates for projected changes in these flood quantiles are therefore used in practice for work with climate change adaptation 2 study area catchment based hydrological modelling is applied in this study to develop hydrological projections for 115 near natural catchments distributed across norway all without significant streamflow regulation affecting high flows fleig et al 2013 the catchments represent a range of climate and hydrological regimes topographic conditions and landscape types and can be grouped into six regions for summarising and presenting results fig 1 and table 1 the boundaries between the six regions are based primarily on established runoff regions e g pettersson 2013 with a further grouping or subdivision of some regions to give a closer correspondence with administrative units i e county boundaries in all cases however the regions used here are based on catchment divides as boundaries between regions rather than county boundaries the adjustments to the runoff regions have been made to facilitate the presentation of summary results for regions that can be further used in planning related to climate change adaptation e g hanssen bauer et al 2017 the mean annual temperature for the whole of norway during the reference period used in this study 1971 2000 was 1 3 c hanssen bauer et al 2015 2017 there are however large regional variations with annual averages of over 6 c in coastal regions of vestlandet sørlandet and østlandet and as low as 2 8 c in finnmark and 4 c in the high mountain region of southern norway located near the boundary between vestlandet and østlandet in fig 1 annual precipitation also shows significant spatial variation with the driest regions in the inland zones of østlandet and finnmark receiving as little as 300 mm yr and the wettest regions in vestlandet and nordland over 4000 mm yr spatial patterns of annual runoff largely reflect regional temperature and precipitation patterns the average annual runoff in the 115 catchments used in this study together with the range of values for the catchments are given for each region in table 1 catchments with the highest annual runoff are found in vestlandet avg 2309 mm yr and in nordland avg 1890 mm yr and the lowest annual runoff is associated with catchments in finnmark avg 773 mm yr and østlandet avg 687 mm yr there is however considerable local variation in each of these regions the seasonal pattern of discharge leading to flooding is strongly controlled by both temperature and precipitation during the winter period as well as the catchment median elevation and hypsometry as they determine the potential for snow accumulation and melting the number of days during the winter half year 1st october 31st march with a temperature over 0 c the precipitation during the winter half year and the catchment median elevation and steepness are given as average values and ranges for each region in table 1 in finnmark troms and in inland østlandet winter conditions are favourable for significant snow storage and snow accumulation is only limited by relatively low precipitation values this leads to a seasonal pattern of runoff with high flows during the late spring to summer months and low flows during the winter in contrast vestlandet and sørlandet and to some extent coastal regions of nordland trøndelag and østlandet have relatively warmer winters with abundant precipitation these areas nevertheless can also experience colder periods with snow accumulation in addition catchments in some of these areas can be quite steep with snow storage and even glaciation in the upper reaches these factors produce a general pattern of high flows during the autumn and winter months with the heaviest precipitation although peak melt periods can also lead to elevated discharge values during spring and summer months and during transient periods of snow accumulation and melting during autumn and winter climate change projections for norway hanssen bauer et al 2015 2017 indicate changes in both temperature and precipitation under a future climate for the whole of norway temperature increases of 1 7 3 7 c under rcp 4 5 moderate greenhouse gas concentration pathway and 3 4 6 0 c under rcp 8 5 high concentration pathway are expected by 2071 2100 relative to a 1971 2000 reference period projected changes in annual precipitation are between 3 and 14 rcp 4 5 and 7 and 23 rcp 8 5 there are nevertheless large variations between regions and between seasons the largest absolute increases in mm in precipitation are expected to occur during the autumn and winter seasons in the regions vestlandet trøndelag and nordland see fig 1 while the largest relative increases in are expected during the spring and winter periods in østlandet and finnmark in addition the number of days with heavy precipitation is expected to increase over the entire country during all seasons in some cases the average number of days with heavy precipitation will be more than double by the end of the 21st century under rcp 8 5 the projected changes in temperature and precipitation regimes are expected to lead to changes in seasonal runoff that also vary significantly between regions due to a decrease in snow storage and an increase in precipitation that falls as rain in the winter under a future climate winter runoff is projected to increase in all regions under rcp 8 5 with the largest relative increases in nordland and finnmark and in inland and mountainous regions in the mid and southern norway hanssen bauer et al 2015 summer runoff is projected to decrease considerably in all regions as a result of increased evapotranspiration and an earlier snowmelt season due to warmer temperatures 3 data and methods 3 1 classification of flood regimes previous analyses of observed and projected future high flows in norway indicate that the dominant flood generation process fgp in a given catchment exerts a strong control on the direction and magnitude of changes vormoor et al 2015 2016 in this study we therefore use the simple categorisation of fgps proposed by vormoor et al 2015 2016 to describe the contribution of precipitation vs snowmelt to the generation of high flows in individual catchments the fgp represents the percentage of the independent events in the over threshold series based on a threshold corresponding to the 98 5th percentile of the flow duration curve comprised predominantly of rainfall see vormoor et al 2016 for further details and is quantified here as a percentage between 0 and 100 although more detailed classifications could be considered e g merz and blöschl 2003 we use the simple 3 member classification proposed by vormoor to broadly distinguish flood regimes and to characterise the spatial pattern of flood generation using this classification the categories snow dominated vs mixed vs rainfall dominated flood regimes shown in fig 1 highlight snowmelt as the main fgp in the inland regions of southern norway and in finnmark troms and rainfall as the dominant driver of high flows in vestlandet and sørlandet and in coastal regions of østlandet trøndelag and nordland mixed regimes are prominent in transitional areas between the two other regimes although actual changes in these flood regimes under a future climate are not analysed in this study the catchment fgp under the current climate is used to identify the types of catchments that are most susceptible to increases vs decreases in flood levels under changing climatic conditions 3 2 ensemble of hydrological projections 3 2 1 climate model data and bias adjustment the hydrological simulations analysed in this study are driven by data from 10 rcm regional climate model runs generated by the eurocordex initiative jacob et al 2014 for rcp 8 5 using the eur 11 grid with a spatial resolution of approximately 12 km table 2 rcp 8 5 is used here because the current national guidance for adaptation related to climate change in norway recommends that estimates for the likely effects of global warming are based on concentration pathways representing a high level of emissions miljøverndepartement 2012 the selection of the gcm rcm combinations shown in table 2 represents eurocordex runs available at the time of the most recent norwegian climate assessment report e g summarized in hanssen bauer et al 2015 2017 which were deemed suitable for analyses in the nordic region by the norwegian meteorological institute precipitation and temperature series were extracted from the eurocordex runs for 115 catchments distributed across norway for a reference period 1971 2000 and a future period 2071 2100 data from the rcm grid cells covering each catchment were used to develop area averaged values weighted according to the proportion of the catchment area covered by individual grid cells for bias adjustment precipitation time series from the rcms were bias adjusted using two alternative techniques a empirical quantile mapping gudmundsson et al 2012 and b a distribution based mapping using a double gamma function yang et al 2010 these two particular techniques were selected as they can give different corrections for the highest precipitation quantiles empirical quantile mapping extrapolates values beyond the highest observed values using a tri cubic spline and is therefore sensitive to the highest values this can however also undermine the robustness of the correction double gamma correction employs separate gamma functions for values above and below the 95th percentile of the cumulative distribution and assumes that the extreme values follow a thgamma distribution in each of the two segments in practice the use of a theoretical distribution such as a gamma function leads to more robust estimates of the highest quantiles although there can be deviations from the highest observed values temperature time series were adjusted using a normal distribution as this has previously been shown to be suitable for temperature distributions piani et al 2010 the data were bias adjusted relative to observed area averaged values for each catchment derived from senorge gridded precipitation and temperature data available at a 1 1 km scale from the norwegian meteorological institute see discussion in lussana et al 2019 daily values were adjusted using corrections for individual months developed by applying a 3 month moving window centered on the month of interest see wong et al 2016 for further details corrections were developed from and applied to residual values after trend removal following the procedures recommended by hempel et al 2013 this approach is used to ensure that the climate change signal is not altered significantly by the bias adjustment process 3 2 2 hydrological modelling the bias adjusted time series were used as input to the hbv hydrological model sælthun 1996 previously calibrated using observed precipitation and temperature series for each of the 115 catchments the observed time series used in the calibration are the same as those used for the bias correction of climate data discussed in the previous section calibration was performed using pest optimization routines lawrence et al 2009 to produce 150 possible parameter sets for each catchment with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion of at least 0 50 the 25 best fit parameter sets were then selected for each catchment such that the nse was within 2 percentage points of the maximum for the catchment both the nse criterion and the volumetric bias were used as objective functions in the model calibration and all daily values were given equal weight i e no weighting of peak flow values was used simulations used a daily time step and the average validation nse value for all 115 catchments was 0 76 and ranged from 0 54 to 0 93 in general better model fits are achieved in catchments with seasonal flow regimes dominated by snowmelt i e østlandet and finnmark troms regions in fig 1 relative to those obtained in areas dominated by rainfall this difference in model performance in catchments with differing flood regimes appears to primarily reflect the higher variance in the streamflow series in rainfall dominated catchments as compared with the relatively smooth annual pattern of flow found in snowmelt dominated catchments the 25 best fit parameter sets selected from the model calibration and validation are used to assess some of the uncertainty introduced by the parameterization of the hbv hydrological model to the total ensemble considered in this study a full assessment of the uncertainty introduced by model parameterization would however require a significantly larger number of parameter sets e g lawrence and haddeland 2011 but is not the focus of the work presented here 3 3 flood frequency analysis methods previously published catchment based hydrological projections for future changes in flood frequency in norway e g lawrence and hisdal 2011 lawrence 2016 apply a 2 parameter gumbel distribution for estimating return levels for the 200 year flood in a reference and a future period the gumbel distribution is used primarily due to its relative robustness for extreme value series of limited length this ensures that small differences in subsequent analyses based on newer climate projections do not lead to unduly large changes in projected estimates changes in the tail of the distribution are however also of interest in climate change studies and such changes are better captured using an extreme value function which also accounts for the skewness of the distribution estimates for the projected changes in flood quantiles developed using a 2 parameter gumbel distribution and a 3 parameter gev distribution based on block maxima i e the annual maximum series are therefore compared in this study in addition a gp distribution is applied to the over threshold series representing independent high flow events this approach has the advantage of a potentially larger sample of events for fitting the distribution in that case a fixed threshold corresponding to the 98 5 percentile of the partial duration series is used to select events events were assumed to be independent if they were separated by at least 6 days a value which has previously been shown to be suitable for the 115 catchments considered here with the exception of two large catchments with an area 10 000 km2 and having a predominantly snowmelt flood regime this procedure gave on average 1 5 2 events per year for most of the catchments considered in order to compare the goodness of fit of the three alternative evds considered the anderson darling laio 2004 test has been used this test was implemented using the gnfit r package saeb 2018 that includes extensions of the anderson darling a d test originally developed for testing of normality to extreme value distributions the cramer von mises test was also applied but as this gave very similar results to the a d test those results are not reported here in principle both the reliability and robustness of the flood estimates based on the three evds could also be evaluated for the cases considered here this has not been undertaken as it is deemed unlikely that the results would differ from those previously reported i e that the 2 parameter gumbel distribution is more stable but slightly less reliable than the 3 parameter gev for record lengths of 30 years kobierska et al 2018 3 4 quantification of uncertainty in return level estimates the 10 climate projections table 2 the 2 bias correction procedures sec 3 2 1 and the 25 hbv parameter sets sec 3 2 2 yield 500 simulations for each of the two time periods considered 1971 2000 and 2071 2100 for each of the 115 catchments for each simulation the 10 100 200 and 1000 year return levels were estimated based on evds fitted with the l moments method implemented in r using the lmomco package asquith 2017 parametric bootstrapping following the procedure described in kuczera and franks 2006 was then used to quantify the 5 and 95 confidence intervals for each return level using 2500 resamples an example of the results for one ensemble member after bootstrapping is shown in fig 2 for the estimated return levels for the 200 year flood for the reference and future periods for the gumbel the gev and the gp distributions this example illustrates the large spread in the estimates for a given simulation period particularly for the gev and gp distributions and the significant overlap between the reference and future periods for those distributions to generate estimates for changes in flood levels between the two periods 100 random samples with replacement were drawn from the distributions for each period and used to estimate the percentage change between the two periods 3 5 ensemble modelling and variance decomposition an ensemble consisting of 50 000 estimates i e 500 ensemble members each with 100 samples for the percentage change in each of the flood quantiles considered was generated for each of the three extreme value functions for each of the 115 catchments the contributions of each of three factors differences between climate model data hydrological model parameterization and uncertainty in the extreme flood estimate to the total spread in the ensemble of results for a given catchment were analysed using variance decomposition see déqué et al 2007 or sunyer et al 2015 for full details the decomposition procedure uses an anova linear model for the ensemble variance and estimates the variance introduced by individual factors and the so called interaction terms between the factors the interaction terms arise when the variance introduced by two or more factors cannot be explained using a simple linear combination of the individual factors in order to produce an ensemble for the analysis of variance in which all components are equally represented bosshard et al 2013 the results for the hydrological parameters sets and for the flood frequency analysis were resampled using a uniform distribution on the 5 95 range to produce 20 subsamples for each component results for the 10 climate models with the 2 bias correction techniques were also combined to produce 20 samples representing climate data the variance decomposition was then performed on the resulting ensemble comprised of 60 members for each catchment in which the three components climate data hydrological model parameterisation and flood frequency analysis are equally represented and in which the decomposition is effectively performed on the ensemble range this is the only decomposition approach that can be justified given that the full distributions of climate data and hydrological parameterisation are unknown 4 results 4 1 projected changes in the flood magnitudes the median values of the 500 member ensemble of estimated changes in the 200 year flood magnitude are illustrated in fig 3 for each of the 115 catchments for the gumbel gev and gp distributions the estimated median change based on the 2 parameter gumbel distribution ranges from 48 to 99 and the spatial distribution of projected changes indicate a regional pattern of decreases or small increases i e 20 in northernmost norway finnmark in mid norway trøndelag and in inland regions of southern norway larger increases are projected for western norway nordland in northern norway and in some catchments in coastal regions in southern and eastern norway although a somewhat similar regional pattern can be seen in the results based on the gev and gp distributions estimated increases are generally larger in most regions and especially along the southwestern coast of norway it is only in the northernmost region i e finnmark that projected decreases or small increases continue to dominate the regional pattern when the gev and gp distributions are applied the results also show a high degree of correspondence between the results for the gev and gp distributions in that areas with higher estimates for the gev such as in coastal southwestern norway also indicate higher estimates for the gp distribution the projected percentage changes in the 200 year flood magnitude estimated using the three evds are shown as a function of the flood generating process fgp in fig 4 the figure confirms the general tendency for the gev and gp distributions to give slightly higher estimates for the estimated change seen in fig 3 both for catchments with projected increases and decreases the results also indicate that virtually all median ensemble estimates are positive for catchments with an fgp of 40 or higher it is only in catchments with flood regimes dominated by snowmelt under the current climate that decreases in the 200 year flood are projected by all three evds and in that case less than half of the catchments are projected to decrease fig 4 also indicates that there are larger differences between catchments with similar fgps when the fgp is 50 or less differences in the projected median changes given by the three distributions for each catchment are shown for the 10 200 and 1000 year return periods in fig 5 the differences are plotted relative to the projected median change for the catchment based on a gumbel distribution for each return period the mean difference of all the values for each case are shown as solid lines and the mean value for that case is given in text at the bottom of the diagram the 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution of the mean values are also shown for the 200 year and 1000 year return levels the values at the bottom of each diagram give the mean difference between each case and its significance level the results indicate that for a return level of 10 years there is on average no significant difference between the estimates based on the three different evds there is however a significance difference between the distribution of values for the 200 year and 1000 year return levels estimated by the evds with a shape parameter gev and gp and those estimated using a gumbel evd the evds with a shape parameter give on average higher estimates the figure also confirms that the gev and gp distribution give on average similar estimates in that there is only a small difference between the two and this is difference is not statistically significant to further compare the three evd distributions the anderson darling a d statistic was calculated for each case i e ensemble member for the fits to the series representing the reference and future periods and the p value indicating the significance level was determined for each case an average p value was then calculated based on the average of all cases for a given catchment for each of the 3 evds the results indicate that it is only for the gp distribution that one can reject the null hypothesis i e that the time series do not come for the distribution indicated at the 0 05 significance level in most catchments based on the average p value for that catchment for the case of the gev and gumbel distributions there were no catchments with average p values indicating that the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 0 05 level although the average p values based on the gev distribution tend to be slightly lower i e slightly better and closer to the 0 05 level than those based on the gumbel distribution 4 2 uncertainty in ensemble projections for changes in flood magnitudes the total ensemble variance decomposed into four components climate data flood frequency analysis hydrological model parameterization and interaction terms is shown in fig 6 a as an average value for all 115 catchments for three return periods 10 100 and 1000 year for each of the three evds the component climate models represents the variance introduced by the use of 10 different climate models and 2 different bias adjustment methods to process the climate data before it is used in hydrological modelling the component ffa i e flood frequency analysis is the ensemble variance derived from the fitting of a given evd the component hydro model represents the variance associated with the use of differing parameterisations of the hbv model for individual catchments the component interaction is the sum of several interaction terms identified in the variance decomposition including both interactions between two individual components e g climate models and ffa and between all components the results illustrated in fig 6a indicate that for the 10 year return period the three evds give a similar average total variance although the gumbel distribution has a slightly higher average value for the 100 year return level the total variance is 2 3 times larger for the gev and gp distributions in comparison with the gumbel distribution and for the 1000 year return level they are an order of magnitude larger the average total variance is however in all cases greater for the gev than the gp distribution the contribution of the four components to the total variance indicates that for the case of the gev and the gp distributions the contribution of the climate models and the flood frequency analysis is of a similar magnitude and much larger than the contribution of the hydrological model parameterization for all evds and return periods this is further illustrated in fig 6b which shows the fraction of the total variance contributed by the four ensemble components for the case of the gumbel distribution gmb climate data contributes on average approximately two thirds of the ensemble variance for all return periods this increases to over 70 for the gp distribution for the 10 year return period in general the contribution of the ffa component increases slightly with return period for all evds the largest change however is in the increase in the interaction terms for the 100 year and 1000 year return periods for the gev and gp distributions fig 6c illustrates the contributions of the individual terms comprising the lumped interaction term shown in fig 6b as a total rather than fractional variance the figure confirms that the interaction terms are negligible when the gumbel distribution is used relative to the two other evds for the case of the gev and gpd the climate model ffa term comprises over 70 of the portion of the variance due to the interaction of two or more factors for both the 100 year and the 1000 year return periods thus the results suggest that for the gev and gp distributions the relative contribution of ffa to the ensemble variance is indeed higher for these distributions at the higher quantiles if one assumes that the interaction between the climate model and ffa terms can be divided equally between the two components then fig 6b and c also indicate that the relative contribution of ffa to the ensemble variance is similar to that of climate models for the gev and gp distributions for the higher quantiles 4 3 changes in evd parameters in a future climate the projected changes illustrated in figs 3 and 4 suggest systematic changes in the evd parameters between the reference and future periods average changes in the three evd parameters location scale and shape are therefore shown for each evd in fig 7 as in figs 3 5 values are shown for the 115 catchments and in this case each point is an average of 50 000 parameter estimates for the catchment derived from 500 ensemble members each with 100 samples from the distribution of boot strapped parameter values the average parameter values are shown relative to the dominant fgp in the current climate in a particular catchment as in fig 4 changes in the location parameter correspond to a shift in the distribution e g to a higher or lower mean value and changes in the scale parameter correspond to an expansion or contraction of the distribution i e to a higher or lower gradient of values as a function of return period changes in the shape parameter represent a change in the skewness of the distribution i e in the heaviness in the tails of the distribution it should also be noted that although a fixed threshold representing the 98 5th quantile is used to set the location parameter for the gp distribution the value of the location parameter will nevertheless vary between periods as the cumulative distribution function of discharge varies the results shown in fig 7 indicate that in most catchments the location and scale parameters are expected to increase for all three evds with the exception of some catchments with lower values of fgp e g 55 or less representing catchments in which snowmelt plays a significant role in flood generation under the current climate for these snow dominated catchments the majority of catchments show a decrease in the location parameter and about half are associated with a decrease in the scale parameter the three evds indicate similar changes although the average change in the scale parameter is slightly larger for the gumbel distribution and it is slightly less for the gp distribution the results also indicate that the average shape parameter decreases in most catchments for both the gev and the gp distribution an exception however to this general decrease is seen for a number of catchments with fgps between 42 and 84 these are catchments with a mixed flood generation regime under the current climate and the increase is consistent with a likely transition to a more rainfall dominated flood regime in the future period the spatial distribution of the direction of change in the shape parameter is shown in fig 8 and indicates a high degree of spatial coherency among the catchments exhibiting an increase in the shape parameter between the reference and future periods most of these catchments are found in western norway vestlandet and in nordland and several of them correspond with the catchments exhibiting the highest percentage change in the 200 year flood shown in fig 3 5 discussion estimated changes in the 200 year flood based on the ensemble median indicate both increases and decreases fig 3 in the catchments considered the direction of change is related to the dominant flood generation process fig 4 in that only catchments with an fgp of 40 or less are associated with projected decreases simultaneously fig 4 also illustrates that the majority of snow dominated catchments exhibit small to large increases in the projected median value of the 200 year flood level the largest median increases are actually seen in catchments with fgps of 50 or less above this fgp value the results are less variable between individual catchments indicating a more consistent response to the effect of projected increases in precipitation the variable response of flood magnitudes in snow dominated catchments most likely reflects the competing effects of precipitation and temperature both of which are projected to increase during the winter season throughout norway hanssen bauer et al 2017 these increases can lead to an increase in winter snow storage and a larger albeit earlierspring snowmelt or to an increase in rain on snow events throughout the winter half year depending on the latitude and the elevation of the catchment such variable responses have also been reported for catchments in the alpine region of europe köplin et al 2014 and in the western region of north america musselman et al 2018 the three evds give similar projected increases for the 10 year flood magnitude but for the 200 and 1000 year return periods the evds with a shape parameter gev and gp give larger increases than the gumbel distribution fig 5 the mean difference between the distributions of results for evds with a shape parameter and those generated by the gumbel distribution is statistically significant at the at least 0 05 significance level for the two higher flood quantiles i e 200 and 1000 year return periods this is not entirely surprising and suggests that distributions that also model the skewness of the extreme values indicate larger changes in the most extreme flood levels the gev and gp evds give similar but not identical estimates for the higher return periods although they represent analyses on somewhat different time series annual maxima vs partial duration series this result concurs with a recent study comparing the use of a gev vs a gp distribution to assess future changes in the 100 year flood for catchments in the uk collet et al 2017 this suggests that despite the potential problems of stability associated with fitting an evd with a shape parameter to a time series of limited length renard et al 2013 kobierska et al 2018 the average values obtained from the ensemble analyses used here give consistent results for the evds with a shape parameter the goodness of fit statistic indicates however that it is only in the case of the gp that the null hypothesis can be rejected for most catchments that the gp distribution has much lower p values than the gev is due at least in part to the larger number of observations available for each time period i e typically 50 60 as compared with the 30 annual maximum values used for fitting the gev and gumbel distributions in addition the threshold value i e that determines the location parameter is fixed to correspond to the 98 5 level of the cumulative distribution of daily runoff values leading to only 2 parameters scale and location fitted from the partial duration series although the selection of this value is somewhat arbitrary in that thresholds should be tailored to each individual partial duration series coles 2001 the similarity in the results for the gev and gp evds shown in fig 5 support the use of this approach at least for the case when average ensemble values rather than individual cases are of interest the analysis of the ensemble variance fig 6 indicates that flood frequency analysis introduces a high degree of uncertainty into the range of estimated changes particularly for the highest flood quantiles for the case of the gev and gp distributions the total variance is for example 8 9 times larger for the 1000 year flood estimated with a gev distribution relative to a gumbel distribution fig 6a at first glance it might be concluded that the use of a gumbel distribution is preferable as it does not entail the fitting of a shape parameter and the additional uncertainty introduced by this estimation however given that the a d statistic suggests a better fit for the evds with a shape parameter it is more likely that for the higher flood quantiles the much larger spread in the ensemble of estimates is a realistic depiction of the high degree of uncertainty associated with projections for changes in these flood quantiles it is also noteworthy that for the case of the 10 year flood the gp distribution gives on average the lowest total variance of all 3 evds thus supporting the use of this distribution for the full range of flood quantiles the fractional contribution of ffa to the total ensemble variance is higher for the gev and gp distributions and is on average equal to the contribution from the differences between climate models the role of hydrological model parameterisation is clearly secondary to these other factors and in most cases the uncertainty introduced by this factor is on average for all catchments almost an order of magnitude less than the combined effects of climate models and flood frequency analyses it should be emphasised however that the decomposition analysis considers estimates for the flood frequency analysis based on an exhaustive parametric bootstrapping procedure and a resampling to arrive at 20 subsamples representing the full range of estimates for the case of the climate models the full distribution of models is unknown and the 10 gcm rcm combinations considered are not necessarily independent models i e they represent in many cases the same gcm run with a different rcm table 2 similarly a complete investigation of the uncertainty introduced by hydrological model parameterisation would need to include a much larger sample of parameter sets if it were possible to identify the range of estimates from a complete distribution of climate models and hydrological model parameterisations then these two factors would presumably make a larger overall contribution to the ensemble range than is shown here in addition only one hydrological model has been considered and previous studies indicate that hydrological model structure is also a considerable source of uncertainty in hydrological projections for extreme flows poulin et al 2011 bosshard et al 2013 however the ensemble analysed here represents that which is available in practise for climate change adaptation in norway e g lawrence 2016 hanssen bauer et al 2017 given this ensemble it can be concluded from fig 6 that statistical flood frequency analysis makes a considerable contribution to the total ensemble variance if uncertainty associated with fitting an evd is taken into account this result agrees with the findings of collet et al 2017 for estimates of the 100 year flood in great britain changes in the average evd location parameter reflecting changes in the mean discharge level in the flood series between the reference and future periods fig 7 have a high degree of correspondence with projected changes in the 200 year flood fig 4 an exception are the several snow dominated catchments which show large increases in the 200 year flood level but apparently have decreases or only small increases in the location parameter it appears that in these catchments the increase in flood level is associated with an increased value of the scale parameter such that flood levels increase as a function of return period although the mean flood discharge level is actually lower in the future period it is also the change in the scale parameter that varies most between evds and between catchments the projected changes in this parameter are on average largest for the gumbel distribution and this is most likely due to the lack of a shape parameter i e a higher gradient is required to accommodate changes in the tail of the distribution that otherwise would be described by the shape parameter most catchments show a decrease in the shape parameter and this is initially somewhat surprising particularly given the results shown in fig 5 which indicate larger increases for the gp and gev distributions for the higher return periods one might assume for example that the larger increases in the estimated changes at the higher return periods reflect increases in the shape parameter fig 7 however indicates that this may only be the case in a subset of catchments i e several catchments with a mixed snow regime in the current climate an increase in rainfall dominated events in this catchments may well contribute to an increase in the positive skewness of the distribution i e reflecting an increase in the probability of the most extreme events catchments with a decrease in the shape parameter under a future climate on the other hand will most likely have an increase in the events that are extreme in today s climate but have lower return intervals under a future climate such that resulting distribution is actually less skewed although the average flood levels are higher similar patterns are seen in the results for changes in flood regimes associated with sea level rise presented by buchanan et al 2018 that the catchments which exhibit a positive increase in the shape parameter are only found in two well defined geographic areas fig 8 rather than in all catchments with mixed flood regimes suggests possible links to changes in climatological drivers this is beyond the scope of the current study but such linkages between changes in climatic variables flood generating processes and the flood quantiles that are affected deserve investigation in further work an additional factor that can influence the changes in the evd parameters but is beyond the scope of the work presented here is the method used for fitting the extreme value function in this work we have applied the l moments methods although other methods such as maximum likelihood estimation or bayesian estimation could be used and may lead to somewhat different conclusions particularly regarding changes in the scale vs the shape parameter the results presented in this study indicate that evds with a shape parameter project somewhat larger increases in higher flood quantiles particularly for the 1000 year flood than does the 2 parameter gumbel distribution in practice adaptation to likely future changes flood hazard in norway is based on projections developed using a 2 parameter gumbel distribution following these projections a climate change allowance of 0 20 or 40 is used lawrence 2016 depending on local conditions i e types of catchments in which flood levels are projected to decrease vs expected to have moderate or large increases for the case of the 200 year flood level the average difference between the gumbel and gev gp distributions is 5 8 this is not a large difference but does suggest that in some cases a higher category e g 40 instead of 20 might be chosen for an individual catchment if the gev or gp distribution were used to develop the estimates the results also indicate that the use of 40 as the highest standard allowance is not excessively conservative in that many catchments actually have a higher projected increase for all three evds for the case of the 1000 year flood level the differences between the gumbel and gev gp distributions is much larger 13 15 in addition there is a high degree of uncertainty in these estimates due in part to the fitting of the shape parameter to a data series of limited length the comparison of the gev and gp distributions point to a preference for the gp distribution due to a better fit and a lower ensemble uncertainty 6 conclusions and recommendations for further work this study has analysed projections for changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate using a large ensemble of hydrological simulations representing differing gcm rcm combinations bias correction methods hydrological model parameterisations and evds for estimating flood return levels consistent with earlier work the median ensemble values indicate an increase in flood hazard under a future climate in all catchments having rainfall dominated or mixed flood regimes under the current climate snowmelt dominated catchments show a wider range of responses with some catchments projected to have a decrease in flood magnitudes and others to have an increase the results also indicate that uncertainty introduced by flood frequency analyses in these estimates is considerable and is of the same magnitude as differences between gcm rcm combinations this is a source of uncertainty that has largely been neglected in previous analyses of ensemble uncertainty there are also differences in estimated changes as a function of the extreme value distribution used for the statistical flood estimation in addition to the uncertainty underlying estimates based on a given distribution in particular the application of evds with a shape parameter gev and gp generally leads to larger projected increases in the 200 and 1000 year flood in comparison with the 2 parameter gumbel distribution there are several relevant sources of uncertainty that have not been considered in this study but which are suitable for further work the analysis presented here for example has assumed stationarity during each of the 30 year time slices representing the current vs the future period although this is consistent with previous work and can be partly justified due to the short period considered a depiction of how flood probabilities change as a continuous function over time would be useful both in climate change adaptation planning and in enhancing our understanding of how flood processes respond to changes in climatological variables non stationary flood frequency methods however require the fitting of additional parameters to account for changes in the evd parameters over time the comparison of average evd parameter values between the two time slices presented here indicate both clear patterns e g changes in the location parameter as related to projected changes in flooding and more complex issues e g changes in the shape parameter as a function of changes in flood generation processes applications of non stationary methods should therefore seek to interrogate the physical factors behind this complexity e g condon et al 2015 rather than simply fitting a non stationary evd with additional parameters in addition this study has evaluated sources of ensemble uncertainty in hydrological projections for 115 gauged catchments where it is possible to calibrate a hydrological model in most cases however flood estimates based on a calibrated hydrological model are not available for the sites where they are needed in practical applications as these sites often represent ungauged catchments in current practice in norway climate change allowances are selected for ungauged catchments based on a qualitative assessment and comparison of the hydrological and climatological characteristics of the catchment of interest relative to published results for the 115 catchments this informal transfer of information between gauged and ungauged catchment also introduces an element of subjectivity and inherent uncertainty methods for regionalising catchment based hydrological projections for likely changes in flood levels and flood regimes to ungauged catchments are therefore also required if one is to improve the reliability of estimates available for climate change adaptation credit authorship contribution statement deborah lawrence conceptualization methodology software

receiving increasing attention and particularly phosphorus p in response to the recent increasing frequency of toxic blue green algal blooms this study assesses how land use seasonal weather patterns and climate extremes interact to control runoff and nutrient loading from tributaries into owasco lake in 2016 ne us experienced a prolonged drought which resulted in unusual and extreme low flows between august and october the drought was ended by an intense rain event at the end of october new hydrological insights for the region the results show that during the drought period the expected influence of agricultural and mixed land use on p loads was masked however high p loads were observed during the first rain event after the drought exacerbating the agricultural impact on water quality this study aids in understanding how climate extremes might affect nutrient runoff dynamics in the ne us these findings are an important contribution from a management perspective as projections for the ne us suggest that total precipitation will slightly increase but large changes are expected in the extremes with summer rains becoming concentrated in fewer events of higher

monchamp et al 2014 excess p loading was significantly reduced in the 1970s with the limits on detergent p content however attention to nutrient pollution has again arisen due to a disturbing increase

transported from the landscape to streams via storm runoff verheyen et al 2015 demonstrated that in agricultural areas surface runoff is the main factor driving dissolved p export from the landscape

likely lead to changes in seasonal snow water equivalent soil moisture and evapotranspiration all leading to modified storm runoff regimes in the ne us the timing and amount of stream flows is anticipated to shift to 1 more high flow events in winter 2 earlier peak flows in spring and 3 extended low flow periods in summer frumhoff et al 2007 in particular the occurrence of summer droughts is projected to become more frequent from one every three years to one every year under the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario hayhoe et al 2007 horton et al 2014 however how such changes would interact to affect water pollution is less well understood our overall goal was to improve our understanding of how land use and changing weather patterns interact to control runoff and nutrient loading into owasco lake owl which is part of the finger lakes watershed located in central ny the lake constitutes the main drinking water source for several nearby communities in cayuga county ny in recent years the lake and surrounding region have been subject to a series of toxic algal blooms posing a threat to human health recreational tourism and aquatic ecology halfman et al 2016 in this context our specific objectives were to 1 quantify and compare overall patterns of water quality among twelve different tributaries of owasco lake which differ in their dominant types of land use 2 determine to what extent annual seasonal weather conditions interact with land use to influence nutrient loading into owasco lake 3 evaluate the impact on stream water chemistry and nutrient loading to owasco lake of contrasting climate extreme events summer drought followed by an intense rainfall both occurring during the 2016 growing season may to november 2 methods 2 1 study area our study was conducted in the owasco lake watershed located in central ny the lake is of glacial origin and is part of the seneca oneida oswego river basin which drains into lake ontario schaffner and oglesby 1978 the region is characterized by a temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 8 8 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1209 mm noaa 2017 the owasco lake watershed extends over approximately 530 km2 and its bedrock geology is composed of limestone sandstone and shale oglesby 1973 the main tributaries to the lake include the owasco inlet which accounts for 60 of the land area draining to the lake dutch hollow brook venness brook and sucker brook each of these streams has several small tributaries in addition there are roughly fifty minor channels perennial and intermittent that flow directly into the lake fig 1 according to the 2010 census approximately 16 000 people live in the watershed predominantly in the towns of moravia groton owasco as well as in several small rural aggregates the lake s shoreline is mainly used for recreational activities and is characterized by seasonal housing the towns of groton and moravia have a developed sewage system with a wastewater treatment plant wwtp that uses a tertiary p treatment the rest of the watershed utilizes septic systems cayuga county 2015 the land is used mainly for agricultural purposes 21 6 of the watershed area is cultivated with crops and 26 4 with hay and pasture for livestock of the remaining area 34 is forested while the rest is distributed among other uses 5 of which is classified as developed multi resolution land characteristics mrlc consortium 2011 according to the 2017 agricultural census cayuga county has 225 204 acres of land occupied by farms this constitutes a total of 842 farms of which 200 of varying sizes from 19 to 2000 acres are estimated to be located in the owasco lake watershed area wright and haight 2011 corn wheat soybeans hay and sweet corn are the major crops grown in the watershed the majority of which is destined to feed and forage dairy and beef cows cayuga county 2015 based on the 2017 agricultural census cayuga county ranked second in new york state for the market value of agricultural products sold livestock poultry and its products represented 75 of the sales with cow milk representing the highest value the 2017 census cattle and cow inventory reported 94 427 heads distributed around the county in 656 farms the majority of the farms 87 were small fewer than 200 cows and 85 farms reported more than 200 heads in one facility note however that more detailed locations on farms is not publicly available and even though agriculture is the primary economic activity in the area covering the majority of the watershed area there is no official information describing agricultural management practices in the watershed a general overview of practices applied in the area however was derived from personal communications with officials from the cayuga county administration and from the soil and water conservation district manure spreading and application of inorganic fertilizer are the predominant methods of fertilization at farms in the watershed fertilizer is generally applied close to planting may june and around mid summer for side dress manure spreading is used as both a way to fertilize crop and to handle waste from dairy and livestock producing farms manure is generally applied closed to planting and could also be apply close to harvest oct nov to some crops such as hay ground and small grains amounts are highly farm specific depending on specific nutrient management plans in general large facilities use storage to manage application and benefit nutrient management while small farms lacking storage facilities will likely apply manure to surrounding crops on a daily basis based on 2017 agricultural census at the county level there are 121 452 acres treated with fertilizer and 40 817 treated with manure given the 94 000 cows located in cayuga county farmers have to dispose of approximately 4 3 million kg of manure daily 2 2 sampling design twelve small tributaries to the lake were selected for sampling to represent the diversity of land uses in the watershed small watersheds were chosen as to isolate impacts of the main three land uses agriculture 80 percent or more of the total surface dedicated to agriculture labeled henceforth as a1 a2 and a3 forest 70 percent or more forest cover labeled as f1 f2 and f3 and mixed agriculture and forest between 40 60 percent of total surface dedicated to agriculture labeled m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 mixed land use watersheds usually included residential areas with associated impervious surfaces and septic systems and together with agriculture land use are here considered as impacted watersheds forest land use watersheds are here considered as baseline sub watersheds associated with each study site ranged between 0 2 to 13 2 km2 in surface area fig 1 2 3 water sampling and analyses water samples from each tributary were collected for total phosphorus tp soluble reactive phosphorus srp nitrate nitrite nox n and total suspended sediments tss from december 2015 to november 2016 sampling was conducted at monthly intervals during the winter and biweekly throughout the rest of the year water samples were collected in 1 l acid washed polypropylene bottles stored at 4 c in a cooler and transported to the soil and water lab at cornell university located in ithaca new york once in the lab each 1 l sample was divided into three parts for the various analyses approximately 50 ml were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm filter supor membrane disc filter 25 mm diameter and stored for srp and nitrate analysis additional unfiltered 550 ml subsamples were stored separately for tp and tss analysis all the samples were stored at 4 c to halt potential microbial cycling of nutrients we decreased the ph to 2 by adding 30 h2so4 before storage nutrient analyses were run within 4 weeks after collection and preservation tss was analyzed within 7 days of collection in addition to the chemical analyses during each sampling event we measured four environmental variables including ph fisher scientific accumet 166 research ar 50 conductivity fisher ar50 dissolved oxygen ysi 550a yellow springs instruments and temperature ysi 550a phosphorus analysis was done on an automated wet chemistry analyzer fs3000 xylem analytics o i analytical beverly massachusetts screening for phosphate anions po3 4 in srp and tp samples tp samples were first digested with persulfate and sulfuric acid us epa 1978 and then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter supor membrane disc filter 25 mm diameter reagents for analysis were ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid sulfuric acid and potassium antimonyl tartate us epa 1978 each run was calibrated using 0 005 0 05 0 5 5 and 10 ppm potassium phosphate standards with all r2 values between 0 9998 and 0 9999 in addition all samples were analyzed for nitrate nitrite resulting in a combined nox n value using a microplate reader following the griess sulfanilamide colorimetric method as developed by doane and horwáth 2003 each run was calibrated using 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 ppm potassium nitrate standards with all r2 values of the standard curves between 0 95 and 0 99 for tss analysis water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter supor membrane disc filter 25 mm diameter and tss concentration was determined by calculating the mass difference of the filter before and after oven drying at 60 c for 24 h divided by the water volume filtered in addition to regular monthly grab samples several storm events were sampled between april and november using both grab samples and continuous automated samplers two isco auto samplers were deployed to capture representative complete storm events during summer and fall one in a forested sub catchment site f1 and one in an agricultural area site a4 fig 1 a water level actuator was used to trigger the auto sampler every time the stream level increased 0 5 cm above baseflow level and was manually adjusted every two weeks to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the water table auto samplers were programmed to collect 250 ml samples every 15 min for 12 h the auto sampler bottles were pre acidified with 0 5 ml concentrated sulfuric acid to guarantee sample preservation within 48 h of the storm the samples collected were analyzed individually for sediments and phosphorus concentrations and then averaged to obtain a daily concentration and load value which was then incorporated in the final database for analysis 2 4 tributary hydrologic measurements when streams allowed access discharge was calculated using measured velocity and cross sectional area of the stream turnipseed and sauer 2010 discharge data were used in conjunction with chemical concentrations to calculate loads water velocity was measured with a portable flow meter marsh mcbirney flo mate model 2000 at several points between four and 15 across the stream every 6 15 or 30 cm depending on stream width as much as possible the measurements were taken at the same stream section during each sampling event when the water level was too low water depth below 3 cm to use a velocity meter a small neutrally buoyant object was used to estimate average velocity or if a culvert was nearby the time required to fill a container of known volume was used to determine discharge in either case three measurements were averaged to obtain the final estimation since the monitored streams are ungauged and due to logistical reasons we were unable to measure discharge at every site during storm events sampled with iscos the continuous flow measurements at the nearest usgs station owasco inlet station 4235299 fig 1 were used to estimate the discharge at sites f1 and a4 throughout the sampled storms events by correcting the measurements by sub watershed area hirsch 1979 2 5 data and statistical analysis the data analysis was structured into two phases in the first phase we used a descriptive analysis in order to characterize the hydrology and water quality of the tributaries to characterize water quality at the tributaries we computed annual summary statistics for the six water quality parameters measured due to the ungauged nature of the tributaries we used data from usgs station at the owasco lake inlet 4235299 and from the noaa station at auburn 00300321 to plot discharge hydrography and annual precipitation for the whole watershed for the period 2015 2016 in addition 2016 annual flow and precipitation statistics were used in a comparison with historical values for the last 30 years in the second phase we used a two way analysis of variance anova with a tukey honest significant difference hsd pairwise comparison to assess the effect of land use and season on conductivity p nitrate nitrate and tss additionally anova estimates were used to predict the best concentration and load estimates for each combination of land use and season as p n and tss concentrations were directly correlated with stream flows we applied the anova only for the concentrations then we calculated the load estimates using the resulting concentration estimates and the area normalized stream flow per land use and season concentration intercept lu se lu se l o a d

owasco lake watershed hydrologic processes in the owasco lake watershed shift seasonally based on historical data from usgs gauge station at the owasco lake inlet over the last 56 years 1960 2016 the highest mean monthly discharge usually occurs between march and april associated with snowmelt and the lowest mean monthly discharge has been observed between july and september when base flow is relatively constant stream discharges generally increase again in october after leaf fall and evapo transpirative losses decline due to the combination of reduced vegetation and storms fig 2 however 2016 was an unusually dry year with a mean annual discharge 3 33 m3 s well below the annual mean 4 34 m3 s over the last 56 years 1960 2016 the 2016 annual runoff 384 mm was notably lower than the annual mean of the last 56 year period 503 mm us geological survey 2016 mean precipitation for 2016 1124 mm was also somewhat lower than the annual mean of the last 20 years 1209 mm and the precipitation during the growing season was significantly lower in comparison to the historical mean noaa 2017 sweet et al 2017 the us drought monitor classifies droughts into 5 categories ranging from abnormally dry conditions d0 to exceptional drought d5 during 2016 95 or more of cayuga county s total area was classified in at least one of the five drought categories from june 7th to december

measurements for the 12 small tributaries monitored in this study the unusual 2016 drought conditions became more evident following the typical annual hydrograph in 2016 the tributaries discharge peaks occurred during the spring months april and may and then decreased to baseflow conditions by the beginning of june fig 3 in all the sites the period extending from june to october experienced extreme low flows with intermittent and in some cases extended periods of no flow of the twelve tributaries monitored in this study only two sites m5 and f2 ran continuously between june and october while the remaining ten sites experienced periods of no flow such drought periods varied in length for each site from a minimum of 1 week and up to 22 weeks table 1 at the end of october october 20th to 24th the area experienced the largest rain event of the year fig 2 which restored flow in all the streams during this event streams located in sites dominated by agricultural and mix uses exhibited a secondary peak in their annual hydrograph while streams located in forested areas did not show a significant second peak in their hydrographs even when flow conditions were restored fig 3 interestingly the peak flow resulting from the mixed land use was greater than that of agriculture with forested being lowest between october 20th and october 24th 136 6 mm of rain fell in the area with 77 2 mm falling during the first 24 h based on the precipitation frequency estimates for auburn meteorological station noaa station id 30 0321 a rain of 77 2 mm in 24 h has an average recurrence interval of 10 years while a rainfall of 136 6 mm in four days has a recurrence interval of 25 years noaa s atlas 14 we consider this event as an extreme rainfall that occurred after a prolonged drought that was also anomalous for the area which gave us an extraordinary opportunity to assess the impact of combined extremes event on nutrients runoff and water quality 3 2 water quality summary for the owasco lake tributaries a total of 212 water samples were collected throughout the study including 114 grab samples and 98 additional isco samples the number of samples was highly variable across tributaries due to the drought influence see table 1 for detailed information on samples per tributary over the same period 98 measurements of discharge were made analytical results of surface water samples indicated that stream waters were slightly alkaline with annual mean ph values ranging from 7 91 to 8 14 the lowest and highest individual ph values were observed at site f3 during fall

higher conductivity values for agricultural sites compared to mixed and forested sites during spring during summer and fall the agricultural sites had significantly higher conductivity values than the forested sites but were not different from sites with mixed land use fig 5 a forested watersheds consistently had the lowest conductivities with seasonal means ranging from 133 to 246 μs cm mixed and agricultural areas had seasonal means ranging from 123 to 393 and 133 to 537μs cm respectively table sm1 seasonally conductivity remained low during winter 130 μs cm and increased over the year for all land uses however these seasonal changes were significant only for agricultural areas from winter to spring p 0 01 3 3 2 phosphorus tp and srp and nitrogen nox n there was significant temporal and

significant differences between land uses during winter spring and summer fig 5b d in agricultural and mixed areas the highest predicted tp concentrations were observed during the fall means of 0 23

61 37 mg l and loads during winter 16000 g d km2 table 3 4 discussion results of this research provided valuable insights into the dynamic and process driven chemical loading into owasco lake as these processes are increasingly being affected by climate driven extremes in precipitation patterns as expected this study supports previous findings in that we observed that agricultural land uses were an overall greater p and nox n contributor both in concentration and loads relative to forested land use carpenter et al 1998 jarvie et al 2010 there were noteworthy differences in p seasonal contributions with agricultural areas presenting its higher p loads during the fall at the end of the growing season and forested areas presenting higher p loads during the winter possibly due to leaf litter entering streams bratt et al 2017 cowen and lee 1973 with respect to nitrogen seasonal variations did not seem to have a significant effect on nitrogen contributions instead land use was the main driver of nitrogen differences between sites with agricultural areas presenting the highest nitrogen concentrations and loads relative to other land uses throughout the entire year tss followed expected patterns for agricultural watersheds with highs in spring and fall when farm fields are uncovered and exposed to erosion however the most interesting findings emerged from the behaviors associated with the occurrence of the 2016 summer drought that was followed by a large rainstorm at the end of october this event provided a unique opportunity to evaluate how predicted climate change might affect patterns of nutrients loading in coming decades during the drought period there was little to no flow and chemical transport in the tributaries the first and simultaneously intense rain event post drought resulted in significant transfer of p and sediment from the landscape to the tributaries interestingly the highest peak flows were measured in mixed use areas possibly due to contributions from the greater extent of impervious surface area as compared to both the forested and agricultural land use however the greatest p concentrations and loads came from agricultural land use while the lowest flows and p inputs were from forested landscapes these findings have important implications for managing lake water quality in order to reduce drivers of eutrophication in the context of climate change improved management of all parts of the watershed including maximizing forested cover controlling stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces and implementing bmps for erosion and nutrient management will work cumulatively to buffer the impacts of climate extremes 4 1 water quality at owasco lake tributaries seasonal and land use effect land uses among the different catchments around owl play key roles in how much they contribute to nutrient loading total phosphorus and srp both exhibited a strong significant interaction between land use and season post hoc comparisons showed that tp and srp concentrations were significantly higher in agricultural areas compared to forested and mixed land uses during the fall season with no significant differences during winter spring or summer overall p concentrations and loads for agricultural sub watersheds were higher than the reported for dutch hollow brook sub watershed in 2016 by halfman et al 2016 highlighting the importance of small tributaries as nutrient contributors to owl it is worth noticing that the major differences between values in this study and those reported by halfman et al 2016 correspond to the fall season for which halfman et al 2016 assessed baseflow samples whereas this study included baseflow as well as stormflow sampling on a regional scale spring and fall seasonal loads were relatively similar to those estimated by makarewicz et al 2015 for the genesee river watershed likewise prestigiacomo et al 2016 reported srp concentrations for fall creek ranging between 0 and 0 045 mg l for april october interval of 2013 while in our study spring and summer mean srp concentration in agricultural sub watersheds were 0 021 and 0 35 mg l respectively for the rest of the water quality parameters land uses also played an important role for nox n there was a strongly significant effect of land uses with agricultural areas exhibiting significantly higher nox n concentrations compared to mixed and forested areas surprisingly however there was no observed seasonal effect and nox n results did not match the usual seasonal nitrogen dynamic in ne us typically higher nitrate concentrations have been documented during winter and spring and attributed winter storm flushing and repeated leaching with high vegetation uptake rates driving lower concentrations during the summer ohte and katsuyama 2019 the shift in nox n season patterns documented in our study may be explained by the unusual weather of 2016 which presented an extreme drought followed by an intense rain event and where none of the nutrients behaved according to the usual dynamics although not measured decreased vegetative growth due to extremely dry soils might also explain reduced nitrogen uptake by plants during the drought conductivity of the stream samples exhibited a strong interaction effect of land use and seasons post hoc comparisons showed that conductivity was significantly higher in agricultural areas during spring summer and fall the differences observed among land uses agree with the expectations for agricultural areas yielding higher conductivity values as it has been reported before okamoto tanaka et al 2015 one possible explanation for higher conductivity levels in agricultural sub watershed might be related to manure application during the growing season which has been already correlated with higher conductivity values ju et al 2007 roberts and clanton 2000 for tss there was no effect of seasons and or land uses yielding similar tss concentrations and loads in agricultural and forested areas along the year it is not clear why agricultural and forested areas had similar tss levels but previous research in the region has shown that steep land correlates with agricultural abandonment flinn et al 2005 steep watersheds will result in high kinetic energy streams which foster higher erosion rates than low topography watersheds especially during high intensity rain events in our study agricultural sub catchments slopes ranged in between 0 20 degrees while forested areas slopes were generally steeper and ranged between 10 60 degrees the high intensity october rain event likely caused in stream bank erosion and increased sediment export 4 2 the drought and post drought rain effect on nutrients dynamic overall our results suggest that in 2016 the prolonged drought followed by an intense rain event was the process driving seasonal p dynamics in the owl tributaries the drought dated between june and october 2016 ndmc university of nebraska usda 2017 sweet et al 2017 provoked extremely low flow levels in the owasco lake tributaries which masked the land use effect during spring and summer on stream p concentrations and loads a close examination of the time series for tp and srp concentrations fig 6 b c seemed to indicate that the seasonal fall effect was driven by the storm event that occurred on october 20th when tp and srp concentrations in agricultural areas almost tripled in magnitude compared with previous seasons winter spring and summer of 2016 different than p neither seasons nor the drought seemed to influence nox n concentrations by analyzing the nox n time series not shown we noted that agricultural areas always presented higher concentrations regardless of seasonality and or the drought and post drought rain effect similarly when we analyzed conductivity time series the drought did not seem to play a key role in conductivity patterns fig 6a the combined drought and post drought effects on nutrient export patterns from different land uses have been captured inonly a few other studies mosley 2015 observed that as runoff decreased during dry periods the catchment influence on stream water also decreased suggesting that the processes dominating stream water quality differed between low and high flow scenarios as the relative importance of water sources varied according to hydroclimatic conditions elsdon et al 2009 reported no differences in nutrient parameters between urban and rural estuaries in south australia during drought conditions showing that as the proportion of sampled water coming from runoff decreased the influence of land use in nutrient parameters decreased as well in addition there are several studies evaluating the effect of drought events on different water quality parameters and specifically focused on water conductivity and main ion concentrations e g chloride sodium and sulfate as an approximate measure of total dissolved ions burt et al 2015 caruso 2002 2001 foster and walling 1978 hellwig et al 2017 mosley et al 2012 muchmore and dziegielewski 2007 nosrati 2011 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 such studies have shown a deterioration of water quality during drought events as solute concentrations increase and suggest that the concentration effect is a result of low flows and evaporation as opposed to the dilution effect that will usually prevail during high flows our results agreed with these studies for forested and mixed areas where we observed the highest conductivity values during the dry period fig 6a however for agricultural areas the drought effect on conductivity was less clear suggesting there might be other variables that influenced conductivity levels such as manure application nutrient dynamics seem to be less consistent in their response to drought and highly related to the nutrient source involved some authors reported a decrease in stream nutrient concentrations in drought to pre drought comparisons mainly as a result of reduced runoff during dry periods in areas dominated by nps pollution baurès et al 2013 boar et al 1995 caruso 2002 2001 golladay and battle 2002 morecroft et al 2000 mosley et al 2012 oelsner et al 2007 on the other hand several studies in areas where point sources of pollution predominate have as expected reported an increase in nutrient concentrations during drought periods andersen et al 2004 boar et al 1995 caruso 2002 2001 davies 1978 macintosh et al 2011 oborne et al 1980 sprague 2005 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 moreover studies in areas where the relative importance of water sources surface vs groundwater change seasonally or which may have changed over time due to fluctuations in hydrometeorological conditions showed no significant changes in nutrient concentrations between drought periods and reference years garcía prieto et al 2012 hellwig et al 2017 wilbers et al 2009 several authors have emphasized the role of biological activity on nutrient concentrations during drought events as temperature increases biological uptake increases which contributes to lower nutrient concentrations during droughts caruso 2001 hellwig et al 2017 our results for these parameters were ambiguous with tp and srp showing a slight increase in concentration from agricultural lands during the drought but sustained low concentrations for the other two land uses fig 6 b c these results emphasize the importance of the land use season interaction in the case of n we did observe a slight decrease in concentration from agricultural lands toward the end of the drought period however not pronounced enough to show a significant effect of seasons and or the drought event on nitrogen dynamics more work on the impacts of drought on tributary chemical loading is clearly needed the effect of rain events occurring immediately post drought deserves special attention in particular high intensity or high magnitude rain events are already increasing in frequency throughout the ne us and elsewhere horton et al 2014 studies of a prolonged drought in sw england between may 1975 and august 1976 burt et al 2015 foster and walling 1978 worrall and burt 2008 concluded that solutes and or nitrate concentrations increased dramatically during the first rain event after the drought burt et al 2015 analyzed conductivity major cations and ph during the first few storms after a drought period for one small catchment their results showed a significant concentration increase during the first rain event after the drought with conductivity peaking drastically and total dissolved solids concentrations doubling when compared to pre storm levels the second rain event also showed a concentration increase but more subdued than the first one while stream response to the third storm returning to a more typical dilution effect process suggested that the supply of readily available soluble loads had been exhausted during the first two events foster and walling 1978 studied the effect of the first post drought rain event in conductivity and nitrate concentrations suggesting that the source of high solute levels was the dissolution of soluble residues that accumulated and concentrated in the soil during the drought period as a result of evaporation of soil moisture and capillary rise in addition worrall and burt 2008 suggested that drought events might change the delivery pattern of water quality constituents retaining them in catchments during dry conditions and releasing during wet conditions interestingly we did not observe a similar effect of the first storm event after the drought on nox n however we did observe a similar dynamic for p nitrogen results are a bit surprising as we had expected to find a strong influence of dry wet conditions on stream nitrogen given previous observations and well stablished set of evidence showing n dynamic under dry wet conditions creed et al 1996 creed and band 1998 ohte and katsuyama 2019 however is worth noticing that we only measured two forms of n nitrate nitrite which seemed not enough to capture the whole nitrogen dynamic which includes many more possible pathways than p including gaseous phases there are several biogeochemical processes that could be involved in nutrient and dissolved solids releases to streams after dry periods although the details of the mechanisms are not well understood particularly for phosphorus haynes and swift 1989 suggested that dry conditions can disrupt organic coating on mineral particles exposing fresh surface for sorption and or desorption processes particularly the capacity for adsorption can be reduced under dry condition due to alterations on the soil mineral crystal structure mclaughin et al 1981 smith and jacinthe 2014 showed that soil cores that were exposed to drought conditions presented higher p release upon rewetting compared to cores that were not exposed to dry conditions in their experiment p flux was independent of total p in the soil showing a high impact of soil drying in p mobility similarly schönbrunner et al 2012 showed that in riverine floodplain systems tp released into the water column increased with increasing duration of the dry period prior to rewetting and the degree of drying was the major determinant controlling p release upon rewetting in addition beside soil p concentrations and its biogeochemical processes during dry wet periods hydroclimatic conditions and storm characteristics can also play a major role on p mobilization upon rewetting vadas et al 2011 demonstrated that as the relative runoff to rain ratio increased so does the amount of dissolved p that gets released the wetness condition of the soil can also play a fundamental role as dry soil may absorb more water during rain events reducing p losses however whenever relative runoff to rain ratio is large this variable drive dissolved p concentration in runoff regardless of soil conditions and timing between storm and manure and or fertilizer application microbial dynamics may also be altered during dry periods although the evidence is less consistent on one hand some studies show higher p uptake by microbes during dry conditions as temperature might increase microbial activity caruso 2001 hellwig et al 2017 and changes in p adsorption capacity can allow for greater microbe access to bounded particles olander and vitousek 2004 on the other hand p mineralization from microbial sources can also prevail during dry periods as microbial cells can desiccate provoking lysis processes when exposed to prolonged periods of drought kieft et al 1987 schönbrunner et al 2012 considering the discussed potential biogeochemical and microbial effects on nutrient release there are several processes and mechanisms that can be postulated as drivers of the particular p dynamics observed during 2016 improving our understanding on the interaction between these processes and mechanisms and weather factors is highly important to deepen our understanding of nutrient dynamics and will contribute to the improvement of management practices under climate change scenarios although it was beyond the scope of this study we suggest possible explanations and venture a hypothesis that might help to explain the observed results we suggest that the first post drought rain event of fall 2016 had a large influence on stream water quality by mobilizing accumulated pools of tp and srp we hypothesize that the lack of storm runoff for weeks to months allowed p to accumulate in the watershed as p has fewer pathways out of the watershed other than surface runoff and to a lesser extent leaching into the groundwater in addition as previous evidence suggest dry conditions might allow for several biogeochemical processes impacting soil p speciation and availability for consumption and or mobilization moreover the first storm event after the drought coincided with the most intense precipitation event of the year with a recurrence interval of 25 years generating large enough runoff to result in a flushing effect that drastically increased stream p concentration in our study this first post drought rain event occurred in late october after fields had been harvested and before any cover crops could become established as such the agricultural landscape was most vulnerable to runoff processes contrary to the effect of the drought which masked the effect of land uses on p export the first rain event after the drought exacerbated the differences among land uses with significantly larger concentrations and loads observed in agricultural areas the p dynamic was then influenced by many factors such as soil p concentration soil biogeochemical processes under dry wet conditions and storm event characteristics all which determine the final phosphorus concentrations and loads into the streams our results together with previous studies on the effect of the first rainfall after a drought on water quality burt et al 2015 foster and walling 1978 worrall and burt 2008 provide evidence towards recognizing the first few storm events after a drought period as hot moments mcclain et al 2003 for nutrient export in areas where npss dominate over point sources we speculate that the large storm in october saturated parts of the landscape and then continuous rain connected many of these saturated areas to the stream generating a network of saturation excess flow paths e g dunne and black 1970 which provided conduits for p to be transported from the landscape to the stream although the processes and mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena need further investigation the results and proposed hypotheses presented in this study are highly important for deepening our understanding on the effects of climate extremes on nutrients dynamic these results could prove useful to water managers in the context of rapid climate change as projections for the ne us suggest that summer rains are likely to become concentrated in fewer events of higher intensities interspaced with more prolonged dry periods hayhoe et al 2007 horton et al 2014 landscapes covered with forests and other vegetation clearly provide greater protection during large storm events which reduces peak flows in the streams and the potential for p transport mixed land uses will be particularly vulnerable to high intensity rain events as their extensive impervious surfaces rapidly convey stormwater to streams contributing to peak erosive flows on the other hand agricultural landscapes are most vulnerable to climate extremes from a chemical contaminant standpoint hence it will be critical to include agricultural management practices that help reduce environmental impacts greater implementation of bmps such as cover crops riparian buffers and cattle fencing along streams and roadside ditches and water and sediments control basins will all help to reduce p and sediment transport as it has already been demonstrated at farm scale in the owl watershed georgakakos et al 2018 and at a watershed scale in other areas along the region herendeen and glazier 2009 makarewicz et al 2009 zollweg and makarewicz 2009 in addition reducing p accumulation in the soil by amending animal manure with n knighton et al 2017 could also prove to be an effective practice to reduce p loads during intense rain events the main findings of this paper help to better understand the interaction between land uses and hydroclimatic conditions and its impact on nutrient runoff in the context of climate extremes still many pieces and interactions of the complex p dynamic need to be revealed in order to understand the fate of p loads and its role in aquatic ecosystems our results showed the highest p load from agricultural areas to the lake at the end of october however toxic algal blooms in general occur during late summer when lake water temperature reach ideal values for cyanobacteria to grow among other conditions i e wind species interactions etc in particular during 2016 owasco lake experienced a highly toxic algal bloom during the first days of september dry period resulting in high concentrations of toxins in the lake water and to a lesser extent into the drinking water supply nys dec 2018 this event highlights the complexity of the system and the necessity for further studies and better understanding of the mechanisms underlying nutrient dynamic and fate and its resulting ecological impact 5 conclusions we expected spring and summer nutrients concentrations and loads to be higher compared to other seasons due to the intensity of recreational and agricultural activities during the growing season however nox n loads were similar along the year while the highest p load in 2016 occurred during the fall presumably due to a prolonged summer drought followed by one large storm event in late october the first storm event after the drought exposed differences in nps loads among land uses with highest p concentrations from agriculture both the hydroclimatic conditions and anthropic activities seem to be controlling factors of p dynamics in this situation since dry years do not occur on a regular basis in the ne us the observations preliminary conclusions and inferences drawn from this study could prove useful for management purposes in the context of climate change one outstanding question is the ecological implications of the unusual p loading patterns in the receiving lake or reservoir i e how does a seasonal shift in p loading to later in the most biologically active period

8377,study region our study was conducted in the owasco lake watershed which is part of the finger lakes located in central ny study focus in the northeastern united states ne us nutrient pollution is receiving increasing attention and particularly phosphorus p in response to the recent increasing frequency of toxic blue green algal blooms this study assesses how land use seasonal weather patterns and climate extremes interact to control runoff and nutrient loading from tributaries into owasco lake in 2016 ne us experienced a prolonged drought which resulted in unusual and extreme low flows between august and october the drought was ended by an intense rain event at the end of october new hydrological insights for the region the results show that during the drought period the expected influence of agricultural and mixed land use on p loads was masked however high p loads were observed during the first rain event after the drought exacerbating the agricultural impact on water quality this study aids in understanding how climate extremes might affect nutrient runoff dynamics in the ne us these findings are an important contribution from a management perspective as projections for the ne us suggest that total precipitation will slightly increase but large changes are expected in the extremes with summer rains becoming concentrated in fewer events of higher intensities interspaced with prolonged dry periods keywords nutrient runoff climate extremes land use algal blooms 1 introduction discharge of pollutants into water bodies is a major concern and a challenge for sustainable development in the us non point source pollution nps is considered the leading contributor to water quality impairments nutrients applied to agricultural soils in the form of either animal manure or chemical fertilizers are among the main nps pollutants of concern excessive nutrient loads can contribute to eutrophication causing negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems and water quality carpenter et al 1998 phosphorus p and nitrogen n runoff from agricultural land to water bodies are among the main causes of eutrophication and algal blooms rabalais 2002 us geological survey 1999 in addition to the ecological impacts some algal species can also pose a threat to human health through the production of toxins which in addition to creating a public health risk also increase the cost of drinking water treatment resulting in significant financial losses for state and regional economies chislock et al 2013 p is usually recognized as the major limiting nutrient for primary productivity carpenter et al 1998 schindler 1977 schindler et al 2016 however recent studies suggest that excess nitrogen can contribute to greater toxicity of the cyanobacterial blooms monchamp et al 2014 excess p loading was significantly reduced in the 1970s with the limits on detergent p content however attention to nutrient pollution has again arisen due to a disturbing increase in seasonal sometimes toxic blue green algal blooms repeated occurrences of toxic algal blooms have impacted water bodies throughout the ne us raising concerns for recreational safety and drinking water anderson et al 2012 nys dec 2018 steffen et al 2014 in agricultural areas of the ne us p is often introduced to cropped fields through manure applications as a simultaneous mechanism for fertilization and waste disposal carpenter et al 1998 klausner et al 1998 kleinman et al 2015 this practice induces soil nutrient imbalances leading to nutrient losses and excess p is primarily transported from the landscape to streams via storm runoff verheyen et al 2015 demonstrated that in agricultural areas surface runoff is the main factor driving dissolved p export from the landscape to the streams however other land uses can also contribute to surface water pollution for example dissolved n from septic systems and sediment erosion from steep slopes and new construction sites could also be contributors mcphillips et al 2017 watershed scale management has been widely applied over the past several decades as a holistic approach to deal with water quality issues emerging from the impact of different land uses especially in agricultural areas hawkins and geering 1989 makarewicz 2009 research by grant and langpap 2018 has documented the successful efforts by more than 1000 us watershed organizations in improving water quality in the past 15 years however in addition to the impact on water quality from human activities the frequency and intensity of hydrometeorological events will also influence nutrient delivery patterns from the landscape to the water bodies e g interactions between patterns of precipitation with soil properties vegetative cover and topography dahlke et al 2012 dunne and black 1970 horton 1941 1930 these interactions gain relevance given global climate change predictions for an increased frequency of hydrological extremes there has already been a 55 increase in high intensity rainfall events daily events that exceed the 99th percentile of all non zero precipitation days throughout the ne us over the past several decades easterling et al 2017 these intense downpours are leading to increased overland flow erosion and associated downstream pollution rosenzweig et al 2011 warming air temperatures and shifting seasonal precipitation will likely lead to changes in seasonal snow water equivalent soil moisture and evapotranspiration all leading to modified storm runoff regimes in the ne us the timing and amount of stream flows is anticipated to shift to 1 more high flow events in winter 2 earlier peak flows in spring and 3 extended low flow periods in summer frumhoff et al 2007 in particular the occurrence of summer droughts is projected to become more frequent from one every three years to one every year under the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario hayhoe et al 2007 horton et al 2014 however how such changes would interact to affect water pollution is less well understood our overall goal was to improve our understanding of how land use and changing weather patterns interact to control runoff and nutrient loading into owasco lake owl which is part of the finger lakes watershed located in central ny the lake constitutes the main drinking water source for several nearby communities in cayuga county ny in recent years the lake and surrounding region have been subject to a series of toxic algal blooms posing a threat to human health recreational tourism and aquatic ecology halfman et al 2016 in this context our specific objectives were to 1 quantify and compare overall patterns of water quality among twelve different tributaries of owasco lake which differ in their dominant types of land use 2 determine to what extent annual seasonal weather conditions interact with land use to influence nutrient loading into owasco lake 3 evaluate the impact on stream water chemistry and nutrient loading to owasco lake of contrasting climate extreme events summer drought followed by an intense rainfall both occurring during the 2016 growing season may to november 2 methods 2 1 study area our study was conducted in the owasco lake watershed located in central ny the lake is of glacial origin and is part of the seneca oneida oswego river basin which drains into lake ontario schaffner and oglesby 1978 the region is characterized by a temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 8 8 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1209 mm noaa 2017 the owasco lake watershed extends over approximately 530 km2 and its bedrock geology is composed of limestone sandstone and shale oglesby 1973 the main tributaries to the lake include the owasco inlet which accounts for 60 of the land area draining to the lake dutch hollow brook venness brook and sucker brook each of these streams has several small tributaries in addition there are roughly fifty minor channels perennial and intermittent that flow directly into the lake fig 1 according to the 2010 census approximately 16 000 people live in the watershed predominantly in the towns of moravia groton owasco as well as in several small rural aggregates the lake s shoreline is mainly used for recreational activities and is characterized by seasonal housing the towns of groton and moravia have a developed sewage system with a wastewater treatment plant wwtp that uses a tertiary p treatment the rest of the watershed utilizes septic systems cayuga county 2015 the land is used mainly for agricultural purposes 21 6 of the watershed area is cultivated with crops and 26 4 with hay and pasture for livestock of the remaining area 34 is forested while the rest is distributed among other uses 5 of which is classified as developed multi resolution land characteristics mrlc consortium 2011 according to the 2017 agricultural census cayuga county has 225 204 acres of land occupied by farms this constitutes a total of 842 farms of which 200 of varying sizes from 19 to 2000 acres are estimated to be located in the owasco lake watershed area wright and haight 2011 corn wheat soybeans hay and sweet corn are the major crops grown in the watershed the majority of which is destined to feed and forage dairy and beef cows cayuga county 2015 based on the 2017 agricultural census cayuga county ranked second in new york state for the market value of agricultural products sold livestock poultry and its products represented 75 of the sales with cow milk representing the highest value the 2017 census cattle and cow inventory reported 94 427 heads distributed around the county in 656 farms the majority of the farms 87 were small fewer than 200 cows and 85 farms reported more than 200 heads in one facility note however that more detailed locations on farms is not publicly available and even though agriculture is the primary economic activity in the area covering the majority of the watershed area there is no official information describing agricultural management practices in the watershed a general overview of practices applied in the area however was derived from personal communications with officials from the cayuga county administration and from the soil and water conservation district manure spreading and application of inorganic fertilizer are the predominant methods of fertilization at farms in the watershed fertilizer is generally applied close to planting may june and around mid summer for side dress manure spreading is used as both a way to fertilize crop and to handle waste from dairy and livestock producing farms manure is generally applied closed to planting and could also be apply close to harvest oct nov to some crops such as hay ground and small grains amounts are highly farm specific depending on specific nutrient management plans in general large facilities use storage to manage application and benefit nutrient management while small farms lacking storage facilities will likely apply manure to surrounding crops on a daily basis based on 2017 agricultural census at the county level there are 121 452 acres treated with fertilizer and 40 817 treated with manure given the 94 000 cows located in cayuga county farmers have to dispose of approximately 4 3 million kg of manure daily 2 2 sampling design twelve small tributaries to the lake were selected for sampling to represent the diversity of land uses in the watershed small watersheds were chosen as to isolate impacts of the main three land uses agriculture 80 percent or more of the total surface dedicated to agriculture labeled henceforth as a1 a2 and a3 forest 70 percent or more forest cover labeled as f1 f2 and f3 and mixed agriculture and forest between 40 60 percent of total surface dedicated to agriculture labeled m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 mixed land use watersheds usually included residential areas with associated impervious surfaces and septic systems and together with agriculture land use are here considered as impacted watersheds forest land use watersheds are here considered as baseline sub watersheds associated with each study site ranged between 0 2 to 13 2 km2 in surface area fig 1 2 3 water sampling and analyses water samples from each tributary were collected for total phosphorus tp soluble reactive phosphorus srp nitrate nitrite nox n and total suspended sediments tss from december 2015 to november 2016 sampling was conducted at monthly intervals during the winter and biweekly throughout the rest of the year water samples were collected in 1 l acid washed polypropylene bottles stored at 4 c in a cooler and transported to the soil and water lab at cornell university located in ithaca new york once in the lab each 1 l sample was divided into three parts for the various analyses approximately 50 ml were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm filter supor membrane disc filter 25 mm diameter and stored for srp and nitrate analysis additional unfiltered 550 ml subsamples were stored separately for tp and tss analysis all the samples were stored at 4 c to halt potential microbial cycling of nutrients we decreased the ph to 2 by adding 30 h2so4 before storage nutrient analyses were run within 4 weeks after collection and preservation tss was analyzed within 7 days of collection in addition to the chemical analyses during each sampling event we measured four environmental variables including ph fisher scientific accumet 166 research ar 50 conductivity fisher ar50 dissolved oxygen ysi 550a yellow springs instruments and temperature ysi 550a phosphorus analysis was done on an automated wet chemistry analyzer fs3000 xylem analytics o i analytical beverly massachusetts screening for phosphate anions po3 4 in srp and tp samples tp samples were first digested with persulfate and sulfuric acid us epa 1978 and then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter supor membrane disc filter 25 mm diameter reagents for analysis were ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid sulfuric acid and potassium antimonyl tartate us epa 1978 each run was calibrated using 0 005 0 05 0 5 5 and 10 ppm potassium phosphate standards with all r2 values between 0 9998 and 0 9999 in addition all samples were analyzed for nitrate nitrite resulting in a combined nox n value using a microplate reader following the griess sulfanilamide colorimetric method as developed by doane and horwáth 2003 each run was calibrated using 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 ppm potassium nitrate standards with all r2 values of the standard curves between 0 95 and 0 99 for tss analysis water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter supor membrane disc filter 25 mm diameter and tss concentration was determined by calculating the mass difference of the filter before and after oven drying at 60 c for 24 h divided by the water volume filtered in addition to regular monthly grab samples several storm events were sampled between april and november using both grab samples and continuous automated samplers two isco auto samplers were deployed to capture representative complete storm events during summer and fall one in a forested sub catchment site f1 and one in an agricultural area site a4 fig 1 a water level actuator was used to trigger the auto sampler every time the stream level increased 0 5 cm above baseflow level and was manually adjusted every two weeks to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the water table auto samplers were programmed to collect 250 ml samples every 15 min for 12 h the auto sampler bottles were pre acidified with 0 5 ml concentrated sulfuric acid to guarantee sample preservation within 48 h of the storm the samples collected were analyzed individually for sediments and phosphorus concentrations and then averaged to obtain a daily concentration and load value which was then incorporated in the final database for analysis 2 4 tributary hydrologic measurements when streams allowed access discharge was calculated using measured velocity and cross sectional area of the stream turnipseed and sauer 2010 discharge data were used in conjunction with chemical concentrations to calculate loads water velocity was measured with a portable flow meter marsh mcbirney flo mate model 2000 at several points between four and 15 across the stream every 6 15 or 30 cm depending on stream width as much as possible the measurements were taken at the same stream section during each sampling event when the water level was too low water depth below 3 cm to use a velocity meter a small neutrally buoyant object was used to estimate average velocity or if a culvert was nearby the time required to fill a container of known volume was used to determine discharge in either case three measurements were averaged to obtain the final estimation since the monitored streams are ungauged and due to logistical reasons we were unable to measure discharge at every site during storm events sampled with iscos the continuous flow measurements at the nearest usgs station owasco inlet station 4235299 fig 1 were used to estimate the discharge at sites f1 and a4 throughout the sampled storms events by correcting the measurements by sub watershed area hirsch 1979 2 5 data and statistical analysis the data analysis was structured into two phases in the first phase we used a descriptive analysis in order to characterize the hydrology and water quality of the tributaries to characterize water quality at the tributaries we computed annual summary statistics for the six water quality parameters measured due to the ungauged nature of the tributaries we used data from usgs station at the owasco lake inlet 4235299 and from the noaa station at auburn 00300321 to plot discharge hydrography and annual precipitation for the whole watershed for the period 2015 2016 in addition 2016 annual flow and precipitation statistics were used in a comparison with historical values for the last 30 years in the second phase we used a two way analysis of variance anova with a tukey honest significant difference hsd pairwise comparison to assess the effect of land use and season on conductivity p nitrate nitrate and tss additionally anova estimates were used to predict the best concentration and load estimates for each combination of land use and season as p n and tss concentrations were directly correlated with stream flows we applied the anova only for the concentrations then we calculated the load estimates using the resulting concentration estimates and the area normalized stream flow per land use and season concentration intercept lu se lu se l o a d c o n c e n t r a t i o n β lu landusese seasonβ area normalized stream flow per land use and season in order to account for having multiple measurements over time from each site water quality parameters were averaged for each sampling season and site before statistical analyses whenever the distribution of water quality measurements was non normal a square root transformation was applied before the analysis results were considered significant when p values 0 05 all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3 2 5 r project for statistical computing 3 results 3 1 hydrology of the owasco lake watershed hydrologic processes in the owasco lake watershed shift seasonally based on historical data from usgs gauge station at the owasco lake inlet over the last 56 years 1960 2016 the highest mean monthly discharge usually occurs between march and april associated with snowmelt and the lowest mean monthly discharge has been observed between july and september when base flow is relatively constant stream discharges generally increase again in october after leaf fall and evapo transpirative losses decline due to the combination of reduced vegetation and storms fig 2 however 2016 was an unusually dry year with a mean annual discharge 3 33 m3 s well below the annual mean 4 34 m3 s over the last 56 years 1960 2016 the 2016 annual runoff 384 mm was notably lower than the annual mean of the last 56 year period 503 mm us geological survey 2016 mean precipitation for 2016 1124 mm was also somewhat lower than the annual mean of the last 20 years 1209 mm and the precipitation during the growing season was significantly lower in comparison to the historical mean noaa 2017 sweet et al 2017 the us drought monitor classifies droughts into 5 categories ranging from abnormally dry conditions d0 to exceptional drought d5 during 2016 95 or more of cayuga county s total area was classified in at least one of the five drought categories from june 7th to december

measurements for the 12 small tributaries monitored in this study the unusual 2016 drought conditions became more evident following the typical annual hydrograph in 2016 the tributaries discharge peaks occurred during the spring months april and may and then decreased to baseflow conditions by the beginning of june fig 3 in all the sites the period extending from june to october experienced extreme low flows with intermittent and in some cases extended periods of no flow of the twelve tributaries monitored in this study only two sites m5 and f2 ran continuously between june and october while the remaining ten sites experienced periods of no flow such drought periods varied in length for each site from a minimum of 1 week and up to 22 weeks table 1 at the end of october october 20th to 24th the area experienced the largest rain event of the year fig 2 which restored flow in all the streams during this event streams located in sites dominated by agricultural and mix uses exhibited a secondary peak in their annual hydrograph while streams located in forested areas did not show a significant second peak in their hydrographs even when flow conditions were restored fig 3 interestingly the peak flow resulting from the mixed land use was greater than that of agriculture with forested being lowest between october 20th and october 24th 136 6 mm of rain fell in the area with 77 2 mm falling during the first 24 h based on the precipitation frequency estimates for auburn meteorological station noaa station id 30 0321 a rain of 77 2 mm in 24 h has an average recurrence interval of 10 years while a rainfall of 136 6 mm in four days has a recurrence interval of 25 years noaa s atlas 14 we consider this event as an extreme rainfall that occurred after a prolonged drought that was also anomalous for the area which gave us an extraordinary opportunity to assess the impact of combined extremes event on nutrients runoff and water quality 3 2 water quality summary for the owasco lake tributaries a total of 212 water samples were collected throughout the study including 114 grab samples and 98 additional isco samples the number of samples was highly variable across tributaries due to the drought influence see table 1 for detailed information on samples per tributary over the same period 98 measurements of discharge were made analytical results of surface water samples indicated that stream waters were slightly alkaline with annual mean ph values ranging from 7 91 to 8 14 the lowest and highest individual ph values were observed at site f3 during fall 7 38 and spring 8 56 respectively fig 4 table sm1 mean annual dissolved oxygen do ranged from 8 06 to 11 93 mg l while individual do values ranged from 5 20 to 14 40 mg l fig 4 table sm1 the lowest values were observed during the summer at sites a2 a4 f2 f3 and a5 ranging between 5 2 and 6 0 mg l while the highest values were observed at f1 m1 and m2 between 14 0 and 14 4 mg l during the winter fig 4 annual mean conductivity ranged between 129 6 and 483 5 μs cm while individual values ranged from 106 to 659 μs cm table sm1 the highest individual conductivity values were observed at sites a1 a2 and a4 659 644 and 644 μs cm respectively during the october 20th storm event while the lowest values were measured at sites m3 and m4 during the winter 106 and 107 μs cm respectively annual mean tp concentrations for the tributaries ranged between 0 04 mg l and 0 20 mg l the highest individual tp values were observed during the october 20th rain event at sites a3 and a2 0 86 and 0 43 mg l

61 37 mg l and loads during winter 16000 g d km2 table 3 4 discussion results of this research provided valuable insights into the dynamic and process driven chemical loading into owasco lake as these processes are increasingly being affected by climate driven extremes in precipitation patterns as expected this study supports previous findings in that we observed that agricultural land uses were an overall greater p and nox n contributor both in concentration and loads relative to forested land use carpenter et al 1998 jarvie et al 2010 there were noteworthy differences in p seasonal contributions with agricultural areas presenting its higher p loads during the fall at the end of the growing season and forested areas presenting higher p loads during the winter possibly due to leaf litter entering streams bratt et al 2017 cowen and lee 1973 with respect to nitrogen seasonal variations did not seem to have a significant effect on nitrogen contributions instead land use was the main driver of nitrogen differences between sites with agricultural areas presenting the highest nitrogen concentrations and loads relative to other land uses throughout the entire year tss followed expected patterns for agricultural watersheds with highs in spring and fall when farm fields are uncovered and exposed to erosion however the most interesting findings emerged from the behaviors associated with the occurrence of the 2016 summer drought that was followed by a large rainstorm at the end of october this event provided a unique opportunity to evaluate how predicted climate change might affect patterns of nutrients loading in coming decades during the drought period there was little to no flow and chemical transport in the tributaries the first and simultaneously intense rain event post drought resulted in significant transfer of p and sediment from the landscape to the tributaries interestingly the highest peak flows were measured in mixed use areas possibly due to contributions from the greater extent of impervious surface area as compared to both the forested and agricultural land use however the greatest p concentrations and loads came from agricultural land use while the lowest flows and p inputs were from forested landscapes these findings have important implications for managing lake water quality in order to reduce drivers of eutrophication in the context of climate change improved management of all parts of the watershed including maximizing forested cover controlling stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces and implementing bmps for erosion and nutrient management will work cumulatively to buffer the impacts of climate extremes 4 1 water quality at owasco lake tributaries seasonal and land use effect land uses among the different catchments around owl play key roles in how much they contribute to nutrient loading total phosphorus and srp both exhibited a strong significant interaction between land use and season post hoc comparisons showed that tp and srp concentrations were significantly higher in agricultural areas compared to forested and mixed land uses during the fall season with no significant differences during winter spring or summer overall p concentrations and loads for agricultural sub watersheds were higher than the reported for dutch hollow brook sub watershed in 2016 by halfman et al 2016 highlighting the importance of small tributaries as nutrient contributors to owl it is worth noticing that the major differences between values in this study and those reported by halfman et al 2016 correspond to the fall season for which halfman et al 2016 assessed baseflow samples whereas this study included baseflow as well as stormflow sampling on a regional scale spring and fall seasonal loads were relatively similar to those estimated by makarewicz et al 2015 for the genesee river watershed likewise prestigiacomo et al 2016 reported srp concentrations for fall creek ranging between 0 and 0 045 mg l for april october interval of 2013 while in our study spring and summer mean srp concentration in agricultural sub watersheds were 0 021 and 0 35 mg l respectively for the rest of the water quality parameters land uses also played an important role for nox n there was a strongly significant effect of land uses with agricultural areas exhibiting significantly higher nox n concentrations compared to mixed and forested areas surprisingly however there was no observed seasonal effect and nox n results did not match the usual seasonal nitrogen dynamic in ne us typically higher nitrate concentrations have been documented during winter and spring and attributed winter storm flushing and repeated leaching with high vegetation uptake rates driving lower concentrations during the summer ohte and katsuyama 2019 the shift in nox n season patterns documented in our study may be explained by the unusual weather of 2016 which presented an extreme drought followed by an intense rain event and where none of the nutrients behaved according to the usual dynamics although not measured decreased vegetative growth due to extremely dry soils might also explain reduced nitrogen uptake by plants during the drought conductivity of the stream samples exhibited a strong interaction effect of land use and seasons post hoc comparisons showed that conductivity was significantly higher in agricultural areas during spring summer and fall the differences observed among land uses agree with the expectations for agricultural areas yielding higher conductivity values as it has been reported before okamoto tanaka et al 2015 one possible explanation for higher conductivity levels in agricultural sub watershed might be related to manure application during the growing season which has been already correlated with higher conductivity values ju et al 2007 roberts and clanton 2000 for tss there was no effect of seasons and or land uses yielding similar tss concentrations and loads in agricultural and forested areas along the year it is not clear why agricultural and forested areas had similar tss levels but previous research in the region has shown that steep land correlates with agricultural abandonment flinn et al 2005 steep watersheds will result in high kinetic energy streams which foster higher erosion rates than low topography watersheds especially during high intensity rain events in our study agricultural sub catchments slopes ranged in between 0 20 degrees while forested areas slopes were generally steeper and ranged between 10 60 degrees the high intensity october rain event likely caused in stream bank erosion and increased sediment export 4 2 the drought and post drought rain effect on nutrients dynamic overall our results suggest that in 2016 the prolonged drought followed by an intense rain event was the process driving seasonal p dynamics in the owl tributaries the drought dated between june and october 2016 ndmc university of nebraska usda 2017 sweet et al 2017 provoked extremely low flow levels in the owasco lake tributaries which masked the land use effect during spring and summer on stream p concentrations and loads a close examination of the time series for tp and srp concentrations fig 6 b c seemed to indicate that the seasonal fall effect was driven by the storm event that occurred on october 20th when tp and srp concentrations in agricultural areas almost tripled in magnitude compared with previous seasons winter spring and summer of 2016 different than p neither seasons nor the drought seemed to influence nox n concentrations by analyzing the nox n time series not shown we noted that agricultural areas always presented higher concentrations regardless of seasonality and or the drought and post drought rain effect similarly when we analyzed conductivity time series the drought did not seem to play a key role in conductivity patterns fig 6a the combined drought and post drought effects on nutrient export patterns from different land uses have been captured inonly a few other studies mosley 2015 observed that as runoff decreased during dry periods the catchment influence on stream water also decreased suggesting that the processes dominating stream water quality differed between low and high flow scenarios as the relative importance of water sources varied according to hydroclimatic conditions elsdon et al 2009 reported no differences in nutrient parameters between urban and rural estuaries in south australia during drought conditions showing that as the proportion of sampled water coming from runoff decreased the influence of land use in nutrient parameters decreased as well in addition there are several studies evaluating the effect of drought events on different water quality parameters and specifically focused on water conductivity and main ion concentrations e g chloride sodium and sulfate as an approximate measure of total dissolved ions burt et al 2015 caruso 2002 2001 foster and walling 1978 hellwig et al 2017 mosley et al 2012 muchmore and dziegielewski 2007 nosrati 2011 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 such studies have shown a deterioration of water quality during drought events as solute concentrations increase and suggest that the concentration effect is a result of low flows and evaporation as opposed to the dilution effect that will usually prevail during high flows our results agreed with these studies for forested and mixed areas where we observed the highest conductivity values during the dry period fig 6a however for agricultural areas the drought effect on conductivity was less clear suggesting there might be other variables that influenced conductivity levels such as manure application nutrient dynamics seem to be less consistent in their response to drought and highly related to the nutrient source involved some authors reported a decrease in stream nutrient concentrations in drought to pre drought comparisons mainly as a result of reduced runoff during dry periods in areas dominated by nps pollution baurès et al 2013 boar et al 1995 caruso 2002 2001 golladay and battle 2002 morecroft et al 2000 mosley et al 2012 oelsner et al 2007 on the other hand several studies in areas where point sources of pollution predominate have as expected reported an increase in nutrient concentrations during drought periods andersen et al 2004 boar et al 1995 caruso 2002 2001 davies 1978 macintosh et al 2011 oborne et al 1980 sprague 2005 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 moreover studies in areas where the relative importance of water sources surface vs groundwater change seasonally or which may have changed over time due to fluctuations in hydrometeorological conditions showed no significant changes in nutrient concentrations between drought periods and reference years garcía prieto et al 2012 hellwig et al 2017 wilbers et al 2009 several authors have emphasized the role of biological activity on nutrient concentrations during drought events as temperature increases biological uptake increases which contributes to lower nutrient concentrations during droughts caruso 2001 hellwig et al 2017 our results for these parameters were ambiguous with tp and srp showing a slight increase in concentration from agricultural lands during the drought but sustained low concentrations for the other two land uses fig 6 b c these results emphasize the importance of the land use season interaction in the case of n we did observe a slight decrease in concentration from agricultural lands toward the end of the drought period however not pronounced enough to show a significant effect of seasons and or the drought event on nitrogen dynamics more work on the impacts of drought on tributary chemical loading is clearly needed the effect of rain events occurring immediately post drought deserves special attention in particular high intensity or high magnitude rain events are already increasing in frequency throughout the ne us and elsewhere horton et al 2014 studies of a prolonged drought in sw england between may 1975 and august 1976 burt et al 2015 foster and walling 1978 worrall and burt 2008 concluded that solutes and or nitrate concentrations increased dramatically during the first rain event after the drought burt et al 2015 analyzed conductivity major cations and ph during the first few storms after a drought period for one small catchment their results showed a significant concentration increase during the first rain event after the drought with conductivity peaking drastically and total dissolved solids concentrations doubling when compared to pre storm levels the second rain event also showed a concentration increase but more subdued than the first one while stream response to the third storm returning to a more typical dilution effect process suggested that the supply of readily available soluble loads had been exhausted during the first two events foster and walling 1978 studied the effect of the first post drought rain event in conductivity and nitrate concentrations suggesting that the source of high solute levels was the dissolution of soluble residues that accumulated and concentrated in the soil during the drought period as a result of evaporation of soil moisture and capillary rise in addition worrall and burt 2008 suggested that drought events might change the delivery pattern of water quality constituents retaining them in catchments during dry conditions and releasing during wet conditions interestingly we did not observe a similar effect of the first storm event after the drought on nox n however we did observe a similar dynamic for p nitrogen results are a bit surprising as we had expected to find a strong influence of dry wet conditions on stream nitrogen given previous observations and well stablished set of evidence showing n dynamic under dry wet conditions creed et al 1996 creed and band 1998 ohte and katsuyama 2019 however is worth noticing that we only measured two forms of n nitrate nitrite which seemed not enough to capture the whole nitrogen dynamic which includes many more possible pathways than p including gaseous phases there are several biogeochemical processes that could be involved in nutrient and dissolved solids releases to streams after dry periods although the details of the mechanisms are not well understood particularly for phosphorus haynes and swift 1989 suggested that dry conditions can disrupt organic coating on mineral particles exposing fresh surface for sorption and or desorption processes particularly the capacity for adsorption can be reduced under dry condition due to alterations on the soil mineral crystal structure mclaughin et al 1981 smith and jacinthe 2014 showed that soil cores that were exposed to drought conditions presented higher p release upon rewetting compared to cores that were not exposed to dry conditions in their experiment p flux was independent of total p in the soil showing a high impact of soil drying in p mobility similarly schönbrunner et al 2012 showed that in riverine floodplain systems tp released into the water column increased with increasing duration of the dry period prior to rewetting and the degree of drying was the major determinant controlling p release upon rewetting in addition beside soil p concentrations and its biogeochemical processes during dry wet periods hydroclimatic conditions and storm characteristics can also play a major role on p mobilization upon rewetting vadas et al 2011 demonstrated that as the relative runoff to rain ratio increased so does the amount of dissolved p that gets released the wetness condition of the soil can also play a fundamental role as dry soil may absorb more water during rain events reducing p losses however whenever relative runoff to rain ratio is large this variable drive dissolved p concentration in runoff regardless of soil conditions and timing between storm and manure and or fertilizer application microbial dynamics may also be altered during dry periods although the evidence is less consistent on one hand some studies show higher p uptake by microbes during dry conditions as temperature might increase microbial activity caruso 2001 hellwig et al 2017 and changes in p adsorption capacity can allow for greater microbe access to bounded particles olander and vitousek 2004 on the other hand p mineralization from microbial sources can also prevail during dry periods as microbial cells can desiccate provoking lysis processes when exposed to prolonged periods of drought kieft et al 1987 schönbrunner et al 2012 considering the discussed potential biogeochemical and microbial effects on nutrient release there are several processes and mechanisms that can be postulated as drivers of the particular p dynamics observed during 2016 improving our understanding on the interaction between these processes and mechanisms and weather factors is highly important to deepen our understanding of nutrient dynamics and will contribute to the improvement of management practices under climate change scenarios although it was beyond the scope of this study we suggest possible explanations and venture a hypothesis that might help to explain the observed results we suggest that the first post drought rain event of fall 2016 had a large influence on stream water quality by mobilizing accumulated pools of tp and srp we hypothesize that the lack of storm runoff for weeks to months allowed p to accumulate in the watershed as p has fewer pathways out of the watershed other than surface runoff and to a lesser extent leaching into the groundwater in addition as previous evidence suggest dry conditions might allow for several biogeochemical processes impacting soil p speciation and availability for consumption and or mobilization moreover the first storm event after the drought coincided with the most intense precipitation event of the year with a recurrence interval of 25 years generating large enough runoff to result in a flushing effect that drastically increased stream p concentration in our study this first post drought rain event occurred in late october after fields had been harvested and before any cover crops could become established as such the agricultural landscape was most vulnerable to runoff processes contrary to the effect of the drought which masked the effect of land uses on p export the first rain event after the drought exacerbated the differences among land uses with significantly larger concentrations and loads observed in agricultural areas the p dynamic was then influenced by many factors such as soil p concentration soil biogeochemical processes under dry wet conditions and storm event characteristics all which determine the final phosphorus concentrations and loads into the streams our results together with previous studies on the effect of the first rainfall after a drought on water quality burt et al 2015 foster and walling 1978 worrall and burt 2008 provide evidence towards recognizing the first few storm events after a drought period as hot moments mcclain et al 2003 for nutrient export in areas where npss dominate over point sources we speculate that the large storm in october saturated parts of the landscape and then continuous rain connected many of these saturated areas to the stream generating a network of saturation excess flow paths e g dunne and black 1970 which provided conduits for p to be transported from the landscape to the stream although the processes and mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena need further investigation the results and proposed hypotheses presented in this study are highly important for deepening our understanding on the effects of climate extremes on nutrients dynamic these results could prove useful to water managers in the context of rapid climate change as projections for the ne us suggest that summer rains are likely to become concentrated in fewer events of higher intensities interspaced with more prolonged dry periods hayhoe et al 2007 horton et al 2014 landscapes covered with forests and other vegetation clearly provide greater protection during large storm events which reduces peak flows in the streams and the potential for p transport mixed land uses will be particularly vulnerable to high intensity rain events as their extensive impervious surfaces rapidly convey stormwater to streams contributing to peak erosive flows on the other hand agricultural landscapes are most vulnerable to climate extremes from a chemical contaminant standpoint hence it will be critical to include agricultural management practices that help reduce environmental impacts greater implementation of bmps such as cover crops riparian buffers and cattle fencing along streams and roadside ditches and water and sediments control basins will all help to reduce p and sediment transport as it has already been demonstrated at farm scale in the owl watershed georgakakos et al 2018 and at a watershed scale in other areas along the region herendeen and glazier 2009 makarewicz et al 2009 zollweg and makarewicz 2009 in addition reducing p accumulation in the soil by amending animal manure with n knighton et al 2017 could also prove to be an effective practice to reduce p loads during intense rain events the main findings of this paper help to better understand the interaction between land uses and hydroclimatic conditions and its impact on nutrient runoff in the context of climate extremes still many pieces and interactions of the complex p dynamic need to be revealed in order to understand the fate of p loads and its role in aquatic ecosystems our results showed the highest p load from agricultural areas to the lake at the end of october however toxic algal blooms in general occur during late summer when lake water temperature reach ideal values for cyanobacteria to grow among other conditions i e wind species interactions etc in particular during 2016 owasco lake experienced a highly toxic algal bloom during the first days of september dry period resulting in high concentrations of toxins in the lake water and to a lesser extent into the drinking water supply nys dec 2018 this event highlights the complexity of the system and the necessity for further studies and better understanding of the mechanisms underlying nutrient dynamic and fate and its resulting ecological impact 5 conclusions we expected spring and summer nutrients concentrations and loads to be higher compared to other seasons due to the intensity of recreational and agricultural activities during the growing season however nox n loads were similar along the year while the highest p load in 2016 occurred during the fall presumably due to a prolonged summer drought followed by one large storm event in late october the first storm event after the drought exposed differences in nps loads among land uses with highest p concentrations from agriculture both the hydroclimatic conditions and anthropic activities seem to be controlling factors of p dynamics in this situation since dry years do not occur on a regular basis in the ne us the observations preliminary conclusions and inferences drawn from this study could prove useful for management purposes in the context of climate change one outstanding question is the ecological implications of the unusual p loading patterns in the receiving lake or reservoir i e how does a seasonal shift in p loading to later in the most biologically active period

west texas mesonet calibration and validation 1 introduction as a result of increasing demand for water resources due to population growth urbanization and irrigated agriculture optimizing the use of the limited available water especially in crop production systems is becoming more critical each year therefore in order to manage and conserve increasingly scarce water resources it is important to examine various methods that increase water use efficiency and reduce the excessive application of water the knowledge of crop evapotranspiration et is one of the most important factors in understanding crop water use irrigation scheduling proper water resources management crop production and water conservation generally the estimation of crop et involves calculating reference crop et eto and then multiplying the eto by an appropriate crop coefficient eto is defined as the evapotranspiration rate at which water would be removed from a reference surface where water is not limited or a limited factor allen et al 1998 the widely used equations which have been developed to estimate eto include american society of civil engineers asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation hereinafter referred to as the asce eto and the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation hereinafter referred to as the fao eto walter et al 2000 howes et al 2015 gurski et al 2018 akumaga et al 2017 gundalia and dholakia 2016 these asce eto and fao eto equations require the detailed climate data to estimate eto the major limitation of the penman monteith equation reported in many studies is the requirement of several meteorological variables that are often incomplete and or unavailable droogers and allen 2002 jabloun and sahli 2008 almorox et al 2015 samani 2000 alternatively the use of simple empirical equations which have a simple calculation procedure and provide reliable and consistent estimates of eto could offer a viable option of estimating eto with limited climate data for water resources and irrigation management and planning eto data estimated using simplified or empirical equations are of great importance at the local scale due to the fact that eto data obtained by measuring experimentally e g lysimetric measurements or eto estimates by applying more accurate and robust methods are not only very limited but also highly challenging martí et al 2015 the application of the fao eto equation has been reported to lead to errors especially when estimated variables as an alternative to measured values were used as inputs in eto computations jabloun and sahli 2008 kwon and choi 2011 the most important meteorological variables for eto estimation are air temperature and solar radiation samani 2000 the influence of these two meteorological variables in estimating eto has been repeatedly stressed in many studies some studies emphasized that at least 80 of eto variability is most likely the result of changes in temperature and solar radiation e g priestley and taylor 1972 jensen and allen 2016 samani 2000 other studies samani and pessarakli 1986 shuttleworth and maidment 1993 di stefano and ferro 1997 found that daily temperature range could be related to relative humidity and cloudiness vanderlinden et al 2004 reported that while advection depends on the interaction between temperature relative humidity vapor pressure and wind speed these variables could be related to the temperature range notably the air temperature is the most widespread monitored meteorological variable among the required inputs for eto estimation mendicino and senatore 2013 much attention has been paid to developing temperature based equations to estimate eto available temperature based equations include the well known hargreaves samani hereinafter referred to as the hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which has been recommended as one of the most simple and accurate empirical equation in several studies jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 the application of the hs equation for eto estimation has yielded contrasting results in different studies maestre valero et al 2013 observed that the performance of the hs equation in estimating eto using original parameters was strongly influenced by the climatic conditions of the location where it was developed a number of studies have reported the over and underestimation trends in humid and dry scenarios or under advective conditions e g tabari and talaee 2011 jensen et al 1990 itenfisu et al 2003 berengena and gavilán 2005 temesgen et al 2005 trajkovic 2007 other researchers suggested that the hs equation showed a tendency to overestimate eto at low evapotranspiration rates and vice versa droogers and allen 2002 xu and singh 2002 samani 2000 carried out site specific calibrations for the hs equation and recommended that the hs equation requires local calibration before applying it to different climatic conditions over the years numerous studies under different climatic conditions suggested that the regional calibration of temperature and radiation based equations improved the performance of these equations e g xu and singh 2002 bogawski and bednorz 2014 cadro et al 2017 most of the calibration studies in various locations with diverse climate conditions were carried out aiming the calibration of hs coefficients based on eto data obtained using the benchmark penman monteith equation itenfisu et al 2003 vanderlinden et al 2004 gavilán et al 2006 trajkovic 2007 mendicino and senatore 2013 berti et al 2014 the calibration of the hs equation using directly measured evapotranspiration data e g lysimetric measurements could be laborious time consuming and expensive as well as difficult because of the complexity associated with different environmental factors affecting field measurements among different calibration methods the most common approach is the calibration using simple linear regression in which the adjustment of hs coefficients is obtained by the regression based local calibration in addition after calibration increasing preciseness of temperature based methods in estimating evapotranspiration has been reported in several studies abbaspour 1991 zhai et al 2010 some studies calibrated only one hs coefficient in estimating eto droogers and allen 2002 tabari and talaee 2011 berti et al 2014 while other studies calibrated the hs equation by adjusting combinations of hs coefficients allen 1996 trajkovic 2007 bachour et al 2013 kra 2013 the local or regional calibration of the hs equation as numerous studies reveal is critical prior to its application in estimating eto besides improving the performance the locally or regionally calibrated hs equation can be used for short term and long term forecasting of daily eto xu et al 2012 luo et al 2014 lorite et al 2015 which is of the great importance for real time irrigation scheduling in crop production systems to our knowledge no prior studies have calibrated the hs equation in west texas therefore the main objective of this study was to develop a regional calibration of the hs equation using the fao eto based reference evapotranspiration in order to improve the performance of the hs equation in west texas the specific objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the original hs equation using the original coeficient values ii calibrate the hs equation for the study area using the available data iii derive monthly empirical coeficients of the hs equation using the fao eto based reference evapotranspiration and iv validate the original and calibrated hs equation within and outside of the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and meteorological data source as shown in fig 1 a the national climate data center ncdc divides texas into ten climate divisions where the climate divisions represent regions with similar characteristics such as vegetation temperature humidity rainfall and seasonal weather changes the list of texas climate divisions and their climate types are presented in table 1 based on data of texas water development board twdb 2017 and prism climate data daly et al 2008 average annual air temperature gradually increases from about 11 c in the northern panhandle of texas to about 23 c in the lower rio grande valley this excludes the isolated mountainous areas far west texas where temperatures are cooler than the surrounding arid valleys and basins average annual precipitation decreases from over 1397 mm in beaumont to less than 254 mm in el paso correspondingly average annual gross lake evaporation varies 1270 mm in east texas and 1900 mm in far west texas the variability of climate in texas is a consequence of interactions between the state s unique geographic location on the north american continent and several factors that result because of the state s location as shown in figs 1a and b the study area located in west texas is comprised of following four divisions high plains low rolling plains trans pecos and edwards plateau there are several weather networks in the state of texas including the u s climate reference

equation for a large number of stations in west texas in this study the weather data from the west texas mesonet hereinafter referred to as the wtm were used primarily because the wtm is the only network that covers west texas the wtm was established in 1999 to provide free timely and accurate meteorological and agricultural data to all residents of the south plains rolling plains region of western texas the wtm is a joint partnership between the atmospheric science group and wind science and engineering research center at texas tech university as of june 2018 the wtm originally intended to be a pilot project for a statewide texas mesonet consists of 115 automated surface meteorological stations covering more than 70 counties in 3 states the following data are collected at each station every one to five minutes i 10 meter wind speed and direction ii 9 meter temperature iii 2 meter wind speed iv 2 meter temperature v 1 5 meter temperature and relative humidity including dewpoint calculation vi barometric pressure using digital barometer calculations include station pressure and altimeter vii rainfall every 5 and 60 min and viii 2 meter solar radiation the readers are

many empirical and semi empirical equations have been developed for eto from meteorological data however they may not provide accurate estimates of eto without calibration when there is no eto measurements available a standard method for estimating eto can be used to develop or calibrate another selected empirical equation prior to its application the use of a standard equation to calibrate or validate another equation has been used and recommended by many researchers e g allen et al 1998 itenfisu et al 2003 irmak et al 2003 gavilán et al 2006 the fao expert consultation on revision of fao methodologies for crop water requirements recommended the use of the penman monteith equation as a standard method to calculate reference eto as well as calibrate or validate empirical methods smith 1992 in this study the fao eto i e the penman monteith equation equation was used to estimate eto the equation allen et al 1998 is given as follows 1 f a o e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a v g 273

to r n it may be ignored g 0 2 2 1 1 potential uncertainties of eto estimation in nonreference stations in an ideal setting weather stations should be centered within large nearly leveled expanses of uniform vegetation that are supplied with sufficient water to support et near maximum levels jensen and allen 2016 many of the wtm stations which do not meet all requirements of reference surface for eto estimation may induce an increase in air temperature and or a decrease in relative humidity resulting in an overestimation of eto calculated using fao eto jensen et al 1997 temesgen et al 1999 wind speeds over nonreference smooth dry surfaces are higher than those measured over reference surfaces jensen and allen 2016 the procedures suggested by allen and wright 1997 for adjusting nonreference wind speed data to represent reference conditions better have not been validated for a wide range of conditions asce 2005 in semi arid environments with strong advective conditions and high wind speed eto results provided by fao eto could be clearly overestimated allen 1996 temesgen et al 1999 by as much as 20 allen et al 2002 computation of eto using eq 1 is based on the weather data measured above a grass reference crop which has an extensive grass crop that is actively evaporating allen et al 1998 however such conditions are often not available howell 1999 de bruin et al 2010 cruz blanco et al 2015 allen et al 1998 and temesgen et al 1999 proposed a method to adjust temperature parameters to reflect well watered conditions however the comparison of eto computed using unadjusted and adjusted temperature of weather station data and lysimetric measurement at bushland texas showed a change in slope for regression passing through origin from 1 01 to 0 95 howell 1999 which was opposite to the change in davis california as reported by temesgen et al 1999 there is no general consensus in the literature about correction procedures or widely used standardized method e g hargreaves and merkley 2004 de bruin and trigo 2019 several authors have been using estimations provided by fao eto as the benchmark for comparison with other equations and methodologies gavilán et al 2006 er raki et al 2010 liu et al 2011 cammalleri and ciraolo 2013 cruz blanco et al 2015 although reference conditions requirements described in allen et al 1998 were not always fulfilled in this study we are using fao eto eq 1 as the reference for comparison and calibration of hargraves samani equation 2 2 2 the hargreaves samani hs equation the use of the fao eto equation as mentioned earlier requires a detailed meteorological data set hence for the locations at which the complete meteorological data is limited the hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which requires only maximum and minimum air temperatures data and location latitude for estimating eto mm d 1 hereinafter referred to as the hs eto can be used the hs equation used in this study is expressed as follows 17 h s e t o a 0 408 r a t a v g b t max t min c where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 t m a x is maximum air temperature c t m i n is the minimum air temperature c t a v g is calculated as the average of t m a x and t m i n c and the coefficient of 0 408 is used to convert from mj m 2 d 1 to mm d 1 coefficients a b and c are multiplier and offset parameters of the hs equation the original values of empirical coefficients a b and c are 0 023 17 8 and 0 5 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 2 3 calibration of the hargreaves samani hs equation and evaluation criteria as mentioned earlier the fao eto was chosen as the benchmark equation for comparison because of its well recognized accuracy in estimating eto in different locations under different weather conditions the performance of the hs equations with different calibrated parameters were evaluated by simple linear regression and simple error analysis the calibration of hs coefficients were conducted with the statistical programming language r version 3 2 2 r core team 2015 under a microsoft windows environment the multi parameter calibration for the hs equation was performed using the nls function from the nlstools package in r baty et al 2015 the correction proposed in this study was based on a regional calibration with datasets covering a diverse climatic conditions among the 88 meteorological stations datasets from the 48 10 years datasets stations were used for calibration of the hs equation while datasets from the other 40 10 years datasets stations located inside and outside of the study region were used for validation of the hs equation fig 1b and table 2 the fao eto method was also used as a reference for comparison statistical indices were used to provide quantitative analysis of eto estimates using the hs eto and fao eto equations the following statistical indices are adopted the coefficient of determination r2 18 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x 2 i 1 n y i y i 1 n x i x

reference and estimated data 3 results and discussion the performance of the original hs equation in estimating eto was first assessed then the equation was re parameterized by local calibration using global and monthly scales and by reginal calibration and finally the validation of the hs equation was performed 3 1 the original hargreaves samani against the fao penman monteith the comparison of daily eto estimated using the original hargreaves samani hereinafter referred to as the ohs eto equation hargreaves and samani 1985 versus daily eto using the fao penman monteith fao eto equation is shown in fig 2 the departure from the straight line 1 1 confirmed the unsatisfactory performance of ohs eto the ohs eto equation underestimated eto compared to fao eto considering all 48 calibration locations the mbe value as presented in table 3 is 0 785 mm d 1 rmse and the ratio between ohs eto and fao eto are 1 417 mm d 1 and 0 838 respectively table 3 suggesting that the ohs eto equation shows a considerable tendency to underestimate eto on average 16 for the 48 calibration locations this underestimation was in agreement with previous studies carried out in other arid and semiarid regions e g saeed 1986 hargreaves and allen 2003 the underestimation might be explained by the inability of the ohs eto equation to explicitly account for the effects of high winds and high vapor pressure deficits itenfisu et al 2003 the average daily wind speed of the 48 stations varied from 2 3 to 3 9 m s which was comparatively higher than the global average of 2 0 m s based on about 2 000 weather stations around the globe allen et al 1998 generally the wind removes saturated air from the boundary layer resulting in the increased evapotranspiration brutsaert 1991 diverse studies have suggested that the hargreaves samani equation tends to underestimate eto values especially when the wind speed is relatively high e g amatya et al 1995 xu and singh 2002 itenfisu et al 2003 martınez cob and tejero juste 2004 berengena and gavilán 2005 temesgen et al 2005 maestre valero et al 2013 the use of wind functions to adjust the hargreaves samani equation in semiarid regions has been also suggested in several studies for example martınez cob and tejero juste 2004 proposed a wind based site specific qualitative calibration of the hargreaves samani eto estimation equation however the scarcity of reliable wind data and the complexity associated with different wind effects on eto due to interactions of wind temperature instrumentation biases etc jensen et al 1997 discouraged the development of wind functions for adjusting the hargreaves samani equation droogers and allen 2002 3 2 calibrated coefficients of the hargreaves samani hs equation in this section the performance of the globally monthly and regionally calibrated hargreaves samani equation with adjusted hs coefficients hereinafter referred to as the ahs eto were assessed against the fao penman monteith fao eto method 3 2 1 global calibration for hargreaves samani hs coefficients the 10 year daily eto data estimated using the fao penman monteith equation fao eto for the selected 48 meteorological stations were used to calibrate the hs equation globally the global calibration provided the best match of hs coefficients for the 10 year data in order to improve the accuracy of eto estimates ahs eto in west texas when complete metrological datasets at selected stations were not available as a result of multi parameter calibration as mentioned earlier using the nls function from the nlstools package in r baty et al 2015 one set of a b and c values were obtained fig 3 shows the comparison of eto estimated by the calibrated hargreaves samani ahs eto equation with adjusted single a and multiple a and b and a b and c coefficients versus eto estimated by the fao eto equation adjusted coefficient a 0 00270 obtained through the single parameter calibration was higher than its original value 0 00230 reported by hargreaves and samani 1985 statistics of eto estimated by the ahs eto equation versus eto estimated by the fao eto equation are presented in table 3 the globally calibrated hs equation ahs eto by adjusting three coefficients a 0 00138 b 24 49 and c 0 685 had the best performance with the comparison between ahs eto and fao eto estimations produced an r2 of 0 772 an rmse of 1 113 mm d 1 an re of 0 234 and the d value of 0 943 the calibration of multiple coefficients led the slope of the regression line to be quite close to the unit thereby correcting the systematic underestimation of eto resulted in the original hs equation ohs eto without calibration similar discrepancies i e rmse me and d values between the ahs eto and fao eto values were reported in feng et al 2017 3 2 2 monthly calibration for hargreaves samani hs coefficients fig 4 illustrates monthly average of major weather parameters wind speed maximum and minimum temperature and fao eto data based on the daily datasets of all 48 stations a general aspect to be noted in figs 4 a through d is that there is high variability in monthly average maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed and eto fao eto values from january to december the calibration process was applied in all 48 stations and hs coefficients a b and c were adjusted for each month separately the monthly calibration of the hs equation resulted in twelve set of calibrated coefficients a b and c the ranges of coefficient values are presented in table 3 the adjusted values of the coefficient a which were comparatively higher than the common default value of 0 0023 hargreaves and samani 1985 varied from 0 00298 to 0 00690 the value of adjusted a was the highest in summer months june july and august due to the high temperature in inland stations the values of coefficient b varied between 7 604 and 13 870 which were comparatively lower than the default value of 17 8 the value of coefficient c which was quite close to the default value of 0 5 ranged from 0 413 to 0 596 the difference of the fitted hs coefficients with those reported in other studies for example coefficients proposed by allen 1993 may be due to the different climate regions alexandris et al 2008 hargreaves and allen 2003 daily eto were estimated using twelve monthly calibrated hs coefficients the comparison of eto estimated by ahs eto equation with adjusted multiple a b and c coefficients versus eto estimated by the fao eto equation was made the comparison between eto values estimated by the hs equation using monthly adjusted coefficients and those estimated by the fao penman monteith equation fao eto is depicted in fig 5 statistical measures of the hs equation performance as indicated by the substantial reduction in rmse re and mbe values and the substantial increase in r2 d and ratio values in table 3 suggest that the calibrated hs equation by adjusting monthly coefficients not only improved the eto estimation but also performed better than the global calibration specifically for the month having higher average wind speed fig 4c similar discrepancies i e rmse me and d between the ahs eto and fao eto values were reported in several studies under different climates luo et al 2014 heydari and heydari 2014 3 2 3 regional calibration for hargreaves samani hs coefficients extrapolation of locally calibrated hs coefficients to the other location would be possible if a relationship between the calibrated hs coefficient and other weather data measured at calibration stations could be established maestre valero et al 2013 a large number of attempts on regionalization of the hs coefficient under different climatic conditions were found in the literature e g samani 2000 vanderlinden et al 2004 gavilán et al 2006 lee 2010 zhai et al 2010 and mendicino and senatore 2013 these studies obtained reliable formulations for calibrated hs coefficients based on several parameters including the annual mean of daily temperature tave the annual mean of daily temperature range δt or the ratio tavg δt the station elevation m above the mean sea level and the ratio between mean annual precipitation of the station and global terrestrial mean annual precipitation ps pg based on the precedent studies cited above an overall correlation analysis including coefficient a tave δt tave δt and other parameters such as the elevation the mean daily precipitation p and the mean daily wind speed is presented in table 4 an important aspect to be noted in table 4 is that the hs coefficient a is highly correlated with the elevation and the wind speed whereas the correlation with other parameters is not statistically significant p value 0 05 α 95 fig 6 illustrates the relationships between the coefficient a and other variables including the wind speed the elevation the rainfall and the relative humidity based on the calibration datasets of all 48 stations as shown in fig 6 among the relationships between a and other variables the wind speed versus a relationship had the highest coefficient of determination r2 however there was a very weak relationship between a and the station elevation while the relationships between a and the rainfall and the relative humidity were considered to be negligibe the calibration of the hs equation based on station specific elevation and wind speed was considered and the only coefficient a of the hs equation was adjusted the station elevation and station wind speed based calibration resulted in relatively higher coefficient a value than its original value 0 00230 table 3 the station based calibration of the hs equation which provided the resulting a values in the range of 0 00239 0 00311 showed better performance with the statistics of r2 rmse re and d values were 0 781 1 142 mm d 1 0 236 and 0 943 respectively the coefficients a b and c of the hs equation were also calibrated at all 48 stations the resulting coefficient a ranging from 0 00081 to 0 00193 was smaller than its original value the resulting coefficient c ranged from 0 534 to 0 829 which was higher than its original value fig 7 shows the comparison of eto values ahs eto estimated by the regionally calibrated hs equation with adjusted coefficient a station specific station elevation and station wind speed based adjustments and coefficients a b and c station specific adjustments versus eto values estimated by the fao eto equation statistics of r2 rmse mbe re and ratio presented in table 3 and depicted in fig 7 suggest that there is generally a close agreement i e r2 ranging from 0 769 to 0 794 rmse ranging from 1 087 to 1 151 re ranging from 0 224 to 0 242 d ranging from 0 940 to 0 948 and ratio ranging from 0 976 to 0 992 between eto estimations by the regionally calibrated ahs eto equation and fao eto equation it is worth noting that among the four scenarios the comparison between ahs eto using calibrated station specific three coefficients a b and c and fao eto yielded relatively higher r2 0 794 and d 0 948 and lower rmse 1 087 mm d 1 and re 0 224 values using the calibrated coefficients of individual stations the spatial distribution of these hs coefficients within the calibration region was determined using an interpolation procedure i e kriging to obtain these coefficients in areas with no weather station kriging is geostatistical interpolation method that implies regression modeling followed by kriging of residuals kriging can be done with arcgis geostatistical analyst esri redland ca that uses the original data of regional variables and the structural characteristics of a variogram to estimate the attribute values of unknown points this method is widely used in various research areas čadro et al 2019 liu et al 2018 malamos and koutsoyiannis 2018 a gridded map of each of all the three coefficients was generated in the calibration region figs 8 a c to evaluate the performance of interpolated coefficients the relationships as shown in fig 8d suggest that the coefficients a and c are highly correlated r2 0 81 whereas the relationship between a and b yields comparatively lower r2 of 0 36 fig 9 shows the monthly variation of statistics used to evaluate the performance of the hs equation for the eto estimation without calibration i e with original coefficients and with three calibration scenarios i e hs coefficients a b and c were calibrated globally monthly and regionally as indicated by rmse mbe re and d values the calibrated hs equation did not substantially improve eto estimates during july august and september as compared to other months this is most likely attributed to as shown in fig 4 the lower average wind speeds during these months as compared to other months similar discrepancies between eto by the hs equation and eto by the fao penman monteith equation in areas with low or high wind speeds were reported in several studies e g martınez cob and tejero juste 2004 trajkovic 2005 3 3 validation of the hargreaves samani equation for validation purposes as illustrated in fig 1 16 and 24 stations a total of 40 stations inside and outside of the calibration region respectively with less than 10 years of weather data were used eto estimated by the hs equation using original and calibrated coefficients obtained through global monthly regional calibrations were compared and evaluated against the ones estimated by the standard fao eto method statistics of the hs equation performance for eto estimation during validation are presented in table 5 the performance of the calibrated hs equation for stations inside the calibration region was much better than stations outside the region however there was generally a close agreement between the hargreaves samani and fao penman monteith eto values when a total of selected 40 validation stations was considered with r2 values ranged from 0 727 to 0 807 rmse ranged from 1 070 to 1 533 mm d 1 mbe values ranged from 2 13 to 0 199 mm d 1 re ranged from 0 220 to 0 316 d ranged from 0 891 to 0 952 and ratio ranged from 0 832 to 1 015 there was no significant improvement in eto estimation by the hs equation with interpolated coefficients derived from station specific calibrated coefficients compared to globally calibrated coefficients based on all stations data used for calibration table 5 an important aspect to be noted during the hs equation validation is that eto estimated by the calibrated hs equation with fitted month specific hs coefficients were in close agreement with those estimated by the standard fao eto equation both within and outside the calibration region data not shown 4 conclusions the crop reference evapotranspiration eto estimated using the temperature based hargreaves samani

weather datasets at selected 88 west texas mesonet meteorological stations i e 48 calibration stations and 40 validation stations resulted in a systematic underestimation of eto as indicated by simple linear regression and error analysis results obtained by comparing hs eto with fao eto for example re 29 for calibration stations and average re 30 for validation stations to improve the performance of hs equation in west texas new coefficients of the hs equation using the fao eto based reference evapotranspiration were derived and proposed for more accurate daily eto estimates under limited climate data based on the results of different calibration scenarios i e global monthly and regional calibration for hs coefficients eto estimated using the calibrated and validated hs equation with fitted month specific coefficients showed much better performance as compared with those estimated using the fao eto equation both within and outside the calibration region i e r2 of 0 82 rmse of 0 99

improvement in eto estimation by the hs equation with interpolated coefficients derived from station specific calibrated coefficients compared with commonly calibrated coefficients derived based on datasets of all calibration stations in west texas further research should be undertaken to evaluate the calibrated hs equation proposed in this study using climate datasets from different weather networks in texas to improve the performance of this limited climate data based hs eto equation in texas in this study the standard fao eto was used without adjustments for local advection effects

local advection effects and adapted for semi arid regions including the advection revised makkink equation mak adv the readers are referred to de bruin et al 2012 and cruz blanco et al 2014 2015 for details on the mak adv approach the mak adv approach requires the input of solar radiation and air temperature at the height of 2 m future studies aimed at evaluating the usefulness of both mak adv

west texas mesonet calibration and validation 1 introduction as a result of increasing demand for water resources due to population growth urbanization and irrigated agriculture optimizing the use of the limited available water especially in crop production systems is becoming more critical each year therefore in order to manage and conserve increasingly scarce water resources it is important to examine various methods that increase water use efficiency and reduce the excessive application of water the knowledge of crop evapotranspiration et is one of the most important factors in understanding crop water use irrigation scheduling proper water resources management crop production and water conservation generally the estimation of crop et involves calculating reference crop et eto and then multiplying the eto by an appropriate crop coefficient eto is defined as the evapotranspiration rate at which water would be removed from a reference surface where water is not limited or a limited factor allen et al 1998 the widely used equations which have been developed to estimate eto include american society of civil engineers asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation hereinafter referred to as the asce eto and the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation hereinafter referred to as the fao eto walter et al 2000 howes et al 2015 gurski et al 2018 akumaga et al 2017 gundalia and dholakia 2016 these asce eto and fao eto equations require the detailed climate data to estimate eto the major limitation of the penman monteith equation reported in many studies is the requirement of several meteorological variables that are often incomplete and or unavailable droogers and allen 2002 jabloun and sahli 2008 almorox et al 2015 samani 2000 alternatively the use of simple empirical equations which have a simple calculation procedure and provide reliable and consistent estimates of eto could offer a viable option of estimating eto with limited climate data for water resources and irrigation management and planning eto data estimated using simplified or empirical equations are of great importance at the local scale due to the fact that eto data obtained by measuring experimentally e g lysimetric measurements or eto estimates by applying more accurate and robust methods are not only very limited but also highly challenging martí et al 2015 the application of the fao eto equation has been reported to lead to errors especially when estimated variables as an alternative to measured values were used as inputs in eto computations jabloun and sahli 2008 kwon and choi 2011 the most important meteorological variables for eto estimation are air temperature and solar radiation samani 2000 the influence of these two meteorological variables in estimating eto has been repeatedly stressed in many studies some studies emphasized that at least 80 of eto variability is most likely the result of changes in temperature and solar radiation e g priestley and taylor 1972 jensen and allen 2016 samani 2000 other studies samani and pessarakli 1986 shuttleworth and maidment 1993 di stefano and ferro 1997 found that daily temperature range could be related to relative humidity and cloudiness vanderlinden et al 2004 reported that while advection depends on the interaction between temperature relative humidity vapor pressure and wind speed these variables could be related to the temperature range notably the air temperature is the most widespread monitored meteorological variable among the required inputs for eto estimation mendicino and senatore 2013 much attention has been paid to developing temperature based equations to estimate eto available temperature based equations include the well known hargreaves samani hereinafter referred to as the hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which has been recommended as one of the most simple and accurate empirical equation in several studies jensen et al 1990 allen et al 1998 the application of the hs equation for eto estimation has yielded contrasting results in different studies maestre valero et al 2013 observed that the performance of the hs equation in estimating eto using original parameters was strongly influenced by the climatic conditions of the location where it was developed a number of studies have reported the over and underestimation trends in humid and dry scenarios or under advective conditions e g tabari and talaee 2011 jensen et al 1990 itenfisu et al 2003 berengena and gavilán 2005 temesgen et al 2005 trajkovic 2007 other researchers suggested that the hs equation showed a tendency to overestimate eto at low evapotranspiration rates and vice versa droogers and allen 2002 xu and singh 2002 samani 2000 carried out site specific calibrations for the hs equation and recommended that the hs equation requires local calibration before applying it to different climatic conditions over the years numerous studies under different climatic conditions suggested that the regional calibration of temperature and radiation based equations improved the performance of these equations e g xu and singh 2002 bogawski and bednorz 2014 cadro et al 2017 most of the calibration studies in various locations with diverse climate conditions were carried out aiming the calibration of hs coefficients based on eto data obtained using the benchmark penman monteith equation itenfisu et al 2003 vanderlinden et al 2004 gavilán et al 2006 trajkovic 2007 mendicino and senatore 2013 berti et al 2014 the calibration of the hs equation using directly measured evapotranspiration data e g lysimetric measurements could be laborious time consuming and expensive as well as difficult because of the complexity associated with different environmental factors affecting field measurements among different calibration methods the most common approach is the calibration using simple linear regression in which the adjustment of hs coefficients is obtained by the regression based local calibration in addition after calibration increasing preciseness of temperature based methods in estimating evapotranspiration has been reported in several studies abbaspour 1991 zhai et al 2010 some studies calibrated only one hs coefficient in estimating eto droogers and allen 2002 tabari and talaee 2011 berti et al 2014 while other studies calibrated the hs equation by adjusting combinations of hs coefficients allen 1996 trajkovic 2007 bachour et al 2013 kra 2013 the local or regional calibration of the hs equation as numerous studies reveal is critical prior to its application in estimating eto besides improving the performance the locally or regionally calibrated hs equation can be used for short term and long term forecasting of daily eto xu et al 2012 luo et al 2014 lorite et al 2015 which is of the great importance for real time irrigation scheduling in crop production systems to our knowledge no prior studies have calibrated the hs equation in west texas therefore the main objective of this study was to develop a regional calibration of the hs equation using the fao eto based reference evapotranspiration in order to improve the performance of the hs equation in west texas the specific objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the original hs equation using the original coeficient values ii calibrate the hs equation for the study area using the available data iii derive monthly empirical coeficients of the hs equation using the fao eto based reference evapotranspiration and iv validate the original and calibrated hs equation within and outside of the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and meteorological data source as shown in fig 1 a the national climate data center ncdc divides texas into ten climate divisions where the climate divisions represent regions with similar characteristics such as vegetation temperature humidity rainfall and seasonal weather changes the list of texas climate divisions and their climate types are presented in table 1 based on data of texas water development board twdb 2017 and prism climate data daly et al 2008 average annual air temperature gradually increases from about 11 c in the northern panhandle of texas to about 23 c in the lower rio grande valley this excludes the isolated mountainous areas far west texas where temperatures are cooler than the surrounding arid valleys and basins average annual precipitation decreases from over 1397 mm in beaumont to less than 254 mm in el paso correspondingly average annual gross lake evaporation varies 1270 mm in east texas and 1900 mm in far west texas the variability of climate in texas is a consequence of interactions between the state s unique geographic location on the north american continent and several factors that result because of the state s location as shown in figs 1a and b the study area located in west texas is comprised of following four divisions high plains low rolling plains trans pecos and edwards plateau there are several weather networks in the state of texas including the u s climate reference

equation for a large number of stations in west texas in this study the weather data from the west texas mesonet hereinafter referred to as the wtm were used primarily because the wtm is the only network that covers west texas the wtm was established in 1999 to provide free timely and accurate meteorological and agricultural data to all residents of the south plains rolling plains region of western texas the wtm is a joint partnership between the atmospheric science group and wind science and engineering research center at texas tech university as of june 2018 the wtm originally intended to be a pilot project for a statewide texas mesonet consists of 115 automated surface meteorological stations covering more than 70 counties in 3 states the following data are collected at each station every one to five minutes i 10 meter wind speed and direction ii 9 meter temperature iii 2 meter wind speed iv 2 meter temperature v 1 5 meter temperature and relative humidity including

many empirical and semi empirical equations have been developed for eto from meteorological data however they may not provide accurate estimates of eto without calibration when there is no eto measurements available a standard method for estimating eto can be used to develop or calibrate another selected empirical equation prior to its application the use of a standard equation to calibrate or validate another equation has been used and recommended by many researchers e g allen et al 1998 itenfisu et al 2003 irmak et al 2003 gavilán et al 2006 the fao expert consultation on revision of fao methodologies for crop water requirements recommended the use of the penman monteith equation as a standard method to calculate reference eto as well as calibrate or validate empirical methods

to r n it may be ignored g 0 2 2 1 1 potential uncertainties of eto estimation in nonreference stations in an ideal setting weather stations should be centered within large nearly leveled expanses of uniform vegetation that are supplied with sufficient water to support et near maximum levels jensen and allen 2016 many of the wtm stations which do not meet all requirements of reference surface for eto estimation may induce an increase in air temperature and or a decrease in relative humidity resulting in an overestimation of eto calculated using fao eto jensen et al 1997 temesgen et al 1999 wind speeds over nonreference smooth dry surfaces are higher than those measured over reference surfaces jensen and allen 2016 the procedures suggested by allen and wright 1997 for adjusting nonreference wind speed data to represent reference conditions better have not been validated for a wide range of conditions asce 2005 in semi arid environments with strong advective conditions and high wind speed eto results provided by fao eto could be clearly overestimated allen 1996 temesgen et al 1999 by as much as 20 allen et al 2002 computation of eto using eq 1 is based on the weather data measured above a grass reference crop which has an extensive grass crop that is actively evaporating allen et al 1998 however such conditions are often not available howell 1999 de bruin et al 2010 cruz blanco et al 2015 allen et al 1998 and temesgen et al 1999 proposed a method to adjust temperature parameters to reflect well watered conditions however the comparison of eto computed using unadjusted and adjusted temperature of weather station data and lysimetric measurement at bushland texas showed a change in slope for regression passing through origin from 1 01 to 0 95 howell 1999 which was opposite to the change in davis california as reported by temesgen et al 1999 there is no general consensus in the literature about correction procedures or widely used standardized method e g hargreaves and merkley 2004 de bruin and trigo 2019 several authors have been using estimations provided by fao eto as the benchmark for comparison with other equations and methodologies gavilán et al 2006 er raki et al 2010 liu et al 2011 cammalleri and ciraolo 2013 cruz blanco et al 2015 although reference conditions requirements described in allen et al 1998 were not always fulfilled in this study we are using fao eto eq 1 as the reference for comparison and calibration of hargraves samani equation 2 2 2 the hargreaves samani hs equation the use of the fao eto equation as mentioned earlier requires a detailed meteorological data set hence for the locations at which the complete meteorological data is limited the hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which requires only maximum and minimum air temperatures data and location latitude for estimating eto mm d 1 hereinafter referred to as the hs eto can be used the hs equation used in this study is expressed as follows 17 h s e t o a 0 408 r a t a v g b t max t min c where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 t m a x is maximum air temperature c t m i n is the minimum air temperature c t a v g is calculated as the average of t m a x and t m i n c and the coefficient of 0 408 is used to convert from mj m 2 d 1 to mm d 1 coefficients a b and c are multiplier and offset parameters of the hs equation the original values of empirical coefficients a b and c are 0 023 17 8 and 0 5 respectively hargreaves and samani 1985 2 3 calibration of the hargreaves samani hs equation and evaluation criteria as mentioned earlier the fao eto was chosen as the benchmark equation for comparison because of its well recognized accuracy in estimating eto in different locations under different weather conditions the performance of the hs equations with different calibrated parameters were evaluated by simple linear regression and simple error analysis the calibration of hs coefficients were conducted with the statistical programming language r version 3 2 2 r core team 2015 under a microsoft windows environment the multi parameter calibration for the hs equation was performed using the nls function from the nlstools package in r baty et al 2015 the correction proposed in this study was based on a regional calibration with datasets covering a diverse climatic conditions among the 88 meteorological stations datasets from the 48 10 years datasets stations were used for calibration of the hs equation while datasets from the other 40 10 years datasets stations located inside and outside of the study region were used for validation of the hs equation fig 1b and table 2 the fao eto method was also used as a reference for comparison statistical indices were used to provide quantitative analysis of eto estimates using the hs eto and fao eto equations the following statistical indices are adopted the coefficient of determination r2 18 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x 2 i 1 n y i y i 1 n x i x

reference and estimated data 3 results and discussion the performance of the original hs equation in estimating eto was first assessed then the equation was re parameterized by local calibration using global and monthly scales and by reginal calibration and finally the validation of the hs equation was performed 3 1 the original hargreaves samani against the fao penman monteith the comparison of daily eto estimated using the original hargreaves samani hereinafter referred to as the ohs eto equation hargreaves and samani 1985 versus daily eto using the fao penman monteith fao eto equation is shown in fig 2 the departure from the straight line 1 1 confirmed the unsatisfactory performance of ohs eto the ohs eto equation underestimated eto compared to fao eto considering all 48 calibration locations the mbe value as presented in table 3 is 0 785 mm d 1 rmse and the ratio between ohs eto and fao eto are 1 417 mm d 1 and 0 838 respectively table 3 suggesting that the ohs eto equation shows a considerable tendency to underestimate eto on average 16 for the 48 calibration locations this underestimation was in agreement with previous studies carried out in other arid and semiarid regions e g saeed 1986 hargreaves and allen 2003 the underestimation might be explained by the inability of the ohs eto equation to explicitly account for the effects of high winds and high vapor pressure deficits itenfisu et al 2003 the average daily wind speed of the 48 stations varied from 2 3 to 3 9 m s which was comparatively higher than the global average of 2 0 m s based on about 2 000 weather stations around the globe allen et al 1998 generally the wind removes saturated air from the boundary layer resulting in the increased evapotranspiration brutsaert 1991 diverse studies have suggested that the hargreaves samani equation tends to underestimate eto values especially when the wind speed is relatively high e g amatya et al 1995 xu and singh 2002 itenfisu et al 2003 martınez cob and tejero juste 2004 berengena and gavilán 2005 temesgen et al 2005 maestre valero et al 2013 the use of wind functions to adjust the hargreaves samani equation in semiarid regions has been also suggested in several studies for example martınez cob and tejero juste 2004 proposed a wind based site specific qualitative calibration of the hargreaves samani eto estimation equation however the scarcity of reliable wind data and the complexity associated with different wind effects on eto due to interactions of wind temperature instrumentation biases etc jensen et al 1997 discouraged the development of wind functions for adjusting the hargreaves samani equation droogers and allen 2002 3 2 calibrated coefficients of the hargreaves samani hs equation in this section the performance of the globally monthly and regionally calibrated hargreaves samani equation with adjusted hs coefficients hereinafter referred to as the ahs eto were assessed against the fao penman monteith fao eto method 3 2 1 global calibration for hargreaves samani hs coefficients the 10 year daily eto data estimated using the fao penman monteith equation fao eto for the selected 48 meteorological stations were used to calibrate the hs equation globally the global calibration provided the best match of hs coefficients for the 10 year data in order to improve the accuracy of eto estimates ahs eto in west texas when complete metrological datasets at selected stations were not available as a result of multi parameter calibration as mentioned earlier using the nls function from the nlstools package in r baty et al 2015 one set of a b and c values were obtained fig 3 shows the comparison of eto estimated by the calibrated hargreaves samani ahs eto equation with adjusted single a and multiple a and b and a b and c coefficients versus eto estimated by the fao eto equation adjusted coefficient a 0 00270 obtained through the single parameter calibration was higher than its original value 0 00230 reported by hargreaves and samani 1985 statistics of eto estimated by the ahs eto equation versus eto estimated by the fao eto equation are presented in table 3 the globally calibrated hs equation ahs eto by adjusting three coefficients a 0 00138 b 24 49 and c 0 685 had the best performance with the comparison between ahs eto and fao eto estimations produced an r2 of 0 772 an rmse of 1 113 mm d 1 an re of 0 234 and the d value of 0 943 the calibration of multiple coefficients led the slope of the regression line to be quite close to the unit thereby correcting the systematic underestimation of eto resulted in the original hs equation ohs eto without calibration similar discrepancies i e rmse me and d values between the ahs eto and fao eto values were reported in feng et al 2017 3 2 2 monthly calibration for hargreaves samani hs coefficients fig 4 illustrates monthly average of major weather parameters wind speed maximum and minimum temperature and fao eto data based on the daily datasets of all 48 stations a general aspect to be noted in figs 4 a through d is that there is high variability in monthly average maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed and eto fao eto values from january to december the calibration process was applied in all 48 stations and hs coefficients a b and c were adjusted for each month separately the monthly calibration of the hs equation resulted in twelve set of calibrated coefficients a b and c the ranges of coefficient values are presented in table 3 the adjusted values of the coefficient a which were comparatively higher than the common default value of 0 0023 hargreaves and samani 1985 varied from 0 00298 to 0 00690 the value of adjusted a was the highest in summer months june july and august due to the high temperature in inland stations the values of coefficient b varied between 7 604 and 13 870 which were comparatively lower than the default value of 17 8 the value of coefficient c which was quite close to the default value of 0 5 ranged from 0 413 to 0 596 the difference of the fitted hs coefficients with those reported in other studies for example coefficients proposed by allen 1993 may be due to the different climate regions alexandris et al 2008 hargreaves and allen 2003 daily eto were estimated using twelve monthly calibrated hs coefficients the comparison of eto estimated by ahs eto equation with adjusted multiple a b and c coefficients versus eto estimated by the fao eto equation was made the comparison between eto values estimated by the hs equation using monthly adjusted coefficients and those estimated by the fao penman monteith equation fao eto is depicted in fig 5 statistical measures of the hs equation performance as indicated by the substantial reduction in rmse re and mbe values and the substantial increase in r2 d and ratio values in table 3 suggest that the calibrated hs equation by adjusting monthly coefficients not only improved the eto estimation but also performed better than the global calibration specifically for the month having higher average wind speed fig 4c similar discrepancies i e rmse me and d between the ahs eto and fao eto values were reported in several studies under different climates luo et al 2014 heydari and heydari 2014 3 2 3 regional calibration for hargreaves samani hs coefficients extrapolation of locally calibrated hs coefficients to the other location would be possible if a relationship between the calibrated hs coefficient and other weather data measured at calibration stations could be established maestre valero et al 2013 a large number of attempts on regionalization of the hs coefficient under different climatic conditions were found in the literature e g samani 2000 vanderlinden et al 2004 gavilán et al 2006 lee 2010 zhai et al 2010 and mendicino and senatore 2013 these studies obtained reliable formulations for calibrated hs coefficients based on several parameters including the annual mean of daily temperature tave the annual mean of daily temperature range δt or the ratio tavg δt the station elevation m above the mean sea level and the ratio between mean annual precipitation of the station and global terrestrial mean annual precipitation ps pg based on the precedent studies cited above an overall correlation analysis including coefficient a tave δt tave δt and other parameters such as the elevation the mean daily precipitation p and the mean daily wind speed is presented in table 4 an important aspect to be noted in table 4 is that the hs coefficient a is highly correlated with the elevation and the wind speed whereas the correlation with other parameters is not statistically significant p value 0 05 α 95 fig 6 illustrates the relationships between the coefficient a and other variables including the wind speed the elevation the rainfall and the relative humidity based on the calibration datasets of all 48 stations as shown in fig 6 among the relationships between a and other variables the wind speed versus a relationship had the highest coefficient of determination r2 however there was a very weak relationship between a and the station elevation while the relationships between a and the rainfall and the relative humidity were considered to be negligibe the calibration of the hs equation based on station specific elevation and wind speed was considered and the only coefficient a of the hs equation was adjusted the station elevation and station wind speed based calibration resulted in relatively higher coefficient a value than its original value 0 00230 table 3 the station based calibration of the hs equation which provided the resulting a values in the range of 0 00239 0 00311 showed better performance with the statistics of r2 rmse re and d values were 0 781 1 142 mm d 1 0 236 and 0 943 respectively the coefficients a b and c of the hs equation were also calibrated at all 48 stations the resulting coefficient a ranging from 0 00081 to 0 00193 was smaller than its original value the resulting coefficient c ranged from 0 534 to 0 829 which was higher than its original value fig 7 shows the comparison of eto values ahs eto estimated by the regionally calibrated hs equation with adjusted coefficient a station specific station elevation and station wind speed based adjustments and coefficients a b and c station specific adjustments versus eto values estimated by the fao eto equation statistics of r2 rmse mbe re and ratio presented in table 3 and depicted in fig 7 suggest that there is generally a close agreement i e r2 ranging from 0 769 to 0 794 rmse ranging from 1 087 to 1 151 re ranging from 0 224 to 0 242 d ranging from 0 940 to 0 948 and ratio ranging from 0 976 to 0 992 between eto estimations by the regionally calibrated ahs eto equation and fao eto equation it is worth noting that among the four scenarios the comparison between ahs eto using calibrated station specific three coefficients a b and c and fao eto yielded relatively higher r2 0 794 and d 0 948 and lower rmse 1 087 mm d 1 and re 0 224 values using the calibrated coefficients of individual stations the spatial distribution of these hs coefficients within the calibration region was determined using an interpolation procedure i e kriging to obtain these coefficients in areas with no weather station kriging is geostatistical interpolation method that implies regression modeling followed by kriging of residuals kriging can be done with arcgis geostatistical analyst esri redland ca that uses the original data of regional

malamos and koutsoyiannis 2018 a gridded map of each of all the three coefficients was generated in the calibration region figs 8 a c to evaluate the performance of interpolated coefficients the

hs coefficients a b and c were calibrated globally monthly and regionally as indicated by rmse mbe re and d values the calibrated hs equation did not substantially improve eto estimates during july august and september as compared to other months this is most likely attributed to as shown in fig 4 the lower average wind speeds during these months as compared to other months similar discrepancies between eto by the hs equation and eto by the fao penman monteith equation in areas with low or high wind speeds were reported in several studies e g martınez cob and tejero juste 2004 trajkovic 2005

evaluated against the ones estimated by the standard fao eto method statistics of the hs equation performance for eto estimation during validation are presented in table 5 the performance of the calibrated hs equation for stations inside the calibration region was much better than stations outside the region however there was generally a close agreement between the hargreaves samani and fao

interpolated coefficients derived from station specific calibrated coefficients compared to globally calibrated coefficients based on all stations data used for calibration table 5 an important aspect to be noted during the hs equation validation is that eto estimated by the calibrated hs equation with fitted month specific hs coefficients were in close agreement with those estimated by the

8379,study area shenzhen megacity southern china study focus sponge city is a chinese concept aimed to mitigate flood risk tackle chronic water scarcity and improve the urban environment it consists of a combination of new storage and infiltration facilities distributed on a large scale the concept is similar to strategies and developments already adopted in the western world in this paper new constraints on the interactions between the sponge facilities the landscape and the subsoil are identified for a hilly sub tropic terrain new hydrological insights for the region using a geomorphological zonation at the catchment scale a conceptual model is proposed for southern china to identify areas where groundwater infiltration and storage is feasible the proposed model is applied to shenzhen a megacity in southern china chosen as a pilot site for sponge city with 24 project areas already identified our zonation approach suggests that project areas on the coastal plain and reclaimed land will only work with above ground storage while there is significant potential to enhance many of the other pilot areas with infiltration facilities the conceptual model improves the sponge city approach aimed at increasing the managed annual runoff it also mitigates the waterlogging risk at the same time the proposed conceptual model has moderate costs and makes possible the application of the sponge city concept in other urban areas of southern china keywords conceptual model flood mitigation groundwater urban planning urban waterlogging wet climate 1 introduction sponge city is a chinese concept to mitigate flood risk and tackle water scarcity for chinese cities and megacities xia et al 2016 chan et al 2018 mei et al 2013 qiao et al 2019 the concept is closely related to strategies and practices of the western world such as sustainable drainage system of united kingdom best management practice and low impact development lid from united states and new zealand as well as the water sensitive city from australia fletcher et al 2014 chui et al 2016 mao et al 2017 all of these concepts aim to slow and attenuate the flow of storm water from buildings and infrastructure in urban areas thereby reducing surface water flooding potential additional benefits are restoration of the ecological function of urban streams urban microclimate enhancement increased property values and sometimes incremented water resources nguyen et al 2019 thus sponge city is a multi purpose concept with ecological architectural hydrologic hydrogeological and economic aspects sponge city concepts can be designed for new districts or the concept can be applied to convert conventional urban areas characterized by impervious surfaces strategies and approaches for the application of the sponge city concept are complex and not trivial the impervious surfaces of the urban areas impede infiltration into the subsoil favoring surface runoff lerner 2002 rainwater is collected by storm drains in separated sewer systems or sewers in combined systems both systems are prone to blockages and overloading during intense storms the various sponge city concepts use infrastructure elements such as green roofs rain gardens permeable pavements drainage swales and storage tanks distributed throughout the city these elements temporarily store the storm water reducing flood peaks and volumes the water may be released slowly into the drainage network gathered for use as a water resource evapotranspired by plants infiltrated into the subsurface to increase groundwater storage or a combination of these elements in the sponge city literature infiltration to groundwater is proposed in dry climates mohurd 2014 is a collection of guidelines on how to design sponge city installations in tropical areas the guidelines propose collection and reuse of about 60 85 of the annual urban runoff focusing on storms with moderate to small rainfall however a lower collection rate is suggested if economic costs are too high or sponge facilities cannot be merged in the urban environment yu et al 2015 randall et al 2019 and yu 2019 focus on groundwater recharge from sponge city facilities to reduce the groundwater depletion problem in northern china li et al 2019 investigates the best performance among different green scenarios however waterlogging and flooding attenuation via groundwater recharge is neglected two alternative concepts for the destination of the stored water are illustrated on fig 1 in the conceptual diagram of fig 1a the storage elements are connected to drains which can either deliver the water slowly to the river network or facilitate its reuse in this version no use is made of any hydrogeological capacity to store water fig 1b shows the storage elements mostly disconnected from the drainage network with the excess water infiltrated into groundwater there are constraints and benefits to both approaches that are explored in this paper the urban areas of southern china which have a sub tropical climate are affected by floods and waterlogging during the summer yin et al 2014 sang and yang 2017 there are frequent tropical storms and average annual rainfall ranges from 1500 to over 2000 mm y sang and yang 2017 xu et al 2018 throughout the area the sub tropical climate favors the production of a thick alluvial colluvial blanket a shallow aquifer with high permeability and porosity fig 1c these aquifers cover the often low permeability bedrock thus for sponge city purposes any catchment in southern china can be conceptualized as a mountainous area where the slopes are steep and runoff is favored a piedmont band characterized by a thick accumulation of soil and detritus with high water storage capacity and an alluvial valley or coastal plain where the water table is generally close to the ground surface the three zones are shown conceptually in fig 1c their different hydrogeological constraints and opportunities for sponge city facilities are explored in this paper the objectives of this paper for the sub tropical region of southern china are 1 to identify the hydrogeological constraints to enhance sponge city facilities via infiltration to groundwater and 2 to define a conceptual model for assessing the storage capacity of urban aquifers in southern china the proposed conceptual model is applied and verified for shenzhen a southern china megacity in the populous pearl river delta fig 2 a the area is already a pilot site for a national sponge city project by the chinese government because of its strategic importance in the chinese economy shenzhen committee 2016 zhao et al 2018 independently proposed an emergy method for the selection of the sponge city elements throughout shenzhen however they neglected the role of subsoil and hydrogeological characteristics 2 material and methods 2 1 study area shenzhen is a megacity of southern china with a population of more than 14 million fig 2a the metropolis extends along the southern chinese sea coastline between the pearl river delta zhujiang river and daya bay it is a major high tech and finance center with a vibrant and booming economy in a few decades after the opening reforms of the communist party the area has changed from small villages of farmers to become a modern megacity hong and guo 2017 the city is at the forefront of the chinese environmental policy for example the city approved the first basic ecological control line that safeguards the rural areas and guarantees green corridors throughout the metropolis hong et al 2017 shenzhen was selected as a test for the application of the sponge city concept with 24 pilot sites distributed throughout the megacity fig 2a the study area has an average annual rainfall rate of 2000 mm year wrsbm 2016 concentrated during the summer season extreme meteorological events such as typhoons bring large quantities of rain in short periods causing damage to the infrastructure economic loss accompanied by deaths and inconvenience for the population for example rainfall from a storm in august 28th 29th 2018 ranged from 100 to more than 300 mm in 24 h across shenzhen fig 2a areas affected by surface water flooding coincide with the most urbanized areas where the sponge city concept could produce major benefits fig 2a shenzhen is chosen for this study because has both low lying areas and hilly terrain distributed across the city urban water table even during the wet season is well below ground surface and these areas are potentially high absorbance zones identification of high absorbance zones is challenging and involves hydrogeology and geomorphology of the site supported by transient analysis of the groundwater table in flat low lying sub tropical areas e g guangzhou in pearl river delta the groundwater table is nearly coincident with ground surface during the wet season consequently absorbance capability is very low fig 1c 2 2 hydrogeological setting the shenzhen area has a complex geological setting lancia et al 2019 that hinders the study of urban groundwater groundwater literature for the area is scarce and consists of a collection of borehole stratigraphies gpgb 1980 and a hydrogeological map at scale 1 50 000 yang et al 2007 lancia et al 2019 defined a hydrogeological budget and reconstructed the average groundwater table elevations for shenzhen via numerical analysis quaternary deposits located in the alluvial valleys and the coastal plain are aquifers with a high permeability and porosity fig 3 the thickness increases down gradient with a maximum thickness of 60 m recorded in the bao an plain yang et al 2007 along the piedmont these deposits are interdigitated with weathered blankets of silty sands and quartz sands lithological and mineralogical characteristics depend on the bedrock source due to the tropical climate the distribution of these deposits is uniform along the piedmont with an average thickness of 30 m lancia et al 2019 because of gravity processes that mobilize deposits downslope blankets are thin on the steep slopes of the main mountain areas where flow landslides are frequent varnes 1978 along the piedmont the shallow aquifers are thicker the paleozoic to mesozoic igneous and sedimentary bedrock is a regional aquitard due to its low porosity and the metamorphic processes that closed the fractures fig 3 groundwater circulation is restricted and concentrated in localized tectonic fracture bands the groundwater sub basins coincide with the surface water catchments throughout the study area lancia et al 2019 the regional groundwater table fig 3a follows the morphology with gentler gradients the highest hydraulic heads are observed under the yangtai mt maximum hydraulic head of 150 m a s l and yantian mts maximum hydraulic head of 192 m a s l at these two locations the water table is located several hundred meters below the ground surface from these highs groundwater flows radially away and feeds streams and rivers or directly discharges into the sea throughout the bao an coastal plain and downstream in the river valleys the groundwater table is between 0 and 20 m a s l close to or coincident with ground surface fig 3a the coastline sectors of mirs bay and daya bay are rocky and most groundwater discharge occurs to the sea however along the slopes of the mountain sector perched aquifers feed the small streams fig 3 for sponge city purposes these aquifers are neglected the interior sectors of the longhua and longgang valleys are characterized by groundwater table elevations ranging from 40 to 80 m a s l 2 3 groundwater levels and response the scarce hydrogeological literature on groundwater conditions in shenzhen gpgb 1980 yang et al 2007 lancia et al 2019 does not provide information about the groundwater table fluctuation during storms thus five piezometers were drilled in the southern university of science and technology sustech field site fig 2b located in the upper portion of the dasha river catchment on the right side the site is just downstream of the changlinpi reservoir fig 2b the distance between the river channel and the piedmont is less than 1 km fig 2b the site is a university campus with groups of buildings and roads together with wide green areas many of which have sprinkler irrigation this site which has a uniform weathered blanket setting is representative of the shenzhen aquifer to assess the water table variations in relation to rainfall boreholes were drilled and continuously cored to bedrock the distribution of the piezometers covers the morphological sectors in accordance with the conceptual model of fig 1c two boreholes were drilled near to the dasha river piezometers 1 and 2 and another two at the top and the center of the piedmont zone piezometer 3 and 4 the last piezometer 5 was drilled in the mountain area locations are shown on fig 2b schlumberger mini diver submersible pressure transducers were installed to automatically measure groundwater levels measurements were performed from may 2017 to november 2018 measurements did not start at the same time because of delays in the drilling permissions and some piezometers were destroyed by construction works however sufficient data were collected to quantify the water table variations at the field site 2 4 urban characterization urbanization creates extensive impermeable surfaces where buildings and paved roads encourage runoff towards rivers and streams streams are shrunk and often diverted into storm or combined sewers a minor part of the surface water infiltrates into the urban aquifers through the green areas e g parks or through fractures and cracks in pipes and impermeable surface the latter is an unconventional recharge yang et al 1999 naik et al 2008 despite the hilly morphology and the continuous weathered blanket that favor infiltration in the last decades shenzhen has been affected by an increasing number of water flooding events access to city databases or archives is restricted and information about the city expansion is difficult to collect and old topographic maps and satellite images were analyzed to study the urbanization of the study area three datasets represent three important stages of shenzhen s urban expansion topographic maps published in the 1954 series l500 sheets nf 49 8 and nf 50 5 scale 1 250 000 u s army 1954 this represents the rural stage without modern urban elements the population is unknown satellite images 1979 landsat orthorectified cgs geocloud 2017 with a resolution of 30 m this stage represents the urban setting at the start of the opening reforms a population of about 0 3 million shen 2008 satellite images cnes airbus 2017 from spot 6 satellite cgs geocloud 2017 orthorectified with a resolution of 1 5 m this stage represents the current urban setting a population of about 14 million the topographic map depicts the number and distribution of the villages the land use and the location of the coastline these features are also detected in the later satellite images via variations of tone color and texture analysis of the satellite images was performed manually at 1 2 000 scale roads and buildings have a dominant grey to pale grey color new residential areas consist of high density housing with tall buildings separated by small parks and green spaces these areas show a varied but easy to recognize pattern old villages consist of short buildings close to each other with a total absence of green spaces a number of excavations to bedrock are visible that are characterized by a white to pale gray these areas were included in the urban area excavations interrupt the continuity of the shallow aquifers exposing the low permeability bedrock because of its importance in the conceptual model fig 1c the piedmont was delineated via analysis of the 1979 landsat satellite images this image dataset is particularly useful as it records the landscape before the massive urbanization that masks the original geomorphological units in the images the piedmonts have a characteristic pattern composed of different tones of green and light brown water reservoirs are important hydraulic elements and were also identified the water surfaces have a uniform tone and a variable brownish to greenish color in addition shore line changes were traced reconstructing the effect of the reclaimed land projects 3 results and discussion 3 1 urban expansion shenzhen is characterized by rapid urban expansion from a group of agricultural and fishing villages to a megacity in the 1950s the urban texture had only a minor impact on the water cycle analysis of the topographic map of 1954 u s corps of army 1954 scale 1 250 000 identified several small urban centers connected by tracks trails or roads with a loose surface rice paddies and fish farming ponds were present in the coastal sectors and along the fluvial valleys in a network of small canals and drains these elements favored the deposition of a thin layer of clayey silt less permeable than the alluvial colluvial blanket because of its finer grain sizes the 1979 landsat dataset shows the first important anthropic changes initially the villages close to the hong kong border expanded followed by the interior sectors at this stage the urban areas covered around 180 km2 equal to 8 9 of the study area fig 4 today rice paddies have been urbanized and fish farming significantly reduced forty two percent of the shenzhen area is currently urbanized fig 4 urban areas are spread throughout river valleys and the bao an coastal plain urban areas also extend into the piedmont regions skirting the mountain sectors the guanlan and shenzhen river valleys are heavily urbanized with urban surfaces covering 62 and 54 respectively of the catchments in contrast the dapeng peninsula preserves its rural characteristics fig 4 mountain areas are characterized by numerous dams for water supply and flood attenuation there are more than 300 lakes and water basins which occupy an area of 6 km2 0 3 of shenzhen the bigger reservoirs were built between 1954 and 1979 after the opening reforms smaller reservoirs were constructed urban areas have developed upstream of the shiyan reservoir and many other reservoirs the reclaimed land projects of bao an plain shekou promontory and yantian port fig 4 have increased shenzhen s area by 95 km2 about 5 along the bao an coastal plain and the shekou promontory a strip from 0 5 km to 2 5 km wide was reclaimed in the reclaimed areas the water table is at or near the surface during the wet season creating waterlogged soils and an increased flood risk due to the reduced topographical gradient the sustech field site fig 4 preserves the original hydrologic characteristics i e before urbanization due to the presence of green areas groundwater table fluctuations at the field site could represent the behavior of an urban area after a sponge city conversion 3 2 water table fluctuations the investigations at the sustech site quantified the water table fluctuations and allow an evaluation of the storage capacity of the shallow aquifers different groundwater table responses were observed in the different morphological zones data are presented as depth from the ground surface to indicate the available storage capacity major groundwater table rises are related to severe rainstorms fig 5 the piezometers close to the dasha riverbed p1 and p2 fig 2b recorded a groundwater table with a total range of 2 m fig 5 during the wet season the highest increments of the water table in storms are 0 3 m to 0 5 m during the dry season the water table declines at a rate of 0 1 m per month for p1 and 0 3 m month for p2 the lower rate of p1 is probably due to additional recharge from local sprinkler irrigation on campus the groundwater levels in both piezometers are similar to the river stage at the end of the dry season piezometer 3 p3 in fig 2b is located at the center of the piedmont band it shows a similar trend to p1 and p2 but the increment for each storm is higher from 0 5 m to 1 m the dry season decline is more accentuated about 0 5 m per month fig 5 piezometer 4 p4 in fig 2b was drilled at the top edge of the piedmont sector its storm response is the spikiest with increases of 1 5 2 5 m fig 5 during storms despite the large spikes the water table never reaches the ground surface and large amounts of water are temporarily stored in the aquifers following storms this water quickly dissipates downstream piezometer 5 p5 in fig 2b is located on a steep slope in proximity to a mountain stream the groundwater table is almost at the surface during the wet season and draws downs during the dry season at a rate of 0 6 m per year 3 3 new insights for the sponge city design in southern china the primary objective of the implementation of sponge city concepts is to reduce surface water flooding this is achieved by capturing and temporarily storing storm runoff before release after the storm has finished the chinese sponge city approach is to use storage facilities above or just below the ground which are connected to pipe networks for reuse fig 1a it potentially has secondary benefits such as improving water quality increasing water resources and ecological and aesthetic improvements to local neighborhoods additional benefits could be obtained by allowing infiltration of storm water into the subsurface instead of discharging it through pipe networks clearly this is only possible where there is storage capacity in the subsurface and the ground is permeable enough for infiltration to occur as the analysis above shows the piedmont regions of shenzhen and other similar areas of southern china have these characteristics the additional benefits include the much larger storage capacity available than could be economically constructed and the increased baseflow in the streams and rivers that are supported by groundwater with consequent aesthetic and ecological benefits the major risk associated with infiltration is that groundwater may become polluted if the storm water is polluted although aquifers have the ability to attenuate many pollutants infiltration should be restricted to clean water sources such as roofs parks and residential streets and should not include major roads and industrial areas where the risks of pollution and chemical spills is high landscape analysis suggests that there are some areas that are not priorities for retrofitting of sponge city elements these include a areas upstream of reservoirs which already provide large storage volumes for flood mitigation and b older developments villages where space is restricted water tables are often high and the drainage network is often confused with cross connections between storm and sanitary sewers the hydrogeological analysis identifies areas where infiltration based elements would not be effective these include the steeper terrain above the piedmont where the aquifer is thin more significant are the coastal plains and reclaimed land in these areas groundwater levels are near to or coincident with the ground surface so there is little additional storage available saline groundwater is usually present as noted in private reports of groundwater quality in shenzhen the shift of the fresh to saline interface predicted by shi and jiao 2014 after the reclaimed land process is very slow especially in the bao an plain where the groundwater gradient is almost null the proposed conceptual model highlights the importance of analysis at the entire catchment scale of both the landscape and the subsurface for the design of sponge city facilities the piedmonts of southern china are natural tanks that can adsorb huge quantity of rainfall due to a thicker aquifer higher permeability and a deeper water table thus these areas are strategic to prevent floods and waterlogging the redevelopment of the piedmont via the sponge city concept must be encouraged at the same time the rural piedmont must be safeguarded from urbanization since 2005 the ecologic control base line policy already safeguards the remaining rural zones of shenzhen because of the geomorphological and hydrogeological uncertainties field investigations and monitoring of water table fluctuations are recommended at a preliminary stage a catchment scale review of shenzhen was carried out to identify areas with a high and low additional storage capacity in the aquifers the shallow aquifers of the piedmont areas fig 2b had water table rises for each storm between 0 3 and 0 5 m during the wet season cumulative increments were less than 3 m despite the geological and hydrogeological uncertainties piedmont areas where the groundwater table is deeper than 4 m have significant additional storage capacity and the water table would not rise to the land surface except in extreme circumstances the areas with high additional storage capacity in the aquifers are depicted on fig 6 piedmont areas upstream of the reservoirs villages and towns built before the 1979 and reclaimed land areas have been excluded the proposed sponge city plan shenzhen committee 2016 focuses on a standard approach based on lid fig 1a and do not have high absorbance fig 6 in fig 6 the proposed 24 pilot sites for shenzhen s city are marked and numbered along the pearl river estuary and shenzhen bay the sites id 1 2 3 4 9 13 are located throughout the reclaimed land sector where there is limited additional storage capacity in the aquifers sponge city facilities involving above or near ground storage will be necessary moving eastwards the sites id 6 12 partially and 18 are located upstream of the shiyan shangmeilin and shenzhen reservoirs fig 6 and benefits will be produced only at very local scale as the reservoirs have large scale storage the luohu and futian sites id 12 and 16 include many old urbanized areas where the sponge city retrofitting will be difficult to implement the remaining sites include portions of areas with a significant additional storage capacity in the aquifers here groundwater infiltration facilities fig 1b could be combined together with the original lid plan for breakthrough results in the future new installations involving groundwater infiltration facilities could be extended to the remaining areas of the city with significant additional storage capacity in the aquifers fig 6 the shenzhen case study reveals that classic sponge city facilities fig 1a can usefully be combined with the proposed surface to ground elements fig 1b this combination will make it easier to reach the target set by mohurd 2014 of managing between 60 85 of annual runoff at a moderate cost the proposed approach combines both recharge urban aquifers along the piedmont and collection and reuse of runoff in the coastal areas instead of series of individual pilot sites the scheme for shenzhen and other cities becomes a multifunctional catchment scale storm runoff and water management plan the proposed model pushes the limits of the sponge city approach further and aims to mitigate the flooding and waterlogging risk caused by extreme meteorological events which were not considered by mohurd 2014 respecting geomorphological and hydrogeological criteria sponge city can be applied in other areas of southern china with limited economic resources leading to safe and sustainable development of less rich urban areas of china beside the use of urban aquifers further expedients can increment the managed runoff to cope the intense rainstorms the improvement of water drainage is recommended to allow a fast discharge of the sponge city installations and avoid the site saturation in respect of the architectural and archeological constrictions a reconstruction of the historical villages is also suggested lack of urban greenery and piled up buildings constitute impervious blocks prone to waterlogging where the sponge city retrofitting are also difficult to implement 4 conclusions our analyses of the shenzhen case study demonstrate that sponge city design can be improved by taking into account the local hydrogeological and geomorphological context these approaches can reveal both constraints and opportunities to ensure that installations are more effective and meet the established runoff control goals for the sponge city components a depth to groundwater of 4 m or more in moderately permeable terrain such as the piedmonts of southern china can be used to infiltrate larger quantities of storm water at lower costs than could realistically be stored in engineered tanks and ponds this water would then be available to support stream baseflows with ecological benefits or for extraction as a local water resource on the other hand the analysis identifies areas where sponge city elements will be of limited benefit in flood control such as upstream of reservoirs and areas where infiltration is not feasible such as on the higher slopes or on coastal land reclaimed lands with salinized aquifers and a groundwater table quasi coincident with the ground surface are also not suitable for storm water collection due to pipe and tank exfiltration the more expensive above ground facilities will be required in these areas the pilot sponge city sites of shenzhen partially match with the results of our geomorphological and hydrogeological analysis however some of the pilot sites are likely to have minimal effectiveness better siting of the pilot sites considering hydrogeological characteristics would provide test sites that have the potential to be more effective and reduce costs by incorporating infiltration based elements the shenzhen case study shows that a catchment scale plan can be developed to optimize urban runoff collection the plan could extend to a wider catchment and involve more cities and villages taking account of the hydrogeological and geomorphological criteria and integrating across the entire city or catchment scale should lead to less expensive and more effective sponge city designs funding this work has been supported by the national key r d program of china project number 2016yfc0402806 additional support was

application of the sponge city concept are complex and not trivial the impervious surfaces of the urban areas impede infiltration into the subsoil favoring surface runoff lerner 2002 rainwater is collected by storm drains in separated sewer systems or sewers in combined systems both systems are prone to blockages and overloading during intense storms the various sponge city concepts use infrastructure elements such as green roofs rain gardens permeable pavements drainage swales and storage tanks distributed throughout the city these elements temporarily store the storm water reducing flood peaks and volumes the water may be released slowly into the drainage network gathered for use as a water resource evapotranspired by plants infiltrated into the subsurface to increase groundwater storage or a combination of these elements in the sponge city literature infiltration to groundwater is proposed in dry climates mohurd 2014 is a collection of guidelines on how to design sponge city installations in tropical areas the guidelines propose collection and reuse of about 60 85 of the annual urban runoff focusing on storms with moderate to small rainfall however a lower collection rate is suggested if economic costs are too high or sponge facilities cannot be merged in the urban environment yu et al 2015 randall et al 2019 and yu 2019 focus on groundwater recharge from sponge city facilities to reduce the groundwater depletion problem in northern china li et al 2019 investigates the best performance among different green scenarios however waterlogging and flooding attenuation via groundwater recharge is neglected two alternative concepts for the destination of the stored water are illustrated on fig 1 in the conceptual diagram of fig 1a the storage elements are connected to drains which can either deliver the water slowly to the river network or facilitate its reuse in this version no use is made of any hydrogeological capacity to store water fig 1b shows the storage elements mostly disconnected from the drainage network with the excess water infiltrated into groundwater there are constraints and benefits to both approaches that are explored in this paper the urban areas of southern china which have a sub tropical climate are affected by floods and waterlogging during the summer yin et al 2014 sang and yang 2017 there are frequent tropical storms and average annual rainfall ranges from 1500 to over 2000 mm y sang and yang 2017 xu et al 2018 throughout the area the sub tropical climate favors the production of a thick alluvial colluvial blanket a shallow aquifer with high permeability and porosity fig 1c these aquifers cover the often low permeability bedrock thus for sponge city purposes any catchment in southern china can be conceptualized as a mountainous area where the slopes are steep and runoff is favored a piedmont band characterized by a thick accumulation of soil and detritus with high water storage capacity and an alluvial valley or coastal plain where the water table is generally close to the ground surface the three zones are shown conceptually in fig 1c their different hydrogeological constraints and opportunities for sponge city facilities are explored in this paper the objectives of this paper for the sub tropical region of southern china are 1 to identify the hydrogeological constraints to enhance sponge city facilities via infiltration to groundwater and 2 to define a conceptual model for assessing the storage capacity of urban aquifers in southern china the proposed conceptual model is applied and verified for shenzhen a southern china megacity in the populous pearl river delta fig 2 a the area is already a pilot site for a national sponge city project by the chinese government because of its strategic importance in the chinese economy shenzhen committee 2016 zhao et al 2018 independently proposed an emergy method for the selection of the sponge city elements throughout shenzhen however they neglected the role of subsoil and hydrogeological characteristics 2 material and methods 2 1 study area shenzhen is a megacity of southern china with a population of more than 14 million fig 2a the metropolis extends along the southern chinese sea coastline between the pearl river delta zhujiang river and daya bay it is a major high tech and finance center with a vibrant and booming economy in a few decades after the opening reforms of the communist party the area has changed from small villages of farmers to become a modern megacity hong and guo 2017 the city is at the forefront of the chinese environmental policy for example the city approved the first basic ecological control line that safeguards the rural areas and guarantees green corridors throughout the metropolis hong et al 2017 shenzhen was selected as a test for the application of the sponge city concept with 24 pilot sites distributed throughout the megacity fig 2a the study area has an average annual rainfall rate of 2000 mm year wrsbm 2016 concentrated during the summer season extreme meteorological events such as typhoons bring large quantities of rain in short periods causing damage to the infrastructure economic loss accompanied by deaths and inconvenience for the population for example rainfall from a storm in august 28th 29th 2018 ranged from 100 to more than 300 mm in 24 h across shenzhen fig 2a areas affected by surface water flooding coincide with the most urbanized areas where the sponge city concept could produce major benefits fig 2a shenzhen is chosen for this study because has both low lying areas and hilly terrain distributed across the city urban water table even during the wet season is well below ground surface and these areas are potentially high absorbance zones identification of high absorbance zones is challenging and involves hydrogeology and geomorphology of the site supported by transient analysis of the groundwater table in flat low lying sub tropical areas e g guangzhou in pearl river delta the groundwater table is nearly coincident with ground surface during the wet season consequently absorbance capability is very low fig 1c 2 2 hydrogeological setting the shenzhen area has a complex geological setting lancia et al 2019 that hinders the study of urban groundwater groundwater literature for the area is scarce and consists of a collection of borehole stratigraphies gpgb 1980 and a hydrogeological map at scale 1 50 000 yang et al 2007 lancia et al 2019 defined a hydrogeological budget and reconstructed the average groundwater table elevations for shenzhen via numerical analysis quaternary deposits located in the alluvial valleys and the coastal plain are aquifers with a high permeability and porosity fig 3 the thickness increases down gradient with a maximum thickness of 60 m recorded in the bao an plain yang et al 2007 along the piedmont these deposits are interdigitated with weathered blankets of silty sands and quartz sands lithological and mineralogical characteristics depend on the bedrock source due to the tropical climate the distribution of these deposits is uniform along the piedmont with an average thickness of 30 m lancia et al 2019 because of gravity processes that mobilize deposits downslope blankets are thin on the steep slopes of the main mountain areas where flow landslides are frequent varnes 1978 along the piedmont the shallow aquifers are thicker the paleozoic to mesozoic igneous and sedimentary bedrock is a regional aquitard due to its low porosity and the metamorphic processes that closed the fractures fig 3 groundwater circulation is restricted and concentrated in localized tectonic fracture bands the groundwater sub basins coincide with the surface water catchments throughout the study area lancia et al 2019 the regional groundwater table fig 3a follows the morphology with gentler gradients the highest hydraulic heads are observed under the yangtai mt maximum hydraulic head of 150 m a s l and yantian mts maximum hydraulic head of 192 m a s l at these two locations the water table is located several hundred meters below the ground surface from these highs groundwater flows radially away and feeds streams and rivers or directly discharges into the sea throughout the bao an coastal plain and downstream in the river valleys the groundwater table is between 0 and 20 m a s l close to or coincident with ground surface fig 3a the coastline sectors of mirs bay and daya bay are rocky and most groundwater discharge occurs to the sea however along the slopes of the mountain sector perched aquifers feed the small streams fig 3 for sponge city purposes these aquifers are neglected the interior sectors of the longhua and longgang valleys are characterized by groundwater table elevations ranging from 40 to 80 m a s l 2 3 groundwater levels and response the scarce hydrogeological literature on groundwater conditions in shenzhen gpgb 1980 yang et al 2007 lancia et al 2019 does not provide information about the groundwater table fluctuation during storms thus five piezometers were drilled in the southern university of science and technology sustech field site fig 2b located in the upper portion of the dasha river catchment on the right side the site is just downstream of the changlinpi reservoir fig 2b the distance between the river channel and the piedmont is less than 1 km fig 2b the site is a university campus with groups of buildings and roads together with wide green areas many of which have sprinkler irrigation this site which has a uniform weathered blanket setting is representative of the shenzhen aquifer to assess the water table variations in relation to rainfall boreholes were drilled and continuously cored to bedrock the distribution of the piezometers covers the morphological sectors in accordance with the conceptual model of fig 1c two boreholes were drilled near to the dasha river piezometers 1 and 2 and another two at the top and the center of the piedmont zone piezometer 3 and 4 the last piezometer 5 was drilled in the mountain area locations are shown on fig 2b schlumberger mini diver submersible pressure transducers were installed to automatically measure groundwater levels measurements were performed from may 2017 to november 2018 measurements did not start at the same time because of delays in the drilling permissions and some piezometers were destroyed by construction works however sufficient data were collected to quantify the water table variations at the field site 2 4 urban characterization urbanization creates extensive impermeable surfaces where buildings and paved roads encourage runoff towards rivers and streams streams are shrunk and often diverted into storm or combined sewers a minor part of the surface water infiltrates into the urban aquifers through the green areas e g parks or through fractures and cracks in pipes and impermeable surface the latter is an unconventional recharge yang et al 1999 naik et al 2008 despite the hilly morphology and the continuous weathered blanket that favor infiltration in the last decades shenzhen has been affected by an increasing number of water flooding events access to city databases or archives is restricted and information about the city expansion is difficult to collect and old topographic maps and satellite images were analyzed to study the urbanization of the study area three datasets represent three important stages of shenzhen s urban expansion topographic maps published in the 1954 series l500 sheets nf 49 8 and nf 50 5 scale 1 250 000 u s army 1954 this represents the rural stage without modern urban elements the population is unknown satellite images 1979 landsat orthorectified cgs geocloud 2017 with a resolution of 30 m this stage represents the urban setting at the start of the opening reforms a population of about 0 3 million shen 2008 satellite images cnes airbus 2017 from spot 6 satellite cgs geocloud 2017 orthorectified with a resolution of 1 5 m this stage represents the current urban setting a population of about 14 million the topographic map depicts the number and distribution of the villages the land use and the location of the coastline these features are also detected in the later satellite images via variations of tone color and texture analysis of the satellite images was performed manually at 1 2 000 scale roads and buildings have a dominant grey to pale grey color new residential areas consist of high density housing with tall buildings separated by small parks and green spaces these areas show a varied but easy to recognize pattern old villages consist of short buildings close to each other with a total absence of green spaces a number of excavations to bedrock are visible that are characterized by a white to pale gray these areas were included in the urban area excavations interrupt the continuity of the shallow aquifers exposing the low permeability bedrock because of its importance in the conceptual model fig 1c the piedmont was delineated via analysis of the 1979 landsat satellite images this image dataset is particularly useful as it records the landscape before the massive urbanization that masks the original geomorphological units in the images the piedmonts have a characteristic pattern composed of different tones of green and light brown water reservoirs are important hydraulic elements and were also identified the water surfaces have a uniform tone and a variable brownish to greenish color in addition shore line changes were traced reconstructing the effect of the reclaimed land projects 3 results and discussion 3 1 urban expansion shenzhen is characterized by rapid urban expansion from a group of agricultural and fishing villages to a megacity in the 1950s the urban texture had only a minor impact on the water cycle analysis of the topographic map of 1954 u s corps of army 1954 scale 1 250 000 identified several small urban centers connected by tracks trails or roads with a loose surface rice paddies and fish farming ponds were present in the coastal sectors and along the fluvial valleys in a network of small canals and drains these elements favored the deposition of a thin layer of clayey silt less permeable than the alluvial colluvial blanket because of its finer grain sizes the 1979 landsat dataset shows the first important anthropic changes initially the villages close to the hong kong border expanded followed by the interior sectors at this stage the urban areas covered around 180 km2 equal to 8 9 of the study area fig 4 today rice paddies have been urbanized and fish farming significantly reduced forty two percent of the shenzhen area is currently urbanized fig 4 urban areas are spread throughout river valleys and the bao an coastal plain urban areas also extend into the piedmont regions skirting the mountain sectors the guanlan and shenzhen river valleys are heavily urbanized with urban surfaces covering 62 and 54 respectively of the catchments in contrast the dapeng peninsula preserves its rural characteristics fig 4 mountain areas are characterized by numerous dams for water supply and flood attenuation there are more than 300 lakes and water basins which occupy an area of 6 km2 0 3 of shenzhen the bigger reservoirs were built between 1954 and 1979 after the opening reforms smaller reservoirs were constructed urban areas have developed upstream of the shiyan reservoir and many other reservoirs the reclaimed land projects of bao an plain shekou promontory and yantian port fig 4 have increased shenzhen s area by 95 km2 about 5 along the bao an coastal plain and the shekou promontory a strip from 0 5 km to 2 5 km wide was reclaimed in the reclaimed areas the water table is at or near the surface during the wet season creating waterlogged soils and an increased flood risk due to the reduced topographical gradient the sustech field site fig 4 preserves the original hydrologic characteristics i e before urbanization due to the presence of green areas groundwater table fluctuations at the field site could represent the behavior of an urban area after a sponge city conversion 3 2 water table fluctuations the investigations at the sustech site quantified the water table fluctuations and allow an evaluation of the storage capacity of the shallow aquifers different groundwater table responses were observed in the different morphological zones data are presented as depth from the ground surface to indicate the available storage capacity major groundwater table rises are related to severe rainstorms fig 5 the piezometers close to the dasha riverbed p1 and p2 fig 2b recorded a groundwater table with a total range of 2 m fig 5 during the wet season the highest increments of the water table in storms are 0 3 m to 0 5 m during the dry season the water table declines at a rate of 0 1 m per month for p1 and 0 3 m month for p2 the lower rate of p1 is probably due to additional recharge from local sprinkler irrigation on campus the groundwater levels in both piezometers are similar to the river stage at the end of the dry season piezometer 3 p3 in fig 2b is located at the center of the piedmont band it shows a similar trend to p1 and p2 but the increment for each storm is higher from 0 5 m to 1 m the dry season decline is more accentuated about 0 5 m per month fig 5 piezometer 4 p4 in fig 2b was drilled at the top edge of the piedmont sector its storm response is the spikiest with increases of 1 5 2 5 m fig 5 during storms despite the large spikes the water table never reaches the ground surface and large amounts of water are temporarily stored in the aquifers following storms this water quickly dissipates downstream piezometer 5 p5 in fig 2b is located on a steep slope in proximity to a mountain stream the groundwater table is almost at the surface during the wet season and draws downs during the dry season at a rate of 0 6 m per year 3 3 new insights for the sponge city design in southern china the primary objective of the implementation of sponge city concepts is to reduce surface water flooding this is achieved by capturing and temporarily storing storm runoff before release after the storm has finished the chinese sponge city approach is to use storage facilities above or just below the ground which are connected to pipe networks for reuse fig 1a it potentially has secondary benefits such as improving water quality increasing water resources and ecological and aesthetic improvements to local neighborhoods additional benefits could be obtained by allowing infiltration of storm water into the subsurface instead of discharging it through pipe networks clearly this is only possible where there is storage capacity in the subsurface and the ground is permeable enough for infiltration to occur as the analysis above shows the piedmont regions of shenzhen and other similar areas of southern china have these characteristics the additional benefits include the much larger storage capacity available than could be economically constructed and the increased baseflow in the streams and rivers that are supported by groundwater with consequent aesthetic and ecological benefits the major risk associated with infiltration is that groundwater may become polluted if the storm water is polluted although aquifers have the ability to attenuate many pollutants infiltration should be restricted to clean water sources such as roofs parks and residential streets and should not include major roads and industrial areas where the risks of pollution and chemical spills is high landscape analysis suggests that there are some areas that are not priorities for retrofitting of sponge city elements these include a areas upstream of reservoirs which already provide large storage volumes for flood mitigation and b older developments villages where space is restricted water tables are often high and the drainage network is often confused with cross connections between storm and sanitary sewers the hydrogeological analysis identifies areas where infiltration based elements would not be effective these include the steeper terrain above the piedmont where the aquifer is thin more significant are the coastal plains and reclaimed land in these areas groundwater levels are near to or coincident with the ground surface so there is little additional storage available saline groundwater is usually present as noted in private reports of groundwater quality in shenzhen the shift of the fresh to saline interface predicted by shi and jiao 2014 after the reclaimed land process is very slow especially in the bao an plain where the groundwater gradient is almost null the proposed conceptual model highlights the importance of analysis at the entire catchment scale of both the landscape and the subsurface for the design of sponge city facilities the piedmonts of southern china are natural tanks that can adsorb huge quantity of rainfall due to a thicker aquifer higher permeability and a deeper water table thus these areas are strategic to prevent floods and waterlogging the redevelopment of the piedmont via the sponge city concept must be encouraged at the same time the rural piedmont must be safeguarded from urbanization since 2005 the ecologic control base line policy already safeguards the remaining rural zones of shenzhen because of the geomorphological and hydrogeological uncertainties field investigations and monitoring of water table fluctuations are recommended at a preliminary stage a catchment scale review of shenzhen was carried out to identify areas with a high and low additional storage capacity in the aquifers the shallow aquifers of the piedmont areas fig 2b had water table rises for each storm between 0 3 and 0 5 m during the wet season cumulative increments were less than 3 m despite the geological and hydrogeological uncertainties piedmont areas where the groundwater table is deeper than 4 m have significant additional storage capacity and the water table would not rise to the land surface except in extreme circumstances the areas with high additional storage capacity in the aquifers are depicted on fig 6 piedmont areas upstream of the reservoirs villages and towns built before the 1979 and reclaimed land areas have been excluded the proposed sponge city plan shenzhen committee 2016 focuses on a standard approach based on lid fig 1a and do not have high absorbance fig 6 in fig 6 the proposed 24 pilot sites for shenzhen s city are marked and numbered along the pearl river estuary and shenzhen bay the sites id 1 2 3 4 9 13 are located throughout the reclaimed land sector where there is limited additional storage capacity in the aquifers sponge city facilities involving above or near ground storage will be necessary moving eastwards the sites id 6 12 partially and 18 are located upstream of the shiyan shangmeilin and shenzhen reservoirs fig 6 and benefits will be produced only at very local scale as the reservoirs have large scale storage the luohu and futian sites id 12 and 16 include many old urbanized areas where the sponge city retrofitting will be difficult to implement the remaining sites include portions of areas with a significant additional storage capacity in the aquifers here groundwater infiltration facilities fig 1b could be combined together with the original lid plan for breakthrough results in the future new installations involving groundwater infiltration facilities could be extended to the remaining areas of the city with significant additional storage capacity in the aquifers fig 6 the shenzhen case study reveals that classic sponge city facilities fig 1a can usefully be combined with the proposed surface to ground elements fig 1b this combination will make it easier to reach the target set by mohurd 2014 of managing between 60 85 of annual runoff at a moderate cost the proposed approach combines both recharge urban aquifers along the piedmont and collection and reuse of runoff in the coastal areas instead of series of individual pilot sites the scheme for shenzhen and other cities becomes a multifunctional catchment scale storm runoff and water management plan the proposed model pushes the limits of the sponge city approach further and aims to mitigate the flooding and waterlogging risk caused by extreme meteorological events which were not considered by mohurd 2014 respecting geomorphological and hydrogeological criteria sponge city can be applied in other areas of southern china with limited economic resources leading to safe and sustainable development of less rich urban areas of china beside the use of urban aquifers further expedients can increment the managed runoff to cope the intense rainstorms the improvement of water drainage is recommended to allow a fast discharge of the sponge city installations and avoid the site saturation in respect of the architectural and archeological constrictions a reconstruction of the historical villages is also suggested lack of urban greenery and piled up buildings constitute impervious blocks prone to waterlogging where the sponge city retrofitting are also difficult to implement 4 conclusions our analyses of the shenzhen case study demonstrate that sponge city design can be improved by taking into account the local hydrogeological and geomorphological context these approaches can reveal both constraints and opportunities to ensure that installations are more effective and meet the established runoff control goals for the sponge city components a depth to groundwater of 4 m or more in moderately permeable terrain such as the piedmonts of southern china can be used to infiltrate larger quantities of storm water at lower costs than could realistically be stored in engineered tanks and ponds this water would then be available to support stream baseflows with ecological benefits or for extraction as a local water resource on the other hand the analysis identifies areas where sponge city elements will be of limited benefit in flood control such as upstream of reservoirs and areas where infiltration is not feasible such as on the higher slopes or on coastal land reclaimed lands with salinized aquifers and a groundwater table quasi coincident with the ground surface are also not suitable for storm water collection due to pipe and tank exfiltration the more expensive above ground facilities will be required in these areas the pilot sponge city sites of shenzhen partially match with the results of our geomorphological and hydrogeological analysis however some of the pilot sites are likely to have minimal effectiveness better siting of the pilot sites considering hydrogeological characteristics would provide test sites that have the potential to be more effective and reduce costs by incorporating infiltration based elements the shenzhen case study shows that a catchment scale plan can be developed to optimize urban runoff collection the plan could extend to a wider catchment and involve more cities and villages taking account of the hydrogeological and geomorphological criteria and integrating across the entire city or catchment scale should lead to less expensive and more effective sponge city designs funding this work has been supported by the national key r d program of china project number 2016yfc0402806 additional support was
