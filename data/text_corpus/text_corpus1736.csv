8680,allocation trade is an instrument that has been widely used to recover water for the environment during periods of scarcity droughts this paper proposes a water bank operating within a monopsony monopoly setting with the dual purpose of reallocating water among farmers and acquiring water for the environment during drought periods the proposed water bank would be managed by a public agency seeking to maximize economic efficiency generated in purchases and sales of water for agriculture and the efficiency generated by the recovery of water allocations for the environment an additional innovative feature of the analysis performed is that it considers the inefficiencies in the economy as a whole caused by public spending on water allocation purchases measured through the marginal cost of public funds the potential performance of the proposed water bank is simulated by mathematical programming techniques taking the guadalquivir river basin southern spain as an empirical case study the results provide evidence that in terms of economic efficiency the proposed institutional arrangement outperforms the instruments currently in place to purchase water allocations keywords allocation trade economic efficiency environmental flows marginal cost of public funds mathematical programming spain 1 introduction economic development and growing demand from the population are the principal drivers of increasing water scarcity worldwide 1 this is especially true in the mediterranean and semi arid regions where the competitive advantage of irrigated agriculture has meant that water consumption for irrigation has multiplied over recent decades leading to the closure of certain river basins 2 in these river basins strong competition for the use of water has led to the overexploitation of water resources without any reasonable engineering solution supply side measures to further expand the water supply to meet new demands in these cases new demands can only be met by reducing the existing ones through demand side policies among these demand side measures the use of economic instruments such as water markets and water banks has gradually become widespread 3 5 in closed basins scarcity problems become especially acute during drought periods when water availability is far too low to meet the rigid demand from the different water users under such conditions of severe cyclical scarcity the environment is often negatively affected since not enough resources are devoted to ensuring that water related environmental services are sustained e g instream flows are diminished and may even drop below the minimum environmental flows although several demand side policy instruments can be useful to cope with these situations 6 7 market instruments have been proven to be more suitable than other alternatives when it comes to recovering water for the environment in terms of both cost effectiveness and social acceptability 8 9 this fact explains the increasingly common implementation of market instruments for the acquisition or lease of water rights from the lower value uses mainly from the agricultural sector for environmental purposes good examples of this type of policy action are the public purchase of water rights or entitlements also known as buy back implemented in the murray darling basin in australia through the restoring the balance program 10 or the allocation trade leasing or temporary reallocation of water rights for environmental purposes during drought events used in california 11 and spain 12 in all the abovementioned cases a public water agency operating in an existing water market has sought to mitigate the environmental effects of water scarcity by acquiring water rights buy back or water allocations allocation trade from irrigators for the environment these environmental purchases have been implemented through water banks a kind of water market where the water agency centralizes purchase operations by organizing public tenders supported through public funding 13 although this market instrument public water agency purchasing water rights or water allocations without subsequently reallocating them has proven to be useful in real world settings for the recovery of water for environmental purposes a series of derivative instruments have been proposed in the literature to further improve drought management strategies these include a counter cyclical trade where allocations are bought and stored when water availability is abundant and used later on for environmental purposes 14 b the purchase of water rights allowing the agency to lease them through spot markets in years of abundance 15 and c the purchase of water option contracts with the agency reserving the right to purchase water allocations in the event of seasonal scarcity 16 the objective of this paper is to provide further insights into how the public purchase of water for environmental purposes during cyclical scarcity periods can be implemented more efficiently than with the water banks currently in place in this regard the alternative proposed in this paper is a water bank managed by a public agency that operates during drought events by purchasing and selling water allocations allocation trade with the dual purpose of reallocating water among productive users and acquiring water for environmental purposes the key feature of the proposed water bank is that it will operate in a monopsony monopoly setting no other water markets will be allowed in the river basin at the same time with the public agency using this market power to maximize economic efficiency in this regard this paper presents an empirical simulation of the potential performance of the proposed economic instrument using the guadalquivir river basin southern spain as a case study the results of this analysis will enable an assessment of whether the implementation of this design of water bank could contribute to improving public water management during drought periods reflected in social efficiency gains the idea of a water bank operating in a monopsony monopoly setting managed by a public agency seeking to maximize economic efficiency has recently been suggested by gutiérrez martín et al 17 these authors propose a design for this kind of water bank which would allow the public agency to balance its budget i e expenditure on purchases is equal to revenues from sales this self financed water bank is appealing since it can use its market power to recover water for environmental purposes and increase efficiency gains without any public expenditure but its potential performance is rather disappointing considering that only a small volume of water can be recovered for improving instream flows gutiérrez martín et al 17 reported a maximum of 10 4 of the water used for irrigation could be recovered for the environment in this sense the main contribution of the present paper is to provide evidence that the former design can be improved by allowing the public agency to spend public funds to purchase additional water for the environment during drought periods as will be demonstrated here this alternative design combining public water purchases based on society s willingness to pay for enhanced instream flows and the market power stemming from the monopsony monopoly setting achieves allocation arrangements that outperform the results obtained by the water banks currently in place or the one suggested by gutiérrez martín et al 17 in terms of efficiency gains a second innovative feature of this paper is the assessment carried out to the best of our knowledge this is the first time economic analysis has included the inefficiencies that inevitably result from the use of public funding to purchase environmental water through a water bank these efficiency losses are due to the distortions generated by the tax system when collecting money from the whole economy as in other analyses of public spending policies they have been measured through the marginal cost of public funds to achieve the abovementioned objective this paper is structured as follows after this introduction the second section explains the two alternative water banks assessed first the competitive water bank which replicates the operation of the current instruments used to purchase environmental water based on public tenders for the lease of water rights that are implemented within an already existing spot water market and second the monopsony monopoly water bank proposed as an alternative design of this economic instrument aimed at improving economic efficiency the analytical framework developed in this second section based on an economic analysis accounting for efficiency gains and losses is used to assess the performance of each of the water bank alternatives next in the third section the guadalquivir river basin is presented as the real case study considered for the empirical analysis the fourth section develops the mathematical programming models used to simulate the performance of the two water banks considered the fifth section summarizes the main results obtained for the two alternative economic instruments which are further discussed in the sixth section finally the last section concludes providing the main insights derived from this study 2 alternative designs for a water bank aimed at recovering water for the environment during drought periods 2 1 common settings for the two water banks analyzed a water bank is a kind of water market where an institutional intermediary acts as a link between buyers and sellers to centralize and facilitate the purchases and sales of water rights or water allocations 18 although this economic instrument has been implemented through a wide variety of institutional arrangements the review of the international experience provided by montilla lópez et al 13 indicates that the most suitable design for a water bank aimed at recovering water for the environment during drought periods should be constituted as follows nature of the institution responsible for its implementation a public authority i e public water banks in our case we assume that the two banks analyzed are organized and managed by a public water agency type of rights exchanged temporary transfer of water use rights or specific quantities of water i e allocation trade water banks management strategy the public water agency adopts a proactive strategy as a market maker i e active water banks first purchasing temporary water rights from rights holders productive users and then selling them totally or partially to other productive users in our case it is assumed that these operations are implemented through public purchase and sale tenders respectively objective resource reallocation and environmental purposes the water banks are managed with the twofold objective of reallocating water among productive users fostering the transfer of water from lower value to higher value uses and recovering a share of the purchased water for the environment purchasing allocations without subsequently reallocating them under this bank design the purchase and sale offers implemented by the public water agency are governed by the aggregate supply curve of water q p p p q p being the allocations of water that can be purchased from rights holders at a price p p and the aggregate demand curve of water q s p s q s being the allocations of water that can be sold to other productive users at a price p s respectively see figs 1 and 2 these aggregate curves represent respectively rights holders willingness to sell water and productive users willingness to buy water based on the heterogeneous marginal values of water in their production functions in fact q p is the aggregate volume of water among rights holders with a marginal value below p p while q s is the aggregate volume of water among productive users with marginal values above p s bank operations in the two water banks analyzed are also determined by the social demand for environmental water q e v e in this sense it is assumed that society attributes a null value to environmental water v e 0 when the instream flows are equal to or greater than those in an average hydrological year q e m a x this social value v e increases as the deficit in instream flows difference between the flows corresponding to an average hydrological year and the current actual flows increases reaching its highest value v e 0 when the instream flows equal those set as minimum environmental flows q e 0 see figs 1 and 2 thus q e is the aggregate volume of water that society is willing to recover for the environment with marginal social values above v e bank operations in the two water banks analyzed are also determined by the social demand for environmental water q e v e with this demand curve representing the population s willingness to pay for different levels of instream flows as pointed out by horne et al 19 developing this curve entails the following three steps 1 quantifying the impact of changes in instream flows on ecological condition 2 quantifying how these changes in ecological condition affect the provision of environmental services and 3 estimating the value of these changes in environmental service provision to society the complexity involved in relating instream flows ecology and the value to society e g non linear relationships or tipping points makes the task of estimating these social demand curves particularly challenging indeed it lies beyond the scope of this paper in any case despite these methodological difficulties and the scarcity of empirical evidence see ref 20 21 as examples of the limited existing literature in this regard it is worth pointing out that these demand curves are needed to look for the optimum social water allocation arrangements i e those that achieve the optimum trade off between the volumes to be allocated to productive and environmental uses as proposed here through the implementation of the two water banks analyzed 22 for the reasons provided above the shape of the social demand for environmental water to be used in this empirical research q e v e should rely on several simplifying assumptions first a simple linear environmental demand curve approximation is used see figs 1 and 2 which is consistent with previous studies 17 19 23 second it is assumed that society attributes a null value to environmental water v e 0 when the instream flows are equal to or greater than those in an average hydrological year q e m a x and third this social value v e linearly increases as the deficit in instream flows difference between the flows corresponding to an average hydrological year and the current actual flows increases reaching its highest value v e 0 when the instream flows equal those set as minimum environmental flows q e 0 see figs 1 and 2 thus this social demand can be formulated as follows 1 q e q e m a x 1 v e v e 0 where q e is the aggregate volume of water that society is willing to recover for the environment with marginal social values above v e and the environmental benefits for society are measured as the area underneath the linear demand curve introducing society s demand curve for environmental water into the analysis this demand must be added to the productive water demand to give an aggregate total demand q t p s v e for productive and environmental water see figs 1 and 2 the first institutional arrangement for the proposed water bank is a dual purpose public bank aimed at reallocating water allocation trade between productive users and recovering a share of the water purchased for the environment under this bank design social demand for environmental water is considered similar to any other demand since public funds support the recovery of environmental water at the same price as the water bought by productive users the bank is therefore managed neutrally by the water agency with the aim of reproducing the equilibrium reached in a competitive market competitive water bank indeed a similar type of bank operates in many regions of the world where public water agencies seek to mitigate the environmental effects of water scarcity by purchasing water allocations from irrigators in an existing spot water market allocation trade for environmental purposes thus this first design of the water bank attempts to replicate the operation of the market instruments already implemented worldwide to cope with cyclical scarcity 13 probably the best known example of this market approach to improve water management during cyclical scarcity is the drought emergency water bank developed in california in 1991 24 similarly the public water banks developed in spain as instruments to cope with droughts are also worth mentioning 12 as an alternative instrument aimed at improving public drought management the second arrangement proposed for the water bank is based in a monopsony monopoly setting monopsony monopoly water bank in this case any water trading operation outside the bank is forbidden allowing the water agency to use its market power to create a gap between purchase and sale prices the water agency managing the bank should first act as the sole buyer monopsony market of water allocations then the agency acts as the sole seller monopoly market of those purchased allocations moreover the agency can distinguish between water uses productive and environmental ones in the implementation of public sale offers enabling the marginal value of the water devoted to environmental uses to diverge from the sale price under this design of the water bank it is assumed that the water agency operates by buying and selling water allocations to maximize overall economic efficiency in water use both alternative designs for the water bank are explained below in more depth indicating how to assess the improvement in economic efficiency that each alternative entails compared with the baseline scenario no trade 2 2 competitive water bank under this institutional arrangement the water agency managing the bank aims to maximize economic efficiency during drought or cyclical scarcity events in a similar way to a competitive spot market to this end the agency first makes a public offer to purchase water allocations at a fixed price p p buying an amount of water q p as shown in fig 1 next the agency makes a public offer to sell those purchased water allocations treating both demands those from productive users and those from society environmental water equally this means that any demand for environmental water must be supported through public funding with society paying the bank the same price for every unit of water recovered for the environment that productive users pay for the water they bought this means that the social value of environmental water is equal to the price paid by productive users i e v e p s it also implies that the social demand and the aggregate total demand for water became functions of the sale price fixed by the agency q e p s and q t p s respectively therefore under this bank design at the price fixed by the agency for the sale offers p s productive users demand an amount of water q s for their private use and society demands q e units of water for environmental purposes with the total water demand being q t q s q e according to economic theory 25 this water bank reaches maximum economic efficiency operating at the point where the supply q p p p and total demand q t p s curves intersect 1 1 this is the optimum solution in the case of zero transaction costs we have applied this assumption for the sake of simplicity as occurs at point a in fig 1 this efficient solution can be achieved if purchase and sale prices are equal p p p s also allowing the quantities purchased and sold to become equal i e when the water balance is verified q p q s q e operating at point a also allows the water agency to balance the bank s cash flows since expenditure on purchases p p q p represented by the area p p a q p o equals the sum of revenues obtained through sales to productive users p s q s represented by the area p s b q s o and to society for environmental purposes p s q e represented by the area p s c q e o the latter revenue is provided by the public sector through the budget assigned to the water agency b u d g e t p s q e intersection point a reproduces the equilibrium reached in a competitive market providing the optimum solution by properly reallocating water resources between productive users and the environment at this point economic efficiency is maximized since the sum of the efficiency gains generated by purchases and sales is also maximized in this regard the efficiency generated by the public purchase offer can be calculated through the producer surplus e p measuring the profit obtained by water users when they sell their water allocations to the bank the difference between the sales revenue and the income foregone due to lower water input if the purchase price is fixed at p p as shown in fig 1 then e p p p a p p 0 area the efficiency generated by the bank sales to productive users is calculated through the consumer surplus e s accounting for the profit that productive users gain when they purchase water from the bank the difference between the additional income due to higher production and the purchase cost if the sale price is fixed at p s then e s p s 0 b p s area water recovery for environmental purposes also generates efficiency gains which can be accounted for using the consumer surplus concept as in the case of productive users in this case the environmental surplus e e measures the benefit that society gains from the water recovered for the environment as the difference between the additional economic efficiency due to higher instream flows and the budget needed to recover that water if the sale price is fixed at p s then e e v e 0 c p s area however it must be noted that the budgetary resources needed to implement any public spending policy such as environmental water recovery through a water bank must first be collected through the tax system and this inevitably causes distortions that reduce economic efficiency 26 surprisingly this fact has been largely ignored in the literature assessing the economic impact of policy instruments used to implement the public purchase or lease of water rights to reallocate water resources to environmental uses 2 2 within the water policy literature efficiency losses due to distortive tax systems have been considered in only a few papers in this regard the only studies worth mentioning are those by garcia and reynaud 27 and van heerden et al 28 which both focus on water pricing for this reason as far as we are aware all related empirical works to date have overestimated the efficiency gains generated this paper thus contributes to the existing literature by carrying out an efficiency analysis that accounts for the efficiency losses introduced by the tax system these losses can be quantified through the marginal cost of public funds m c f a parameter reflecting the shadow price that society pays for each monetary unit invested in public spending policies 29 thus environmental surplus e e can be more accurately measured as the difference between the efficiency generated by the amount of water diverted for environmental purposes area below society s demand curve for environmental water v e 0 c q e o and the social cost of this water in budgetary terms b u d g e t m c f 2 e e p s v e 0 q e p s d p s p s q e b u d g e t m c f in sum the water agency operates this water bank in a similar way to a competitive market achieving an optimum solution when the sum e p e s e e is maximized finally it is worth pointing out that under this theoretical framework the efficiency assessment for the baseline scenario no trade is null since q p q s q e 0 and then e p e s e e 0 as this scenario is taken as a benchmark it should be noted that the efficiency assessments for the two alternative designs proposed for the water bank should be considered as improvements over this baseline scenario 2 3 monopsony monopoly water bank similar to the previous bank design during a hydrological drought the public water agency can mitigate any deficit in instream flows by recovering water allocations granted to productive users and reallocating them to the environment however the key feature of this innovative water bank arrangement is that the public agency operates in a monopsony monopoly setting no other water markets are allowed in this setting the agency should first act as the sole buyer monopsony market of water allocations by organizing public purchase offers of temporary water rights subsequently this agency also acts as the sole seller monopoly market of those purchased allocations by organizing a public sale offer operating in this way the agency managing the bank can use its market power to create a gap between the purchase price p p and the sale price to productive users p s moreover this market power allows the agency to distinguish between water uses productive and environmental ones enabling the marginal value of the water sold to productive users p s to diverge from the marginal value of the water devoted to environmental uses v e as a non profit public institution the water agency is assumed to use this monopsony monopoly power to maximize economic efficiency covering any deficit in the bank s cash flow revenue obtained through public sale offers less expenditure on public purchase offers with public funds fig 2 shows how this design of the water bank should work the water agency first makes a public purchase offer fixing the purchase price p p and buying a quantity of water q p see point a as determined by the supply curve of water q p p p second the agency implements a public sale offer fixing a sale price p s higher than p p and selling a smaller amount of water q s see point b as determined by the demand curve of water for productive users q s p s the difference between the amount of water purchased and subsequently sold is allocated to the environment q e q p q s operating in this way the deficit in the bank s cash flow equals the difference between the revenue obtained through sales p s q s represented by the area p s b q s o and the expenditure on purchases p p q p represented by the area p p a q p o this deficit is compensated for with public funds through the budget assigned to the water agency b u d g e t p p q p p s q s among the infinite number of alternative operational strategies that fulfill the abovementioned water and financial balance constraints the public water agency aims to maximize total economic efficiency thus the single optimum solution to be achieved is the one that maximizes the sum of the efficiencies related to the water bank s purchases producer surplus e p equivalent to the area p p a p p 0 in fig 2 the efficiency linked to the water bank s sales to productive users consumer surplus e s measured by the p s 0 b p s area and the efficiency derived from the amount of water the bank recovers for the environment environmental surplus e e the latter efficiency is also calculated considering the efficiency losses introduced by the tax system as in the previous bank setting thus it is measured as the difference between the economic efficiency generated by the amount of water diverted for environmental purposes area v e 0 c q e o and the social cost of the budget needed to recover this water 3 e e v e v e 0 q e v e d v e v e q e b u d g e t m c f unlike with the competitive water bank it can be easily seen that by lowering the purchase price and increasing the sale price in relation to the competitive equilibrium both producer and consumer surpluses are reduced under this institutional arrangement however the environmental surplus increases when this monopsony monopoly water bank is implemented since the social cost of environmental water recovery becomes smaller in this sense the main purpose of this paper is to empirically confirm that the overall variation of the three surpluses considered for this bank setting e p e s e e outperforms the total economic efficiency gains generated by the competitive water bank and to quantitatively assess the improvement in economic efficiency that this novel water bank design could provide 3 modeling the performance of the two alternative water banks 3 1 competitive water bank in order to simulate the potential performance of the first institutional arrangement proposed for the water bank a mathematical programming model has been built considering that the competitive market s equilibrium is reached when the sum of the efficiencies derived from purchases sales to productive users and the recovery of water for environmental purposes is maximized the objective function of this model is the maximization of the total economic efficiency e c o m p e t i t i v e this efficiency can be operatively measured as the sum of the producer consumer and environmental surpluses e p e s and e e respectively as shown in eq 4 1 moreover based on the explanations provided in section 2 2 the constraints needed for simulating the performance of this water bank design are as follows 4 1 max e c o m p e t i t i v e e p e s e e subject to 4 2 e p p p 0 p p q p p p d p p 4 3 e s p s p s 0 q s p s d p s 4 4 e e p s v e 0 q e p s d p s p s q e b u d g e t m c f 4 5 q p q p p p 4 6 q s q s p s 4 7 q e q e m a x 1 p s v e 0 4 8 q p q s q e 4 9 b u d g e t p s q e 4 10 p p p s equations 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 account for the producer consumer and environmental surpluses respectively that is they represent the efficiency gains from water bank purchases e p from water bank sales to the agricultural sector e s and from water recovery with environmental purposes the first two are measured as the area under the q p p p and q s p s curves on the ordinate axis while the third is computed as explained in eq 2 equations 4 5 and 4 6 represent the volumes traded on both the supply and the demand sides the first represents the amount of water purchased by the bank from irrigators which in turn is the aggregate supply curve q p p p while the second represents the amount of water sold to farmers corresponding to the aggregate irrigators demand curve q s p s equation 4 7 denotes the social demand for environmental water as expressed in eq 1 but considering that v e p s making this demand a function of the sale price fixed by the agency q e p s equations 4 8 and 4 9 ensure that the water and financial funding needed balances are verified finally eq 4 10 ensures that purchase and sale prices are equal 3 2 monopsony monopoly water bank under the monopsony monopoly institutional arrangement for the water bank see explanations provided in section 2 3 the public water agency aims to maximize total economic efficiency e m o n o p o l y thus this agency manages the bank s operations in such a way as to maximize the sum of the surpluses generated in purchases e p sales to productive users e s and the recovery of water for environmental purposes e e as shown in the objective function eq 5 1 of the mathematical programming model built to simulate the performance of this water bank design 5 1 max e m o n o p o l y e p e s e e subject to 5 2 e p p p 0 p p q p p p d p p 5 3 e s p s p s 0 q s p s d p s 5 4 e e v e v e 0 q e v e d v e v e q e b u d g e t m c f 5 5 q p q p p p 5 6 q s q s p s 5 7 q e q e m a x 1 v e v e 0 5 8 q p q s q e 5 9 b u d g e t p p q p p s q s in this case the efficiency improvements generated by the public purchase offers e p in eq 5 2 and by public sale offers to the agricultural sector e s in eq 5 3 are calculated as in the previous institutional arrangement for the water bank similarly the equations regarding the aggregate supply q p p p in eq 5 5 the aggregate agricultural demand q s p s in eq 5 6 and market balance for water quantities eq 5 8 remain the same as in the previous model the model simulating the monopsony monopoly water bank diverges from the model 4 x in three equations first since this bank setting allows the agency to distinguish between water uses the marginal value of the water sold to productive users p s can diverge from the marginal value of the water devoted to environmental uses v e thus the efficiency derived from environmental water recovery e e in eq 5 4 and the social demand for environmental water q e in eq 5 7 are calculated as functions of v e as shown in eqs 1 and 2 second in this case the public funding needed for the water bank operations constraint 5 9 regarding the financial balance is calculated as the amount of money required to cover the deficit in cash flow considering the revenue obtained in sales p s q s and the expenditure on purchases p p q p finally it is worth mentioning that under this monopsony monopoly setting the water agency managing the bank can create a gap between purchase prices p p and sale prices to productive users p s thus the strategy implemented by this agency optimal solution is not constrained by eq 4 10 included in the previous model p p p s 3 3 comparing the performance of the two water banks proposed once the theoretical models for the two water banks have been established we can compare their potential performance in terms of total economic efficiency to that end we can change eq 4 10 to p p p s v e since in the optimum solutions of the competitive water bank the marginal values of the water devoted to environmental uses v e are the same as the equilibrium market price p p p s whenever v e 0 is higher than the clearing price 3 3 for values of v e 0 lower than the clearing price the two models perform identically as no water is recovered for the environment and only agricultural water is traded replacing p s by v e in eqs 4 4 and 4 7 these constraints became identical to eqs 5 4 and 5 7 moreover it can be proved that eqs 4 9 and 5 9 are also equivalent 4 4 as explained before q e q p q s thus eq 4 9 can be written as b u d g e t p s q p q s p s q p p s q s furthermore as in the case of the competitive water bank p p p s we can write this equation as eq 5 9 b u d g e t p p q p p s q s thus it can be checked that the feasible region of the model 5 x given by eqs 5 2 5 9 is bigger than that of model 4 x given by eqs 4 2 4 9 equivalent to 5 2 5 9 plus eq 4 10 since the latter model has one additional constraint eq 4 10 that needs to be met this means that the maximum values of the common objective function total economic efficiency e reached in model 5 x are always equal to or higher than those obtained in model 4 x in other words the monopsony monopoly design proposed for the water bank is able to reach higher levels of total economic efficiency than the competitive design furthermore it is worth comparing the objective function in the two designs of the water market e e p e s e e considering the explanations provided above the only difference regarding this mathematical expression in the two models is the inefficiency generated by the public budget used for water recovery term b u d g e t m c f in eqs 4 3 and 5 3 to draw conclusions about the efficiency performance of these alternative designs the inefficiency in the monopsony monopoly setting is subtracted from the inefficiency in the competitive setting as follows 6 b u d g e t m c f c o m p e t i t i v e b u d g e t m c f m o n o p o l y p s q e m c f p p q p p s q s m c f p s q e p p q p p s q s m c f p s q e q s p p q p m c f p s q p p p q p m c f q p p s p p m c f this proves that as long as the water agency can create a gap between purchase prices and sale prices to productive users as proposed for the monopsony monopoly setting i e p s p p the inefficiency generated by the use of public funds in the competitive setting is higher i e positive difference in eq 6 and this difference increases with m c f it also confirms that the total economic efficiency reached with the monopsony monopoly design model 5 x is always equal to or higher than the one obtained in the competitive design model 4 x the two proofs detailed above regarding the size of the solution space and the inefficiency in the use of public funds provide theoretical evidence of the superiority of the monopsony monopoly setting in terms of total economic efficiency the next sections of the paper seek to confirm this conclusion through an empirical application in a real world setting 4 case study 4 1 the guadalquivir river basin the guadalquivir river basin grb in southern spain covers an area of 58 000 km2 and is home to a population of 4 1 million the competitive advantage enjoyed by irrigated agriculture vegetables olive cotton citrus and other fruits in this territory has generated a steady increase in the demand for agricultural water in recent decades eventually leading to the closure of the basin 30 nowadays the average water use in the grb is 3815 mm3 year the agricultural sector being the primary water user consuming 88 of the available water while only 10 is used by households and other urban demands 31 structural water scarcity in this closed basin is cyclically aggravated by drought episodes recurrent in mediterranean climate regions climate change predictions for the grb suggest that drought events are expected to become more frequent and intense 32 the basin is closed to new users because any further increase in the water supply is impossible thus several demand side policy instruments have been implemented to facilitate a more efficient reallocation of the scant water resources in this sense the 1999 reform of the spanish water act allowed the implementation of water trading instruments both spot water markets between productive users and the temporary establishment of public water banks termed water exchange centers for environmental purposes in the event of exceptional situations of water scarcity i e severe droughts the water rights priority system established by law in spain guarantees that urban uses are served first in case of water scarcity this means that only farmers are willing to participate in water trading as a drought management instrument since of all the users they are the most negatively affected by shortages in the water supply during this cyclical scarcity only irrigators with valuable productions are willing to buy additional allocations while only the farmers with low marginal value of water are willing to lease their own water rights however market activity has been limited to date because of the high transaction costs 12 moreover even in the most severe drought episodes e g 2007 2008 public water banks have not been implemented in the grb due to the lack of political will i e public budget to implement them 33 the grb management plan grbmp chg 34 establishes a minimal ecological flow of 305 mm3 year to guarantee the resilience of environmental services however during drought periods when instream flows are just above this minimum level water related ecosystems are negatively impacted and society would be willing to recover water from agriculture to minimize environmental damages 35 all the reasons provided above the structural and cyclical water scarcity the legal framework for water trading instruments the heterogeneity in the marginal value of water between irrigators and the social demand for the recovery of environmental water justify the use of the grb as case study to assess the potential performance of the two water bank arrangements proposed as demand side instruments aimed at improving drought management 4 2 feeding the models simulating the performance of the water banks in the grb the empirical analysis performed relies on the aggregate supply curves of water from agricultural users q p p p and the aggregate demand curves of water for irrigation q s p s in the grb estimated by gutiérrez martín et al 17 these authors based their estimations on the results of mathematical programming models built by montilla lópez et al 33 to simulate irrigators heterogenous trading behavior within a water bank framework decisions regarding the sale and purchase of water allocations in this basin gutiérrez martín et al 17 estimated aggregate supply and demand curves for three different scenarios of water availability intensity of droughts a moderate drought where water allocations to irrigators are only 75 of those granted in an average hydrological year b severe drought where only 50 of the water granted in an average hydrological year is allocated to irrigators and c extreme drought where allocations to irrigators are only 25 of those granted in an average hydrological year these scenarios are labeled as s75 s50 and s25 respectively the polynomial functions expressing the aggregate supply and the aggregate demand in each scenario are shown in table 1 these functions are the ones used for simulating the purchase and sale offers implemented by the public water agency within the two alternative institutional arrangements proposed for the water bank another common setting for both institutional arrangements is related to the social demand for environmental water q e v e unfortunately there is no previous estimate of this demand in the gbr that can be used for the empirical analysis proposed this justifies the use of the simplified linear demand defined in eq 1 the parameter q e m a x has been estimated considering that the average instream flow the flow registered in an average hydrological year in the grb is 7092 mm3 year while the minimum ecological flow established in the grbmp is 305 mm3 year thus it is reasonable to assume that the maximum quantity of water that society would demand for environmental purposes with a non zero willingness to pay q e m a x is the difference between average flow and minimum ecological flow 6787 mm3 year however there is no robust empirical estimate available for the maximum value that society would be willing to pay for environmental water v e 0 given this lack of information the potential performance of both water bank designs is simulated parameterizing this value from 0 to 1 euro per cubic meter this range of hypothetical values for v e 0 is considered wide enough to comprise all the unit costs for water supply estimated for spain 36 and all water prices paid in the existing spot water markets 12 furthermore the parameter m c f used for modeling both water bank designs is taken as equal to 1 2 this means that every 100 monetary units collected by the public sector through taxes involves efficiency losses of 20 monetary units due to the distortion of the whole economic system caused by taxation this reference value for this parameter is based on more recent estimates for spain 37 which are in line with the values estimated for most oecd countries 38 5 results 5 1 competitive water bank fig 3 shows the results obtained for the competitive water bank for the three water scarcity scenarios proposed s75 s50 and s25 in terms of volumes traded clearing prices public funding required and efficiency improvements relative to the baseline scenario no trading achieved for every maximum marginal value of environmental water v e 0 ranging from 0 to 0 8 m3 the three scenarios considered reveal net efficiency gains compared to the baseline scenario although with some differences the parametrization of v e 0 shows three defined stages or phases in all the scenarios considered the main features of every phase are summarized in table 2 the first phase is found for the lowest values of v e 0 with this phase characterized by the fact that no water is recovered for the environment see fig 3a c as the marginal value of environmental water is below the market equilibrium price p p p s see fig 3d f thus the water bank buys water allocations from farmers who are willing to sell and subsequently sells them all to other farmers who are willing to buy q p q s since expenditure on purchases equals revenue obtained in sales i e the bank is self financed no public funding is needed for water bank operations see fig 3g i this first phase covers the values of v e 0 ranging from 0 to the hypothetical clearing prices of a competitive market in each drought scenario since this hypothetical clearing price for each scenario is higher when the water shortage is more acute ranging from 0 15 m3 for scenario s75 to 0 40 m3 for scenario s25 see fig 3d f the more severe the drought the longer the first phase comparing the volume of water traded see fig 3a c it can be observed that the largest transfers measured in absolute terms mm3 are found in the scenario s50 however it is worth pointing out that the quantity of water traded measured in relative terms water trade over total water availability rises from 16 0 in scenario s75 to 27 0 in s50 and to 38 6 in scenario s25 relative to the no trade baseline scenario it is shown that this water bank design involves an improvement in economic efficiency for the three water availability scenarios amounting to around 50 million euros see fig 3j l during this first phase this efficiency enhancement is due only to the surpluses generated in purchases e p and sales e s since no water is recovered for the environment e e 0 after the maximum environmental water value v e 0 reaches the corresponding clearing prices the simulation results of the competitive water bank enter a second phase where a share of the water allocations bought from farmers is recovered for the environment reallocating the rest among other farmers q p q s q e and q e 0 the higher the maximum environmental water value the larger the quantities purchased and recovered for the environment and the lesser the quantity reallocated among farmers see fig 3a c this second phase ends when v e 0 becomes so high that no water is reallocated for productive uses and all purchased allocations are recovered for the environment during this second phase the water agency managing the bank needs public funding to support the purchases of environmental water see fig 3g i the amount of public funding needed increases as v e 0 and the amount of water bought q p rise regarding the efficiency assessment see fig 3j l it is worth noting that over this second phase the surplus generated in sales e s decreases as the water reallocated for irrigation declines while the surplus generated in agricultural purchases e p increases as the water bought from irrigators rises moreover environmental water purchases also generate a surplus e e although this environmental surplus takes negatives values this negative sign for environmental efficiency can be explained by the fact that this spending policy involves an efficiency loss derived from the economic distortions caused by the tax system when raising the public funds needed that is the efficiency gains stemming from the improvement in instream flows measured as p s v e 0 q e p s d p s p s q e in eq 4 4 do not offset the loss of economic efficiency caused by raising public funds through taxes measured as the marginal cost of public funds b u d g e t m c f in the same eq 4 4 this negative environmental efficiency means that total economic efficiency e p e s e e at the beginning of the second phase is slightly lower than in the first phase since the increases in the producer surplus are outweighed by the sum of the decreases in consumer and environmental surpluses however once the minimum total efficiency has been reached for 0 20 0 33 and 0 50 m3 for the scenarios s75 s50 and s25 respectively this measure of economic efficiency increases in all scenarios indeed by the end of the second phase these values are higher than in the first phase the third phase begins when the maximum environmental water value is high enough that all water purchases are allocated to the environment q p q e and consequently no water is sold for productive uses q s 0 this is when v e 0 is higher than 0 30 0 45 and 0 63 m3 for the scenarios s75 s50 and s25 respectively in every scenario total economic efficiency continues to follow the rising trends observed at the end of the second phase since when values of v e 0 are high enough the increases in the producer surplus outweigh the sum of the decreases in consumer and environmental surpluses the higher the value of v e 0 the higher the economic efficiency in all cases the total efficiency improvements are greater than those obtained in the first phase 5 2 monopsony monopoly water bank in the case of the monopsony monopoly water bank the parametrization of v e 0 shows four phases instead of three as can be seen in fig 4 the main features of these phases are summarized in table 3 the first phase is identical to that of the previous model where v e 0 is below the market equilibrium price p p p s thus no water is recovered for the environment q p q s q e 0 and the water bank is self financed a second phase can be observed for the following ranges of v e 0 0 16 0 20 m3 0 26 0 32 m3 and 0 41 0 49 m3 for s75 s50 and s25 respectively over this relatively short phase the water bank reduces its purchases of water allocations from farmers a decreasing share of these purchases is reallocated to other farmers while an increasing portion is recovered for the environment q p q s q e see fig 4a c unlike with the competitive bank it is worth pointing out that during this phase the agency managing the monopsony monopoly water bank exerts its market power to create a gap between the purchase and the sale prices p p p s as shown in fig 4d f allowing the bank to be self financed since no public funding is needed for the acquisition of environmental water see fig 4g i moreover the water agency maximizes total efficiency for these ranges of v e 0 by discriminating between the marginal value of environmental water v e and the sale price p s v e as shown in fig 4d f discriminating between these two water values leads to improvements positive values in environmental efficiency in this case the efficiency gains resulting from the improvement in instream flows measured as v e v e 0 q e v e d v e v e q e in eq 5 4 outweigh the loss of economic efficiency caused by raising public funds through taxes quantified through the marginal cost of public funds b u d g e t m c f in the same eq 5 4 there is therefore a continuous increase in total economic efficiency e p e s e e as shown in fig 4j l consequently the level of economic efficiency linked to water use at basin level from this phase onwards is higher than in the competitive water bank the third phase begins when values of v e 0 become high enough that the water bank has to spend public funds to further increase economic efficiency by recovering more water for the environment see fig 4a c that is over this third phase the monopsony monopoly power that allows the public agency to self finance its acquisition of more environmental water is not enough to further increase economic efficiency and an increasing amount of public funding is needed to purchase more water allocations for environmental purposes see fig 4g i nevertheless unlike with the competitive water bank it is worth pointing out that discriminating between water values p p p s v e allows the water agency to maintain positive values improvements for environmental efficiency e e even at increasing positive marginal values the higher the value of v e 0 the higher the slope of e e the gradual substitution of q s by q e ends at a point of v e 0 where the agricultural sector cannot afford to compete for the purchase of water allocations with the social demand for environmental water q s 0 this point defines the beginning of the fourth phase for values of v e 0 above 0 35 m3 0 53 m3and 0 75 m3 in the case of s75 s50 and s25 respectively see fig 4a c over this phase all the water allocations bought from farmers are devoted to the environment q p q e supported by an increasing amount of public funding see fig 4g i however the monopsony monopoly power of the water agency allows it to keep purchase prices below the marginal environmental value of water p p v e as shown in fig 4d f thus we observe an increasing trend in total efficiency improvement see fig 4j l 6 discussion the results have shown that both water bank settings can generate an increase in economic efficiency compared to the no trade baseline scenario however the most relevant hypothesis to be tested is whether the monopsony monopoly water bank improves drought management from a social point of view compared to current policy competitive water bank in order to do so the results obtained for the competitive and the monopsony monopoly water banks are compared using differential values of performance variables volumes traded prices cash flows and efficiency improvements in this regard figs 5 and 7 show the differences calculated by subtracting the values of the variable obtained in the simulations of the competitive water bank from the results found for the monopsony monopoly water bank for instance a negative value for the volume of water recovered for the environment q e as shown in fig 5a c indicates that the monopsony monopoly bank secures less water for the environment than the competitive bank for the value of v e 0 and drought scenario considered the differential values observed in fig 5 show that the competitive water bank recovers more water for the environment although more public funding is needed compared to the monopsony monopoly water bank the case of v e 0 0 60 for scenario s50 can be taken as an example in both water bank arrangements this maximum value of environmental water means that no water allocations are sold to farmers point located in the last phase at this point the competitive water bank recovers 240 mm3 more water for the environment than the monopsony monopoly bank see fig 5b however at this point the competitive water bank needs 205 million euros more public funds to implement these environmental purchases see fig 5e in order to provide a broader view of environmental purchases of water allocations it is worth estimating the unit costs of environmental water recovered in terms of the public funding required i e the ratio between the funds needed and the volume recovered expressed in euros per cubic meter fig 6 shows the differences between the two banks proposed in terms of the unit costs borne by the public agency managing the banks for any quantity of water recovered for the environment in each scarcity scenario the lower costs for almost every quantity and drought scenario provide evidence of the advantage offered by the monopsony monopoly water bank in terms of the public budget assigned less public funding is needed per unit of water recovered for environmental purposes especially in the phase where the monopsony monopoly water bank is self financed it can be seen than the lower the quantity of water to recover the greater the gap in the cost per cubic meter between the two bank designs on the contrary for large quantities of water to recover the advantage of the monopsony monopoly bank is diminished indeed for v e values greater than the maximum p s the agricultural sector does not participate in the market meaning that the cost of environmental water is the same for both water bank designs as can be seen in fig 6 for the scenario s25 when the volumes of water recovered are higher than 400 mm3 fig 7 shows the differences between the two water bank settings considered regarding economic efficiency improvements the most relevant outcome to highlight is the higher levels of total economic efficiency e achieved with the monopsony monopoly water bank compared to the competitive one for every drought scenario when the values of v e 0 exceed the competitive equilibrium prices this confirms the potential benefits of the bank proposed here as an economic instrument to improve drought management finally the role of the parameter measuring the marginal cost of public funds m c f in the empirical analyses also merits further analysis as stated above one of the contributions of this paper is that it accounts for this additional cost of using public funds thus providing a more accurate estimation of efficiency improvements when implementing a water bank with environmental purposes in this regard it should be pointed out that the value for the m c f taken for the analysis performed m c f 1 2 is a reasonable assumption considering a proportional tax rate increase an equal marginal tax rate increase in all tax brackets 38 however the estimates of this parameter vary significantly depending on the assumptions regarding how additional public funds are collected i e taxation instruments implemented in fact more recent estimates for spain 37 report values of m c f ranging from 0 82 to 1 88 in this sense it is worth noting that this parameter has a marked effect on simulation results since any change in the value considered would involve relatively large changes in the performance simulated for both water bank designs generally speaking it can be stated that the higher the value of m c f the more attractive the monopsony monopoly water bank becomes since differences in efficiency improvement between the two alternative banks grow higher values of m c f lead to higher inefficiencies in the competitive water bank from phase 2 onwards as an illustrative example consider v e 0 0 60 for the scenario s50 if m c f increases from 1 2 to 1 4 the difference in the total economic efficiency improvement achieved between the monopsony monopoly and the competitive water banks increases from 23 4 million euros to 74 9 million euros further underlining the attractiveness of the monopsony monopoly water bank proposed it is also worth pointing out that for medium to high social values of environmental water the economic efficiency achieved with the monopsony monopoly water bank design proposed in this paper far exceeds the level generated by the self financed monopsony monopoly water bank proposed by gutiérrez martín et al 17 despite the appealing prospect of recovering water for the environment without any public expenditure the amount of water that can be recovered for the environment by the latter is markedly lower than that achieved by the former which is ultimately reflected in lower levels of economic efficiency indeed the monopsony monopoly water bank suggested in this paper shares some characteristics with the design proposed by gutiérrez martín et al 17 in that the two water banks operate identically until the start of phase 3 at which point the former makes use of public funds to purchase additional environmental water thereby achieving higher levels of economic efficiency 7 conclusions the public monopsony monopoly water bank proposed is an interesting drought management policy option to recover water for the environment during scarcity events this study demonstrates its potential to outperform the alternative design currently implemented public purchases within an existing competitive spot water market in terms of economic efficiency the success of this water bank arrangement is based on its ability to partially self finance public purchases of environmental water with the public agency managing the bank using its market power to create a gap between the purchase and the sale prices and also to set different prices at which the water bank can reallocate the water among end users differentiating between prices to farmers willing to buy p s and prices to society for environmental water v e a key innovation of this study is that it accounts for the inefficiencies inherent in the use of public expenditure measured through the marginal cost of public funds m c f when making public purchases of water allocations or rights it has been demonstrated that the net economic efficiency variations when purchasing water for the environment in an existing competitive water market are not always positive in fact for a range of environmental water values this policy option leads to a decrease in total economic efficiency since the losses caused by the distortion effects of raising public funds on the whole economy are not fully offset by the efficiency increases achieved through market operations moreover this finding suggests that previous assessments of public water recovery for the environment through market instruments could have overestimated efficiency gains because they ignored inefficiencies relating to public expenditure it is suggested that going forward any policy assessment involving the public purchase of water allocations or rights should account for these inefficiencies through the marginal cost of public funds even accounting for the inefficiencies regarding the use of public funds it has been shown that the monopsony monopoly water bank proposed can increase total economic efficiency for every value of environmental water in all cases yielding equal or higher economic efficiency estimates than the competitive market option although it would not change the conclusions presented above it is worth commenting that the simulation results reported could be improved with more accurate estimates of some of the parameters considered in the models specifically society s demand for environmental water and the m c f parameter given the lack of accurate information about public willingness to pay for environmental water we assumed linear demand and chose to parametrize the maximum value that society would be willing to pay for public water purchases v e 0 in order to better estimate society s demand for environmental water there is a need for future research to quantify the impact of a change in instream flows on ecological condition its effects on environmental service provision and the value of the change in environmental service provision to society in this sense it is worth remarking that these demand curves are needed to enable policy makers to look for optimum social water allocation arrangements regarding the m c f parameter it should be noted that the estimate used in the model m c f 1 2 is based on estimates for other developed countries for a proportional increase in all taxes collected at national level however the actual value for this parameter should also be more accurately estimated for the case study analyzed considering the inefficiencies caused by the spanish tax system the proposed bank would be financed by the spanish national budget and how the tax increase would be implemented from a practical point of view it is obvious that accurate estimates of both society s demand and m c f are a prerequisite for the proper implementation of the proposed economic instrument in a real world setting finally it is also worth pointing out that for the sake of simplicity the assessment performed has been carried out assuming zero transaction costs in this sense it would be interesting for further research to estimate both institutional and operational transaction costs 39

8680,allocation trade is an instrument that has been widely used to recover water for the environment during periods of scarcity droughts this paper proposes a water bank operating within a monopsony monopoly setting with the dual purpose of reallocating water among farmers and acquiring water for the environment during drought periods the proposed water bank would be managed by a public agency seeking to maximize economic efficiency generated in purchases and sales of water for agriculture and the efficiency generated by the recovery of water allocations for the environment an additional innovative feature of the analysis performed is that it considers the inefficiencies in the economy as a whole caused by public spending on water allocation purchases measured through the marginal cost of public funds the potential performance of the proposed water bank is simulated by mathematical programming techniques taking the guadalquivir river basin southern spain as an empirical case study the results provide evidence that in terms of economic efficiency the proposed institutional arrangement outperforms the instruments currently in place to purchase water allocations keywords allocation trade economic efficiency environmental flows marginal cost of public funds mathematical programming spain 1 introduction economic development and growing demand from the population are the principal drivers of increasing water scarcity worldwide 1 this is especially true in the mediterranean and semi arid regions where the competitive advantage of irrigated agriculture has meant that water consumption for irrigation has multiplied over recent decades leading to the closure of certain river basins 2 in these river basins strong competition for the use of water has led to the overexploitation of water resources without any reasonable engineering solution supply side measures to further expand the water supply to meet new demands in these cases new demands can only be met by reducing the existing ones through demand side policies among these demand side measures the use of economic instruments such as water markets and water banks has gradually become widespread 3 5 in closed basins scarcity problems become especially acute during drought periods when water availability is far too low to meet the rigid demand from the different water users under such conditions of severe cyclical scarcity the environment is often negatively affected since not enough resources are devoted to ensuring that water related environmental services are sustained e g instream flows are diminished and may even drop below the minimum environmental flows although several demand side policy instruments can be useful to cope with these situations 6 7 market instruments have been proven to be more suitable than other alternatives when it comes to recovering water for the environment in terms of both cost effectiveness and social acceptability 8 9 this fact explains the increasingly common implementation of market instruments for the acquisition or lease of water rights from the lower value uses mainly from the agricultural sector for environmental purposes good examples of this type of policy action are the public purchase of water rights or entitlements also known as buy back implemented in the murray darling basin in australia through the restoring the balance program 10 or the allocation trade leasing or temporary reallocation of water rights for environmental purposes during drought events used in california 11 and spain 12 in all the abovementioned cases a public water agency operating in an existing water market has sought to mitigate the environmental effects of water scarcity by acquiring water rights buy back or water allocations allocation trade from irrigators for the environment these environmental purchases have been implemented through water banks a kind of water market where the water agency centralizes purchase operations by organizing public tenders supported through public funding 13 although this market instrument public water agency purchasing water rights or water allocations without subsequently reallocating them has proven to be useful in real world settings for the recovery of water for environmental purposes a series of derivative instruments have been proposed in the literature to further improve drought management strategies these include a counter cyclical trade where allocations are bought and stored when water availability is abundant and used later on for environmental purposes 14 b the purchase of water rights allowing the agency to lease them through spot markets in years of abundance 15 and c the purchase of water option contracts with the agency reserving the right to purchase water allocations in the event of seasonal scarcity 16 the objective of this paper is to provide further insights into how the public purchase of water for environmental purposes during cyclical scarcity periods can be implemented more efficiently than with the water banks currently in place in this regard the alternative proposed in this paper is a water bank managed by a public agency that operates during drought events by purchasing and selling water allocations allocation trade with the dual purpose of reallocating water among productive users and acquiring water for environmental purposes the key feature of the proposed water bank is that it will operate in a monopsony monopoly setting no other water markets will be allowed in the river basin at the same time with the public agency using this market power to maximize economic efficiency in this regard this paper presents an empirical simulation of the potential performance of the proposed economic instrument using the guadalquivir river basin southern spain as a case study the results of this analysis will enable an assessment of whether the implementation of this design of water bank could contribute to improving public water management during drought periods reflected in social efficiency gains the idea of a water bank operating in a monopsony monopoly setting managed by a public agency seeking to maximize economic efficiency has recently been suggested by gutiérrez martín et al 17 these authors propose a design for this kind of water bank which would allow the public agency to balance its budget i e expenditure on purchases is equal to revenues from sales this self financed water bank is appealing since it can use its market power to recover water for environmental purposes and increase efficiency gains without any public expenditure but its potential performance is rather disappointing considering that only a small volume of water can be recovered for improving instream flows gutiérrez martín et al 17 reported a maximum of 10 4 of the water used for irrigation could be recovered for the environment in this sense the main contribution of the present paper is to provide evidence that the former design can be improved by allowing the public agency to spend public funds to purchase additional water for the environment during drought periods as will be demonstrated here this alternative design combining public water purchases based on society s willingness to pay for enhanced instream flows and the market power stemming from the monopsony monopoly setting achieves allocation arrangements that outperform the results obtained by the water banks currently in place or the one suggested by gutiérrez martín et al 17 in terms of efficiency gains a second innovative feature of this paper is the assessment carried out to the best of our knowledge this is the first time economic analysis has included the inefficiencies that inevitably result from the use of public funding to purchase environmental water through a water bank these efficiency losses are due to the distortions generated by the tax system when collecting money from the whole economy as in other analyses of public spending policies they have been measured through the marginal cost of public funds to achieve the abovementioned objective this paper is structured as follows after this introduction the second section explains the two alternative water banks assessed first the competitive water bank which replicates the operation of the current instruments used to purchase environmental water based on public tenders for the lease of water rights that are implemented within an already existing spot water market and second the monopsony monopoly water bank proposed as an alternative design of this economic instrument aimed at improving economic efficiency the analytical framework developed in this second section based on an economic analysis accounting for efficiency gains and losses is used to assess the performance of each of the water bank alternatives next in the third section the guadalquivir river basin is presented as the real case study considered for the empirical analysis the fourth section develops the mathematical programming models used to simulate the performance of the two water banks considered the fifth section summarizes the main results obtained for the two alternative economic instruments which are further discussed in the sixth section finally the last section concludes providing the main insights derived from this study 2 alternative designs for a water bank aimed at recovering water for the environment during drought periods 2 1 common settings for the two water banks analyzed a water bank is a kind of water market where an institutional intermediary acts as a link between buyers and sellers to centralize and facilitate the purchases and sales of water rights or water allocations 18 although this economic instrument has been implemented through a wide variety of institutional arrangements the review of the international experience provided by montilla lópez et al 13 indicates that the most suitable design for a water bank aimed at recovering water for the environment during drought periods should be constituted as follows nature of the institution responsible for its implementation a public authority i e public water banks in our case we assume that the two banks analyzed are organized and managed by a public water agency type of rights exchanged temporary transfer of water use rights or specific quantities of water i e allocation trade water banks management strategy the public water agency adopts a proactive strategy as a market maker i e active water banks first purchasing temporary water rights from rights holders productive users and then selling them totally or partially to other productive users in our case it is assumed that these operations are implemented through public purchase and sale tenders respectively objective resource reallocation and environmental purposes the water banks are managed with the twofold objective of reallocating water among productive users fostering the transfer of water from lower value to higher value uses and recovering a share of the purchased water for the environment purchasing allocations without subsequently reallocating them under this bank design the purchase and sale offers implemented by the public water agency are governed by the aggregate supply curve of water q p p p q p being the allocations of water that can be purchased from rights holders at a price p p and the aggregate demand curve of water q s p s q s being the allocations of water that can be sold to other productive users at a price p s respectively see figs 1 and 2 these aggregate curves represent respectively rights holders willingness to sell water and productive users willingness to buy water based on the heterogeneous marginal values of water in their production functions in fact q p is the aggregate volume of water among rights holders with a marginal value below p p while q s is the aggregate volume of water among productive users with marginal values above p s bank operations in the two water banks analyzed are also determined by the social demand for environmental water q e v e in this sense it is assumed that society attributes a null value to environmental water v e 0 when the instream flows are equal to or greater than those in an average hydrological year q e m a x this social value v e increases as the deficit in instream flows difference between the flows corresponding to an average hydrological year and the current actual flows increases reaching its highest value v e 0 when the instream flows equal those set as minimum environmental flows q e 0 see figs 1 and 2 thus q e is the aggregate volume of water that society is willing to recover for the environment with marginal social values above v e bank operations in the two water banks analyzed are also determined by the social demand for environmental water q e v e with this demand curve representing the population s willingness to pay for different levels of instream flows as pointed out by horne et al 19 developing this curve entails the following three steps 1 quantifying the impact of changes in instream flows on ecological condition 2 quantifying how these changes in ecological condition affect the provision of environmental services and 3 estimating the value of these changes in environmental service provision to society the complexity involved in relating instream flows ecology and the value to society e g non linear relationships or tipping points makes the task of estimating these social demand curves particularly challenging indeed it lies beyond the scope of this paper in any case despite these methodological difficulties and the scarcity of empirical evidence see ref 20 21 as examples of the limited existing literature in this regard it is worth pointing out that these demand curves are needed to look for the optimum social water allocation arrangements i e those that achieve the optimum trade off between the volumes to be allocated to productive and environmental uses as proposed here through the implementation of the two water banks analyzed 22 for the reasons provided above the shape of the social demand for environmental water to be used in this empirical research q e v e should rely on several simplifying assumptions first a simple linear environmental demand curve approximation is used see figs 1 and 2 which is consistent with previous studies 17 19 23 second it is assumed that society attributes a null value to environmental water v e 0 when the instream flows are equal to or greater than those in an average hydrological year q e m a x and third this social value v e linearly increases as the deficit in instream flows difference between the flows corresponding to an average hydrological year and the current actual flows increases reaching its highest value v e 0 when the instream flows equal those set as minimum environmental flows q e 0 see figs 1 and 2 thus this social demand can be formulated as follows 1 q e q e m a x 1 v e v e 0 where q e is the aggregate volume of water that society is willing to recover for the environment with marginal social values above v e and the environmental benefits for society are measured as the area underneath the linear demand curve introducing society s demand curve for environmental water into the analysis this demand must be added to the productive water demand to give an aggregate total demand q t p s v e for productive and environmental water see figs 1 and 2 the first institutional arrangement for the proposed water bank is a dual purpose public bank aimed at reallocating water allocation trade between productive users and recovering a share of the water purchased for the environment under this bank design social demand for environmental water is considered similar to any other demand since public funds support the recovery of environmental water at the same price as the water bought by productive users the bank is therefore managed neutrally by the water agency with the aim of reproducing the equilibrium reached in a competitive market competitive water bank indeed a similar type of bank operates in many regions of the world where public water agencies seek to mitigate the environmental effects of water scarcity by purchasing water allocations from irrigators in an existing spot water market allocation trade for environmental purposes thus this first design of the water bank attempts to replicate the operation of the market instruments already implemented worldwide to cope with cyclical scarcity 13 probably the best known example of this market approach to improve water management during cyclical scarcity is the drought emergency water bank developed in california in 1991 24 similarly the public water banks developed in spain as instruments to cope with droughts are also worth mentioning 12 as an alternative instrument aimed at improving public drought management the second arrangement proposed for the water bank is based in a monopsony monopoly setting monopsony monopoly water bank in this case any water trading operation outside the bank is forbidden allowing the water agency to use its market power to create a gap between purchase and sale prices the water agency managing the bank should first act as the sole buyer monopsony market of water allocations then the agency acts as the sole seller monopoly market of those purchased allocations moreover the agency can distinguish between water uses productive and environmental ones in the implementation of public sale offers enabling the marginal value of the water devoted to environmental uses to diverge from the sale price under this design of the water bank it is assumed that the water agency operates by buying and selling water allocations to maximize overall economic efficiency in water use both alternative designs for the water bank are explained below in more depth indicating how to assess the improvement in economic efficiency that each alternative entails compared with the baseline scenario no trade 2 2 competitive water bank under this institutional arrangement the water agency managing the bank aims to maximize economic efficiency during drought or cyclical scarcity events in a similar way to a competitive spot market to this end the agency first makes a public offer to purchase water allocations at a fixed price p p buying an amount of water q p as shown in fig 1 next the agency makes a public offer to sell those purchased water allocations treating both demands those from productive users and those from society environmental water equally this means that any demand for environmental water must be supported through public funding with society paying the bank the same price for every unit of water recovered for the environment that productive users pay for the water they bought this means that the social value of environmental water is equal to the price paid by productive users i e v e p s it also implies that the social demand and the aggregate total demand for water became functions of the sale price fixed by the agency q e p s and q t p s respectively therefore under this bank design at the price fixed by the agency for the sale offers p s productive users demand an amount of water q s for their private use and society demands q e units of water for environmental purposes with the total water demand being q t q s q e according to economic theory 25 this water bank reaches maximum economic efficiency operating at the point where the supply q p p p and total demand q t p s curves intersect 1 1 this is the optimum solution in the case of zero transaction costs we have applied this assumption for the sake of simplicity as occurs at point a in fig 1 this efficient solution can be achieved if purchase and sale prices are equal p p p s also allowing the quantities purchased and sold to become equal i e when the water balance is verified q p q s q e operating at point a also allows the water agency to balance the bank s cash flows since expenditure on purchases p p q p represented by the area p p a q p o equals the sum of revenues obtained through sales to productive users p s q s represented by the area p s b q s o and to society for environmental purposes p s q e represented by the area p s c q e o the latter revenue is provided by the public sector through the budget assigned to the water agency b u d g e t p s q e intersection point a reproduces the equilibrium reached in a competitive market providing the optimum solution by properly reallocating water resources between productive users and the environment at this point economic efficiency is maximized since the sum of the efficiency gains generated by purchases and sales is also maximized in this regard the efficiency generated by the public purchase offer can be calculated through the producer surplus e p measuring the profit obtained by water users when they sell their water allocations to the bank the difference between the sales revenue and the income foregone due to lower water input if the purchase price is fixed at p p as shown in fig 1 then e p p p a p p 0 area the efficiency generated by the bank sales to productive users is calculated through the consumer surplus e s accounting for the profit that productive users gain when they purchase water from the bank the difference between the additional income due to higher production and the purchase cost if the sale price is fixed at p s then e s p s 0 b p s area water recovery for environmental purposes also generates efficiency gains which can be accounted for using the consumer surplus concept as in the case of productive users in this case the environmental surplus e e measures the benefit that society gains from the water recovered for the environment as the difference between the additional economic efficiency due to higher instream flows and the budget needed to recover that water if the sale price is fixed at p s then e e v e 0 c p s area however it must be noted that the budgetary resources needed to implement any public spending policy such as environmental water recovery through a water bank must first be collected through the tax system and this inevitably causes distortions that reduce economic efficiency 26 surprisingly this fact has been largely ignored in the literature assessing the economic impact of policy instruments used to implement the public purchase or lease of water rights to reallocate water resources to environmental uses 2 2 within the water policy literature efficiency losses due to distortive tax systems have been considered in only a few papers in this regard the only studies worth mentioning are those by garcia and reynaud 27 and van heerden et al 28 which both focus on water pricing for this reason as far as we are aware all related empirical works to date have overestimated the efficiency gains generated this paper thus contributes to the existing literature by carrying out an efficiency analysis that accounts for the efficiency losses introduced by the tax system these losses can be quantified through the marginal cost of public funds m c f a parameter reflecting the shadow price that society pays for each monetary unit invested in public spending policies 29 thus environmental surplus e e can be more accurately measured as the difference between the efficiency generated by the amount of water diverted for environmental purposes area below society s demand curve for environmental water v e 0 c q e o and the social cost of this water in budgetary terms b u d g e t m c f 2 e e p s v e 0 q e p s d p s p s q e b u d g e t m c f in sum the water agency operates this water bank in a similar way to a competitive market achieving an optimum solution when the sum e p e s e e is maximized finally it is worth pointing out that under this theoretical framework the efficiency assessment for the baseline scenario no trade is null since q p q s q e 0 and then e p e s e e 0 as this scenario is taken as a benchmark it should be noted that the efficiency assessments for the two alternative designs proposed for the water bank should be considered as improvements over this baseline scenario 2 3 monopsony monopoly water bank similar to the previous bank design during a hydrological drought the public water agency can mitigate any deficit in instream flows by recovering water allocations granted to productive users and reallocating them to the environment however the key feature of this innovative water bank arrangement is that the public agency operates in a monopsony monopoly setting no other water markets are allowed in this setting the agency should first act as the sole buyer monopsony market of water allocations by organizing public purchase offers of temporary water rights subsequently this agency also acts as the sole seller monopoly market of those purchased allocations by organizing a public sale offer operating in this way the agency managing the bank can use its market power to create a gap between the purchase price p p and the sale price to productive users p s moreover this market power allows the agency to distinguish between water uses productive and environmental ones enabling the marginal value of the water sold to productive users p s to diverge from the marginal value of the water devoted to environmental uses v e as a non profit public institution the water agency is assumed to use this monopsony monopoly power to maximize economic efficiency covering any deficit in the bank s cash flow revenue obtained through public sale offers less expenditure on public purchase offers with public funds fig 2 shows how this design of the water bank should work the water agency first makes a public purchase offer fixing the purchase price p p and buying a quantity of water q p see point a as determined by the supply curve of water q p p p second the agency implements a public sale offer fixing a sale price p s higher than p p and selling a smaller amount of water q s see point b as determined by the demand curve of water for productive users q s p s the difference between the amount of water purchased and subsequently sold is allocated to the environment q e q p q s operating in this way the deficit in the bank s cash flow equals the difference between the revenue obtained through sales p s q s represented by the area p s b q s o and the expenditure on purchases p p q p represented by the area p p a q p o this deficit is compensated for with public funds through the budget assigned to the water agency b u d g e t p p q p p s q s among the infinite number of alternative operational strategies that fulfill the abovementioned water and financial balance constraints the public water agency aims to maximize total economic efficiency thus the single optimum solution to be achieved is the one that maximizes the sum of the efficiencies related to the water bank s purchases producer surplus e p equivalent to the area p p a p p 0 in fig 2 the efficiency linked to the water bank s sales to productive users consumer surplus e s measured by the p s 0 b p s area and the efficiency derived from the amount of water the bank recovers for the environment environmental surplus e e the latter efficiency is also calculated considering the efficiency losses introduced by the tax system as in the previous bank setting thus it is measured as the difference between the economic efficiency generated by the amount of water diverted for environmental purposes area v e 0 c q e o and the social cost of the budget needed to recover this water 3 e e v e v e 0 q e v e d v e v e q e b u d g e t m c f unlike with the competitive water bank it can be easily seen that by lowering the purchase price and increasing the sale price in relation to the competitive equilibrium both producer and consumer surpluses are reduced under this institutional arrangement however the environmental surplus increases when this monopsony monopoly water bank is implemented since the social cost of environmental water recovery becomes smaller in this sense the main purpose of this paper is to empirically confirm that the overall variation of the three surpluses considered for this bank setting e p e s e e outperforms the total economic efficiency gains generated by the competitive water bank and to quantitatively assess the improvement in economic efficiency that this novel water bank design could provide 3 modeling the performance of the two alternative water banks 3 1 competitive water bank in order to simulate the potential performance of the first institutional arrangement proposed for the water bank a mathematical programming model has been built considering that the competitive market s equilibrium is reached when the sum of the efficiencies derived from purchases sales to productive users and the recovery of water for environmental purposes is maximized the objective function of this model is the maximization of the total economic efficiency e c o m p e t i t i v e this efficiency can be operatively measured as the sum of the producer consumer and environmental surpluses e p e s and e e respectively as shown in eq 4 1 moreover based on the explanations provided in section 2 2 the constraints needed for simulating the performance of this water bank design are as follows 4 1 max e c o m p e t i t i v e e p e s e e subject to 4 2 e p p p 0 p p q p p p d p p 4 3 e s p s p s 0 q s p s d p s 4 4 e e p s v e 0 q e p s d p s p s q e b u d g e t m c f 4 5 q p q p p p 4 6 q s q s p s 4 7 q e q e m a x 1 p s v e 0 4 8 q p q s q e 4 9 b u d g e t p s q e 4 10 p p p s equations 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 account for the producer consumer and environmental surpluses respectively that is they represent the efficiency gains from water bank purchases e p from water bank sales to the agricultural sector e s and from water recovery with environmental purposes the first two are measured as the area under the q p p p and q s p s curves on the ordinate axis while the third is computed as explained in eq 2 equations 4 5 and 4 6 represent the volumes traded on both the supply and the demand sides the first represents the amount of water purchased by the bank from irrigators which in turn is the aggregate supply curve q p p p while the second represents the amount of water sold to farmers corresponding to the aggregate irrigators demand curve q s p s equation 4 7 denotes the social demand for environmental water as expressed in eq 1 but considering that v e p s making this demand a function of the sale price fixed by the agency q e p s equations 4 8 and 4 9 ensure that the water and financial funding needed balances are verified finally eq 4 10 ensures that purchase and sale prices are equal 3 2 monopsony monopoly water bank under the monopsony monopoly institutional arrangement for the water bank see explanations provided in section 2 3 the public water agency aims to maximize total economic efficiency e m o n o p o l y thus this agency manages the bank s operations in such a way as to maximize the sum of the surpluses generated in purchases e p sales to productive users e s and the recovery of water for environmental purposes e e as shown in the objective function eq 5 1 of the mathematical programming model built to simulate the performance of this water bank design 5 1 max e m o n o p o l y e p e s e e subject to 5 2 e p p p 0 p p q p p p d p p 5 3 e s p s p s 0 q s p s d p s 5 4 e e v e v e 0 q e v e d v e v e q e b u d g e t m c f 5 5 q p q p p p 5 6 q s q s p s 5 7 q e q e m a x 1 v e v e 0 5 8 q p q s q e 5 9 b u d g e t p p q p p s q s in this case the efficiency improvements generated by the public purchase offers e p in eq 5 2 and by public sale offers to the agricultural sector e s in eq 5 3 are calculated as in the previous institutional arrangement for the water bank similarly the equations regarding the aggregate supply q p p p in eq 5 5 the aggregate agricultural demand q s p s in eq 5 6 and market balance for water quantities eq 5 8 remain the same as in the previous model the model simulating the monopsony monopoly water bank diverges from the model 4 x in three equations first since this bank setting allows the agency to distinguish between water uses the marginal value of the water sold to productive users p s can diverge from the marginal value of the water devoted to environmental uses v e thus the efficiency derived from environmental water recovery e e in eq 5 4 and the social demand for environmental water q e in eq 5 7 are calculated as functions of v e as shown in eqs 1 and 2 second in this case the public funding needed for the water bank operations constraint 5 9 regarding the financial balance is calculated as the amount of money required to cover the deficit in cash flow considering the revenue obtained in sales p s q s and the expenditure on purchases p p q p finally it is worth mentioning that under this monopsony monopoly setting the water agency managing the bank can create a gap between purchase prices p p and sale prices to productive users p s thus the strategy implemented by this agency optimal solution is not constrained by eq 4 10 included in the previous model p p p s 3 3 comparing the performance of the two water banks proposed once the theoretical models for the two water banks have been established we can compare their potential performance in terms of total economic efficiency to that end we can change eq 4 10 to p p p s v e since in the optimum solutions of the competitive water bank the marginal values of the water devoted to environmental uses v e are the same as the equilibrium market price p p p s whenever v e 0 is higher than the clearing price 3 3 for values of v e 0 lower than the clearing price the two models perform identically as no water is recovered for the environment and only agricultural water is traded replacing p s by v e in eqs 4 4 and 4 7 these constraints became identical to eqs 5 4 and 5 7 moreover it can be proved that eqs 4 9 and 5 9 are also equivalent 4 4 as explained before q e q p q s thus eq 4 9 can be written as b u d g e t p s q p q s p s q p p s q s furthermore as in the case of the competitive water bank p p p s we can write this equation as eq 5 9 b u d g e t p p q p p s q s thus it can be checked that the feasible region of the model 5 x given by eqs 5 2 5 9 is bigger than that of model 4 x given by eqs 4 2 4 9 equivalent to 5 2 5 9 plus eq 4 10 since the latter model has one additional constraint eq 4 10 that needs to be met this means that the maximum values of the common objective function total economic efficiency e reached in model 5 x are always equal to or higher than those obtained in model 4 x in other words the monopsony monopoly design proposed for the water bank is able to reach higher levels of total economic efficiency than the competitive design furthermore it is worth comparing the objective function in the two designs of the water market e e p e s e e considering the explanations provided above the only difference regarding this mathematical expression in the two models is the inefficiency generated by the public budget used for water recovery term b u d g e t m c f in eqs 4 3 and 5 3 to draw conclusions about the efficiency performance of these alternative designs the inefficiency in the monopsony monopoly setting is subtracted from the inefficiency in the competitive setting as follows 6 b u d g e t m c f c o m p e t i t i v e b u d g e t m c f m o n o p o l y p s q e m c f p p q p p s q s m c f p s q e p p q p p s q s m c f p s q e q s p p q p m c f p s q p p p q p m c f q p p s p p m c f this proves that as long as the water agency can create a gap between purchase prices and sale prices to productive users as proposed for the monopsony monopoly setting i e p s p p the inefficiency generated by the use of public funds in the competitive setting is higher i e positive difference in eq 6 and this difference increases with m c f it also confirms that the total economic efficiency reached with the monopsony monopoly design model 5 x is always equal to or higher than the one obtained in the competitive design model 4 x the two proofs detailed above regarding the size of the solution space and the inefficiency in the use of public funds provide theoretical evidence of the superiority of the monopsony monopoly setting in terms of total economic efficiency the next sections of the paper seek to confirm this conclusion through an empirical application in a real world setting 4 case study 4 1 the guadalquivir river basin the guadalquivir river basin grb in southern spain covers an area of 58 000 km2 and is home to a population of 4 1 million the competitive advantage enjoyed by irrigated agriculture vegetables olive cotton citrus and other fruits in this territory has generated a steady increase in the demand for agricultural water in recent decades eventually leading to the closure of the basin 30 nowadays the average water use in the grb is 3815 mm3 year the agricultural sector being the primary water user consuming 88 of the available water while only 10 is used by households and other urban demands 31 structural water scarcity in this closed basin is cyclically aggravated by drought episodes recurrent in mediterranean climate regions climate change predictions for the grb suggest that drought events are expected to become more frequent and intense 32 the basin is closed to new users because any further increase in the water supply is impossible thus several demand side policy instruments have been implemented to facilitate a more efficient reallocation of the scant water resources in this sense the 1999 reform of the spanish water act allowed the implementation of water trading instruments both spot water markets between productive users and the temporary establishment of public water banks termed water exchange centers for environmental purposes in the event of exceptional situations of water scarcity i e severe droughts the water rights priority system established by law in spain guarantees that urban uses are served first in case of water scarcity this means that only farmers are willing to participate in water trading as a drought management instrument since of all the users they are the most negatively affected by shortages in the water supply during this cyclical scarcity only irrigators with valuable productions are willing to buy additional allocations while only the farmers with low marginal value of water are willing to lease their own water rights however market activity has been limited to date because of the high transaction costs 12 moreover even in the most severe drought episodes e g 2007 2008 public water banks have not been implemented in the grb due to the lack of political will i e public budget to implement them 33 the grb management plan grbmp chg 34 establishes a minimal ecological flow of 305 mm3 year to guarantee the resilience of environmental services however during drought periods when instream flows are just above this minimum level water related ecosystems are negatively impacted and society would be willing to recover water from agriculture to minimize environmental damages 35 all the reasons provided above the structural and cyclical water scarcity the legal framework for water trading instruments the heterogeneity in the marginal value of water between irrigators and the social demand for the recovery of environmental water justify the use of the grb as case study to assess the potential performance of the two water bank arrangements proposed as demand side instruments aimed at improving drought management 4 2 feeding the models simulating the performance of the water banks in the grb the empirical analysis performed relies on the aggregate supply curves of water from agricultural users q p p p and the aggregate demand curves of water for irrigation q s p s in the grb estimated by gutiérrez martín et al 17 these authors based their estimations on the results of mathematical programming models built by montilla lópez et al 33 to simulate irrigators heterogenous trading behavior within a water bank framework decisions regarding the sale and purchase of water allocations in this basin gutiérrez martín et al 17 estimated aggregate supply and demand curves for three different scenarios of water availability intensity of droughts a moderate drought where water allocations to irrigators are only 75 of those granted in an average hydrological year b severe drought where only 50 of the water granted in an average hydrological year is allocated to irrigators and c extreme drought where allocations to irrigators are only 25 of those granted in an average hydrological year these scenarios are labeled as s75 s50 and s25 respectively the polynomial functions expressing the aggregate supply and the aggregate demand in each scenario are shown in table 1 these functions are the ones used for simulating the purchase and sale offers implemented by the public water agency within the two alternative institutional arrangements proposed for the water bank another common setting for both institutional arrangements is related to the social demand for environmental water q e v e unfortunately there is no previous estimate of this demand in the gbr that can be used for the empirical analysis proposed this justifies the use of the simplified linear demand defined in eq 1 the parameter q e m a x has been estimated considering that the average instream flow the flow registered in an average hydrological year in the grb is 7092 mm3 year while the minimum ecological flow established in the grbmp is 305 mm3 year thus it is reasonable to assume that the maximum quantity of water that society would demand for environmental purposes with a non zero willingness to pay q e m a x is the difference between average flow and minimum ecological flow 6787 mm3 year however there is no robust empirical estimate available for the maximum value that society would be willing to pay for environmental water v e 0 given this lack of information the potential performance of both water bank designs is simulated parameterizing this value from 0 to 1 euro per cubic meter this range of hypothetical values for v e 0 is considered wide enough to comprise all the unit costs for water supply estimated for spain 36 and all water prices paid in the existing spot water markets 12 furthermore the parameter m c f used for modeling both water bank designs is taken as equal to 1 2 this means that every 100 monetary units collected by the public sector through taxes involves efficiency losses of 20 monetary units due to the distortion of the whole economic system caused by taxation this reference value for this parameter is based on more recent estimates for spain 37 which are in line with the values estimated for most oecd countries 38 5 results 5 1 competitive water bank fig 3 shows the results obtained for the competitive water bank for the three water scarcity scenarios proposed s75 s50 and s25 in terms of volumes traded clearing prices public funding required and efficiency improvements relative to the baseline scenario no trading achieved for every maximum marginal value of environmental water v e 0 ranging from 0 to 0 8 m3 the three scenarios considered reveal net efficiency gains compared to the baseline scenario although with some differences the parametrization of v e 0 shows three defined stages or phases in all the scenarios considered the main features of every phase are summarized in table 2 the first phase is found for the lowest values of v e 0 with this phase characterized by the fact that no water is recovered for the environment see fig 3a c as the marginal value of environmental water is below the market equilibrium price p p p s see fig 3d f thus the water bank buys water allocations from farmers who are willing to sell and subsequently sells them all to other farmers who are willing to buy q p q s since expenditure on purchases equals revenue obtained in sales i e the bank is self financed no public funding is needed for water bank operations see fig 3g i this first phase covers the values of v e 0 ranging from 0 to the hypothetical clearing prices of a competitive market in each drought scenario since this hypothetical clearing price for each scenario is higher when the water shortage is more acute ranging from 0 15 m3 for scenario s75 to 0 40 m3 for scenario s25 see fig 3d f the more severe the drought the longer the first phase comparing the volume of water traded see fig 3a c it can be observed that the largest transfers measured in absolute terms mm3 are found in the scenario s50 however it is worth pointing out that the quantity of water traded measured in relative terms water trade over total water availability rises from 16 0 in scenario s75 to 27 0 in s50 and to 38 6 in scenario s25 relative to the no trade baseline scenario it is shown that this water bank design involves an improvement in economic efficiency for the three water availability scenarios amounting to around 50 million euros see fig 3j l during this first phase this efficiency enhancement is due only to the surpluses generated in purchases e p and sales e s since no water is recovered for the environment e e 0 after the maximum environmental water value v e 0 reaches the corresponding clearing prices the simulation results of the competitive water bank enter a second phase where a share of the water allocations bought from farmers is recovered for the environment reallocating the rest among other farmers q p q s q e and q e 0 the higher the maximum environmental water value the larger the quantities purchased and recovered for the environment and the lesser the quantity reallocated among farmers see fig 3a c this second phase ends when v e 0 becomes so high that no water is reallocated for productive uses and all purchased allocations are recovered for the environment during this second phase the water agency managing the bank needs public funding to support the purchases of environmental water see fig 3g i the amount of public funding needed increases as v e 0 and the amount of water bought q p rise regarding the efficiency assessment see fig 3j l it is worth noting that over this second phase the surplus generated in sales e s decreases as the water reallocated for irrigation declines while the surplus generated in agricultural purchases e p increases as the water bought from irrigators rises moreover environmental water purchases also generate a surplus e e although this environmental surplus takes negatives values this negative sign for environmental efficiency can be explained by the fact that this spending policy involves an efficiency loss derived from the economic distortions caused by the tax system when raising the public funds needed that is the efficiency gains stemming from the improvement in instream flows measured as p s v e 0 q e p s d p s p s q e in eq 4 4 do not offset the loss of economic efficiency caused by raising public funds through taxes measured as the marginal cost of public funds b u d g e t m c f in the same eq 4 4 this negative environmental efficiency means that total economic efficiency e p e s e e at the beginning of the second phase is slightly lower than in the first phase since the increases in the producer surplus are outweighed by the sum of the decreases in consumer and environmental surpluses however once the minimum total efficiency has been reached for 0 20 0 33 and 0 50 m3 for the scenarios s75 s50 and s25 respectively this measure of economic efficiency increases in all scenarios indeed by the end of the second phase these values are higher than in the first phase the third phase begins when the maximum environmental water value is high enough that all water purchases are allocated to the environment q p q e and consequently no water is sold for productive uses q s 0 this is when v e 0 is higher than 0 30 0 45 and 0 63 m3 for the scenarios s75 s50 and s25 respectively in every scenario total economic efficiency continues to follow the rising trends observed at the end of the second phase since when values of v e 0 are high enough the increases in the producer surplus outweigh the sum of the decreases in consumer and environmental surpluses the higher the value of v e 0 the higher the economic efficiency in all cases the total efficiency improvements are greater than those obtained in the first phase 5 2 monopsony monopoly water bank in the case of the monopsony monopoly water bank the parametrization of v e 0 shows four phases instead of three as can be seen in fig 4 the main features of these phases are summarized in table 3 the first phase is identical to that of the previous model where v e 0 is below the market equilibrium price p p p s thus no water is recovered for the environment q p q s q e 0 and the water bank is self financed a second phase can be observed for the following ranges of v e 0 0 16 0 20 m3 0 26 0 32 m3 and 0 41 0 49 m3 for s75 s50 and s25 respectively over this relatively short phase the water bank reduces its purchases of water allocations from farmers a decreasing share of these purchases is reallocated to other farmers while an increasing portion is recovered for the environment q p q s q e see fig 4a c unlike with the competitive bank it is worth pointing out that during this phase the agency managing the monopsony monopoly water bank exerts its market power to create a gap between the purchase and the sale prices p p p s as shown in fig 4d f allowing the bank to be self financed since no public funding is needed for the acquisition of environmental water see fig 4g i moreover the water agency maximizes total efficiency for these ranges of v e 0 by discriminating between the marginal value of environmental water v e and the sale price p s v e as shown in fig 4d f discriminating between these two water values leads to improvements positive values in environmental efficiency in this case the efficiency gains resulting from the improvement in instream flows measured as v e v e 0 q e v e d v e v e q e in eq 5 4 outweigh the loss of economic efficiency caused by raising public funds through taxes quantified through the marginal cost of public funds b u d g e t m c f in the same eq 5 4 there is therefore a continuous increase in total economic efficiency e p e s e e as shown in fig 4j l consequently the level of economic efficiency linked to water use at basin level from this phase onwards is higher than in the competitive water bank the third phase begins when values of v e 0 become high enough that the water bank has to spend public funds to further increase economic efficiency by recovering more water for the environment see fig 4a c that is over this third phase the monopsony monopoly power that allows the public agency to self finance its acquisition of more environmental water is not enough to further increase economic efficiency and an increasing amount of public funding is needed to purchase more water allocations for environmental purposes see fig 4g i nevertheless unlike with the competitive water bank it is worth pointing out that discriminating between water values p p p s v e allows the water agency to maintain positive values improvements for environmental efficiency e e even at increasing positive marginal values the higher the value of v e 0 the higher the slope of e e the gradual substitution of q s by q e ends at a point of v e 0 where the agricultural sector cannot afford to compete for the purchase of water allocations with the social demand for environmental water q s 0 this point defines the beginning of the fourth phase for values of v e 0 above 0 35 m3 0 53 m3and 0 75 m3 in the case of s75 s50 and s25 respectively see fig 4a c over this phase all the water allocations bought from farmers are devoted to the environment q p q e supported by an increasing amount of public funding see fig 4g i however the monopsony monopoly power of the water agency allows it to keep purchase prices below the marginal environmental value of water p p v e as shown in fig 4d f thus we observe an increasing trend in total efficiency improvement see fig 4j l 6 discussion the results have shown that both water bank settings can generate an increase in economic efficiency compared to the no trade baseline scenario however the most relevant hypothesis to be tested is whether the monopsony monopoly water bank improves drought management from a social point of view compared to current policy competitive water bank in order to do so the results obtained for the competitive and the monopsony monopoly water banks are compared using differential values of performance variables volumes traded prices cash flows and efficiency improvements in this regard figs 5 and 7 show the differences calculated by subtracting the values of the variable obtained in the simulations of the competitive water bank from the results found for the monopsony monopoly water bank for instance a negative value for the volume of water recovered for the environment q e as shown in fig 5a c indicates that the monopsony monopoly bank secures less water for the environment than the competitive bank for the value of v e 0 and drought scenario considered the differential values observed in fig 5 show that the competitive water bank recovers more water for the environment although more public funding is needed compared to the monopsony monopoly water bank the case of v e 0 0 60 for scenario s50 can be taken as an example in both water bank arrangements this maximum value of environmental water means that no water allocations are sold to farmers point located in the last phase at this point the competitive water bank recovers 240 mm3 more water for the environment than the monopsony monopoly bank see fig 5b however at this point the competitive water bank needs 205 million euros more public funds to implement these environmental purchases see fig 5e in order to provide a broader view of environmental purchases of water allocations it is worth estimating the unit costs of environmental water recovered in terms of the public funding required i e the ratio between the funds needed and the volume recovered expressed in euros per cubic meter fig 6 shows the differences between the two banks proposed in terms of the unit costs borne by the public agency managing the banks for any quantity of water recovered for the environment in each scarcity scenario the lower costs for almost every quantity and drought scenario provide evidence of the advantage offered by the monopsony monopoly water bank in terms of the public budget assigned less public funding is needed per unit of water recovered for environmental purposes especially in the phase where the monopsony monopoly water bank is self financed it can be seen than the lower the quantity of water to recover the greater the gap in the cost per cubic meter between the two bank designs on the contrary for large quantities of water to recover the advantage of the monopsony monopoly bank is diminished indeed for v e values greater than the maximum p s the agricultural sector does not participate in the market meaning that the cost of environmental water is the same for both water bank designs as can be seen in fig 6 for the scenario s25 when the volumes of water recovered are higher than 400 mm3 fig 7 shows the differences between the two water bank settings considered regarding economic efficiency improvements the most relevant outcome to highlight is the higher levels of total economic efficiency e achieved with the monopsony monopoly water bank compared to the competitive one for every drought scenario when the values of v e 0 exceed the competitive equilibrium prices this confirms the potential benefits of the bank proposed here as an economic instrument to improve drought management finally the role of the parameter measuring the marginal cost of public funds m c f in the empirical analyses also merits further analysis as stated above one of the contributions of this paper is that it accounts for this additional cost of using public funds thus providing a more accurate estimation of efficiency improvements when implementing a water bank with environmental purposes in this regard it should be pointed out that the value for the m c f taken for the analysis performed m c f 1 2 is a reasonable assumption considering a proportional tax rate increase an equal marginal tax rate increase in all tax brackets 38 however the estimates of this parameter vary significantly depending on the assumptions regarding how additional public funds are collected i e taxation instruments implemented in fact more recent estimates for spain 37 report values of m c f ranging from 0 82 to 1 88 in this sense it is worth noting that this parameter has a marked effect on simulation results since any change in the value considered would involve relatively large changes in the performance simulated for both water bank designs generally speaking it can be stated that the higher the value of m c f the more attractive the monopsony monopoly water bank becomes since differences in efficiency improvement between the two alternative banks grow higher values of m c f lead to higher inefficiencies in the competitive water bank from phase 2 onwards as an illustrative example consider v e 0 0 60 for the scenario s50 if m c f increases from 1 2 to 1 4 the difference in the total economic efficiency improvement achieved between the monopsony monopoly and the competitive water banks increases from 23 4 million euros to 74 9 million euros further underlining the attractiveness of the monopsony monopoly water bank proposed it is also worth pointing out that for medium to high social values of environmental water the economic efficiency achieved with the monopsony monopoly water bank design proposed in this paper far exceeds the level generated by the self financed monopsony monopoly water bank proposed by gutiérrez martín et al 17 despite the appealing prospect of recovering water for the environment without any public expenditure the amount of water that can be recovered for the environment by the latter is markedly lower than that achieved by the former which is ultimately reflected in lower levels of economic efficiency indeed the monopsony monopoly water bank suggested in this paper shares some characteristics with the design proposed by gutiérrez martín et al 17 in that the two water banks operate identically until the start of phase 3 at which point the former makes use of public funds to purchase additional environmental water thereby achieving higher levels of economic efficiency 7 conclusions the public monopsony monopoly water bank proposed is an interesting drought management policy option to recover water for the environment during scarcity events this study demonstrates its potential to outperform the alternative design currently implemented public purchases within an existing competitive spot water market in terms of economic efficiency the success of this water bank arrangement is based on its ability to partially self finance public purchases of environmental water with the public agency managing the bank using its market power to create a gap between the purchase and the sale prices and also to set different prices at which the water bank can reallocate the water among end users differentiating between prices to farmers willing to buy p s and prices to society for environmental water v e a key innovation of this study is that it accounts for the inefficiencies inherent in the use of public expenditure measured through the marginal cost of public funds m c f when making public purchases of water allocations or rights it has been demonstrated that the net economic efficiency variations when purchasing water for the environment in an existing competitive water market are not always positive in fact for a range of environmental water values this policy option leads to a decrease in total economic efficiency since the losses caused by the distortion effects of raising public funds on the whole economy are not fully offset by the efficiency increases achieved through market operations moreover this finding suggests that previous assessments of public water recovery for the environment through market instruments could have overestimated efficiency gains because they ignored inefficiencies relating to public expenditure it is suggested that going forward any policy assessment involving the public purchase of water allocations or rights should account for these inefficiencies through the marginal cost of public funds even accounting for the inefficiencies regarding the use of public funds it has been shown that the monopsony monopoly water bank proposed can increase total economic efficiency for every value of environmental water in all cases yielding equal or higher economic efficiency estimates than the competitive market option although it would not change the conclusions presented above it is worth commenting that the simulation results reported could be improved with more accurate estimates of some of the parameters considered in the models specifically society s demand for environmental water and the m c f parameter given the lack of accurate information about public willingness to pay for environmental water we assumed linear demand and chose to parametrize the maximum value that society would be willing to pay for public water purchases v e 0 in order to better estimate society s demand for environmental water there is a need for future research to quantify the impact of a change in instream flows on ecological condition its effects on environmental service provision and the value of the change in environmental service provision to society in this sense it is worth remarking that these demand curves are needed to enable policy makers to look for optimum social water allocation arrangements regarding the m c f parameter it should be noted that the estimate used in the model m c f 1 2 is based on estimates for other developed countries for a proportional increase in all taxes collected at national level however the actual value for this parameter should also be more accurately estimated for the case study analyzed considering the inefficiencies caused by the spanish tax system the proposed bank would be financed by the spanish national budget and how the tax increase would be implemented from a practical point of view it is obvious that accurate estimates of both society s demand and m c f are a prerequisite for the proper implementation of the proposed economic instrument in a real world setting finally it is also worth pointing out that for the sake of simplicity the assessment performed has been carried out assuming zero transaction costs in this sense it would be interesting for further research to estimate both institutional and operational transaction costs 39

8681,benefit transfer bt is often applied when a primary valuation study is considered too costly or time consuming to conduct it is commonly assumed that bt performance improves with increasing similarity between study and policy sites however no common criteria for defining similarity exist making it difficult to operationalise the concept of similarity in a practical bt context we propose a structured framework for distinguishing between different degrees of similarity in particular we differentiate between three dimensions physical population and attribute similarity while the first two are often used in the literature attribute similarity is not to investigate the impact attribute descriptions have on bt we define it as whether or not the same ecosystem service categories are emphasised in the valuation studies using value estimates for water quality improvements obtained from 17 choice experiments conducted in europe we empirically test unit value transfer performance along a similarity gradient the results confirm that increasing physical similarities across commodities and sites generally lead to lower transfer errors however when using income adjusted value transfer we surprisingly find the opposite finally we demonstrate that increasing attribute similarity may offset dissimilarities in terms of the site characteristics keywords benefit transfer similarity dissimilarity transfer error water quality choice experiment water framework directive 1 introduction in the wake of the increasing use of cost benefit analysis cba in european policy and decision making there is a growing demand for value estimates of public goods 1 2 for instance the eu water framework directive wfd states that lower environmental objectives may be aimed for if achieving the intended water quality level good ecological status would be disproportionately costly 3 applying cba i e assessing if the benefits of achieving good ecological status are outweighed by the associated costs is one way to determine whether or not costs can be considered disproportionate 4 7 the wfd thereby considers several dimensions to determine the ecological status but while they are important to understand the ecology of the water and inform the design of valuation scenarios their direct adoption may not always be useful for valuation studies as many of these dimensions result in intermediary ecosystem services cf 8 9 which might result in double counting when valuing them explicitly 10 moreover cba requires the benefits of water quality improvements to be assessed in monetary terms yet primary valuation studies are often not available for certain geographical contexts as time and money are often limiting factors when it comes to conducting valuation surveys this demand is more often than not met by relying on value transfer methods also referred to as benefit transfer bt in its simplest form bt refers to obtaining value estimates for goods at a specific site or context called the policy site by using value estimates that have been previously obtained through primary valuation at another site and context called the study site in other words the value estimates are transferred from the study site to the policy site there are two main sources of error that may render the use of value estimates obtained from bt questionable 11 12 first of all transferred values are only as good as the primary valuation survey conducted at the study site this means that any measurement errors that may cause the study site value estimates to deviate from the underlying true value of a good will be transferred to the policy site 11 13 secondly the transfer of value estimates may in itself introduce an error reflecting dissimilarity between study and policy sites which are not accounted for in the value transfer process this is referred to as the transfer error te in concept both sources of error will be present in any bt but as the measurement error is generally unknown focus is typically on the te since this can be minimized by using more or less sophisticated adjustments to transferred values in the value transfer process in most applied bts there is no way to assess the presence and magnitude of te since this requires policy site values to be known and such knowledge would defeat the purpose of conducting bt in the first place consequently the expected performance of bt in practice is generally based on accumulated experience from more systematic investigations of te in the scientific literature with some exemptions suggesting that bt performance is determined by the similarity of willingness to pay wtp distributions rather than by the similarity of the commodities or populations e g 14 16 it is generally agreed that tes are smaller the more similar the study and policy sites and goods are e g 13 17 21 it is thus largely seen as a prerequisite for valid bt in general research suggests that wtp estimates can be transferred directly called simple value transfer only if study and policy sites are relatively similar 17 22 whereas predicting policy site values by use of a value function estimated at the study site called function transfer may perform better when study and policy sites are relatively dissimilar 17 23 however function transfers do not consistently outperform value transfers 24 moreover as there are no common criteria defining similarity 25 and there is no clear guidance in the literature on how relative similarity should be interpreted in a practical bt context insights on the impact of similarity on bt performance are often conflicting 2 11 13 26 29 for instance 30 finds that similarity in terms of environmental characteristics and land use attributes between study and policy sites improves bt performance for some transferred attributes whereas merely assuring geographical proximity does not in contrast 31 discover that tes increase with distance between study and policy sites whereas 22 find both increasing and decreasing tes with increasing distance most studies distinguish between site and commodity similarity but differences in their interpretations remain typically sites are described by characteristics such as the affected population the availability of substitutes and complements to the good or geographical proximity 30 whereas a commodity is determined by its physical and welfare dimensions cf 28 however despite similarity generally being seen as a prerequisite for valid bt there is little consistency in the literature concerning which dimensions of similarity to consider in bt for instance the good and the affected population may or may not be included when referring to site similarity 13 30 whether sites can be considered similar is further determined by spatial patterns and temporal trends 2 13 spatial patterns entail that bt applications must consider the extent of the population and thus the affected market and whether there are spatial differerences e g in relation to distance decay temporal trends refer to changes in price levels and society s preferences across time 13 while the spatial and temporal components of tes have been widely investigated in the literature an often overlooked source of te originates from dissimilarities in the quantity and quality of the goods 28 ultimately reflected by the survey description in the applied valuation methods as such this is a measurement error referring to the performance of the original study but it may be confounded with a transfer error if the same design characteristics do not apply for the study and policy sites choice experiments ce is a valuation method which is often argued to be useful for bt 2 18 27 30 32 because it values individual components characteristics or levels of one or more goods each of them can then be transferred to other situations and differences between policy and study site may to some extent be captured by the attributes however two implications for the performance of bt based on ce estimates emerge when the design of the ce surveys differ first the way in which goods and attributes are defined and described in economic valuation studies influence wtp estimates 28 differently specified attributes and whether some aspects are added as separate attributes may influence the value estimate of the attribute to be transferred second attribute levels are often described qualitatively e g as poor medium good relative to the current situation due to difficulties in estimating specific and comparable outcome benefits this may cause the use of bt to be restricted 32 or at least transfer similarity to be more challenging as it has to refer to both attribute levels and the qualitative description behind in this paper we investigate the impact of similarity on bt performance with regard to 1 the physical characteristics 2 the affected populations and 3 the survey description of both the attribute of interest and the additional attributes the first dimension refers to the biophysical improvements of the commodity water quality and the geophysical site characteristics of the associated water body the second dimension accounts for differences in incomes between the study and policy sites populations the third dimension investigates the impact of the survey design and thereby addresses further commodity components which are in addition to the geophysical site characteristics also referred to by 28 as aspects of the welfare dimension of commodities namely the welfare influencing quantities or qualities of goods p 38 we restrict our analysis to considering ce surveys and categorise attribute similarity according to the ecosystem service framework by aiming to make bt more operational in practice we split commodity and site similarity as well as the welfare dimension into different sub components and thus do not directly follow the typical approach in the literature disentangling the components of similarity serves the purpose of providing detailed insights on the impacts they have on bt but does not preclude overlaps between the dimensions in particular between the first and third dimensions for example the geophysical aspects of the first dimension also represent welfare influencing aspects for reasons of clarity the narrative and discussions in this paper focus on the key aspects of the differently defined dimension whereas the overall results consider the adjustments of all dimensions both separately and together while the third dimension concerning the impact of survey design may be considered primarily of interest for testing bt we here focus on the impact of attribute descriptions which potentially has repercussions also for conducting bt in practice we contribute to the bt performance literature by considering different key characteristics of dis similarity the purpose of the paper is dual first we propose a structured framework enabling bt practitioners to distinguish between different dimensions and degrees of similarity thus operationalizing the link between similarity and bt performance second we investigate how the practical applicability of bt can be improved in a given policy context by transferring value estimates of water quality changes along a similarity gradient and across european water bodies 1 1 when mentioning water bodies we refer to both surface and groundwater bodies we consider an environmental good which has a prominent role in regulatory and environmental policy making 2 17 2 background on benefit transfer and similarities several studies in the literature have considered bt of water quality value estimates based on stated preferences methods i a 17 24 including ces 18 27 30 33 most of the literature addresses whether to use function or value transfer with ambiguous results for instance 17 conclude that value transfer should be preferred when the sites are relatively similar and function transfer if the sites are dissimilar in contrast 24 find that function transfers do not necessarily outperform value transfers however they refer to baltic sea water quality and are therefore comparing already rather similar sites most studies testing bt rely on identical survey designs in study and policy sites and therefore also transfer across similar improvement scenarios 18 27 30 33 however the selection and description of water quality attributes is typically designed for a specific context and research question and may thus vary across studies essentially assessing the same good 32 34 for instance both 35 36 value characteristics of marine water quality in ces while the former selects indicators of eutrophication i e intermediary ecosystems services in terms of water clarity quantity of coarse fish state of the seaweed population and occurrences of blue green algae blooms the latter focus on recreational values i e final ecosystem services in terms of bathing water quality or cod catch levels 2 1 transferring values of water quality attributes considering three dimensions of similarity the considered good water quality is described differently in the empirical ce surveys available in the literature to examine and operationalise the different yet clearly connected key aspects of similarity we suggest using a framework which defines and distinguishes between three dimensions of similarity likely to affect bt performance more precisely we investigate the impact of similarity on bt performance with regard to 1 the biophysical characteristics of water quality and the geophysical characteristics of the site 2 the income of the affected populations and 3 the survey description of the valued attributes the framework is outlined in the following 2 1 1 the physical similarity dimension both the biophysical 2 2 even though chemical and hydromorphological aspects are relevant to determine water quality e g in the context of the wfd those aspects are often not addressed specifically in the ce scenario and attribute descriptions due to focusing on final ecosystem services also referred to as ecological endpoints thus we mainly refer to the biophysical conditions when addressing water quality levels in this study improvement in water quality and the geophysical characteristics of water bodies can be described by various indicators and characteristics for instance the resources for the future rff water quality ladder defines the change in water quality in relation to the final ecosystem services es boating angling swimming 37 and initially also drinking 38 39 expand this description by further including intermediary es characteristics such as vegetation or fish species to match the wfd indicators for uk rivers the rff ladder e g 26 40 the expanded ladder e g 17 41 or variations adapted to the local context 42 are frequently applied in valuation studies however the line between different water quality definitions and similar concepts is narrow in particular the differentiation between the ecological status of water bodies and water quality for instance while the wfd describes the ecological status of water bodies by intermediary es 8 9 other studies focus on intermediary es of eutrophication related aspects with direct relevance for water quality 24 43 in contrast 17 define water quality based on both intermediary and final es whereas 44 describe the ecological status by intermediary and water quality by final es to avoid transferring dissimilar goods based on the same hypernym such as water quality it is thus necessary to recognise the underlying definition and description furthermore the relationship between wtp and water quality improvement is typically nonlinear 26 ensuring bt of a similar good therefore requires accounting for the extent of the water quality change i e the reference and the target level studies do not only draw on different definitions of the good and its change but also refer to the water quality in various contexts for instance water quality may be valued according to different water body types such as rivers lakes estuaries coastal waters open marine waters or groundwater e g 24 45 46 furthermore as wtp is sensitive to the spatial scope of a change e g 28 41 47 the literature recommends not to scale unit values to much larger or smaller areas 48 the spatial location within a landscape may also matter for example some studies account for surrounding land use attributes 30 the distance between the study and the policy sites 22 25 and whether the valued good serves as a substitute or complement 17 30 49 50 while these aspects are important to consider when assessing similarity of studies for bt they also require specific knowledge of both cases in conclusion as the ideal bt would consider transferring goods with similar bio and geophysical dimensions 28 the differently described reference and target levels of water quality as well as types and sizes of water bodies should therefore be accounted for to ensure a high level of bt performance 2 1 2 the population similarity dimension to account for population similarity frequently considered as being one component of site similarity bt studies often adjust the transferred values to differences in income purchase power parities currencies or inflation between the study and the policy site different market extents and even across cultures or time 17 20 28 51 52 in terms of income this can be done by drawing on the site specific average income of the study sample which is suggested to outperform the use of gdp per capita 51 while income adjustments are relevant for bt across and within countries international bt additionally requires accounting for potential price differences for instance based on average consumer prices and implied ppp conversation rates in the context of water quality applying a constant income elasticity of wtp of one is often identified as leading to the lowest tes value transfers 24 51 53 55 still as studies have also identified income elasticities different from one e g ref 56 in the context of biodiversity conservation conducting sensitivity analyses to test different assumptions is necessary furthermore as preferences and thus wtp may not be stable over time it is suggested to account for temporal trends when transferring benefits across time the results in the literature testing the temporal stability of bt are however ambiguous over a time span of 5 years or less 57 59 find no significant temporal impact on wtp for river restoration improved water quality and flood protection respectively in contrast 60 discover a significant difference in wtp for flood control and wetland conservation over a time period of 5 years furthermore while cultural differences may also affect wtp 52 61 find only limited influence of cultural differences on bt performance between countries which however share many ethnic linguistic and other cultural similarities moreover wtp estimates may vary when respondents perceive the current environmental state or the proposed change scenario as unrealistic 47 whether respondents are users or non users of the valued good 50 and whether they live close or far away from the given site or available substitutes 50 62 as these aspects may lead to variations in wtp they are important to consider when conducting and testing bt yet again valuation studies often do not report on those aspects 2 1 3 the attribute similarity dimension while ces are often used for bt little evidence exists on how different study designs affect bt performance several studies document that wtp estimates can be affected by various ce study design considerations e g the number of choice sets attributes or attribute levels as well as the range of attribute levels the experimental design of choice sets payment vehicles and bid vectors 63 68 however due to focus on practical bt application in the context of water quality it is beyond the scope of this paper to address the effect of all those aspects this dimension therefore refers to how choice attribute descriptions may impact tes of single attributes in our case water quality attributes from a theoretical and empirical point of view goods with identical biophysical characteristics e g the chemical state of water may result in different welfare and thus wtp estimates 28 for instance valuation studies describe the purposes or benefits of valued goods differently e g water for either drinking or merely for recreation which causes direct implications on the utility of the respondents water quality consists of as well as affects and generates various goods and services and is therefore an umbrella term for different characteristics determining the status of water bodies ces either value water body attributes which are assumed to determine water quality 3 3 for instance in stream ecology aesthetics and bank side conditions in ref 93 water clarity fish species blue green algal blooms and sliming in ref 43 or water clarity number of coarse fish the state of bladder wrack and the occurrence of algae blooms in ref 35 or explicitly value water quality as one attribute itself e g refs 41 42 69 70 due to this study s objective of transferring water quality values we focus on the latter as such water quality is assessed as one attribute in the context of many 32 46 its value may thus not just be described by a single attribute but could consist of an amalgamation of different attributes depending on the services in question for example value estimates may differ whether say an increase in fish stock is assumed to be included in the water quality attribute itself or if it is rather detached as a separate additional attribute in the choice set assuming that the amount of fish would be a value generating service in itself e g for anglers then for the latter case we would expect a lower wtp for the water quality attribute compared to the former case see e g ref 71 the selection and description of attributes is not standardised different study designs and attribute descriptions may be chosen due to for instance heterogeneous pertinences of water quality characteristics across regions or due to the need to increase the practical applicability of valuation methods for example 36 find considerably lower response rates for choice sets which include the attribute green algae despite the attribute being a recognised indicator for water quality generally but also in the respective study the attribute was excluded while the selection or restriction of attributes may be most feasible at the study site it seems likely that the description associated with all ce attributes influences the wtp of the attribute to be transferred for instance water quality levels in two similar water bodies may be valued differently if described as being very good or alternatively as suitable for boating angling swimming and drinking without any treatment despite showing identical quality levels in the above introduced quality ladder in other words aligning the water quality levels cf section 2 2 1 refers to biophysical dimension of water quality in a concrete water body however considering the characteristics which are ascribed to the different ce attributes i e the information that is provided to the respondents of the ce refers to the valued and therefore to components of the welfare dimension of water quality 28 while the discrepancy between the true and the valued water quality attribute is nothing else than the previously introduced measurement error this dimension aims to reveal if dissimilarities in survey descriptions of the attributes i e the characteristics which are ascribed to the defined levels of the ce attributes may affect bt performance despite referring to a similar biophysical change in water quality given the need for a primary study at the policy sites to investigate the third dimension the impact of survey design may be considered primarily of interest for testing bt still we here focus on the impact of attribute descriptions which potentially has repercussions also for conducting bt in practice e g if certain attribute descriptions in the original study would not be relevant in the policy site context 3 materials and methods by adapting the selection criteria outlined by ref 45 we identified a number of relevant studies according to the following criteria they should all 1 estimate the wtp explicitly for water quality 2 address european water bodies 3 apply ce in which water quality is one choice attribute and 4 describe the good sufficiently and do not bias the wording of its description use a mandatory payment and provide sufficient background information such as showing or describing the choice cards the survey and all the information required for the three dimensions the latter are among the recommendations in ref 72 for applying state of the art ce methods the analysis is limited to ce studies in order to draw on the same set of studies throughout all similarity dimensions including the one testing for attribute similarity in addition all selected studies measure compensating surplus table 1 provides the list of identified studies 4 4 google scholar was used as search engine keywords water quality benefit transfer choice experiment since the purpose of the search was not to provide an exhaustive review of all water quality ce valuation studies in europe but rather to identify a fairly representative selection of these studies with variation within the defined similarity dimensions it was not deemed necessary to use a wider range of search engines however as noted by ref 13 this introduces the risk of selection effects which could potentially bias results and their estimated mean marginal wtps for water quality improvements to test bt performance we transfer wtp estimates between all possible pairwise combinations of the individual studies totalling 4552 one to one transfer applications each study acts as study site from which value estimates are transferred to each of the remaining 16 studies serving as individual policy sites this implies that if a single study reports wtp estimates for three different water quality changes then the study serves up to three times as study site and also up to three times as policy site in this study we apply unit value transfers due to the following reasons first the focus of the paper is on applied bt and to operationalise different similarity aspects rather than adding to the literature comparing the performance of different approaches to bt e g ref 24 53 83 this includes that function transfers are likely to increase the bt complexity 13 including the requirement of much more information than is often provided in ce studies 84 second when conducting and testing bt in a water quality context related to the baltic sea function transfers do not generally outperform simple value transfers 24 85 third there is also a lack of consensus in the literature on how function transfers should actually be conducted and despite arguments for the advantages of specific types of function transfer empirical evidence fails to provide unequivocal support for the superiority of any specific type 13 p 483 the most straightforward bt application is the unadjusted value transfer which can be denoted as follows 1 w t p p o l i c y w t p s t u d y however as previously outlined several studies found that an income adjusted value transfer with an income elasticity of one performed the best we follow this approach and additionally apply equation 2 to account for differences in income when transferring benefits 2 w t p p o l i c y w t p s t u d y i n c o m e p o l i c y i n c o m e s t u d y e l a s t i c i t y next to test the performance of bt the transfer error of each individual bt application is estimated this is done following equation 3 3 t r a n s f e r e r r o r t e w t p s t u d y w t p p o l i c y w t p p o l i c y finally to test the performance of bt applications under consideration of the three different dimensions of similarity we classify the bt applications into groups and assess and compare the average tes of and across these groups the average te is calculated based on equation 4 in which te represents the transfer errors of the i 1 n bt applications within a group g as an element of all bt applications g in addition we also estimate the median te 4 m e a n t e g 1 n i 0 n t e i g g g one group g thereby consists of one or more similarity dimensions or components sets or levels within the three dimensions which are described in table 2 and further defined in the following sections 3 1 the physical similarity dimension to account and test for the impact of physical similarity on bt performance this dimension considers the extent of the valued and transferred water quality improvements as well as the type and size of the respective water bodies the assumption here is that the final water quality rating of the applied water quality ladders best translates the actual physical condition of water quality into comparable ranks thus this dimension refers to some of the key aspects of commodity and site similarity 28 29 86 whereas other related aspects will be covered in the second income of the populations and third welfare influencing quantities and qualities of water quality dimensions to adjust for the level of the water quality both in terms of its status quo and the extent of the considered change we start out by following the water quality ladder and indicators suggested in ref 39 the ladder is applied in the european context linked closely to the eu water framework directive as it ranks water quality as either poor 5 5 in the eu wfd there is an additional lower level of water quality referred to as bad moderate good or very good based on wide range of indicators such as aquatic and river bank vegetation fish species chemical limits flow rates and substrate types as well as suitability for swimming angling and boating 6 6 it is up to each individual eu member state to specifically define quality criteria indicators and measurements to classify their water bodies according to this overall classification to facilitate the transfer of similar and dissimilar extents of water quality changes we allocate the quality level indicators provided in each study to this water quality ladder i e both the status quo and the level after the assumed improvement to decide upon the allocation to the appropriate water quality levels the different valuation studies were screened for indicators and descriptions which fit to the indicators defined for the water quality ladder in refs 39 from now on referred to as the hime ladder the main determinants were the recreational indicators of swimming angling and boating in the valuation studies these indicators were provided by the majority of the studies and allowed a straightforward allocation to the ranks of the hime ladder if these indicators were however not provided additional indicators and or descriptive information were considered this includes among others the applied qualitative water quality measures such as high medium low as well as the diversity and availability of plants fish types or the turbidity of water which were then translated into the above introduced indicators defined for the hime ladder moreover while not representing an explicit indicator in the hime ladder water which is declared to be acceptable for drinking without further treatment was considered as indicating very good water quality which corresponds to its rank in the rff ladder given this approach different water quality level descriptions and definitions can be compared based on a common framework the original ladder by ref 39 is defined based on the water quality indicators of the wfd for rivers in the uk however despite the finding that water quality reference conditions and levels are fairly similar in the uk germany denmark and the baltic countries 87 discrepancies may occur when applying the ladder in different geographical areas or water bodies for instance in terms of the composition or occurrence of certain fish and vegetation types cf 41 or simply due to not being compatible with the indicators set by local public administration agencies 41 42 furthermore both 41 73 find that allocating different uses to water quality states is rather subjective and the perceptions of respondents in terms of which activities are suitable in certain water quality conditions is not always in line with the definition set in the hime ladder ultimately adjusting the ladder description to local conditions as for instance done by ref 41 may lead to a better fit of the wtp estimates in the local context but may lead to correspondence errors when aligning the quality indicators used in different studies to the levels of a common ladder yet the generic ladder by ref 39 is selected for the current study since it contains the use and non use indicators found in the different water quality descriptions of all considered studies cf table 1 thus it allows for a straightforward alignment of the water quality levels particularly when primary studies do not provide sufficient information to investigate the local conditions or the respondents perceptions in detail we then classify the different extents in water quality changes i e the change from the reference level to the level after the assumed improvement into two sets namely all and comparable changes in water quality while all describes the average tes of all bt applications between wtp estimates of any change in water quality within a given group g in eq 4 comparable is restricted to transfers between wtp estimates describing equal improvements from the same reference level in that way improvements from say poor to moderate are transferred to study sites with valued improvements of the same extent and with the same reference levels i e also poor to moderate furthermore and despite all selected studies valuing water quality the geophysical aspects of the analyses defined as the water body types and sizes differ we thus distinguish between three levels of similarity similar less similar and dissimilar while similar refers to alike water bodies e g transfers between two rivers less similar entails all surface waters e g transfers across rivers lakes and coastal waters whereas dissimilar imply transfers between surface water and groundwater this classification is illustrated in table 3 to reduce complexity and ensure sufficient quantities of bt applications per adjustment group river basins which also include lakes or fjords e g ref 47 are considered as rivers as studies do often not indicate the exact magnitude of the considered change or in different metrics such as km or ha we test the impact of the water body size on bt performance by distinguishing between larger and smaller sites respectively while a site is considered large when covering water bodies of an entire nation e g 76 78 coastal waters e g 36 77 or relatively large rivers of and above lengths of 60 km the study areas of small sites are defined as rivers or river stretches below 60 km e g 42 and lakes e g 70 and thus only representing a fraction of what respondents presumably care about in their country or region 7 7 the number is selected due to representing the median length of all rivers in the selected studies the impact of the water body size on bt performance is then tested based on restricting the assessment of the average tes to transfers between similar sized water bodies i e only transferring from large to large water bodies and from small to small water bodies which is referred to as area adjustment in the following alternatively all bt applications are also conducted between sites no area adjustment 3 2 the population similarity dimension due to mostly applying bt across countries which entails different socio economic characteristics of the affected populations we adjust the primary wtp estimates for inflation and purchasing power parities ppp and convert all values into euro 2017 cf table 1 for the adjustment explanation this holds for all wtp estimates transferred in the context of this study independent from the similarity dimension furthermore as economic theory predicts that an increase in income leads to increasing wtp we examine the impact of income on bt performance by drawing on and adjusting for the site specific average income of the study sample if available 8 8 studies often indicate income based on open ended intervals e g 5 of the considered population with an income of 100 000 year and above in such case the highest quantified number i e 100 000 is assumed to be the upper boundary which may however result in an underestimation of the average income the income of the study population is indicated in all studies except for 81 for the latter the average income of the respective region is used as indicated by the eu excluding the study in the analysis is not resulting in different conclusions following equation 2 consequently the results reflect the average tes of all bt applications with and without income adjustments due to relatively similar income distributions in the selected study countries the gini coefficients of the study countries range from 26 to 36 in the year of the conducted survey we do not adjust for income inequality in this study furthermore as all considered primary studies were conducted within a relatively narrow time frame of ten years 2005 2015 whereas 13 of the 17 selected studies were implemented within 5 years we do not consider potential temporal trends in terms of changing preferences which are reflected in changing wtp estimates as noted in section 2 2 the results in the literature testing the temporal stability of preferences are however ambiguous 3 3 the attribute similarity dimension another dimension which is explored in this paper consists of testing the impact of the survey descriptions of the ce attributes on bt performance despite its practical relevance for the wfd and achieving good ecological status we thereby draw on the ecosystem services es framework which allows considering both final i e the ones that directly provide values to people and thus influence their welfare and intermediary services like some of the indicators determining good ecological status therefore we examine the choice set attribute descriptions both water quality and the additional attributes based on what es they are assumed to provide or address we thereby draw on the classification system introduced by 88 which considers aquatic ecosystem services delivered by various kinds of water bodies and splits the es framework into three categories namely provisioning regulating and cultural services table 4 thus we define attribute similarity as whether or not the same ecosystem service categories are emphasised in the valuation studies consequently and in addition to the geophysical site characteristics of the first dimension this dimension investigates further aspects of the welfare dimension of water quality 28 in other words the biophysical and welfare components of the first and this dimension are both linked to the overall commodity and its associated impact on utility as both dimensions are interlinked we consider the dimensions not only separately but also in a combined manner to test if transferring attributes which incorporate similar benefits may reduce the resulting tes we compare the average tes of transfer applications of four different attribute description sets ads the first set adsw1a1 consists of studies in which both the water quality attribute w and the additional attributes a address or neglect the same es categories we expect the smallest te for this ads as the attributes are the most similar and therefore describe nonmarket goods with comparable welfare influencing qualities 28 the second set adsw1a0 includes studies with water quality attributes addressing the same but the additional attributes addressing dissimilar es categories the anticipation is that adsw1a0 would result in higher tes compared to adsw1a1 expecting that what is important at a given site differs adsw0a1 considers studies in which the additional attributes address the same es categories whereas the water quality attribute addresses dissimilar es categories we would expect tes to be larger here compared to adsw1a1 or adsw1a0 as the core attribute being valued is described differently in adsw0a0 both the water quality attribute and the additional attributes of all studies address dissimilar es categories table 5 9 9 the precise allocation of the addressed ecosystem services is provided in appendix a we thereby refer to the information the respondents of the ces are provided with i e the choice sets including the associated descriptions or given those are not included the study text describing the provided information in detail 4 results as we find mean and median tes to differ substantially in the following we have chosen to focus on the median as this measure is less sensitive to extreme observations by following the approach in ref 11 or whitehead et al 2015 we consider the samples as independent and test the statistical significance of tes by drawing on the mann whitney u test with p value 0 05 10 10 the p values of the significance test are provided in figs 1 3 in within the text where relevant the full details of the results both mean and median tes of all tests the mann whitney u test etc are provided in appendix b across the entire sample and based on all 4552 bts which are possible when not introducing any restriction from the three dimensions we find a median te of 69 this may serve as a benchmark for the following assessments within each of the three dimensions of similarity 4 1 the physical similarity dimension the results for this dimension confirm that bt performance may be improved by ensuring bio and geophysical similarity across the transferred commodities fig 1 illustrates that tes are lowest when transferring wtp estimates of comparable water quality improvements between similar water bodies we first look at how the similarity of the water body type and its size affect bt performance considering the transfers without area adjustment white boxplots in fig 1 with any all changes in water quality tes turn out lower when restricting transfers to wtp estimates of similar water bodies 66 compared to transfers between less similar 69 and dissimilar sites 76 the difference between the medians of transferring between similar and dissimilar sites is statistically significant p value 0 00 whereas no statistical significance can be observed between similar and less similar sites p value 0 07 considering the bt applications with area adjustments shaded boxplots in fig 1 the results indicate significantly lower tes 62 compared to taking any water body size into account p value 0 01 however while adjusting for the area of water bodies might intuitively be expected to reduce errors results are ambiguous while the tes for similar water bodies decline as expected adjusting for the water body size leads to considerable and statistically significant increases in tes for less similar water bodies 83 compared to 69 p value 0 00 if studies value similar types of water bodies the median error is significantly lower when also restricting the transfers to value estimates of comparable water quality improvements 58 compared to considering all changes in water quality p value 0 02 if additionally adjusting for the water body size the median te is the lowest of all in this dimension tested transfer applications 54 the difference in the medians with all these and without any adjustments is thereby statistically significant p value 0 00 cf figure 1 4 2 the population similarity dimension somewhat surprisingly adjusting wtp estimates for income does not appear to improve bt performance rather tes tend to increase fig 2 the differences between the medians with income adjustments compared to the respective alternatives without such adjustments are significant except when transferring between less similar water bodies this is in contrast to what has been found in the literature e g ref 24 when additionally adjusting for the area the median tes remain alike when transferring between similar water bodies and comparable improvements in water quality 81 yet further increase for less similar from 83 to 87 and dissimilar sites 80 88 all errors remain above the average errors of the unadjusted transfer alternatives 4 3 the attribute similarity dimension testing for the attribute similarity suggests that the way choice sets are designed and described may influence the performance of transferring single attributes fig 3 in the following for reasons of brevity we limit the comparison to the transfers showing the best performance i e the ones unadjusted for income furthermore we refer to the transfer of comparable water quality improvements between similar and for the purpose of comparison less similar water bodies this implies that both components of commodity similarity are considered in the following i e the biophysical covered in the physical similarity dimension and the welfare influencing aspects of water quality which are considered in the attribute similarity dimension cf 28 when transferring value estimates between similar water bodies restricting bt applications to similar attribute descriptions adsw1a1 suggests an increase in median te 67 compared to 58 without accounting for the attribute descriptions however the difference between the median tes is statistically insignificant and adsw1a1 consists of only 48 bt applications the results must thus be interpreted with caution yet looking at transfers of estimates from adjustment sets in which only the water quality attributes address the same es categories adsw1a0 we find a lower median te 54 which is however also not significantly different to the median te without considering the attribute descriptions interestingly if studies concern less similar water bodies restricting bt applications to similar descriptions of all attributes adsw1a1 improves the bt performance substantially more precisely the median te of adsw1a1 results in 58 compared to 70 when not considering the attribute similarity and the difference between both is statistically significant p value 0 02 restricting the transfer application to similar descriptions of the water quality attribute but dissimilar descriptions of the additional attributes adsw1a0 further decreases the te 55 which is among the lowest te of all in this study tested transfer applications between less similar water bodies again the difference in the median tes is significant p value 0 00 as expected restricting bts to the control groups in which only the additional adsw0a1 or none of all attributes adsw0a0 have similar descriptions results in larger median tes when transferring between less similar water bodies adsw0a1 results in a median te of 86 and adsw0a0 in a te of 69 while compared to the respective median te emerging when not considering the attribute description the first is significantly different the latter is not in contrast when transferring the respective values between similar water bodies the control groups do not result in a significant increase in tes these results suggest that when transferring values between less similar water bodies tes are significantly lower when the water quality attribute is described by the same ecosystem service categories whether or not the additional attributes are similar however when testing bt between similar water bodies considering similarities in the survey descriptions of the attributes appears to not necessarily improve bt performance 5 discussion and conclusion the proposed framework on how to assess and classify similarity in a structured manner contributes to the methodological improvement of practical bt by drawing on wtp estimates for water quality improvements in european water bodies which were measured by valuation studies applying ces we demonstrate that two out of the three introduced dimensions of similarity play an important role when aiming to improve bt performance while the biophysical and welfare related similarity of commodities i e including the geophysical site characteristics result in mostly significant lower tes income adjustments do not improve bt performance furthermore the results are of direct relevance for the economic assessments in the context of the wfd they disclose ranges of tes that can be expected when transferring water quality attributes under certain conditions they may thus serve as indications to be considered in the sensitivity analyses and interpretations of cbas dealing with the benefits of water quality improvements the findings demonstrate that tes may be reduced substantially by as far as possible transferring values describing commodities which similar physical characteristics i e comparable water quality changes in alike water body types with similar sizes as such the results are in line with the literature emphasising the importance of commodity and site similarity for valid bt 13 17 26 28 30 48 when setting the results of this study in the context of the average tes of other studies dealing with bt of water quality estimates in the european context we find ambiguous results for instance ref 17 transfer wtp estimates from surveys applying the hime ladder and being related to several studies utilised in this paper 11 11 namely the studies conducted in the aquamoney project though 17 transfer wtp estimates originating from contingent valuation studies whereas we focus on ces when looking at the average mean te when transferring between similar water bodies without area adjustments and comparable water quality changes which corresponds to the setting tested for in ref 17 this study generates a lower average te 95 compared to 121 for value transfers in ref 17 while we demonstrate that this te can be even further reduced by incorporating area adjustments down to a mean te of 82 17 reveal that tes of value transfers can be reduced substantially when restricting bt to countries with fairly similar socio economic characteristics te of 37 overall the median tes of this study depict comparable ranges as the mean tes reported in ref 24 85 though given our specific adjustments and considerations which are not directly transferable to related studies or goods direct comparisons remain speculative to ensure comparability of value estimates and despite potentially unconsidered measurement errors e g due to variations in local conditions and perceptions in context of water quality definitions and levels 41 42 47 73 the suggested approach of aligning the differently defined changes of water quality into a common framework i e the water quality ladder turns out to be an effective and easily applicable approach to increase bt performance still limitations remain first utilising the different water quality ladders ratings as reflecting the biophysical water quality is certainly a simplification which needs to be regarded when interpreting the results second selecting other water quality ladders or frameworks to adjust different good definitions may change and possibly improve bt performance while this is beyond the scope of this paper further research on such comparisons would generate valuable insights on the sensitivity of the results third changing the subjective definition of whether water bodies are considered as being small or large may affect the results more precisely shifting the assumed 60 km threshold to either 50 or 70 km leads to small changes in the average median transfer errors which however never exceed one percentage point in the present case the conclusions thus remain fairly unchanged while the tes for similar water bodies decline as expected adjusting for the water body size leads to significant increases in tes for less similar water bodies a possible explanation might be that when transferring across less similar water bodies the size aspect is not a main driver of differences for instance transferring from a lake to a river may already be associated with relatively large error due to the fact that it is two different types of water bodies and taking into account whether one is transferring from a small lake to a large river or from a large lake to a large river might not matter much we can only speculate as to why we actually find an increase in tes when adjusting for size one explanation might be that size differences between less similar water bodies correlate with other drivers of te adjusting for the size when transferring values between dissimilar water bodies has no significant effect on tes again a possible explanation could be that size differences correlate with other drivers of te contrary to most findings and recommendations in the literature cf 18 48 52 89 adjusting wtp estimates to the income of the respective population appears to have a negative impact on transfer performance altering the income elasticity does thereby not change the conclusions the income adjusted bt applications always result in higher tes in comparison to no income adjustments or naturally in the same te when assuming zero elasticity due to the theoretical foundation of income adjustments it may be that in the present case income could not fully account for the complex population characteristics and thus possesses limited explanatory power 84 90 moreover income differences may even correlate with for instance cultural differences and increase tes by pulling the adjustments in the adverse direction for instance additional determinants such as culture or attitude may be heterogeneous across sites 20 52 and wtp may vary across users and non users 50 furthermore wtp may not be robust over a longer time span 60 and dependent upon the availability of substitute goods as well as on the distance to and between the sites or the substitute goods 17 26 31 35 50 moreover recent studies find that income inequality within societies may affect the wtp for environmental goods 91 92 however we focus on key elements of water quality similarity which were provided by the majority of the studies and thus leave testing those aspects for further research while studies typically test bt performance based on identical ces in study and policy sites 27 30 the impact of the design of choice sets on transfer performance often remains unconsidered this study suggests that how the attributes of ces are described may influence the obtained tes and thus highlight the need to consider the impact of different survey descriptions when testing bt applications more precisely the results demonstrate that transferring values between less similar water bodies results in significantly lower tes when the water quality attribute is described by the same ecosystem service categories the results thus indicate that considering similar welfare influencing aspects in water quality attributes may offset dissimilarities in terms of the geophysical site characteristics given the need for a primary study at the policy sites to investigate whether or not the same ecosystem service categories are emphasised in the valuation studies this third dimension is particularly relevant for testing rather than applying bt still the results suggest that also bt practitioners should carefully consider the descriptions of the attributes in the study site and whether they are relevant in the policy site context for instance transferring an otherwise similar good value might lead to higher tes if an associated description e g swimming is not applicable at the policy site e g swimming is prohibited nevertheless and despite the statistical significance of these results studies meeting the definition of attribute similarity describe water quality largely by the same ecosystem services all studies refer at least to fishing provisioning service maintaining population and habitat regulating service and recreation cultural service whereas the descriptions do not seem to explicitly point to potential differences between water bodies while it seems possible that the results occur due to specified attributes encouraging respondents to mainly think of these so that the site becomes less important for the overall valuation drawing conclusions with the given number of bt applications and merely on the basis of addressed ecosystem service categories may not be sufficient for instance attribute descriptions referring to fishing may as well describe different fish species pointing to specific types of water bodies or even water quality conditions see e g ref 41 in conclusion our results confirm other studies in finding that commodity and site similarity i e the type and size of water bodies as well as the valued improvement in water quality are important parameters to consider when transferring values estimates the welfare influencing aspects of water quality namely the attribute similarity of ces thereby turns out to improve bt performance under certain conditions particularly when bt deals with less similar water bodies in contrast we find population similarity to matter less declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8681,benefit transfer bt is often applied when a primary valuation study is considered too costly or time consuming to conduct it is commonly assumed that bt performance improves with increasing similarity between study and policy sites however no common criteria for defining similarity exist making it difficult to operationalise the concept of similarity in a practical bt context we propose a structured framework for distinguishing between different degrees of similarity in particular we differentiate between three dimensions physical population and attribute similarity while the first two are often used in the literature attribute similarity is not to investigate the impact attribute descriptions have on bt we define it as whether or not the same ecosystem service categories are emphasised in the valuation studies using value estimates for water quality improvements obtained from 17 choice experiments conducted in europe we empirically test unit value transfer performance along a similarity gradient the results confirm that increasing physical similarities across commodities and sites generally lead to lower transfer errors however when using income adjusted value transfer we surprisingly find the opposite finally we demonstrate that increasing attribute similarity may offset dissimilarities in terms of the site characteristics keywords benefit transfer similarity dissimilarity transfer error water quality choice experiment water framework directive 1 introduction in the wake of the increasing use of cost benefit analysis cba in european policy and decision making there is a growing demand for value estimates of public goods 1 2 for instance the eu water framework directive wfd states that lower environmental objectives may be aimed for if achieving the intended water quality level good ecological status would be disproportionately costly 3 applying cba i e assessing if the benefits of achieving good ecological status are outweighed by the associated costs is one way to determine whether or not costs can be considered disproportionate 4 7 the wfd thereby considers several dimensions to determine the ecological status but while they are important to understand the ecology of the water and inform the design of valuation scenarios their direct adoption may not always be useful for valuation studies as many of these dimensions result in intermediary ecosystem services cf 8 9 which might result in double counting when valuing them explicitly 10 moreover cba requires the benefits of water quality improvements to be assessed in monetary terms yet primary valuation studies are often not available for certain geographical contexts as time and money are often limiting factors when it comes to conducting valuation surveys this demand is more often than not met by relying on value transfer methods also referred to as benefit transfer bt in its simplest form bt refers to obtaining value estimates for goods at a specific site or context called the policy site by using value estimates that have been previously obtained through primary valuation at another site and context called the study site in other words the value estimates are transferred from the study site to the policy site there are two main sources of error that may render the use of value estimates obtained from bt questionable 11 12 first of all transferred values are only as good as the primary valuation survey conducted at the study site this means that any measurement errors that may cause the study site value estimates to deviate from the underlying true value of a good will be transferred to the policy site 11 13 secondly the transfer of value estimates may in itself introduce an error reflecting dissimilarity between study and policy sites which are not accounted for in the value transfer process this is referred to as the transfer error te in concept both sources of error will be present in any bt but as the measurement error is generally unknown focus is typically on the te since this can be minimized by using more or less sophisticated adjustments to transferred values in the value transfer process in most applied bts there is no way to assess the presence and magnitude of te since this requires policy site values to be known and such knowledge would defeat the purpose of conducting bt in the first place consequently the expected performance of bt in practice is generally based on accumulated experience from more systematic investigations of te in the scientific literature with some exemptions suggesting that bt performance is determined by the similarity of willingness to pay wtp distributions rather than by the similarity of the commodities or populations e g 14 16 it is generally agreed that tes are smaller the more similar the study and policy sites and goods are e g 13 17 21 it is thus largely seen as a prerequisite for valid bt in general research suggests that wtp estimates can be transferred directly called simple value transfer only if study and policy sites are relatively similar 17 22 whereas predicting policy site values by use of a value function estimated at the study site called function transfer may perform better when study and policy sites are relatively dissimilar 17 23 however function transfers do not consistently outperform value transfers 24 moreover as there are no common criteria defining similarity 25 and there is no clear guidance in the literature on how relative similarity should be interpreted in a practical bt context insights on the impact of similarity on bt performance are often conflicting 2 11 13 26 29 for instance 30 finds that similarity in terms of environmental characteristics and land use attributes between study and policy sites improves bt performance for some transferred attributes whereas merely assuring geographical proximity does not in contrast 31 discover that tes increase with distance between study and policy sites whereas 22 find both increasing and decreasing tes with increasing distance most studies distinguish between site and commodity similarity but differences in their interpretations remain typically sites are described by characteristics such as the affected population the availability of substitutes and complements to the good or geographical proximity 30 whereas a commodity is determined by its physical and welfare dimensions cf 28 however despite similarity generally being seen as a prerequisite for valid bt there is little consistency in the literature concerning which dimensions of similarity to consider in bt for instance the good and the affected population may or may not be included when referring to site similarity 13 30 whether sites can be considered similar is further determined by spatial patterns and temporal trends 2 13 spatial patterns entail that bt applications must consider the extent of the population and thus the affected market and whether there are spatial differerences e g in relation to distance decay temporal trends refer to changes in price levels and society s preferences across time 13 while the spatial and temporal components of tes have been widely investigated in the literature an often overlooked source of te originates from dissimilarities in the quantity and quality of the goods 28 ultimately reflected by the survey description in the applied valuation methods as such this is a measurement error referring to the performance of the original study but it may be confounded with a transfer error if the same design characteristics do not apply for the study and policy sites choice experiments ce is a valuation method which is often argued to be useful for bt 2 18 27 30 32 because it values individual components characteristics or levels of one or more goods each of them can then be transferred to other situations and differences between policy and study site may to some extent be captured by the attributes however two implications for the performance of bt based on ce estimates emerge when the design of the ce surveys differ first the way in which goods and attributes are defined and described in economic valuation studies influence wtp estimates 28 differently specified attributes and whether some aspects are added as separate attributes may influence the value estimate of the attribute to be transferred second attribute levels are often described qualitatively e g as poor medium good relative to the current situation due to difficulties in estimating specific and comparable outcome benefits this may cause the use of bt to be restricted 32 or at least transfer similarity to be more challenging as it has to refer to both attribute levels and the qualitative description behind in this paper we investigate the impact of similarity on bt performance with regard to 1 the physical characteristics 2 the affected populations and 3 the survey description of both the attribute of interest and the additional attributes the first dimension refers to the biophysical improvements of the commodity water quality and the geophysical site characteristics of the associated water body the second dimension accounts for differences in incomes between the study and policy sites populations the third dimension investigates the impact of the survey design and thereby addresses further commodity components which are in addition to the geophysical site characteristics also referred to by 28 as aspects of the welfare dimension of commodities namely the welfare influencing quantities or qualities of goods p 38 we restrict our analysis to considering ce surveys and categorise attribute similarity according to the ecosystem service framework by aiming to make bt more operational in practice we split commodity and site similarity as well as the welfare dimension into different sub components and thus do not directly follow the typical approach in the literature disentangling the components of similarity serves the purpose of providing detailed insights on the impacts they have on bt but does not preclude overlaps between the dimensions in particular between the first and third dimensions for example the geophysical aspects of the first dimension also represent welfare influencing aspects for reasons of clarity the narrative and discussions in this paper focus on the key aspects of the differently defined dimension whereas the overall results consider the adjustments of all dimensions both separately and together while the third dimension concerning the impact of survey design may be considered primarily of interest for testing bt we here focus on the impact of attribute descriptions which potentially has repercussions also for conducting bt in practice we contribute to the bt performance literature by considering different key characteristics of dis similarity the purpose of the paper is dual first we propose a structured framework enabling bt practitioners to distinguish between different dimensions and degrees of similarity thus operationalizing the link between similarity and bt performance second we investigate how the practical applicability of bt can be improved in a given policy context by transferring value estimates of water quality changes along a similarity gradient and across european water bodies 1 1 when mentioning water bodies we refer to both surface and groundwater bodies we consider an environmental good which has a prominent role in regulatory and environmental policy making 2 17 2 background on benefit transfer and similarities several studies in the literature have considered bt of water quality value estimates based on stated preferences methods i a 17 24 including ces 18 27 30 33 most of the literature addresses whether to use function or value transfer with ambiguous results for instance 17 conclude that value transfer should be preferred when the sites are relatively similar and function transfer if the sites are dissimilar in contrast 24 find that function transfers do not necessarily outperform value transfers however they refer to baltic sea water quality and are therefore comparing already rather similar sites most studies testing bt rely on identical survey designs in study and policy sites and therefore also transfer across similar improvement scenarios 18 27 30 33 however the selection and description of water quality attributes is typically designed for a specific context and research question and may thus vary across studies essentially assessing the same good 32 34 for instance both 35 36 value characteristics of marine water quality in ces while the former selects indicators of eutrophication i e intermediary ecosystems services in terms of water clarity quantity of coarse fish state of the seaweed population and occurrences of blue green algae blooms the latter focus on recreational values i e final ecosystem services in terms of bathing water quality or cod catch levels 2 1 transferring values of water quality attributes considering three dimensions of similarity the considered good water quality is described differently in the empirical ce surveys available in the literature to examine and operationalise the different yet clearly connected key aspects of similarity we suggest using a framework which defines and distinguishes between three dimensions of similarity likely to affect bt performance more precisely we investigate the impact of similarity on bt performance with regard to 1 the biophysical characteristics of water quality and the geophysical characteristics of the site 2 the income of the affected populations and 3 the survey description of the valued attributes the framework is outlined in the following 2 1 1 the physical similarity dimension both the biophysical 2 2 even though chemical and hydromorphological aspects are relevant to determine water quality e g in the context of the wfd those aspects are often not addressed specifically in the ce scenario and attribute descriptions due to focusing on final ecosystem services also referred to as ecological endpoints thus we mainly refer to the biophysical conditions when addressing water quality levels in this study improvement in water quality and the geophysical characteristics of water bodies can be described by various indicators and characteristics for instance the resources for the future rff water quality ladder defines the change in water quality in relation to the final ecosystem services es boating angling swimming 37 and initially also drinking 38 39 expand this description by further including intermediary es characteristics such as vegetation or fish species to match the wfd indicators for uk rivers the rff ladder e g 26 40 the expanded ladder e g 17 41 or variations adapted to the local context 42 are frequently applied in valuation studies however the line between different water quality definitions and similar concepts is narrow in particular the differentiation between the ecological status of water bodies and water quality for instance while the wfd describes the ecological status of water bodies by intermediary es 8 9 other studies focus on intermediary es of eutrophication related aspects with direct relevance for water quality 24 43 in contrast 17 define water quality based on both intermediary and final es whereas 44 describe the ecological status by intermediary and water quality by final es to avoid transferring dissimilar goods based on the same hypernym such as water quality it is thus necessary to recognise the underlying definition and description furthermore the relationship between wtp and water quality improvement is typically nonlinear 26 ensuring bt of a similar good therefore requires accounting for the extent of the water quality change i e the reference and the target level studies do not only draw on different definitions of the good and its change but also refer to the water quality in various contexts for instance water quality may be valued according to different water body types such as rivers lakes estuaries coastal waters open marine waters or groundwater e g 24 45 46 furthermore as wtp is sensitive to the spatial scope of a change e g 28 41 47 the literature recommends not to scale unit values to much larger or smaller areas 48 the spatial location within a landscape may also matter for example some studies account for surrounding land use attributes 30 the distance between the study and the policy sites 22 25 and whether the valued good serves as a substitute or complement 17 30 49 50 while these aspects are important to consider when assessing similarity of studies for bt they also require specific knowledge of both cases in conclusion as the ideal bt would consider transferring goods with similar bio and geophysical dimensions 28 the differently described reference and target levels of water quality as well as types and sizes of water bodies should therefore be accounted for to ensure a high level of bt performance 2 1 2 the population similarity dimension to account for population similarity frequently considered as being one component of site similarity bt studies often adjust the transferred values to differences in income purchase power parities currencies or inflation between the study and the policy site different market extents and even across cultures or time 17 20 28 51 52 in terms of income this can be done by drawing on the site specific average income of the study sample which is suggested to outperform the use of gdp per capita 51 while income adjustments are relevant for bt across and within countries international bt additionally requires accounting for potential price differences for instance based on average consumer prices and implied ppp conversation rates in the context of water quality applying a constant income elasticity of wtp of one is often identified as leading to the lowest tes value transfers 24 51 53 55 still as studies have also identified income elasticities different from one e g ref 56 in the context of biodiversity conservation conducting sensitivity analyses to test different assumptions is necessary furthermore as preferences and thus wtp may not be stable over time it is suggested to account for temporal trends when transferring benefits across time the results in the literature testing the temporal stability of bt are however ambiguous over a time span of 5 years or less 57 59 find no significant temporal impact on wtp for river restoration improved water quality and flood protection respectively in contrast 60 discover a significant difference in wtp for flood control and wetland conservation over a time period of 5 years furthermore while cultural differences may also affect wtp 52 61 find only limited influence of cultural differences on bt performance between countries which however share many ethnic linguistic and other cultural similarities moreover wtp estimates may vary when respondents perceive the current environmental state or the proposed change scenario as unrealistic 47 whether respondents are users or non users of the valued good 50 and whether they live close or far away from the given site or available substitutes 50 62 as these aspects may lead to variations in wtp they are important to consider when conducting and testing bt yet again valuation studies often do not report on those aspects 2 1 3 the attribute similarity dimension while ces are often used for bt little evidence exists on how different study designs affect bt performance several studies document that wtp estimates can be affected by various ce study design considerations e g the number of choice sets attributes or attribute levels as well as the range of attribute levels the experimental design of choice sets payment vehicles and bid vectors 63 68 however due to focus on practical bt application in the context of water quality it is beyond the scope of this paper to address the effect of all those aspects this dimension therefore refers to how choice attribute descriptions may impact tes of single attributes in our case water quality attributes from a theoretical and empirical point of view goods with identical biophysical characteristics e g the chemical state of water may result in different welfare and thus wtp estimates 28 for instance valuation studies describe the purposes or benefits of valued goods differently e g water for either drinking or merely for recreation which causes direct implications on the utility of the respondents water quality consists of as well as affects and generates various goods and services and is therefore an umbrella term for different characteristics determining the status of water bodies ces either value water body attributes which are assumed to determine water quality 3 3 for instance in stream ecology aesthetics and bank side conditions in ref 93 water clarity fish species blue green algal blooms and sliming in ref 43 or water clarity number of coarse fish the state of bladder wrack and the occurrence of algae blooms in ref 35 or explicitly value water quality as one attribute itself e g refs 41 42 69 70 due to this study s objective of transferring water quality values we focus on the latter as such water quality is assessed as one attribute in the context of many 32 46 its value may thus not just be described by a single attribute but could consist of an amalgamation of different attributes depending on the services in question for example value estimates may differ whether say an increase in fish stock is assumed to be included in the water quality attribute itself or if it is rather detached as a separate additional attribute in the choice set assuming that the amount of fish would be a value generating service in itself e g for anglers then for the latter case we would expect a lower wtp for the water quality attribute compared to the former case see e g ref 71 the selection and description of attributes is not standardised different study designs and attribute descriptions may be chosen due to for instance heterogeneous pertinences of water quality characteristics across regions or due to the need to increase the practical applicability of valuation methods for example 36 find considerably lower response rates for choice sets which include the attribute green algae despite the attribute being a recognised indicator for water quality generally but also in the respective study the attribute was excluded while the selection or restriction of attributes may be most feasible at the study site it seems likely that the description associated with all ce attributes influences the wtp of the attribute to be transferred for instance water quality levels in two similar water bodies may be valued differently if described as being very good or alternatively as suitable for boating angling swimming and drinking without any treatment despite showing identical quality levels in the above introduced quality ladder in other words aligning the water quality levels cf section 2 2 1 refers to biophysical dimension of water quality in a concrete water body however considering the characteristics which are ascribed to the different ce attributes i e the information that is provided to the respondents of the ce refers to the valued and therefore to components of the welfare dimension of water quality 28 while the discrepancy between the true and the valued water quality attribute is nothing else than the previously introduced measurement error this dimension aims to reveal if dissimilarities in survey descriptions of the attributes i e the characteristics which are ascribed to the defined levels of the ce attributes may affect bt performance despite referring to a similar biophysical change in water quality given the need for a primary study at the policy sites to investigate the third dimension the impact of survey design may be considered primarily of interest for testing bt still we here focus on the impact of attribute descriptions which potentially has repercussions also for conducting bt in practice e g if certain attribute descriptions in the original study would not be relevant in the policy site context 3 materials and methods by adapting the selection criteria outlined by ref 45 we identified a number of relevant studies according to the following criteria they should all 1 estimate the wtp explicitly for water quality 2 address european water bodies 3 apply ce in which water quality is one choice attribute and 4 describe the good sufficiently and do not bias the wording of its description use a mandatory payment and provide sufficient background information such as showing or describing the choice cards the survey and all the information required for the three dimensions the latter are among the recommendations in ref 72 for applying state of the art ce methods the analysis is limited to ce studies in order to draw on the same set of studies throughout all similarity dimensions including the one testing for attribute similarity in addition all selected studies measure compensating surplus table 1 provides the list of identified studies 4 4 google scholar was used as search engine keywords water quality benefit transfer choice experiment since the purpose of the search was not to provide an exhaustive review of all water quality ce valuation studies in europe but rather to identify a fairly representative selection of these studies with variation within the defined similarity dimensions it was not deemed necessary to use a wider range of search engines however as noted by ref 13 this introduces the risk of selection effects which could potentially bias results and their estimated mean marginal wtps for water quality improvements to test bt performance we transfer wtp estimates between all possible pairwise combinations of the individual studies totalling 4552 one to one transfer applications each study acts as study site from which value estimates are transferred to each of the remaining 16 studies serving as individual policy sites this implies that if a single study reports wtp estimates for three different water quality changes then the study serves up to three times as study site and also up to three times as policy site in this study we apply unit value transfers due to the following reasons first the focus of the paper is on applied bt and to operationalise different similarity aspects rather than adding to the literature comparing the performance of different approaches to bt e g ref 24 53 83 this includes that function transfers are likely to increase the bt complexity 13 including the requirement of much more information than is often provided in ce studies 84 second when conducting and testing bt in a water quality context related to the baltic sea function transfers do not generally outperform simple value transfers 24 85 third there is also a lack of consensus in the literature on how function transfers should actually be conducted and despite arguments for the advantages of specific types of function transfer empirical evidence fails to provide unequivocal support for the superiority of any specific type 13 p 483 the most straightforward bt application is the unadjusted value transfer which can be denoted as follows 1 w t p p o l i c y w t p s t u d y however as previously outlined several studies found that an income adjusted value transfer with an income elasticity of one performed the best we follow this approach and additionally apply equation 2 to account for differences in income when transferring benefits 2 w t p p o l i c y w t p s t u d y i n c o m e p o l i c y i n c o m e s t u d y e l a s t i c i t y next to test the performance of bt the transfer error of each individual bt application is estimated this is done following equation 3 3 t r a n s f e r e r r o r t e w t p s t u d y w t p p o l i c y w t p p o l i c y finally to test the performance of bt applications under consideration of the three different dimensions of similarity we classify the bt applications into groups and assess and compare the average tes of and across these groups the average te is calculated based on equation 4 in which te represents the transfer errors of the i 1 n bt applications within a group g as an element of all bt applications g in addition we also estimate the median te 4 m e a n t e g 1 n i 0 n t e i g g g one group g thereby consists of one or more similarity dimensions or components sets or levels within the three dimensions which are described in table 2 and further defined in the following sections 3 1 the physical similarity dimension to account and test for the impact of physical similarity on bt performance this dimension considers the extent of the valued and transferred water quality improvements as well as the type and size of the respective water bodies the assumption here is that the final water quality rating of the applied water quality ladders best translates the actual physical condition of water quality into comparable ranks thus this dimension refers to some of the key aspects of commodity and site similarity 28 29 86 whereas other related aspects will be covered in the second income of the populations and third welfare influencing quantities and qualities of water quality dimensions to adjust for the level of the water quality both in terms of its status quo and the extent of the considered change we start out by following the water quality ladder and indicators suggested in ref 39 the ladder is applied in the european context linked closely to the eu water framework directive as it ranks water quality as either poor 5 5 in the eu wfd there is an additional lower level of water quality referred to as bad moderate good or very good based on wide range of indicators such as aquatic and river bank vegetation fish species chemical limits flow rates and substrate types as well as suitability for swimming angling and boating 6 6 it is up to each individual eu member state to specifically define quality criteria indicators and measurements to classify their water bodies according to this overall classification to facilitate the transfer of similar and dissimilar extents of water quality changes we allocate the quality level indicators provided in each study to this water quality ladder i e both the status quo and the level after the assumed improvement to decide upon the allocation to the appropriate water quality levels the different valuation studies were screened for indicators and descriptions which fit to the indicators defined for the water quality ladder in refs 39 from now on referred to as the hime ladder the main determinants were the recreational indicators of swimming angling and boating in the valuation studies these indicators were provided by the majority of the studies and allowed a straightforward allocation to the ranks of the hime ladder if these indicators were however not provided additional indicators and or descriptive information were considered this includes among others the applied qualitative water quality measures such as high medium low as well as the diversity and availability of plants fish types or the turbidity of water which were then translated into the above introduced indicators defined for the hime ladder moreover while not representing an explicit indicator in the hime ladder water which is declared to be acceptable for drinking without further treatment was considered as indicating very good water quality which corresponds to its rank in the rff ladder given this approach different water quality level descriptions and definitions can be compared based on a common framework the original ladder by ref 39 is defined based on the water quality indicators of the wfd for rivers in the uk however despite the finding that water quality reference conditions and levels are fairly similar in the uk germany denmark and the baltic countries 87 discrepancies may occur when applying the ladder in different geographical areas or water bodies for instance in terms of the composition or occurrence of certain fish and vegetation types cf 41 or simply due to not being compatible with the indicators set by local public administration agencies 41 42 furthermore both 41 73 find that allocating different uses to water quality states is rather subjective and the perceptions of respondents in terms of which activities are suitable in certain water quality conditions is not always in line with the definition set in the hime ladder ultimately adjusting the ladder description to local conditions as for instance done by ref 41 may lead to a better fit of the wtp estimates in the local context but may lead to correspondence errors when aligning the quality indicators used in different studies to the levels of a common ladder yet the generic ladder by ref 39 is selected for the current study since it contains the use and non use indicators found in the different water quality descriptions of all considered studies cf table 1 thus it allows for a straightforward alignment of the water quality levels particularly when primary studies do not provide sufficient information to investigate the local conditions or the respondents perceptions in detail we then classify the different extents in water quality changes i e the change from the reference level to the level after the assumed improvement into two sets namely all and comparable changes in water quality while all describes the average tes of all bt applications between wtp estimates of any change in water quality within a given group g in eq 4 comparable is restricted to transfers between wtp estimates describing equal improvements from the same reference level in that way improvements from say poor to moderate are transferred to study sites with valued improvements of the same extent and with the same reference levels i e also poor to moderate furthermore and despite all selected studies valuing water quality the geophysical aspects of the analyses defined as the water body types and sizes differ we thus distinguish between three levels of similarity similar less similar and dissimilar while similar refers to alike water bodies e g transfers between two rivers less similar entails all surface waters e g transfers across rivers lakes and coastal waters whereas dissimilar imply transfers between surface water and groundwater this classification is illustrated in table 3 to reduce complexity and ensure sufficient quantities of bt applications per adjustment group river basins which also include lakes or fjords e g ref 47 are considered as rivers as studies do often not indicate the exact magnitude of the considered change or in different metrics such as km or ha we test the impact of the water body size on bt performance by distinguishing between larger and smaller sites respectively while a site is considered large when covering water bodies of an entire nation e g 76 78 coastal waters e g 36 77 or relatively large rivers of and above lengths of 60 km the study areas of small sites are defined as rivers or river stretches below 60 km e g 42 and lakes e g 70 and thus only representing a fraction of what respondents presumably care about in their country or region 7 7 the number is selected due to representing the median length of all rivers in the selected studies the impact of the water body size on bt performance is then tested based on restricting the assessment of the average tes to transfers between similar sized water bodies i e only transferring from large to large water bodies and from small to small water bodies which is referred to as area adjustment in the following alternatively all bt applications are also conducted between sites no area adjustment 3 2 the population similarity dimension due to mostly applying bt across countries which entails different socio economic characteristics of the affected populations we adjust the primary wtp estimates for inflation and purchasing power parities ppp and convert all values into euro 2017 cf table 1 for the adjustment explanation this holds for all wtp estimates transferred in the context of this study independent from the similarity dimension furthermore as economic theory predicts that an increase in income leads to increasing wtp we examine the impact of income on bt performance by drawing on and adjusting for the site specific average income of the study sample if available 8 8 studies often indicate income based on open ended intervals e g 5 of the considered population with an income of 100 000 year and above in such case the highest quantified number i e 100 000 is assumed to be the upper boundary which may however result in an underestimation of the average income the income of the study population is indicated in all studies except for 81 for the latter the average income of the respective region is used as indicated by the eu excluding the study in the analysis is not resulting in different conclusions following equation 2 consequently the results reflect the average tes of all bt applications with and without income adjustments due to relatively similar income distributions in the selected study countries the gini coefficients of the study countries range from 26 to 36 in the year of the conducted survey we do not adjust for income inequality in this study furthermore as all considered primary studies were conducted within a relatively narrow time frame of ten years 2005 2015 whereas 13 of the 17 selected studies were implemented within 5 years we do not consider potential temporal trends in terms of changing preferences which are reflected in changing wtp estimates as noted in section 2 2 the results in the literature testing the temporal stability of preferences are however ambiguous 3 3 the attribute similarity dimension another dimension which is explored in this paper consists of testing the impact of the survey descriptions of the ce attributes on bt performance despite its practical relevance for the wfd and achieving good ecological status we thereby draw on the ecosystem services es framework which allows considering both final i e the ones that directly provide values to people and thus influence their welfare and intermediary services like some of the indicators determining good ecological status therefore we examine the choice set attribute descriptions both water quality and the additional attributes based on what es they are assumed to provide or address we thereby draw on the classification system introduced by 88 which considers aquatic ecosystem services delivered by various kinds of water bodies and splits the es framework into three categories namely provisioning regulating and cultural services table 4 thus we define attribute similarity as whether or not the same ecosystem service categories are emphasised in the valuation studies consequently and in addition to the geophysical site characteristics of the first dimension this dimension investigates further aspects of the welfare dimension of water quality 28 in other words the biophysical and welfare components of the first and this dimension are both linked to the overall commodity and its associated impact on utility as both dimensions are interlinked we consider the dimensions not only separately but also in a combined manner to test if transferring attributes which incorporate similar benefits may reduce the resulting tes we compare the average tes of transfer applications of four different attribute description sets ads the first set adsw1a1 consists of studies in which both the water quality attribute w and the additional attributes a address or neglect the same es categories we expect the smallest te for this ads as the attributes are the most similar and therefore describe nonmarket goods with comparable welfare influencing qualities 28 the second set adsw1a0 includes studies with water quality attributes addressing the same but the additional attributes addressing dissimilar es categories the anticipation is that adsw1a0 would result in higher tes compared to adsw1a1 expecting that what is important at a given site differs adsw0a1 considers studies in which the additional attributes address the same es categories whereas the water quality attribute addresses dissimilar es categories we would expect tes to be larger here compared to adsw1a1 or adsw1a0 as the core attribute being valued is described differently in adsw0a0 both the water quality attribute and the additional attributes of all studies address dissimilar es categories table 5 9 9 the precise allocation of the addressed ecosystem services is provided in appendix a we thereby refer to the information the respondents of the ces are provided with i e the choice sets including the associated descriptions or given those are not included the study text describing the provided information in detail 4 results as we find mean and median tes to differ substantially in the following we have chosen to focus on the median as this measure is less sensitive to extreme observations by following the approach in ref 11 or whitehead et al 2015 we consider the samples as independent and test the statistical significance of tes by drawing on the mann whitney u test with p value 0 05 10 10 the p values of the significance test are provided in figs 1 3 in within the text where relevant the full details of the results both mean and median tes of all tests the mann whitney u test etc are provided in appendix b across the entire sample and based on all 4552 bts which are possible when not introducing any restriction from the three dimensions we find a median te of 69 this may serve as a benchmark for the following assessments within each of the three dimensions of similarity 4 1 the physical similarity dimension the results for this dimension confirm that bt performance may be improved by ensuring bio and geophysical similarity across the transferred commodities fig 1 illustrates that tes are lowest when transferring wtp estimates of comparable water quality improvements between similar water bodies we first look at how the similarity of the water body type and its size affect bt performance considering the transfers without area adjustment white boxplots in fig 1 with any all changes in water quality tes turn out lower when restricting transfers to wtp estimates of similar water bodies 66 compared to transfers between less similar 69 and dissimilar sites 76 the difference between the medians of transferring between similar and dissimilar sites is statistically significant p value 0 00 whereas no statistical significance can be observed between similar and less similar sites p value 0 07 considering the bt applications with area adjustments shaded boxplots in fig 1 the results indicate significantly lower tes 62 compared to taking any water body size into account p value 0 01 however while adjusting for the area of water bodies might intuitively be expected to reduce errors results are ambiguous while the tes for similar water bodies decline as expected adjusting for the water body size leads to considerable and statistically significant increases in tes for less similar water bodies 83 compared to 69 p value 0 00 if studies value similar types of water bodies the median error is significantly lower when also restricting the transfers to value estimates of comparable water quality improvements 58 compared to considering all changes in water quality p value 0 02 if additionally adjusting for the water body size the median te is the lowest of all in this dimension tested transfer applications 54 the difference in the medians with all these and without any adjustments is thereby statistically significant p value 0 00 cf figure 1 4 2 the population similarity dimension somewhat surprisingly adjusting wtp estimates for income does not appear to improve bt performance rather tes tend to increase fig 2 the differences between the medians with income adjustments compared to the respective alternatives without such adjustments are significant except when transferring between less similar water bodies this is in contrast to what has been found in the literature e g ref 24 when additionally adjusting for the area the median tes remain alike when transferring between similar water bodies and comparable improvements in water quality 81 yet further increase for less similar from 83 to 87 and dissimilar sites 80 88 all errors remain above the average errors of the unadjusted transfer alternatives 4 3 the attribute similarity dimension testing for the attribute similarity suggests that the way choice sets are designed and described may influence the performance of transferring single attributes fig 3 in the following for reasons of brevity we limit the comparison to the transfers showing the best performance i e the ones unadjusted for income furthermore we refer to the transfer of comparable water quality improvements between similar and for the purpose of comparison less similar water bodies this implies that both components of commodity similarity are considered in the following i e the biophysical covered in the physical similarity dimension and the welfare influencing aspects of water quality which are considered in the attribute similarity dimension cf 28 when transferring value estimates between similar water bodies restricting bt applications to similar attribute descriptions adsw1a1 suggests an increase in median te 67 compared to 58 without accounting for the attribute descriptions however the difference between the median tes is statistically insignificant and adsw1a1 consists of only 48 bt applications the results must thus be interpreted with caution yet looking at transfers of estimates from adjustment sets in which only the water quality attributes address the same es categories adsw1a0 we find a lower median te 54 which is however also not significantly different to the median te without considering the attribute descriptions interestingly if studies concern less similar water bodies restricting bt applications to similar descriptions of all attributes adsw1a1 improves the bt performance substantially more precisely the median te of adsw1a1 results in 58 compared to 70 when not considering the attribute similarity and the difference between both is statistically significant p value 0 02 restricting the transfer application to similar descriptions of the water quality attribute but dissimilar descriptions of the additional attributes adsw1a0 further decreases the te 55 which is among the lowest te of all in this study tested transfer applications between less similar water bodies again the difference in the median tes is significant p value 0 00 as expected restricting bts to the control groups in which only the additional adsw0a1 or none of all attributes adsw0a0 have similar descriptions results in larger median tes when transferring between less similar water bodies adsw0a1 results in a median te of 86 and adsw0a0 in a te of 69 while compared to the respective median te emerging when not considering the attribute description the first is significantly different the latter is not in contrast when transferring the respective values between similar water bodies the control groups do not result in a significant increase in tes these results suggest that when transferring values between less similar water bodies tes are significantly lower when the water quality attribute is described by the same ecosystem service categories whether or not the additional attributes are similar however when testing bt between similar water bodies considering similarities in the survey descriptions of the attributes appears to not necessarily improve bt performance 5 discussion and conclusion the proposed framework on how to assess and classify similarity in a structured manner contributes to the methodological improvement of practical bt by drawing on wtp estimates for water quality improvements in european water bodies which were measured by valuation studies applying ces we demonstrate that two out of the three introduced dimensions of similarity play an important role when aiming to improve bt performance while the biophysical and welfare related similarity of commodities i e including the geophysical site characteristics result in mostly significant lower tes income adjustments do not improve bt performance furthermore the results are of direct relevance for the economic assessments in the context of the wfd they disclose ranges of tes that can be expected when transferring water quality attributes under certain conditions they may thus serve as indications to be considered in the sensitivity analyses and interpretations of cbas dealing with the benefits of water quality improvements the findings demonstrate that tes may be reduced substantially by as far as possible transferring values describing commodities which similar physical characteristics i e comparable water quality changes in alike water body types with similar sizes as such the results are in line with the literature emphasising the importance of commodity and site similarity for valid bt 13 17 26 28 30 48 when setting the results of this study in the context of the average tes of other studies dealing with bt of water quality estimates in the european context we find ambiguous results for instance ref 17 transfer wtp estimates from surveys applying the hime ladder and being related to several studies utilised in this paper 11 11 namely the studies conducted in the aquamoney project though 17 transfer wtp estimates originating from contingent valuation studies whereas we focus on ces when looking at the average mean te when transferring between similar water bodies without area adjustments and comparable water quality changes which corresponds to the setting tested for in ref 17 this study generates a lower average te 95 compared to 121 for value transfers in ref 17 while we demonstrate that this te can be even further reduced by incorporating area adjustments down to a mean te of 82 17 reveal that tes of value transfers can be reduced substantially when restricting bt to countries with fairly similar socio economic characteristics te of 37 overall the median tes of this study depict comparable ranges as the mean tes reported in ref 24 85 though given our specific adjustments and considerations which are not directly transferable to related studies or goods direct comparisons remain speculative to ensure comparability of value estimates and despite potentially unconsidered measurement errors e g due to variations in local conditions and perceptions in context of water quality definitions and levels 41 42 47 73 the suggested approach of aligning the differently defined changes of water quality into a common framework i e the water quality ladder turns out to be an effective and easily applicable approach to increase bt performance still limitations remain first utilising the different water quality ladders ratings as reflecting the biophysical water quality is certainly a simplification which needs to be regarded when interpreting the results second selecting other water quality ladders or frameworks to adjust different good definitions may change and possibly improve bt performance while this is beyond the scope of this paper further research on such comparisons would generate valuable insights on the sensitivity of the results third changing the subjective definition of whether water bodies are considered as being small or large may affect the results more precisely shifting the assumed 60 km threshold to either 50 or 70 km leads to small changes in the average median transfer errors which however never exceed one percentage point in the present case the conclusions thus remain fairly unchanged while the tes for similar water bodies decline as expected adjusting for the water body size leads to significant increases in tes for less similar water bodies a possible explanation might be that when transferring across less similar water bodies the size aspect is not a main driver of differences for instance transferring from a lake to a river may already be associated with relatively large error due to the fact that it is two different types of water bodies and taking into account whether one is transferring from a small lake to a large river or from a large lake to a large river might not matter much we can only speculate as to why we actually find an increase in tes when adjusting for size one explanation might be that size differences between less similar water bodies correlate with other drivers of te adjusting for the size when transferring values between dissimilar water bodies has no significant effect on tes again a possible explanation could be that size differences correlate with other drivers of te contrary to most findings and recommendations in the literature cf 18 48 52 89 adjusting wtp estimates to the income of the respective population appears to have a negative impact on transfer performance altering the income elasticity does thereby not change the conclusions the income adjusted bt applications always result in higher tes in comparison to no income adjustments or naturally in the same te when assuming zero elasticity due to the theoretical foundation of income adjustments it may be that in the present case income could not fully account for the complex population characteristics and thus possesses limited explanatory power 84 90 moreover income differences may even correlate with for instance cultural differences and increase tes by pulling the adjustments in the adverse direction for instance additional determinants such as culture or attitude may be heterogeneous across sites 20 52 and wtp may vary across users and non users 50 furthermore wtp may not be robust over a longer time span 60 and dependent upon the availability of substitute goods as well as on the distance to and between the sites or the substitute goods 17 26 31 35 50 moreover recent studies find that income inequality within societies may affect the wtp for environmental goods 91 92 however we focus on key elements of water quality similarity which were provided by the majority of the studies and thus leave testing those aspects for further research while studies typically test bt performance based on identical ces in study and policy sites 27 30 the impact of the design of choice sets on transfer performance often remains unconsidered this study suggests that how the attributes of ces are described may influence the obtained tes and thus highlight the need to consider the impact of different survey descriptions when testing bt applications more precisely the results demonstrate that transferring values between less similar water bodies results in significantly lower tes when the water quality attribute is described by the same ecosystem service categories the results thus indicate that considering similar welfare influencing aspects in water quality attributes may offset dissimilarities in terms of the geophysical site characteristics given the need for a primary study at the policy sites to investigate whether or not the same ecosystem service categories are emphasised in the valuation studies this third dimension is particularly relevant for testing rather than applying bt still the results suggest that also bt practitioners should carefully consider the descriptions of the attributes in the study site and whether they are relevant in the policy site context for instance transferring an otherwise similar good value might lead to higher tes if an associated description e g swimming is not applicable at the policy site e g swimming is prohibited nevertheless and despite the statistical significance of these results studies meeting the definition of attribute similarity describe water quality largely by the same ecosystem services all studies refer at least to fishing provisioning service maintaining population and habitat regulating service and recreation cultural service whereas the descriptions do not seem to explicitly point to potential differences between water bodies while it seems possible that the results occur due to specified attributes encouraging respondents to mainly think of these so that the site becomes less important for the overall valuation drawing conclusions with the given number of bt applications and merely on the basis of addressed ecosystem service categories may not be sufficient for instance attribute descriptions referring to fishing may as well describe different fish species pointing to specific types of water bodies or even water quality conditions see e g ref 41 in conclusion our results confirm other studies in finding that commodity and site similarity i e the type and size of water bodies as well as the valued improvement in water quality are important parameters to consider when transferring values estimates the welfare influencing aspects of water quality namely the attribute similarity of ces thereby turns out to improve bt performance under certain conditions particularly when bt deals with less similar water bodies in contrast we find population similarity to matter less declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8682,excess nutrients have led to eutrophication of the chesapeake bay usa it has been suggested that oyster restoration can play an important role in achieving water quality goals in the bay an optimal control bioeconomic model is applied to the management of oysters in the chesapeake bay taking into account nutrient removal by the oysters optimal management of oyster harvests in the bay reduces the cost of attaining water quality goals by 4 6 relative to an open access fishery a naïve management optimization that maximizes discounted net revenues from oyster harvests but that does not take into account their nitrogen impacts performs almost as well as the fully optimal solution sensitivity analyses show that the optimal oyster harvest depends on the cost of reducing nitrogen loadings from point and nonpoint sources through best management practices further denitrification by living oysters is a much more important process than nutrient removal through harvest keywords bioeconomics bmp chesapeake bay nitrogen tmdl optimal control oysters 1 introduction environmental management that incorporates multiple objectives while promoting sustainability has gained recognition compared to single objective approaches economists have investigated the policy implications of potential positive spillovers from species management in different settings in management of fisheries ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm is an approach that integrates the complex ecological and socioeconomic linkages that exist in fisheries in order to predict the impacts of fishery management on the ecosystem and the impacts of ecosystem change on the fisheries and their users 1 unlike traditional fisheries management ebfm has the potential to achieve positive outcomes for marine ecosystems while promoting greater economic rents from fisheries 2 ebfm also has the potential to address negative unintended consequences of fishing rebalancing the structure and functions of ecosystems 3 the ebfm approach acknowledges the ecological links among species 4 5 the approach has been applied to the management of fish species with predation prey interactions as well as non use values 6 consider a situation where harvest of a prey species is valuable but the stock of a predator species provides non use values in such situations the management challenge is to balance exploitation and conservation 7 considered a more complex system that included more than one prey species and non use values associated with stock density of all species they investigate the implications of moving along a management continuum that ranges from single species management without accounting for non use values to multiple species management that include both trophic interactions and nonuse values in addition to considering trophic interactions ebfm can incorporate consideration of management actions on indicators of environmental quality 8 this paper addresses a specific application where the management of a fishery has implications for environmental quality oysters in the chesapeake bay the bay hereafter the bay has experienced reduced water quality due to cultural eutrophication from excess nutrient loadings 9 this has resulted in increased phytoplankton abundance decreased water clarity loss of submerged aquatic vegetation that serves as habitat for important benthic species like blue crab and recurring areas of hypoxia acknowledgement of water quality problems has resulted in efforts to reduce the loadings of nutrients into the bay from both point and nonpoint sources 10 12 in december 2010 the u s environmental protection agency established a target level of nutrient loadings for the bay called the total maximum daily load tmdl the tmdl specifies loadings limits of 185 9 million pounds for nitrogen 12 5 million pounds for phosphorus and 6 45 billion pounds for sediment per year which represent 25 24 and 20 reductions respectively compared to their recent levels 13 the goal is to reach these targets by 2025 with 60 of the reduction achieved by 2017 the primary means of achieving the goal is through adoption of so called best management practices bmps to reduce loadings at the source point source bmps aim at reducing pollution from industrial wastewater municipal wastewater treatment plants and stormwater systems 14 agricultural bmps are methods used by farmers to reduce soil and fertilizer runoff and to properly manage animal waste the five most cost effective agricultural nonpoint bmps in terms of amount of nitrogen and phosphorus removed per dollar spent are streamside buffers streamside fencing nutrient management plans continuous no till and cover crops 15 forest bmps include strategies aimed at reducing soil erosion from forested lands 15 oysters have been suggested as a supplementary option for addressing the bay s eutrophication problem 16 because they are filter feeders that remove nutrients in two ways first nutrients contained in the phytoplankton consumed by oysters become part of oysters shell and meat 1 1 this process is known as nitrogen or phosphorus assimilation 17 47 and are removed from the bay when the oysters are harvested reports indicate that 700 to 5500 pounds of total nitrogen are removed annually per million market sized oysters harvested 17 second oysters remove nutrients while still in the water by accelerating denitrification in sediments 18 oyster denitrification is more important in terms of the amount of nitrogen removed from the system than nitrogen assimilation and removal through harvest 18 19 however the stock of native oysters in the bay has declined dramatically from its historical levels due to overharvest disease and habitat loss 20 the objective of this paper is to investigate the potential contribution that oysters could make to achieving water quality goals for the bay if their abundance could be increased closer to historical levels it may be difficult to rebuild oyster stocks until some other stressors such as lack of suitable habit and disease are alleviated 17 however improvements in habitat and control of oyster disease are necessary but not sufficient conditions to rebuilding oyster stocks if the stock continues to be overharvested therefore management of the fishery in a way that rebuilds oyster stocks through harvest effort restrictions and eventually restores both higher oyster stocks and harvests could play a significant role towards the achievement of water quality goals in the bay we develop an optimal control bioeconomic model of oysters in the bay that takes into account the value of oyster harvests the cost of fishing effort and the removal of nitrogen from the bay through harvest and denitrification the model is based on one developed by 21 who explored optimal management of oyster stocks under different spatial management regimes as the model in the next section outlines rehabilitation of oyster stocks through limits on harvest effort can provide two types of social benefits 1 rehabilitated oyster stocks can provide sustained harvests that generate positive rents and 2 by removing nitrogen from the bay increased oyster stocks can contribute to meeting the tmdl target and reduce the amount of money that must be spent on bmps within the contributing basin results are obtained under two cases that differ in the assumed marginal cost of nitrogen removal through bmps we also perform a sensitivity analysis to examine the relative importance of denitrification versus nitrogen removal through harvest finally we assess the relative performance of a naïve management case where the regulatory agency manages the stock taking into consideration only the value of oyster harvests and ignoring the nutrient reduction service provided by the oysters in section 2 the bioeconomic model is described analytical optimality results are derived and interpreted in section 3 specific functional forms and parameter values used in simulations are described in section 4 section 5 presents simulation results and section 6 discusses their policy implication 2 a bioeconomic model of a bivalve fishery with nitrogen dynamics this section is organized into three subsections in the first the biology and economic decisions will be discussed the second subsection deals with nitrogen dynamics while the third presents the elements of the social objective function 2 1 biology and economic decisions in public oyster grounds the model developed here treats oysters in the bay as comprising one stock but is calibrated on a per unit area basis let o be the average oyster stock per unit area in the bay the actual density of oysters per unit area varies throughout the bay with some areas providing more suitable habitat than others the stock variable o measures the average number of market sized oysters per hectare in areas suitable for oyster production 2 2 the terms adult harvestable and market sized oyster will be used interchangeably here f o represents the growth of the stock accounting for somatic growth recruitment and natural mortality we assume continuous harvest and a schaefer production function 22 with q and e being the catchability coefficient and fishing effort per unit area respectively so that h q e o denotes harvest per unit area 3 3 the chesapeake bay has some areas set aside as reserves which are harvested infrequently and others set aside as sanctuaries which are never harvested our model simplifies by assuming all areas are continuously harvested the model also does not consider farmed oysters which represent a growing portion of total oyster harvest but use a small portion of the total bay area with this notation in place we can write the state equation for the stock per unit area as 1 o f o q e o it is conjectured that f o 0 for low stock densities and f o 0 for high stock densities for simplicity we assume that the stock s productivity is not affected by nitrogen levels in the bay in fact higher nitrogen levels could either enhance oyster productivity through increased availability of phytoplankton as a food source or decrease oyster productivity through harmful algal blooms or zones with depressed oxygen levels but the impact of nitrogen concentrations on oyster growth is less important than factors such as habitat and harvest 23 and parasite disease 24 watermen oyster harvesters are assumed to be price takers 4 4 the assumption of exogenous price is plausible 48 show that chesapeake bay harvest is small relative to other regions new england south atlantic middle atlantic and the gulf with p denoting oyster unit price the unit cost of effort v is assumed to be constant so that harvest rents per unit area are 2 π p q e o v e in the open access equilibrium e is set by harvesters at the level where rents are zero in the socially optimal solution e is a control variable set at all points in time by the management agency 2 2 nitrogen dynamics our analysis is for nitrogen but the methodology is applicable to other nutrients such as phosphorus let l be the loadings of the pollutant in the water body given the level of bmps and other pollution control actions already adopted for simplicity we ignore nitrogen recycling internal loading and focus only on elements of nitrogen dynamics that can be affected by management nitrogen loadings are reduced through bmp s by an amount r at a constant unit cost l r is the second control variable chosen by the management agency in simulations we explore how the optimal solution differs between two different levels of the unit cost l the assumption of constant unit cost of nitrogen abatement is admittedly unrealistic more generally abatement costs could follow some cost function c r because management agencies would tend to invest in the most cost effective bmps first before investing in less cost effective bmps we would expect c r 0 and c r 0 below after deriving analytical results for the simple model with constant unit costs of nitrogen reduction we consider how the results would differ if a more general cost model were used nitrogen levels can also be affected through oyster harvest h and denitrification the amount of the pollutant in one oysters shell and meat that is removed when that oyster is harvested is denoted by s for simplicity denitrification is taken to be a linear function of the stock with ρ being the constant denitrification rate per adult oyster in fact the rate of denitrification could vary with the level of n for example if higher n concentrations and resulting higher phytoplankton abundance lead to more rapid feeding by oysters d is the natural rate of decay of nitrogen through processes other than those associated with oysters again the rate of decay could be nonlinear though there is little guidance whether the decay rate would be higher or lower with higher levels of n with a being the total area suitable for oysters in the bay the nitrogen state equation can then be written as 3 n l r ρ a o s a h d n the parameters ρ and s constitute the ecological influence of the stock through nitrogen removal the initial condition for nitrogen in the system is n 0 n 0 2 3 the objective function the value of total harvest is given by p a q e o and total cost of effort is given by a v e the bay generates other social benefits recreation aesthetics nonuse values etc that depend on the nitrogen concentration we define u n as the benefit to the general public from reducing nitrogen concentration in the bay to levels below the current level it is conjectured that u n 0 for the relevant range of n 5 5 at very low levels of n additional reductions would cause harm to the bay but it is not anticipated that n will reach levels that are too clean efforts to reduce nitrogen through bmps come at a cost r l denoting the social welfare function by s w summing over all benefits and costs yields 4 s w 0 p a q e o u n r l a v e e δ t d t where δ is the discount rate we can now fully present the complete problem to be characterized and simulated this is given below max r e s w 0 p a q e o u n r l a v e e δ t d t o f o q e o t n l r ρ a o s a q e o d n t n 0 n 0 the optimal control problem contains two state variables oyster stock per acre o and nitrogen n and two control variables fishing effort per acre e and the amount of the pollutant removed through bmps r the model presented above is based on the same model developed by 21 in that paper the authors modeled four different oyster management regimes continuously harvested grounds intermittently harvested reserves sanctuaries that are never harvested and aquaculture on leased grounds and explored the optimal mix of those regimes their main finding was that optimally managed continuous harvesting was the first best way to manage oysters in the bay this paper takes a deeper look at that management system and asks two new research questions how large a contribution can oysters make to water quality goals and how does optimal oyster management change as the cost of bmps change the model used in this paper is then a simplified special case of the model from 21 that model incorporated impulsive optimal control with four control variables including the timing of reserve opening and seven state variables including the stock levels of two connected species oysters and blue crabs in order to focus on oyster management on continuously harvested grounds the current model includes only that management regime and includes oysters as the only modeled species specifically to narrow down that model to the one presented here we assumed no connection between the two species 6 6 in the model calibration from 21 we set the biodiversity spillover parameter from oysters to blue crabs ζ equal to zero so that there is no connection between the two species this made harvest effort for blue crabs as a control variable irrelevant for the purposes of this paper one could alternatively set the unit price of blue crabs pc equal to zero moreover and given the main objectives of this paper we modified the 21 model by making the entire bay area a available for continuous harvest by setting the amount of oyster grounds in sanctuaries reserves and aquaculture as ar and aa in 21 equal to zero 7 7 all parameter notations are from 21 that resulted in the continuous optimal control model presented above with two control and two state variables 3 analytical results the current value hamiltonian is h p a q e o u n r l a v e λ o f o q e o λ n l r ρ a o s a q e o d n with λ o and λ n being the shadow values or user costs of oyster stock and nitrogen respectively the first order condition for the amount of nitrogen reductions through bmps is 5 h r l λ n 0 λ n l λ n is a negative number that represents all future disutility in present value terms from a marginal increase in the nitrogen stock it follows from 5 that λ n 0 the adjoint equation for nitrogen yields λ n δ λ n h n δ λ n u n λ n d and because λ n 0 we obtain 6 λ n u n δ d l u n is negative and represents people s aggregate marginal willingness to pay wtp for reduced nitrogen expression 6 states that the user cost of nitrogen equals people s wtp for ambient nitrogen reductions accounting for the discount rate and the natural decay of the pollutant because r shows up linearly in the hamiltonian eq 5 states that r should be rapidly increased or decreased bang bang control so that at all points in time the shadow value of nitrogen is equal to the constant cost of removing it one important result of 6 is that if u n is not changing over time then u n will be constant which implies that the optimal n n will also be constant over time turning to fishing effort the first order condition is h e p a q o a v λ o q o λ n s a q o 0 e 0 p a q o a v λ o q o λ n s a q o e 0 7 p v q o s λ n λ o a as with nitrogen oyster management follows a bang bang solution whenever λ o a exceeds p v q o s λ n the stock should be expanded by ceasing all oyster harvest whenever p v q o s λ n λ o a fishing effort should be employed at the maximum rate that harvest capacity allows the process will continue until 8 p v q o s λ n λ o a the lhs of eq 8 is the immediate net benefit from harvesting one unit of stock i e one oyster including the marginal value of removing nitrogen through harvest the rhs of 8 is the current value of having an additional unit of oyster stock in situ per unit area the adjoint equation for the public oyster stock upon simplification becomes 9 λ o λ o δ f o o p a q e λ o q e λ n a ρ s a q e using 8 9 and the state equation for the stock and following the steps in 25 we obtain 10 δ f o v o p q o v s λ n q o f o q o ρ λ n p q o v s λ n q o expression 10 is the arbitrage condition that implicitly solves for o the singular solution for the oyster stock this expression is known as the fundamental equation of renewable resources 26 and implies that at all times the marginal net growth rate plus the marginal stock effect together known as the resource s internal rate of return should equal the discount factor in contrast to the standard expressions 25 the marginal stock effect here consists of two parts the first is the familiar marginal stock effect which is the marginal value of the stock v f o o relative to the marginal value of effort p q o v s λ n q o extended to capture the value of nitrogen removal through harvest s λ n the second new part of the marginal stock effect accounts for the marginal value of nitrogen removal through denitrification ρ λ n this new term is positive providing an additional incentive to leave more stock in the water compared to a situation where denitrification is ignored finally if a more general cost function for nitrogen abatement c r is used the analytical results change in the following ways at the long run equilibrium the solution will look very similar to that from the simple model eq 5 becomes h r c r λ n 0 λ n c r 5 the shadow value of nitrogen still equals the marginal cost of nitrogen abatement however the hamiltonian will no longer be a linear function of r so the solution will no longer exhibit a bang bang approach path instead the approach to the long run equilibrium will be smoother and slower because it is too costly to invest in very high levels of r during the approach a second reason why the approach to the long run equilibrium will tend to be slower than modeled here is to avoid stranding capital investments in bmps the bang bang approach path assumes that bmps can be turned on and off quickly actual bmps often required upfront capital investments that become stranded if the bmp is abandoned there is therefore a cost associated with overinvesting in bmps above the level that will be needed to maintain the long run equilibrium for these reasons the simulation results presented below will likely overstate somewhat the true social value of achieving the tmdl in the bay 4 model calibration in order to simulate the system a specific functional form for oyster dynamics needs to be chosen we assume that the stock grows logistically given by 11 f o r o o 1 o k o with r o and k o the oysters intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity respectively the logistic growth function is commonly used for example 27 but has limitations for example it does not explicitly model dynamics that are not density dependent such as mortality from stochastic events such as disease outbreaks or year to year variation in recruitment predation or mortality due to burial it also does not explicitly model enhancements in productivity from the presence of shell reefs 28 use a more detailed model that incorporates mortality due to sedimentation burial and impacts on productivity from the availability of shell reefs but it would be difficult to calibrate such a model on a bay wide scale u n captures all benefits from reductions in nitrogen in the bay including impacts on property values on commercial fisheries other than the oyster fishery on recreational activities including fishing swimming and boating as well as on nonuse values there is a considerable amount of literature estimating many of these benefits for the bay over the years and a comprehensive discussion of assumptions techniques results and limitations is presented in 29 they point out particular difficulties of the exercise especially mapping nitrogen reductions into observed environmental outcomes and accurately measuring nonuse values including stewardship altruistic bequest and existence values 30 fortunately because the optimal solution sets n n at all points in time we do not need to know the shape of u n for all values of n we only need to know u n at n further if we know n then we do not need to know u n to find the optimal solution for r and e it is assumed that the target for n n is known and was in fact the basis for setting the tmdl in the model simulations n is set equal to the equilibrium level of nitrogen that would occur in the bay according to eq 3 if net nitrogen loadings were equal to the tmdl target level of 185 9 million pounds per year in effect we assume that the us epa set the tmdl at the right level because u n and n do not appear in the optimality conditions this assumption will not affect the calculated optimal level of harvest effort we do however need to know the value of u n to calculate the value of the social welfare function 31 estimate the water quality benefits in the bay that resulted from the clean water act for the period 1972 1996 for the district of columbia and portions of maryland and virginia annual benefits for boating fishing and swimming range from 0 49 to 2 45 billion adjusted to 2011 dollars due to the limited geographic coverage of that study the fact that boating fishing and swimming constitute only a subset of the benefits from water quality improvements and the fact that the nutrient reductions valued in that study are smaller than those that would be obtained from attaining the tmdl target these estimates represent lower bounds on u n more recently 32 conducted a stated preference survey to measure the benefits of improvements in bay water quality 33 use their results to calculate a social value of achieving the bay tmdl of 1 88 billion per year adjusted to 2011 dollars we use that value as our estimate of u n but stress that it is based on only one study still because the optimal harvest effort level e and the optimal investment in bmps r do not depend on the magnitude of u n comparisons across scenarios are not sensitive to this value we assume that most of the nitrogen reductions r will be achieved through agricultural bmps which tend to deliver nutrient reductions at a much lower cost per pound than urban and point source bmps 34 35 lists five agricultural bmps with costs ranging from 1 50 to 22 per pound of nitrogen reduction with most less than 5 per pound 36 lists 26 agricultural bmps with costs per pound ranging from under 1 to over 44 per pound with most costing less than 10 per pound in contrast 35 reports costs per pound from urban and point source bmps ranging from 15 per pound to over 200 per pound and 34 list several urban stormwater bmps with costs as high as 600 per pound as a sensitivity analysis we use two estimates of l a low estimate 5 per pound and a high estimate 44 per pound to capture the range of costs among agricultural bmps numerical values for the rest of the parameters were obtained from published values from the literature calculations using different data sources and in some cases expert judgment details on the selection of parameter values are provided in an appendix from 21 table 1 summarizes all parameter values and their definitions we impose the initial condition that the oyster stock is at an open access equilibrium which occurs when equation 2 is set equal to zero and o v p q numerical simulations were conducted that followed optimality conditions 5 6 8 9 the state equations for oyster stock and nitrogen and the arbitrage condition 10 simulations are performed for 200 years with a time step of 0 1 years for each of the two assumed marginal costs of bmps two baseline simulations were performed one with open access harvest of oysters and one under optimally regulated fishing effort for each of the four cases the net present value npv of net oyster revenues bmp costs and u n were calculated and summed to generate estimates of discounted social welfare 5 simulation results fig 1 shows the growth function f o for oysters as well as various solution equilibria under open access the equilibrium oyster stock is 2400 oysters per acre and the annual harvest is 419 oysters per acre per year under open access revenues from harvest exactly equal cost of effort so that rents are zero under efficient regulation of fishing effort oyster harvest is immediately stopped until the oyster stock builds up to the singular solution with cheap bmps it takes 10 5 years to reach the singular solution which is a stock level of 10 345 oysters per acre generating an equilibrium annual harvest of 938 oysters per acre per year with expensive bmps oyster harvest is shut down for 17 5 years until oyster stocks reach the singular solution of 15 601 oysters per acre which allows an equilibrium harvest of 549 oysters per acre per year in subsequent years optimal oyster management requires larger stocks than the open access solution for two reasons first harvest rents are positive with higher oyster stocks but zero under open access second higher oyster stocks remove more nitrogen allowing cost savings on bmps when the cost of bmps is low oysters role in nitrogen removal is less important than when bmps are more expensive consequently the optimal singular solution with cheap bmps is at a lower stock level and higher harvest level than for expensive bmps note that the optimal management strategy involves complete shutdown of the oyster harvest for several years the model does not account for adjustment costs of such a radical change in oyster fishing effort a model that includes adjustment costs would tend to recommend a smaller decrease in effort that lasts longer table 2 summarizes the simulation results under each case with cheap bmps the present value of bmp costs under optimal effort is 27 9 billion dollars compared to 29 1 billion dollars under open access for a cost savings of 4 1 with expensive bmps the present value of bmp costs under regulated fishing effort is 240 5 billion dollars compared to 256 1 under open access a savings of 6 1 while the cost savings associated with increased nitrogen removal by oysters are small optimal oyster regulation also generates positive harvest rents harvest rents are higher with cheap bmps npv of 5 5 billion dollars than with expensive bmps 2 9 billion dollars reflecting the social choice to maintain oyster stocks at higher levels total social welfare includes the benefits associated with improved water quality in the bay because n is held equal to n at all times the discounted present value of social benefits measured by u n is the same under all scenarios under expensive bmps the total social welfare becomes negative suggesting that the discounted benefits from clean water do not justify the costs of attaining the tmdl target either through bmps alone or through bmps and restoration of oyster stocks however measurement of u n is difficult and our estimate is based only one study the true value of u n could easily be higher 8 8 with expensive bmps attaining the tmdl would generate a positive net benefit if u n exceeds 7 7 billion annually still it is important to remember that comparisons of total social value across scenarios are not sensitive to the value of u n next we performed sensitivity analyses to explore the relative importance of denitrification versus nitrogen removal through harvest various scenarios and results are presented in table 3 scenarios 1 and 2 have already been discussed table 2 but are included here for comparison purposes in scenario 3 oysters do not provide any nitrogen reduction services the optimal singular solution oyster stock is still higher than under open access to maximize discounted harvest rents but lower than under scenario 2 where oysters do provide nitrogen reduction services bmp costs are higher under scenario 3 than under scenario 1 because even with oyster stocks at the open access equilibrium the oyster stock provides some small nitrogen benefit in scenario 1 because oysters play no role in nitrogen dynamics in scenario 3 the cost of bmps does not affect the optimal management of oysters in scenario 4 oysters remove nitrogen through denitrification only in scenario 5 oysters remove nitrogen through harvest only comparing scenarios 2 3 4 and 5 shows that as nitrogen removal services are added the optimal oyster stock increases but that almost all of the nitrogen reduction benefit provided by oysters comes from denitrification nitrogen removal through harvest has an almost negligible contribution to the water quality goals still comparing scenario 5 to scenario 2 shows that when oyster harvest results in nitrogen removal there is an extra incentive to harvest oysters and the optimal equilibrium oyster stock size is lower next we considered a scenario where oysters provide nitrogen removal services but where the management agency is unaware of those services a situation we call naïve management in this case the management agency will manage oyster harvest to maximize discounted oyster harvest rents the optimal singular solution is therefore the same as under scenario 3 but now oysters remove nitrogen saving bmp costs with cheap bmps naïve management generates a cost of bmps that is 0 4 more than under optimal management even though naïve management ignores nitrogen rebuilding oyster stocks to improve harvests accomplishes almost all of the bmp cost savings that fully optimal management does with expensive bmps naïve management accomplishes less of the potential cost savings naïve management saves 2 5 of bmp costs as compared to 6 1 savings under fully optimal management we therefore see that the penalty of naïve management in terms of funds spent in bmps increases as the cost bmps increases next we examined whether it would be optimal to harvest oysters just for their ability to remove nitrogen ignoring harvest rents by setting oyster price equal to zero for both cheap and expensive bmps the optimal oyster singular stock was equal to the carrying capacity and oyster harvest was set to zero at all times suggesting that oyster harvest cannot be justified solely on the basis of nitrogen removal this results differs from that of 28 who found that even if the harvested oysters have no market value it is worth doing some level of harvest in order to stimulate oyster growth and nitrogen sequestration finally we explored whether it might be worth investing in reef construction in the bay in an attempt to accelerate oyster repopulation costs for reef construction range from 5000 8000 using dredged oyster shell up to 22 000 to 24 000 per acre using reef balls or recycled concrete 37 at a cost of 8000 per acre even if reef construction increased the initial oyster stock by a factor of four times and bmps were expensive the investment had a negative net present value 6 discussion and policy implications this paper contributes to the existing literature in that it quantifies the management related ecosystem benefits of oysters using a bioeconomic framework similar positive benefits or spillovers have been examined previously 38 analyzed the land conservation implications of listing a species as endangered 39 used a bioeconomic model of an endangered species but without attempting an explicit quantification similar to 5 6 our analysis incorporates non use values but here stemming from water quality environmental goals rather than from other marine species achievement of these goals usually provides multiple market and non market benefits that can be unrelated to the species under examination we find that optimal management of oysters in the bay reduces the cost of attaining the tmdl goal by between 4 1 and 6 1 depending on the cost of bmps our sensitivity analysis provided three further insights first denitrification is a much more important process than nitrogen removal through harvest this result is in line with previous studies 19 and laboratory experiments 18 and stresses the importance of better measuring the rate of denitrification from oysters 40 second even if the management agency ignores the nitrogen benefits provided by oysters but regulates the fishery to solve the open access problem society will enjoy most or almost all of the nitrogen removal benefits that would occur under fully optimal management lastly our results indicate that harvesting oysters solely to remove the nitrogen contained in their meat and shells cannot be justified on economic grounds our results show that oyster management can play a role in meeting water quality goals in the bay consistent with previous studies 17 it has been suggested that aquaculture of oysters be included in the implementation plans for the tmdl through the establishment of nutrient trading credits 19 our results suggest that this approach could be useful if the aquaculture operations increase the total number of oysters in the bay a challenge for a nutrient credit scheme would be the accurate measurement of the removed pollutant in aquaculture the nitrogen removal through harvest can be easily measured by the quantity of the harvested stock however the task becomes harder in quantifying the nitrogen removal through denitrification which our analysis shows is the more important process we now turn to the second implication of our results while the percent cost savings from optimal oyster management are similar with cheap bmps versus expensive bmps 4 1 versus 6 1 the absolute cost savings are much higher when bmps are expensive and the optimal singular solution oyster stock is considerably higher when bmps are expensive still the cost savings from optimal oyster management are relatively modest relative to the total cost of achieving the tmdl goal 41 42 question the potential water cleaning benefits from large oyster stocks in the bay 43 argue that for noticeable water related benefits to be seen the bay s oyster biomass must be increased 25 to 50 fold relative to current levels our simulation results are similar in that stocks close to the carrying capacity are still not large enough for a considerable increase in nitrogen removal with the associated bmps cost savings oysters can provide a part of the nutrient reduction solution but only a small part this paper has several caveats that must be discussed first the hamiltonian is linear in controls resulting is bang bang controls both for bmps and for oyster management the solution assumes that policy makers have both the resources and the ability to achieve the nitrogen reductions necessary to quickly meet tmdl goals second the model here focuses only on nitrogen it is relatively straightforward to extend the model to include other nutrients such as phosphorus however given that bmps typically affect loadings of both nutrients 44 we acknowledge that in reality it is hard to separate their management and implications third our model lacks nitrogen feedbacks on oysters although we acknowledge that nitrogen affects oysters it has been reported that the most important factors related to restoration and growth oysters in the bay other than harvest are a habitat b population size which determines recruitment 23 p 906 and c control of parasite disease 24 we therefore argue that nitrogen feedbacks on oysters are likely small if nitrogen did have an important impact on oyster productivity then the optimal levels of bmps would change slightly over time as oyster stocks change even if nitrogen feedbacks were non linear in addition our model assumes that nitrogen removal through harvest occurs only by removing living oysters we acknowledge that in reality some nutrients remain sequestered in the bodies of oyster predators and other scavengers fourth the model developed here is deterministic oyster dynamics can be highly stochastic in particular year to year variation in recruitment and disease outbreaks can have large unanticipated impacts on oyster stocks growth in oysters stocks after a reduction in harvest effort and consequently enhanced nutrient removal could occur more or less quickly than the model suggests fifth our use of a simple logistic oyster growth function follows standard practice for example 45 but does not capture sources of mortality that are especially relevant for oysters for example the logistic model does not capture oyster mortality due to sedimentation burial and disease and does not account for productivity changes due to shell reef construction such dynamics are modeled explicitly in 28 however their model was implemented at the scale of single oyster reef we acknowledge that our bay wide model necessarily will omit some aspects further our model ignores age structure dynamics 22 seasonality in the rate of nitrogen removal and trophic interactions of oysters with primary and secondary production that can be important in determining water quality effects 42 in addition it models only harvest by watermen from public grounds there are several other oyster management options to promote greater oyster biomass in the bay other than regulating fishing effort in public grounds these options include sanctuaries reserves and aquaculture 46 lastly the value chosen for u n is based on only one study we find that achieving the tmdl generates positive net benefits when nitrogen reductions through bmps can be done at low cost but negative net benefits when reductions are more costly that conclusion is sensitive to our assumed value of u n still efficiency comparisons among scenarios and our conclusions regarding the potential contribution of oysters to meeting water quality goals are not sensitive to u n 7 mathematical appendix differentiating 8 with respect to time and keeping in mind that λ n 0 yields λ o a v o q o 2 given the state equation o f o q e o we get

8682,excess nutrients have led to eutrophication of the chesapeake bay usa it has been suggested that oyster restoration can play an important role in achieving water quality goals in the bay an optimal control bioeconomic model is applied to the management of oysters in the chesapeake bay taking into account nutrient removal by the oysters optimal management of oyster harvests in the bay reduces the cost of attaining water quality goals by 4 6 relative to an open access fishery a naïve management optimization that maximizes discounted net revenues from oyster harvests but that does not take into account their nitrogen impacts performs almost as well as the fully optimal solution sensitivity analyses show that the optimal oyster harvest depends on the cost of reducing nitrogen

bioeconomics bmp chesapeake bay nitrogen tmdl optimal control oysters 1 introduction environmental management that incorporates multiple objectives while promoting sustainability has gained recognition compared to single objective approaches economists have investigated the policy implications of potential positive spillovers from species management in different settings in management of fisheries ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm is an approach that integrates the complex ecological and socioeconomic linkages that exist in fisheries in order to predict the impacts of fishery management on the ecosystem and the impacts of ecosystem change on the fisheries and their users 1 unlike traditional fisheries management ebfm has the potential to achieve positive outcomes for marine ecosystems while promoting greater economic rents from fisheries 2 ebfm also has the potential to address negative unintended consequences of fishing rebalancing the structure and functions of ecosystems 3 the ebfm approach acknowledges the ecological links among species 4 5 the approach has been applied to the management of fish species with predation prey interactions as well as non use values 6 consider a situation where harvest of a prey species is valuable but the stock of a predator species provides non use values in such situations the management challenge is to balance exploitation and conservation 7 considered a more complex system that included more than one prey species and non use values associated with stock density of all species they investigate the implications of moving along a management continuum that ranges from single species management without accounting for non use values to multiple species management that include both trophic interactions and nonuse values in addition to considering trophic interactions ebfm can incorporate consideration of management actions on indicators of environmental quality 8 this paper addresses a specific application where the management of a fishery has implications for environmental quality oysters in the chesapeake bay the bay hereafter the bay has experienced reduced water quality due to cultural eutrophication from excess nutrient loadings 9 this has resulted in increased phytoplankton abundance decreased water clarity loss of submerged aquatic vegetation that serves as habitat for important benthic species like blue crab and recurring areas of hypoxia acknowledgement of water quality problems has resulted in efforts to reduce the loadings of nutrients into the bay from both point and nonpoint sources 10 12 in december 2010 the u s environmental protection agency established a target level of nutrient loadings for the bay called the total maximum daily load tmdl the tmdl specifies loadings limits of 185 9 million pounds for nitrogen 12 5 million pounds for phosphorus and 6 45 billion pounds for sediment per year which represent 25 24 and 20 reductions respectively compared to their recent levels 13 the goal is to reach these targets by 2025 with 60 of the reduction achieved by 2017 the primary means of achieving the goal is through adoption of so called best management practices bmps to reduce loadings at the source point source bmps aim at reducing pollution from industrial wastewater municipal wastewater treatment plants and stormwater systems 14 agricultural bmps are methods used by farmers to reduce soil and fertilizer runoff and to properly manage animal waste the five most cost effective agricultural nonpoint bmps in terms of amount of nitrogen and phosphorus removed per dollar spent are streamside buffers streamside fencing nutrient management plans continuous no till and cover crops 15 forest bmps include strategies aimed at reducing soil erosion from forested lands 15 oysters have been suggested as a supplementary option for addressing the bay s eutrophication problem 16 because they are filter feeders that remove nutrients in two ways first nutrients contained in the phytoplankton consumed by oysters become part of oysters shell and meat 1 1 this process is known as nitrogen or phosphorus assimilation 17 47 and are removed from the bay when the oysters are harvested reports indicate that 700 to 5500 pounds of total nitrogen are removed annually per million market sized oysters harvested 17 second oysters remove nutrients while still in the water by accelerating denitrification in sediments 18 oyster denitrification is more important in terms of the amount of nitrogen removed from the system than nitrogen assimilation and removal through harvest 18 19 however the stock of native oysters in the bay has declined dramatically from its historical levels due to overharvest disease and habitat loss 20 the objective of this paper is to investigate the potential contribution that oysters could make to achieving water quality goals for the bay if their abundance could be increased closer to historical levels it may be difficult to rebuild oyster stocks until some other stressors such as lack of suitable habit and disease are alleviated 17 however improvements in habitat and control of oyster disease are necessary but not sufficient conditions to rebuilding oyster stocks if the stock continues to be overharvested therefore management of the fishery in a way that rebuilds oyster stocks through harvest effort restrictions and eventually restores both higher oyster stocks and harvests could play a significant role towards the achievement of water quality goals in the bay we develop an optimal control bioeconomic model of oysters in the bay that takes into account the value of oyster harvests the cost of fishing effort and the removal of nitrogen from the bay through harvest and denitrification the model is based on one developed by 21 who explored optimal management of oyster stocks under different spatial management regimes as the model in the next section outlines rehabilitation of oyster stocks through limits on harvest effort can provide two types of social benefits 1 rehabilitated oyster stocks can provide sustained harvests that generate positive rents and 2 by removing nitrogen from the bay increased oyster stocks can contribute to meeting the tmdl target and reduce the amount of money that must be spent on bmps within the contributing basin results are obtained under two cases that differ in the assumed marginal cost of nitrogen removal through bmps we also perform a sensitivity analysis to examine the relative importance of denitrification versus nitrogen removal through harvest finally we assess the relative performance of a naïve management case where the regulatory agency manages the stock taking into consideration only the value of oyster harvests and ignoring the nutrient reduction service provided by the oysters in section 2 the bioeconomic model is described analytical optimality results are derived and interpreted in section 3 specific functional forms and parameter values used in simulations are described in section 4 section 5 presents simulation results and section 6 discusses their policy implication 2 a bioeconomic model of a bivalve fishery with nitrogen dynamics this section is organized into three subsections in the first the biology and economic decisions will be discussed the second subsection deals with nitrogen dynamics while the third presents the elements of the social objective function 2 1 biology and economic decisions in public oyster grounds the model developed here treats oysters in the bay as comprising one stock but is calibrated on a per unit area basis let o be the average oyster stock per unit area in the bay the actual density of oysters per unit area varies throughout the bay with some areas providing more suitable habitat than others the stock variable o measures the average number of market sized oysters per hectare in areas suitable for oyster production 2 2 the terms adult harvestable and market sized oyster will be used interchangeably here f o represents the growth of the stock accounting for somatic growth recruitment and natural mortality we assume continuous harvest and a schaefer production function 22 with q and e being the catchability coefficient and fishing effort per unit area respectively so that h q e o denotes harvest per unit area 3 3 the chesapeake bay has some areas set aside as reserves which are harvested infrequently and others set aside as sanctuaries which are never harvested our model simplifies by assuming all areas are continuously harvested the model also does not consider farmed oysters which represent a growing portion of total oyster harvest but use a small portion of the total bay area with this notation in place we can write the state equation for the stock per unit area as 1 o f o q e o it is conjectured that f o 0 for low stock densities and f o 0 for high stock densities for simplicity we assume that the stock s productivity is not affected by nitrogen levels in the bay in fact higher nitrogen levels could either enhance oyster productivity through increased availability of phytoplankton as a food source or decrease oyster productivity through harmful algal blooms or zones with depressed oxygen levels but the impact of nitrogen concentrations on oyster growth is less important than factors such as habitat and harvest 23 and parasite disease 24 watermen oyster harvesters are assumed to be price takers 4 4 the assumption of exogenous price is plausible 48 show that chesapeake bay harvest is small relative to other regions new england south atlantic middle atlantic and the gulf with p denoting oyster unit price the unit cost of effort v is assumed to be constant so that harvest rents per unit area are 2 π p q e o v e in the open access equilibrium e is set by harvesters at the level where rents are zero in the socially optimal solution e is a control variable set at all points in time by the management agency 2 2 nitrogen dynamics our analysis is for nitrogen but the methodology is applicable to other nutrients such as phosphorus let l be the loadings of the pollutant in the water body given the level of bmps and other pollution control actions already adopted for simplicity we ignore nitrogen recycling internal loading and focus only on elements of nitrogen dynamics that can be affected by management nitrogen loadings are reduced through bmp s by an amount r at a constant unit cost l r is the second control variable chosen by the management agency in simulations we explore how the optimal solution differs between two different levels of the unit cost l the assumption of constant unit cost of nitrogen abatement is admittedly unrealistic more generally abatement costs could follow some cost function c r because management agencies would tend to invest in the most cost effective bmps first before investing in less cost effective bmps we would expect c r 0 and c r 0 below after deriving analytical results for the simple model with constant unit costs of nitrogen reduction we consider how the results would differ if a more general cost model were used nitrogen levels can also be affected through oyster harvest h and denitrification the amount of the pollutant in one oysters shell and meat that is removed when that oyster is harvested is denoted by s for simplicity denitrification is taken to be a linear function of the stock with ρ being the constant denitrification rate per adult oyster in fact the rate of denitrification could vary with the level of n for example if higher n concentrations and resulting higher phytoplankton abundance lead to more rapid feeding by oysters d is the natural rate of decay of nitrogen through processes other than those associated with oysters again the rate of decay could be nonlinear though there is little guidance whether the decay rate would be higher or lower with higher levels of n with a being the total area suitable for oysters in the bay the nitrogen state equation can then be written as 3 n l r ρ a o s a h d n the parameters ρ and s constitute the ecological influence of the stock through nitrogen removal the initial condition for nitrogen in the system is n 0 n 0 2 3 the objective function the value of total harvest is given by p a q e o and total cost of effort is given by a v e the bay generates other social benefits recreation aesthetics nonuse values etc that depend on the nitrogen concentration we define u n as the benefit to the general public from reducing nitrogen concentration in the bay to levels below the current level it is conjectured that u n 0 for the relevant range of n 5 5 at very low levels of n additional reductions would cause harm to the bay but it is not anticipated that n will reach levels that are too clean efforts to reduce nitrogen through bmps come at a cost r l denoting the social welfare function by s w summing over all benefits and costs yields 4 s w 0 p a q e o u n r l a v e e δ t d t where δ is the discount rate we can now fully present the complete problem to be characterized and simulated this is given below max r e s w 0 p a q e o u n r l a v e e δ t d t o f o q e o t n l r ρ a o s a q e o d n t n 0 n 0 the optimal control problem contains two state variables oyster stock per acre o and nitrogen n and two control variables fishing effort per acre e and the amount of the pollutant removed through bmps r the model presented above is based on the same model developed by 21 in that paper the authors modeled four different oyster management regimes continuously harvested grounds intermittently harvested reserves sanctuaries that are never harvested and aquaculture on leased grounds and explored the optimal mix of those regimes their main finding was that optimally managed continuous harvesting was the first best way to manage oysters in the bay this paper takes a deeper look at that management system and asks two new research questions how large a contribution can oysters make to water quality goals and how does optimal oyster management change as the cost of bmps change the model used in this paper is then a simplified special case of the model from 21 that model incorporated impulsive optimal control with four control variables including the timing of reserve opening and seven state variables including the stock levels of two connected species oysters and blue crabs in order to focus on oyster management on continuously harvested grounds the current model includes only that management regime and includes oysters as the only modeled species specifically to narrow down that model to the one presented here we assumed no connection between the two species 6 6 in the model calibration from 21 we set the biodiversity spillover parameter from oysters to blue crabs ζ equal to zero so that there is no connection between the two species this made harvest effort for blue crabs as a control variable irrelevant for the purposes of this paper one could alternatively set the unit price of blue crabs pc equal to zero moreover and given the main objectives of this paper we modified the 21 model by making the entire bay area a available for continuous harvest by setting the amount of oyster grounds in sanctuaries reserves and aquaculture as ar and aa in 21 equal to zero 7 7 all parameter notations are from 21 that resulted in the continuous optimal control model presented above with two control and two state variables 3 analytical results the current value hamiltonian is h p a q e o u n r l a v e λ o f o q e o λ n l r ρ a o s a q e o d n with λ o and λ n being the shadow values or user costs of oyster stock and nitrogen respectively the first order condition for the amount of nitrogen reductions through bmps is 5 h r l λ n 0 λ n l λ n is a negative number that represents all future disutility in present value terms from a marginal increase in the nitrogen stock it follows from 5 that λ n 0 the adjoint equation for nitrogen yields λ n δ λ n h n δ λ n u n λ n d and because λ n 0 we obtain 6 λ n u n δ d l u n is negative and represents people s aggregate marginal willingness to pay wtp for reduced nitrogen expression 6 states that the user cost of nitrogen equals people s wtp for ambient nitrogen reductions accounting for the discount rate and the natural decay of the pollutant because r shows up linearly in the hamiltonian eq 5 states that r should be rapidly increased or decreased bang bang control so that at all points in time the shadow value of nitrogen is equal to the constant cost of removing it one important result of 6 is that if u n is not changing over time then u n will be constant which implies that the optimal n n will also be constant over time turning to fishing effort the first order condition is h e p a q o a v λ o q o λ n s a q o 0 e 0 p a q o a v λ o q o λ n s a q o e 0 7 p v q o s λ n λ o a as with nitrogen oyster management follows a bang bang solution whenever λ o a exceeds p v q o s λ n the stock should be expanded by ceasing all oyster harvest whenever p v q o s λ n λ o a fishing effort should be employed at the maximum rate that harvest capacity allows the process will continue until 8 p v q o s λ n λ o a the lhs of eq 8 is the immediate net benefit from harvesting one unit of stock i e one oyster including the marginal value of removing nitrogen through harvest the rhs of 8 is the current value of having an additional unit of oyster stock in situ per unit area the adjoint equation for the public oyster stock upon simplification becomes 9 λ o λ o δ f o o p a q e λ o q e λ n a ρ s a q e using 8 9 and the state equation for the stock and following the steps in 25 we obtain 10 δ f o v o p q o v s λ n q o f o q o ρ λ n p q o v s λ n q o expression 10 is the arbitrage condition that implicitly solves for o the singular solution for the oyster stock this expression is known as the fundamental equation of renewable resources 26 and implies that at all times the marginal net growth rate plus the marginal stock effect together known as the resource s internal rate of return should equal the discount factor in contrast to the standard expressions 25 the marginal stock effect here consists of two parts the first is the familiar marginal stock effect which is the marginal value of the stock v f o o relative to the marginal value of effort p q o v s λ n q o extended to capture the value of nitrogen removal through harvest s λ n the second new part of the marginal stock effect accounts for the marginal value of nitrogen removal through denitrification ρ λ n this new term is positive providing an additional incentive to leave more stock in the water compared to a situation where denitrification is ignored finally if a more general cost function for nitrogen abatement c r is used the analytical results change in the following ways at the long run equilibrium the solution will look very similar to that from the simple model eq 5 becomes h r c r λ n 0 λ n c r 5 the shadow value of nitrogen still equals the marginal cost of nitrogen abatement however the hamiltonian will no longer be a linear function of r so the solution will no longer exhibit a bang bang approach path instead the approach to the long run equilibrium will be smoother and slower because it is too costly to invest in very high levels of r during the approach a second reason why the approach to the long run equilibrium will tend to be slower than modeled here is to avoid stranding capital investments in bmps the bang bang approach path assumes that bmps can be turned on and off quickly actual bmps often required upfront capital investments that become stranded if the bmp is abandoned there is therefore a cost associated with overinvesting in bmps above the level that will be needed to maintain the long run equilibrium for these reasons the simulation results presented below will likely overstate somewhat the true social value of achieving the tmdl in the bay 4 model calibration in order to simulate the system a specific functional form for oyster dynamics needs to be chosen we assume that the stock grows logistically given by 11 f o r o o 1 o k o with r o and k o the oysters intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity respectively the logistic growth function is commonly used for example 27 but has limitations for example it does not explicitly model dynamics that are not density dependent such as mortality from stochastic events such as disease outbreaks or year to year variation in recruitment predation or mortality due to burial it also does not explicitly model enhancements in productivity from the presence of shell reefs 28 use a more detailed model that incorporates mortality due to sedimentation burial and impacts on productivity from the availability of shell reefs but it would be difficult to calibrate such a model on a bay wide scale u n captures all benefits from reductions in nitrogen in the bay including impacts on property values on commercial fisheries other than the oyster fishery on recreational activities including fishing swimming and boating as well as on nonuse values there is a considerable amount of literature estimating many of these benefits for the bay over the years and a comprehensive discussion of assumptions techniques results and limitations is presented in 29 they point out particular difficulties of the exercise especially mapping nitrogen reductions into observed environmental outcomes and accurately measuring nonuse values including stewardship altruistic bequest and existence values 30 fortunately because the optimal solution sets n n at all points in time we do not need to know the shape of u n for all values of n we only need to know u n at n further if we know n then we do not need to know u n to find the optimal solution for r and e it is assumed that the target for n n is known and was in fact the basis for setting the tmdl in the model simulations n is set equal to the equilibrium level of nitrogen that would occur in the bay according to eq 3 if net nitrogen loadings were equal to the tmdl target level of 185 9 million pounds per year in effect we assume that the us epa set the tmdl at the right level because u n and n do not appear in the optimality conditions this assumption will not affect the calculated optimal level of harvest effort we do however need to know the value of u n to calculate the value of the social welfare function 31 estimate the water quality benefits in the bay that resulted from the clean water act for the period 1972 1996 for the district of columbia and portions of maryland and virginia annual benefits for boating fishing and swimming range from 0 49 to 2 45 billion adjusted to 2011 dollars due to the limited geographic coverage of that study the fact that boating fishing and swimming constitute only a subset of the benefits from water quality improvements and the fact that the nutrient reductions valued in that study are smaller than those that would be obtained from attaining the tmdl target these estimates represent lower bounds on u n more recently 32 conducted a stated preference survey to measure the benefits of improvements in bay water quality 33 use their results to calculate a social value of achieving the bay tmdl of 1 88 billion per year adjusted to 2011 dollars we use that value as our estimate of u n but stress that it is based on only one study still because the optimal harvest effort level e and the optimal investment in bmps r do not depend on the magnitude of u n comparisons across scenarios are not sensitive to this value we assume that most of the nitrogen reductions r will be achieved through agricultural bmps which tend to deliver nutrient reductions at a much lower cost per pound than urban and point source bmps 34 35 lists five agricultural bmps with costs ranging from 1 50 to 22 per pound of nitrogen reduction with most less than 5 per pound 36 lists 26 agricultural bmps with costs per pound ranging from under 1 to over 44 per pound with most costing less than 10 per pound in contrast 35 reports costs per pound from urban and point source bmps ranging from 15 per pound to over 200 per pound and 34 list several urban stormwater bmps with costs as high as 600 per pound as a sensitivity analysis we use two estimates of l a low estimate 5 per pound and a high estimate 44 per pound to capture the range of costs among agricultural bmps numerical values for the rest of the parameters were obtained from published values from the literature calculations using different data sources and in some cases expert judgment details on the selection of parameter values are provided in an appendix from 21 table 1 summarizes all parameter values and their definitions we impose the initial condition that the oyster stock is at an open access equilibrium which occurs when equation 2 is set equal to zero and o v p q numerical simulations were conducted that followed optimality conditions 5 6 8 9 the state equations for oyster stock and nitrogen and the arbitrage condition 10 simulations are performed for 200 years with a time step of 0 1 years for each of the two assumed marginal costs of bmps two baseline simulations were performed one with open access harvest of oysters and one under optimally regulated fishing effort for each of the four cases the net present value npv of net oyster revenues bmp costs and u n were calculated and summed to generate estimates of discounted social welfare 5 simulation results fig 1 shows the growth function f o for oysters as well as various solution equilibria under open access the equilibrium oyster stock is 2400 oysters per acre and the annual harvest is 419 oysters per acre per year under open access revenues from harvest exactly equal cost of effort so that rents are zero under efficient regulation of fishing effort oyster harvest is immediately stopped until the oyster stock builds up to the singular solution with cheap bmps it takes 10 5 years to reach the singular solution which is a stock level of 10 345 oysters per acre generating an equilibrium annual harvest of 938 oysters per acre per year with expensive bmps oyster harvest is shut down for 17 5 years until oyster stocks reach the singular solution of 15 601 oysters per acre which allows an equilibrium harvest of 549 oysters per acre per year in subsequent years optimal oyster management requires larger stocks than the open access solution for two reasons first harvest rents are positive with higher oyster stocks but zero under open access second higher oyster stocks remove more nitrogen allowing cost savings on bmps when the cost of bmps is low oysters role in nitrogen removal is less important than when bmps are more expensive consequently the optimal singular solution with cheap bmps is at a lower stock level and higher harvest level than for expensive bmps note that the optimal management strategy involves complete shutdown of the oyster harvest for several years the model does not account for adjustment costs of such a radical change in oyster fishing effort a model that includes adjustment costs would tend to recommend a smaller decrease in effort that lasts longer table 2 summarizes the simulation results under each case with cheap bmps the present value of bmp costs under optimal effort is 27 9 billion dollars compared to 29 1 billion dollars under open access for a cost savings of 4 1 with expensive bmps the present value of bmp costs under regulated fishing effort is 240 5 billion dollars compared to 256 1 under open access a savings of 6 1 while the cost savings associated with increased nitrogen removal by oysters are small optimal oyster regulation also generates positive harvest rents harvest rents are higher with cheap bmps npv of 5 5 billion dollars than with expensive bmps 2 9 billion dollars reflecting the social choice to maintain oyster stocks at higher levels total social welfare includes the benefits associated with improved water quality in the bay because n is held equal to n at all times the discounted present value of social benefits measured by u n is the same under all scenarios under expensive bmps the total social welfare becomes negative suggesting that the discounted benefits from clean water do not justify the costs of attaining the tmdl target either through bmps alone or through bmps and restoration of oyster stocks however measurement of u n is difficult and our estimate is based only one study the true value of u n could easily be higher 8 8 with expensive bmps attaining the tmdl would generate a positive net benefit if u n exceeds 7 7 billion annually still it is important to remember that comparisons of total social value across scenarios are not sensitive to the value of u n next we performed sensitivity analyses to explore the relative importance of denitrification versus nitrogen removal through harvest various scenarios and results are presented in table 3 scenarios 1 and 2 have already been discussed table 2 but are included here for comparison purposes in scenario 3 oysters do not provide any nitrogen reduction services the optimal singular solution oyster stock is still higher than under open access to maximize discounted harvest rents but lower than under scenario 2 where oysters do provide nitrogen reduction services bmp costs are higher under scenario 3 than under scenario 1 because even with oyster stocks at the open access equilibrium the oyster stock provides some small nitrogen benefit in scenario 1 because oysters play no role in nitrogen dynamics in scenario 3 the cost of bmps does not affect the optimal management of oysters in scenario 4 oysters remove nitrogen through denitrification only in scenario 5 oysters remove nitrogen through harvest only comparing scenarios 2 3 4 and 5 shows that as nitrogen removal services are added the optimal oyster stock increases but that almost all of the nitrogen reduction benefit provided by oysters comes from denitrification nitrogen removal through harvest has an almost negligible contribution to the water quality goals still comparing scenario 5 to scenario 2 shows that when oyster harvest results in nitrogen removal there is an extra incentive to harvest oysters and the optimal equilibrium oyster stock size is lower next we considered a scenario where oysters provide nitrogen removal services but where the management agency is unaware of those services a situation we call naïve management in this case the management agency will manage oyster harvest to maximize discounted oyster harvest rents the optimal singular solution is therefore the same as under scenario 3 but now oysters remove nitrogen saving bmp costs with cheap bmps naïve management generates a cost of bmps that is 0 4 more than under optimal management even though naïve management ignores nitrogen rebuilding oyster stocks to improve harvests accomplishes almost all of the bmp cost savings that fully optimal management does with expensive bmps naïve management accomplishes less of the potential cost savings naïve management saves 2 5 of bmp costs as compared to 6 1 savings under fully optimal management we therefore see that the penalty of naïve management in terms of funds spent in bmps increases as the cost bmps increases next we examined whether it would be optimal to harvest oysters just for their ability to remove nitrogen ignoring harvest rents by setting oyster price equal to zero for both cheap and expensive bmps the optimal oyster singular stock was equal to the carrying capacity and oyster harvest was set to zero at all times suggesting that oyster harvest cannot be justified solely on the basis of nitrogen removal this results differs from that of 28 who found that even if the harvested oysters have no market value it is worth doing some level of harvest in order to stimulate oyster growth and nitrogen sequestration finally we explored whether it might be worth investing in reef construction in the bay in an attempt to accelerate oyster repopulation costs for reef construction range from 5000 8000 using dredged oyster shell up to 22 000 to 24 000 per acre using reef balls or recycled concrete 37 at a cost of 8000 per acre even if reef construction increased the initial oyster stock by a factor of four times and bmps were expensive the investment had a negative net present value 6 discussion and policy implications this paper contributes to the existing literature in that it quantifies the management related ecosystem benefits of oysters using a bioeconomic framework similar positive benefits or spillovers have been examined previously 38 analyzed the land conservation implications of listing a species as endangered 39 used a bioeconomic model of an endangered species but without attempting an explicit quantification similar to 5 6 our analysis incorporates non use values but here stemming from water quality environmental goals rather than from other marine species achievement of these goals usually provides multiple market and non market benefits that can be unrelated to the species under examination we find that optimal management of oysters in the bay reduces the cost of attaining the tmdl goal by between 4 1 and 6 1 depending on the cost of bmps our sensitivity analysis provided three further insights first denitrification is a much more important process than nitrogen removal through harvest this result is in line with previous studies 19 and laboratory experiments 18 and stresses the importance of better measuring the rate of denitrification from oysters 40 second even if the management agency ignores the nitrogen benefits provided by oysters but regulates the fishery to solve the open access problem society will enjoy most or almost all of the nitrogen removal benefits that would occur under fully optimal management lastly our results indicate that harvesting oysters solely to remove the nitrogen contained in their meat and shells cannot be justified on economic grounds our results show that oyster management can play a role in meeting water quality goals in the bay consistent with previous studies 17 it has been suggested that aquaculture of oysters be included in the implementation plans for the tmdl through the establishment of nutrient trading credits 19 our results suggest that this approach could be useful if the aquaculture operations increase the total number of oysters in the bay a challenge for a nutrient credit scheme would be the accurate measurement of the removed pollutant in aquaculture the nitrogen removal through harvest can be easily measured by the quantity of the harvested stock however the task becomes harder in quantifying the nitrogen removal through denitrification which our analysis shows is the more important process we now turn to the second implication of our results while the percent cost savings from optimal oyster management are similar with cheap bmps versus expensive bmps 4 1 versus 6 1 the absolute cost savings are much higher when bmps are expensive and the optimal singular solution oyster stock is considerably higher when bmps are expensive still the cost savings from optimal oyster management are relatively modest relative to the total cost of achieving the tmdl goal 41 42 question the potential water cleaning benefits from large oyster stocks in the bay 43 argue that for noticeable water related benefits to be seen the bay s oyster biomass must be increased 25 to 50 fold relative to current levels our simulation results are similar in that stocks close to the carrying capacity are still not large enough for a considerable increase in nitrogen removal with the associated bmps cost savings oysters can provide a part of the nutrient reduction solution but only a small part this paper has several caveats that must be discussed first the hamiltonian is linear in controls resulting is bang bang controls both for bmps and for oyster management the solution assumes that policy makers have both the resources and the ability to achieve the nitrogen reductions necessary to quickly meet tmdl goals second the model here focuses only on nitrogen it is relatively straightforward to extend the model to include other nutrients such as phosphorus however given that bmps typically affect loadings of both nutrients 44 we acknowledge that in reality it is hard to separate their management and implications third our model lacks nitrogen feedbacks on oysters although we acknowledge that nitrogen affects oysters it has been reported that the most important factors related to restoration and growth oysters in the bay other than harvest are a habitat b population size which determines recruitment 23 p 906 and c control of parasite disease 24 we therefore argue that nitrogen feedbacks on oysters are likely small if nitrogen did have an important impact on oyster productivity then the optimal levels of bmps would change slightly over time as oyster stocks change even if nitrogen feedbacks were non linear in addition our model assumes that nitrogen removal through harvest occurs only by removing living oysters we acknowledge that in reality some nutrients remain sequestered in the bodies of oyster predators and other scavengers fourth the model developed here is deterministic oyster dynamics can be highly stochastic in particular year to year variation in recruitment and disease outbreaks can have large unanticipated impacts on oyster stocks growth in oysters stocks after a reduction in harvest effort and consequently enhanced nutrient removal could occur more or less quickly than the model suggests fifth our use of a simple logistic oyster growth function follows standard practice for example 45 but does not capture sources of mortality that are especially relevant for oysters for example the logistic model does not capture oyster mortality due to sedimentation burial and disease and does not account for productivity changes due to shell reef construction such dynamics are modeled explicitly in 28 however their model was implemented at the scale of single oyster reef we acknowledge that our bay wide model necessarily will omit some aspects further our model ignores age structure dynamics 22 seasonality in the rate of nitrogen removal and trophic interactions of oysters with primary and secondary production that can be important in determining water quality effects 42 in addition it models only harvest by watermen from public grounds there are several other oyster management options to promote greater oyster biomass in the bay other than regulating fishing effort in public grounds these options include sanctuaries reserves and aquaculture 46 lastly the value chosen for u n is based on only one study we find that achieving the tmdl generates positive net benefits when nitrogen reductions through bmps can be done at low cost but negative net benefits when reductions are more costly that conclusion is sensitive to our assumed value of u n still efficiency comparisons among scenarios and our conclusions regarding the potential contribution of oysters to meeting water

8683,this study aims to understand the economic and bio physical conditions under which mussel farming is a cost effective mitigation measure to improve water quality related to excess nitrogen in fjords and coastal areas we set up a mixed integer optimization model including every farm in three agricultural catchments surrounding limfjorden the largest fjord in denmark we include a number of relevant nitrogen abatement measures including agricultural land use measures and mussel farming in the sea the aim is to model the least costly combination of mitigation measures to improve water quality when agricultural environmental and market conditions vary we run three scenarios varying environmental conditions for mussel productivity and market opportunities for mussel based products as organic animal feed we analyze the resulting marginal abatement costs and draw insights about the potential scale of mussel farming for the different catchments we show that mussel farming is a cost effective option for 2 of the 3 catchments but that decreasing mussel productivity over time may make the measure ineffective for one of the catchments if a market for feed is not available the possibility of a market for mussel based organic feed significantly increases the share of nitrogen reduction done by mussels and decreases overall costs by up to 65 ultimately the results indicate that for catchments where environmental conditions are adequate mussel farming can be a cost effective nutrient reduction measure therefore mussel farming can potentially increase the cost effectiveness of incentive schemes aimed at reducing eutrophication in fjords and coastal waters keywords mussel farming eutrophication water quality nitrogen reduction agri environmental policy cost effectiveness 1 introduction denmark is one of the most intensively farmed countries in the world with more than 60 of its land surface used for agriculture it has one of the most developed nitrogen emission abatement regulation systems in the world 1 2 however despite the progress in lowering nutrient loss from agricultural systems there is still a need to improve environmental performance of agricultural production systems this is evident in the gap between the current water quality status and the targets stipulated in the water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec 3 it is acknowledged in the literature that effective regulation of excess nutrients in water bodies needs to take a spatial approach it is also acknowledged that introducing spatially differentiated and targeted regulation of the agricultural production constituting the largest emitting source of nitrogen to water can potentially reduce the economic costs of achieving environmental targets in freshwater and marine environments this is due to the correlation between farm characteristics e g soil type crop choice and location e g nutrient retention distance to water bodies impacting the effectiveness and costs of abatement measures 4 6 with the pressing need to reach the nutrient reduction targets stipulated in the wfd there is growing interest in identifying cost effective ways of meeting those targets different approaches have been used to identify cost effective solutions including bio economic modelling regression models and mathematical programming see ref 7 for a review in this study we use operations research methods and build on previous studies utilizing mathematical optimization to identify least cost combinations of abatement measures capable of achieving reduction targets 4 5 8 in recent years a growing literature has advocated including marine measures to the pool of land based policy measures in particular it is theorized that bivalve cultivation can avoid costly land based measures oyster reef restoration is e g discussed as a potential tool for nutrient removal particularly by increasing denitrification in estuarine areas 9 11 12 analyze combined oyster reefs and aquaculture as a method to remove nitrogen from estuarine waters in the us they conclude that the combination maximize n reduction capacity the evidence from existing studies suggests that when optimized for mitigation purposes mussel cultivation can be carried out at a lower cost than some land based measures and work as an effective measure to improve coastal water quality gren et al 2018 8 10 14 16 timmermann et al 2019 two of these studies 8 15 have examined the costs related to creation maintenance and harvest of mussels for n mitigation they estimate costs of n mitigation to be between 10 and 63 5 per kg of n 8 including several baltic sea basins and between 14 8 and 20 1 15 based on data from an experimental farm in skive fjord which is part of limfjorden moreover 8 tested the potential of mussel farming as a mitigation option for nitrogen and phosphorus reduction along with 20 other measures in 24 drainage basins in the baltic sea they found that for a large range of reduction targets mussel farming would be a cost effective measure economic analyses of mussel production as a nutrient reduction measure often assume a constant mussel productivity in a given catchment there are however studies demonstrating the relationship between mussel growth and environmental conditions 17 18 in particular mussel growth depends among other factors on the chlorophyll a chl a concentration of the water flowing through the farms chl a concentration is directly related to n concentration as nitrogen fuels phytoplankton growth this implies that efforts to improve water quality standards can alter mussel productivity and in turn potentially the cost effectiveness of mussels farming mitigation measures moreover it is proposed in the literature that the cost effectiveness of mussel farming as a mitigation measure can be significantly improved by utilizing the harvested mussels as organic animal feed 8 15 19 research have shown that the proposed mussel feed has satisfactory levels of nutrients and is well suited for piglets and egg laying hens 20 21 the protein content of mussels can substitute imported soy and other sources of imported protein for both organic and conventional animal feed 22 23 but the incentive for this substitution to take place depends on the price of mussel meal as an ingredient to animal feed relative to fish meal or soy the unrealized potential for organic animal feed in europe was estimated to be 135000 metric tons of crude protein in 2015 24 the crude protein production by mussels in the study area would only provide a marginal contribution to this market and thus is not expected to influence market prices when growing mussels for mitigation purposes the main objective is to capture nutrients only n is considered in this study since n content is directly related to biomass growers will setup their farms to maximize biomass production increased biomass means higher mussel density and thus smaller mussels the small mussels have less demand on the market for human consumption but are still suited for animal feed production furthermore the market demand for organic animal feed is growing and a potential increased supply of mussel based feed is unlikely to meet the demand 24 25 conversely mussel aquaculture for human consumption in the eu is in decline low and stagnant prices mainly caused by an atomized primary production sector and competition from imported products from outside the eu avdelas et al 2020 discourages the pursuit of a compromise between mussel farming for mitigation purposes and for human consumption 1 1 aim of the paper the aim of the paper is to investigate the impact of introducing mussel cultivation in the mix of nitrogen reduction measures to meet wfd targets the study contributes to the current literature by exploring the effects of combining the production of mussel feed and the n reduction effort furthermore we investigate the effects of a possible decrease in the productivity of mussel farms as water quality improvements are achieved and nutrient concentrations decrease the study differentiate itself from the current literature e g ref 8 15 by addressing key aspects of the uncertainty of the potential of mussels as a policy instrument we analyze whether the conclusions on cost effectiveness is sensitive to the biological constraints on mussel productivity this contributes to the evaluation of the long term viability of mussel production as achieving the environmental target may affect the cost effectiveness of mussels relative to land based measure the study also adds to the literature by including how the price of mussels as feed affect the cost effectiveness of nitrogen abatement by mussel production relative to land based measures three scenarios are set up no mussels mussels and mussels feed the last two scenarios are divided into sub scenarios allowing us to explore the effects of changes in environmental and market conditions we take the point of view of a social planner who aims to reduce n loss from non point sources to water bodies in order to comply with reduction targets set by the danish ministry of environment and food in the context of the wfd the environmental targets stipulated by wfd is agreed among the eu member states to be reached in 2021 with possible extensions to 2027 26 we seek to optimize the combination of mitigation measures to achieve the required reduction for the least possible cost we use a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem 5 6 27 mussel farming as a mitigation measure is introduced in the model for joint evaluation along with 14 land based measures we assess the cost effectiveness of mussel farming as a mitigation measure for eutrophication by observing whether it is included in the output of the optimization model furthermore we analyze the resulting marginal abatement curves and draw insights about the potential scale of mussel farming that would be desirable in each analyzed catchment for each of the proposed scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site the red upper catchment includes the following areas nissum bredning thisted bredning kås bredning løgstør bredning nibe bredning og langerak it is called catchment 1 in the text the blue middle catchment includes the following areas bjørnholms bugt riisgårde bredning skive fjord og lovns bredning it is called catchment 2 in the text the green lower catchment is the hjarbæk fjord it is called catchment 3 in the text catchment 3 is not suitable for mussel farming and is thus not subject of further analysis limfjorden is a large body of water 1500 km2 located in jutland denmark including its catchments which extend over approximately 7600 km2 the total area covers more than 1 5 of the country it has become a eutrophic water body due to high nutrient input from the surrounding catchments 28 land use in the area is dominated by agriculture with the total share of agricultural land reaching 70 which is slightly above the national average of 68 natural areas such as meadows bogs lakes and wetlands are above the national average 11 compared to 9 nationally in addition urban areas make up almost 4 and forests 11 of the area livestock production in the area is evenly distributed between cattle and pigs and other livestock production accounts for only a limited share of the total 28 there are three catchments from which nutrients flow to the limfjorden water bodies fig 1 referenced by fig 1 from top to bottom left to right the catchments will be called catchment 1 2 and 3 each water body has its own set of environmental indicator targets and n reduction targets the water bodies linked to catchments 1 and 2 currently have poor ecological status whereas the one for catchment 3 has bad ecological status following the water framework directive classification most of limfjorden is well suited for mussel production mainly due to optimal salinity conditions high nutrient inputs from land resulting in high primary production and phytoplankton biomass in combination with low levels of chemical and microbiological contamination however catchment 3 s waters are characterized by low surface salinity which limits mussel growth 29 making it unsuitable for mussel farming blue mussels feed on phytoplankton and in general higher phytoplankton biomass results in higher mussel growth whereas a low primary production and phytoplankton biomass may reduce mussel growth 15 30 the wfd stipulates a reduction of the levels of phytoplankton biomass through reductions in nutrient inputs and hence is it expected that mussel growth potential in danish waters will decrease as water bodies approach the good ecological status the different water bodies in limfjorden is characterized by different chemical biological and hydro morphological conditions such as salinity food availability water currents stratification and depth resulting in different growth conditions for blue mussels due to the different hydro morphological characteristics the sub basins also have individual environmental targets the target for phytoplankton biomass in catchment 1 catchment 2 and catchment 3 are 3 6 μg chl a l 6 μg chl a l and 9 μg chl a l respectively 31 the nitrogen reduction targets also differ among the water bodies with reduction requirements between 30 and 60 of the current nitrogen loading 31 reduction requirements of this size will likely reduce mussel productivity in limfjorden most of the present mussel harvesting is in the form of fisheries only approximately 10 comes from longline farming two opposite effects of mussel cultivation could influence wild mussel populations one the one hand wild mussels can be affected by food limitation with increasing number of mussel farms on the other hand mussel cultures may reduce the number of hypoxia events and benefit the wild mussels using a relatively simple box model without any spatial dimensions to estimate the consequences of reduced nutrient loads on the wild population 32 found a decrease in wild mussel biomass hence the same effect would probably occur if nutrient and chl levels are reduced due to suspended mussel cultures however this has not yet been estimated for a model with spatial dimensions mussel farms and hypoxia in summary the water bodies from catchments 1 and 2 are currently suitable for cultivation catchment 3 was determined to be unsuitable for mussel farming and was dropped from the analysis potentially catchment 2 mussel farms could maintain the same productivity even when the ecological status becomes classified as good ecological status since target chlorophyll a concentrations will not be limiting for mussel growth 33 however mussel farms in catchment 1 s waters could be expected to have reduced productivity under good ecological status due to reduced chlorophyll a concentrations 33 it should be noted that the impact on productivity of changing ecological status is uncertain research indicate however that the impact is important as the biomass of blue mussels in the fjord has markedly increased during the last three decades as a result of increasing eutrophication resulting in a high phytoplankton biomass 34 the decrease of the nutrient levels in the past years has according to refs 32 decreased the harvest of wild mussels however the effect on cultivated mussels from changes in nutrient levels are not known it is also relevant to acknowledge that a naturally oligotrophic body of water as was the case of limfjorden in the past may go through a regime shift a regime shift happens in broad terms when an ecosystem switches abruptly to a contrasting alternative state 35 studies have strongly indicated the existence of alternative stable states in various ecosystems 36 37 furthermore it is possible that after a shift the system will exhibit hysteresis hysteresis happens when a larger change in environmental conditions is required to reverse back to the original steady state this clearly would be relevant for our study since limfjorden s ecosystem may not respond linearly to reductions in n concentration according to ref 34 limfjorden went through a regime shift in the early nineties however little is known about the nature of the dynamics of the changes in the ecological status of the fjord and it is currently unknown if limfjorden s system will exhibit hysteresis nonetheless it is important to note that if it did restoring the ecosystem to its previous state would require larger changes than simply returning to previous nitrogen load levels this has been demonstrated for other fjords in e g duarte et al 2009 ecological economics models have been used to study the economic implications of regime shifts see ref 38 for an overview as the costs of ecological restorations could be significantly underestimated if important hysteresis effects were ignored recently efforts to link regime shifts to changes in ecosystem services have further highlighted the relevance of understanding the underlying dynamics of the water recipient to which the policy measures are targeted 39 the marine models used for wfd target setting for limfjorden do not account for potential hysteresis effects 31 and the abatement costs we identify could therefore underestimate the required costs to reach intended water quality targets 2 2 the data data sources are the danish general farm register the danish husbandry register the national nitrogen model 40 the danish agricultural advisory service seges and selected publications an overview of the data inputs and sources is presented in table 1 and described in more detail below additional information about the data is presented in appendix 1 for each field block which have a mean area of approximately 70500 m2 the social planner has access to data on crop composition prices and gross margins fertilizer application and nitrogen retention level it is also available for each combination of field block and mitigation measure its effectiveness and potential applicable area see section 2 3 crop composition and fertilizer applications come from the danish general farm register and the danish husbandry register the latter collected annually by authorities for cross compliance control of danish farmers prices and gross margins are calculated per individual crop soil type and use of manure as an average from 2011 to 2013 the data is collected from farmtaonline dlbr dk administered by seges danish agricultural advisory service retention values or the difference between the nutrient load leaving the root zone and what actually reaches the fjord see section 2 3 are taken from the most recent national nitrogen model 40 the model estimates retention coefficients for areas with a mean size of 15 km2 for all of denmark leaching coefficients are available for each specific measure as the difference in kg of n leached per hectare before and after implementation the data is differentiated for soil types and topography costs of land based measures are calculated as opportunity costs incurred from the loss in gross margins due to the implementation of mitigation measures it is estimated at the block field level and crop composition of each block is determined by data from the danish general farm register gross margins are influenced by whether manure is applied to the field the harmony rule which limits the maximum livestock density per hectare and was introduced as a consequence of the eu nitrate directive makes it more costly to implement measures on fields used for spreading manure especially measures that include land retirement mussel production costs mussel feed production costs and mussel feed selling prices are taken from ref 16 19 25 some estimates are updated based on yet unpublished data petersen personal communication these sources describe the best available data to estimate production costs and market conditions in denmark in the model 14 different types of mitigation measures and 26 variations are considered the variations refer to different intensities of the measures whether they are close to waterways low lying areas and whether they are being fertilized with manure harmony areas or not harmony free areas in table 2 they are listed in alphabetical order the table also includes what type of retention each measure is subject to 2 3 the model with detailed and spatially explicit data on land use abatement measures and mussel mitigation we set up a mixed integer cost minimization model the model minimizes the total costs of reaching the n reduction targets of a catchment by choosing the optimal combination of available measures it is subject to constraints on the total amount of n reaching the relevant water body and on each field parcel being able to receive only one measure explained below for the mussels and mussels feed scenarios additional cost of producing mussels and mussel feed are included all model parameters and variables are listed in table 3 the objective function minimizes the total costs of reducing n load to the water body given the available measures it is given by min x ik v i 1 i k 1 k cos t ik x ik cos t mussel are a mussel where i i 1 2 i represent the individual land parcels of a specific catchment and k k 1 2 k denote the set of mitigation measures available table 2 the cost of mussel farming per ha is represented by c o s t m u s s e l and the area occupied by it in ha is denoted by a r e a m u s s e l the costs of all the other measures for each parcel is represented by c o s t i k which calculates the costs of implementing abatement measures k 1 2 k at the field blocks i 1 2 i costs are given in danish kroners dkk 1 dkk 0 13 eur july 04 2019 moreover since each land parcel can be allocated to only one measure or none x i k is a binary variable determining whether the parcel is selected for a measure the restriction is needed because measures such as energy crops wetlands and set aside cannot be implemented at the same time and place as other measures other measures such as catch crops and reduced fertilization could be implemented jointly but there is no data on the combined effects assuming additive effects could result in overestimation of the environmental effectiveness but assuming that two measures cannot be implemented simultaneously might overestimate the relative cost effectiveness of mussel production as the effectiveness of land based measures could be underestimated in order not to overestimate the effectiveness of mitigation measures the binary non additivity approach is chosen additivity issues does not apply to mussel farming because it does not compete with other measures for space having only an upper bound for how much area a r e a m u s s e l can be used for mussel farms the maximum allowed area for mussels is taken from ref 41 the mutual exclusivity constraint is expressed as k 1 k x ij 1 i 1 2 i n reduction compliance constraint to ensure that the n reduction targets are met we include an inequality constraint accounting for the potential and effectiveness of the measures and the retention of n between the field and the recipient water body it is given by the expression below i 1 i

it passes through a series of processes referred to as retention resulting in a reduced quantity of n leaving the system this process can be broadly divided into surface water and ground water retention 6 this is reflected in the model by the parameters r e t s u r surface water and r e t t o t surface water ground water which will reduce the mitigation effects of measures depending on where it is applied retention parameters are assigned to each land parcel according to the latest danish national nitrogen model 40 not all abatement measures are subject to ground water retention since they connect directly to surface waters e g wetlands so they will be affected only by surface retention in the model we create a subset for measures that are subject to groundwater retention k 1 2 k furthermore each parcel measure combination has a potential applicable area given in ha and an effectiveness value given in n kg per ha in the model these parameters are represented by p o t i k and e f f i k respectively potential applicable area refers to the area in each field block that can be used for each measure subtracting the area where measures have been implemented before 2011 effectiveness refers to the estimated reduction in nitrogen loss for each measure for each field block mussel farming has two differences from land based mitigation measures with respect to how it is represented in the model its mitigation impact is not affected by retention since it is located at the coast and the applicable area a r e a m u s s e l has an upper limit determined by the conditions in each catchment but is treated as a variable rather than a fixed parameter e f f m u s s e l which represents the estimated efficiency of mussels to sequester n when multiplied by a r e a m u s s e

mus cos t feed pric e feed pro d mus pe r meat pe r dry for the mussels feed scenario two extra equations are added they calculate the costs of producing the mussel feed and from the social planner s perspective the balance after producing the mussels and selling the feed the scenarios are described in the next section 2 4 costfeed is the cost to produce feed from harvested mussels sep is the cost

is justified when analyzing from the perspective of the social planner pricefeed is the selling price for the mussel feed note that in the mussels scenario in which the production and selling of mussel feed is not contemplated c o s t f e e d and p r i c e f e e d can be considered to be zero c o s t m u s s e l b a s e c o s t m u s 2 4 modelled scenarios in order to better understand the impact of introducing mussel cultivation in the mix of abatement measures as well as the sensitivity of the results to different parameters we set up 3 scenarios for each catchment table 4 no mussels mussels and mussels feed catchment 1 which may experience a decrease in mussel productivity has additional sub scenarios to reflect that condition the no mussels scenario allows us to have a reference point using only land based measures comparing it to the other scenarios shows us the potential benefits of mussel farming with and without a market for feed the mussels scenario introduces mussel cultivation as a mitigation measure its parameters for mussel productivity and production costs are derived from ref 16 and petersen personal communication the productivity is set to 92427 kg of harvested mussels per ha of which 1 37 is considered to be sequestered n costs are 104906 dkk per ha for catchment 1 we run sub scenarios for the hypothesized reduction in productivity caused by lower nitrogen concentrations in the fjord the mussels feed scenario introduces the possibility of a market for mussel feed and allows us to visualize the total benefit that such setting would provide at the same time by varying the selling price of the feed it is possible to analyze the sensitivity to this yet uncertain parameter the model parameters for mussel productivity and production costs are the same as for the mussels scenario possible selling prices for mussel feed are based on 19 which estimates it between 11 dkk and 12 dkk per kg we take a conservative approach and test for 10 dkk and 12 dkk for catchment 1 we again estimate the impact of a reduction in mussel productivity due to lower nitrogen concentrations we run the model described in section 2 3 to find the optimal solutions to reach the n reduction targets for each catchment for each scenario described in table 4 and analyze the implication these have for mussel production in limfjorden n reduction targets are defined in the danish river basin management plans 26 reduction targets are 2112100 kg of n for catchment 1 and 681900 kg of n for catchment 2 the definition of these targets take into account the amount of n entering the system from land based sources from atmospheric deposition as well as from nutrient loadings coming from the baltic sea transport of nutrients between catchments is also considered 31 we then analyze and discuss the results in the following sections 3 results 3 1 overview in this section we present the model results for each scenario and catchment we show results for total cost marginal abatement cost n reduction due to mussel farming n reduction due to other measures area used for mussel farming and area used for other measures the results refer to the solutions to the optimization problem for the reduction targets in catchments 1 and 2 we compare results between scenarios and draw marginal abatement curves for each catchment all results are included in tables 5 and 6 and figs 2 and 3 show the corresponding marginal abatement curves for each catchment the marginal abatement curves are calculated from the shadow price of the n reduction compliance constraint section 2 3 scenarios including mussel farming show a flat marginal abatement curve as soon as the cost to reduce an extra kg of n reaches the mussel farm s cost per kg of n reduced this holds if sufficient area for mussel farming is available 3 2 no mussels scenario with only land based measures this baseline scenario has a total cost of 133 0 million dkk for the first catchment and 48 9 million dkk for the second the mean cost for a kg of n reduced is 63 dkk and 72 dkk respectively for catchments 1 and 2 respectively the marginal abatement costs are 125 dkk and 178 dkk per kg of n removed mitigation measures are used on approximately 114 thousand hectares in catchment 1 and 35 thousand hectares in catchment 2 3 3 mussels scenario when mussel farming is included in the pool of available mitigation measures the total cost decreases from 133 0 million dkk to 118 6 million dkk 11 for catchment 1 and from 48 9 million dkk to 37 4 million dkk 24 for catchment 2 the mean cost for reducing one kg n is 56 dkk for catchment 1 and 55 dkk for catchment 2 the marginal abatement cost for both catchments decreases to 83 dkk which is the value of the marginal cost for a kg of n mitigated by mussel farming since it is now responsible for n reductions that would otherwise have higher marginal costs for catchment 1 the n reduction by mussel farming reaches 749 tons of n 35 of the reduction target while other measures are responsible for around 1363 tons the total area used by mussel farming is 593 ha and 95031 ha are used by other measures 17 than the no mussels scenario catchment 2 has 217 tons of n mitigated by mussel farming 32 of the reduction goal and other measures are responsible for around 465 tons of n as for area used mussels occupy 172 ha whereas other measures take up 26045 ha a decrease of 25 from the scenario without mussels 3 4 mussels feed scenario when introducing the possibility to produce mussel feed and sell it at market price both total and marginal costs fall in contrast n reduction due to mussels and the area it occupies rises significantly for catchment 1 with the selling price of feed at 10 dkk the total cost of achieving the target decreases to around 74 4 million dkk a reduction of 44 from the no mussels scenario the mean cost for a kg of n reduced is 35 dkk and the marginal abatement cost falls to 42 dkk n reduction by mussel cultivation reaches 1369 tons 65 of the target and the total area occupied by it is 1084 ha lastly the area allocated to land based measures decreases by 54 to 52963 ha for catchment 2 and a selling price of feed at 10 dkk the total cost decreases to 24 7 million dkk this is a 49 reduction compared to the no mussels scenario the mean cost for reducing emissions by one kg n is 41 dkk the lower marginal abatement cost at 42 dkk leads to mussel farming reaching 63 of the n reduction goal for the catchment the total area used by land based measures drops by 51 to 17072 ha while mussel farming now occupies 343 ha increasing the selling price of mussel feed to 12 dkk per kg further decreases total and marginal costs and increases the share of n reduction done by mussels and the area needed for its cultivation catchment 1 s total cost to achieve the reduction target is reduced by 61 falling to 51 9 million dkk the higher revenue means a lower marginal abatement cost from the social planner s perspective now at 27 dkk per kg of n mussel farming is now responsible for 77 of the catchment s n reduction target removing 1616 tons of n from the fjord the area used by land based measures decreases by 72 to 31956 ha mussel cultivation occupies 1280 ha and the mean cost of reducing n is 25 dkk kg for catchment 2 we see a 65 reduction in total cost decreasing to 17 3 million dkk the mean cost of reducing n is 25 dkk kg with the same parameters for costs and productivity of mussel cultivation as catchment 1 the marginal abatement cost is also 27 dkk consequently the relative weight of mussel farming in n reduction also increases and reaches 82 of the catchment s reduction target at 556 5 tons of n the total area used by mussel farms stands at 441 ha whereas the land based measure s area is reduced by 76 to 8199 ha 3 5 sub scenarios for decreasing productivity lastly we analyze the results for the extra scenarios where the productivity of mussel farming is decreased gradually only catchment 1 is analyzed in these extra scenarios as explained in section 2 1 for the scenario with mussels and no mussel feed the cost reduction starts at 11 and gradually falls until at around 75 of mussel productivity where there would be no savings from having mussel farming as a measure fig 4 when including a market for mussel feed savings start at 61 selling price of feed at 12 dkk and gradually decrease until at around 50 of mussel productivity where there would be no overall cost reduction fig 4 4 discussion this study has demonstrated that mussel farming as a nutrient reduction measure can be cost effective but it has also shown that its suitability is dependent on environmental and market conditions without a market for mussel feed only one of the three catchments initially considered has the environmental conditions to sustain mussels as a mitigation measure even when the environmental status in the fjord waters reached good ecological status catchment 1 would probably see a fall in productivity mainly due to low chl a concentration while the level of reduction in mussel productivity is currently unknown a decrease of 25 50 with a market for feed would remove mussel farming from the most cost effective solutions this would imply that mussel farming should be reduced or even phased out when the water quality reaches good ecological status furthermore catchment 3 does not have suitable environmental conditions for competitive mussel farming even at current conditions our analysis has also shown that the introduction of a market for feed greatly increases the potential for mussel farming as a mitigation measure social costs would fall by as much as 65 catchment 2 price of feed 12 dkk kg when producers can sell the harvested mussels it is clear that the selling price of the feed will have an important impact on how much mussel farming is desirable and also on the total social cost to achieve the reduction targets an increase of 2 dkk in the price per kg of mussel feed increases its share of the reduction target by 12 19 and decreases total cost by 16 17 it is noteworthy however that it is not currently known when the hypothesized reduction in mussel productivity would occur the rate of improvement of the n concentrations in the fjords waters are dependent on the lag time between n loss at the source and its actual arrival at the catchment discharge point this interval may be from a few months to decades 42 however mussel farming has a distinct advantage over most land based measures its effects on n concentration in fjords and coastal waters will happen immediately since it is sequestrating n at its final destination and thus it is not subject to the lag effect experienced by most mitigation measures inland 10 nevertheless it is important to note that it is not effective in reducing nitrogen loads to freshwater bodies such as lakes and rivers in future studies it would be helpful to work in cooperation with hydrological modelers in order to integrate to the analysis knowledge about these lag times the hydrological analysis and subsequent estimation of the specific lag time for a catchment would allow for better analyses of the suitability of mussel farming as an n mitigation measure over time furthermore it is important to consider that in the absence of a market for mussel feed a solution would have to be found for the disposal of the harvested mussels it is not clear yet if farmers would be able to sell it for other purposes such as fertilizer products for agriculture but it might be the case that the disposal of the mussels will come with a cost in that case different conclusions about the cost effectiveness of mussel farming might be drawn especially for catchment 1 as for all empirically based modelling uncertainties in the model parameters can have significant influences on the results however it is expected that our cost estimates for the mussel harvesting and costs of production of feed are likely to decrease in the coming years and improve the competitiveness of mussel farming for nitrogen reduction purposes this paper is based on data from a case study in limfjorden using a pilot mussel farms to evaluate the wider applicability of mussel farms for mitigation purposes it would be important to test transferability of the findings to other settings our analysis illustrates that the factors impacting the potential of mussel farms could come from a range of sources such as leaching coefficients n retention in the area and the opportunity costs from farming the productivity of mussel farms might also vary extensively across space in our study it was possible to collect data on mussel farm productivity from in loco test farms however when such data is not available it is also possible to infer such productivity from growth controlling parameters levels in the area such as temperature salinity and food availability 41 further analysis and test in other localities is needed to evaluate the wider applicability of mussel farms to reach wfd targets at a larger scale it is also important to consider potential negative environmental externalities from mussel cultivation that may occur e g effects on habitats visual amenities and recreation marine habitats close to the farms could be negatively influenced from mussel cultivation as sediments directly below the farms increase in n content 43 conclude that the potential negative water quality effect is outweighed by a net removal of nutrients by harvest but also that there is a knowledge gap related to the potential negative effects on natural habitats mussel farms can also result in negative visual amenity and recreation effects by taking up limited space in the fjords research in limfjorden by ref 44 indicates that the visual impacts of the farms are perceived as negative by local residents and owners of the summer houses in the area but no assessment has been made on the extent and value of this negative externality production costs of mussels can potentially be lowered and productivity increased by introducing new technology such as the smart farm system offered by firms such as smart farm as from norway www smartfarm no accessed on july 04th 2019 according to ref 16 the technology can potentially increase yields up to 300 and while it would require higher capital investments the labor costs for maintenance are estimated to be only around 10 that of traditional systems the initial impression is that the technology is more cost effective than traditional systems however further investigation is required for a full assessment production costs of feed is yet uncertain but there are also efforts to establish a production method that could potentially lower the production costs significantly in the calculations used for this study costs were estimated based on existing technology and methods that were not optimized for mussels especially not smaller mussels which are expected in mussel farming for n mitigation of special importance is to find cheaper ways to separate the meat from the shells and to dry the material to an acceptable level 25 as the organic feed product based on mussel meal is not currently on the market we cannot use market data to reveal the value of the product we have based our scenario assumption on the current market for fishmeal as this is a close substitute however several market trends indicate that this could be a conservative estimate firstly the market for organic farm produce is increasing generating an increased demand for organic feed to animal husbandry secondly it is also expected that the tightening regulations for organic production may also further increase the demand for mussel based feed nielsen personal communication given that mussel farming as an n mitigation measure is a cost effective measure to achieve the wfd targets the next obvious step is to reflect on how this can be integrated into the incentive schemes designed to achieve those targets one proposal could be to include mussel farming in the eu agri environmental schemes and allow national governments to subsidise mussel farmers for their removal of nitrogen for the water bodies in the same way as farmers are paid to implement land based measures such as catch crops 45 also present in the literature is the proposal to develop nutrient trading markets that could potentially integrate land based farmers and mussel farmers 8 14 46 47 such markets are evolving in the us1 in that context a specially interesting proposal is the creation of smart markets for water quality in which similarly to modern electricity markets buyers and sellers submit bids to a central market manager the central manager then uses mathematical optimization to match bids and set prices 48 such system would in theory account for the spatial and temporal interactions that arise from the dispersed and delayed nature of diffuse pollution effects while also addressing the problem of thin trading in nutrient trading markets in such setting as described by ref 49 mussel farmers can help improve market performance by acting as resource banks offering resource permits that would help balance resource allocation over time and increase liquidity 5 conclusion this study has investigated the economic and bio physical conditions under which mussel farming is a cost effective mitigation measure for improving water quality related to excess nitrogen in marine and coastal areas we have developed a mixed integer optimization model including every farm in the catchments surrounding limfjorden denmark scenarios were developed and tested for each catchment varying environmental and market conditions and the results were analyzed in terms of the cost effectiveness and scope of the mitigation measure in contrast to land based measures acknowledging parameter uncertainties the present study has demonstrated that mussel farming is a cost effective measure for n mitigation in two of the three catchments of limfjorden a market for feed albeit greatly increasing its cost effectiveness is not a necessary condition when the environmental conditions are suitable considering the likely scenario that there will be demand for organic mussel feed and that production costs will decrease the parameter space for adequate environmental conditions are expected to increase considerably furthermore the effects of water quality improvements and lower nutrient concentration in water bodies on mussel productivity was shown to have limited consequences in situations where mussel productivity is expected to fall such as in catchment 1 there is still potential for overall cost reductions by including mussel farming as a mitigation measure eutrophication in marine and coastal waters is a cause for concern in europe and arguably worldwide and decision makers are currently striving to find suitable and cost efficient solutions to the problem cost effective land based measures have in many cases already been implemented and efforts to expand implementation are often met with resistance by farmers in that context mussel farming can potentially increase the scope and cost effectiveness of incentive schemes aimed at reducing eutrophication in marine and coastal waters in locations

8683,this study aims to understand the economic and bio physical conditions under which mussel farming is a cost effective mitigation measure to improve water quality related to excess nitrogen in fjords and coastal areas we set up a mixed integer optimization model including every farm in three agricultural catchments surrounding limfjorden the largest fjord in denmark we include a number of relevant nitrogen abatement measures including agricultural land use measures and mussel farming in the sea the aim is to model the least costly combination of mitigation measures to improve water quality when agricultural environmental and market conditions vary we run three scenarios varying environmental conditions for mussel productivity and market opportunities for mussel based products as organic animal feed we analyze the resulting marginal abatement costs and draw insights about the potential scale of mussel farming for the different catchments we show that mussel farming is a cost effective option for 2 of the 3 catchments but that decreasing mussel productivity over time may make the measure ineffective for one of the catchments if a market for feed is not available the possibility of a market for mussel based organic feed significantly increases the share of nitrogen reduction done by mussels and decreases overall costs by up to 65 ultimately the results indicate that for catchments where environmental conditions are adequate mussel farming can be a cost effective nutrient reduction measure therefore mussel farming can potentially increase the cost effectiveness of incentive schemes aimed at reducing eutrophication in fjords and coastal waters keywords mussel farming eutrophication water quality nitrogen reduction agri environmental policy cost effectiveness 1 introduction denmark is one of the most intensively farmed countries in the world with more than 60 of its land surface used for agriculture it has one of the most developed nitrogen emission abatement regulation systems in the world 1 2 however despite the progress in lowering nutrient loss from agricultural systems there is still a need to improve environmental performance of agricultural production systems this is evident in the gap between the current water quality status and the targets stipulated in the water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec 3 it is acknowledged in the literature that effective regulation of excess nutrients in water bodies needs to take a spatial approach it is also acknowledged that introducing spatially differentiated and targeted regulation of the agricultural production constituting the largest emitting source of nitrogen to water can potentially reduce the economic costs of achieving environmental targets in freshwater and marine environments this is due to the correlation between farm characteristics e g soil type crop choice and location e g nutrient retention distance to water bodies impacting the effectiveness and costs of abatement measures 4 6 with the pressing need to reach the nutrient reduction targets stipulated in the wfd there is growing interest in identifying cost effective ways of meeting those targets different approaches have been used to identify cost effective solutions including bio economic modelling regression models and mathematical programming see ref 7 for a review in this study we use operations research methods and build on previous studies utilizing mathematical optimization to identify least cost combinations of abatement measures capable of achieving reduction targets 4 5 8 in recent years a growing literature has advocated including marine measures to the pool of land based policy measures in particular it is theorized that bivalve cultivation can avoid costly land based measures oyster reef restoration is e g discussed as a potential tool for nutrient removal particularly by increasing denitrification in estuarine areas 9 11 12 analyze combined oyster reefs and aquaculture as a method to remove nitrogen from estuarine waters in the us they conclude that the combination maximize n reduction capacity the evidence from existing studies suggests that when optimized for mitigation purposes mussel cultivation can be carried out at a lower cost than some land based measures and work as an effective measure to improve coastal water quality gren et al 2018 8 10 14 16 timmermann et al 2019 two of these studies 8 15 have examined the costs related to creation maintenance and harvest of mussels for n mitigation they estimate costs of n mitigation to be between 10 and 63 5 per kg of n 8 including several baltic sea basins and between 14 8 and 20 1 15 based on data from an experimental farm in skive fjord which is part of limfjorden moreover 8 tested the potential of mussel farming as a mitigation option for nitrogen and phosphorus reduction along with 20 other measures in 24 drainage basins in the baltic sea they found that for a large range of reduction targets mussel farming would be a cost effective measure economic analyses of mussel production as a nutrient reduction measure often assume a constant mussel productivity in a given catchment there are however studies demonstrating the relationship between mussel growth and environmental conditions 17 18 in particular mussel growth depends among other factors on the chlorophyll a chl a concentration of the water flowing through the farms chl a concentration is directly related to n concentration as nitrogen fuels phytoplankton growth this implies that efforts to improve water quality standards can alter mussel productivity and in turn potentially the cost effectiveness of mussels farming mitigation measures moreover it is proposed in the literature that the cost effectiveness of mussel farming as a mitigation measure can be significantly improved by utilizing the harvested mussels as organic animal feed 8 15 19 research have shown that the proposed mussel feed has satisfactory levels of nutrients and is well suited for piglets and egg laying hens 20 21 the protein content of mussels can substitute imported soy and other sources of imported protein for both organic and conventional animal feed 22 23 but the incentive for this substitution to take place depends on the price of mussel meal as an ingredient to animal feed relative to fish meal or soy the unrealized potential for organic animal feed in europe was estimated to be 135000 metric tons of crude protein in 2015 24 the crude protein production by mussels in the study area would only provide a marginal contribution to this market and thus is not expected to influence market prices when growing mussels for mitigation purposes the main objective is to capture nutrients only n is considered in this study since n content is directly related to biomass growers will setup their farms to maximize biomass production increased biomass means higher mussel density and thus smaller mussels the small mussels have less demand on the market for human consumption but are still suited for animal feed production furthermore the market demand for organic animal feed is growing and a potential increased supply of mussel based feed is unlikely to meet the demand 24 25 conversely mussel aquaculture for human consumption in the eu is in decline low and stagnant prices mainly caused by an atomized primary production sector and competition from imported products from outside the eu avdelas et al 2020 discourages the pursuit of a compromise between mussel farming for mitigation purposes and for human consumption 1 1 aim of the paper the aim of the paper is to investigate the impact of introducing mussel cultivation in the mix of nitrogen reduction measures to meet wfd targets the study contributes to the current literature by exploring the effects of combining the production of mussel feed and the n reduction effort furthermore we investigate the effects of a possible decrease in the productivity of mussel farms as water quality improvements are achieved and nutrient concentrations decrease the study differentiate itself from the current literature e g ref 8 15 by addressing key aspects of the uncertainty of the potential of mussels as a policy instrument we analyze whether the conclusions on cost effectiveness is sensitive to the biological constraints on mussel productivity this contributes to the evaluation of the long term viability of mussel production as achieving the environmental target may affect the cost effectiveness of mussels relative to land based measure the study also adds to the literature by including how the price of mussels as feed affect the cost effectiveness of nitrogen abatement by mussel production relative to land based measures three scenarios are set up no mussels mussels and mussels feed the last two scenarios are divided into sub scenarios allowing us to explore the effects of changes in environmental and market conditions we take the point of view of a social planner who aims to reduce n loss from non point sources to water bodies in order to comply with reduction targets set by the danish ministry of environment and food in the context of the wfd the environmental targets stipulated by wfd is agreed among the eu member states to be reached in 2021 with possible extensions to 2027 26 we seek to optimize the combination of mitigation measures to achieve the required reduction for the least possible cost we use a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem 5 6 27 mussel farming as a mitigation measure is introduced in the model for joint evaluation along with 14 land based measures we assess the cost effectiveness of mussel farming as a mitigation measure for eutrophication by observing whether it is included in the output of the optimization model furthermore we analyze the resulting marginal abatement curves and draw insights about the potential scale of mussel farming that would be desirable in each analyzed catchment for each of the proposed scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site the red upper catchment includes the following areas nissum bredning thisted bredning kås bredning løgstør bredning nibe bredning og langerak it is called catchment 1 in the text the blue middle catchment includes the following areas bjørnholms bugt riisgårde bredning skive fjord og lovns bredning it is called catchment 2 in the text the green lower catchment is the hjarbæk fjord it is called catchment 3 in the text catchment 3 is not suitable for mussel farming and is thus not subject of further analysis limfjorden is a large body of water 1500 km2 located in jutland denmark including its catchments which extend over approximately 7600 km2 the total area covers more than 1 5 of the country it has become a eutrophic water body due to high nutrient input from the surrounding catchments 28 land use in the area is dominated by agriculture with the total share of agricultural land reaching 70 which is slightly above the national average of 68 natural areas such as meadows bogs lakes and wetlands are above the national average 11 compared to 9 nationally in addition urban areas make up almost 4 and forests 11 of the area livestock production in the area is evenly distributed between cattle and pigs and other livestock production accounts for only a limited share of the total 28 there are three catchments from which nutrients flow to the limfjorden water bodies fig 1 referenced by fig 1 from top to bottom left to right the catchments will be called catchment 1 2 and 3 each water body has its own set of environmental indicator targets and n reduction targets the water bodies linked to catchments 1 and 2 currently have poor ecological status whereas the one for catchment 3 has bad ecological status following the water framework directive classification most of limfjorden is well suited for mussel production mainly due to optimal salinity conditions high nutrient inputs from land resulting in high primary production and phytoplankton biomass in combination with low levels of chemical and microbiological contamination however catchment 3 s waters are characterized by low surface salinity which limits mussel growth 29 making it unsuitable for mussel farming blue mussels feed on phytoplankton and in general higher phytoplankton biomass results in higher mussel growth whereas a low primary production and phytoplankton biomass may reduce mussel growth 15 30 the wfd stipulates a reduction of the levels of phytoplankton biomass through reductions in nutrient inputs and hence is it expected that mussel growth potential in danish waters will decrease as water bodies approach the good ecological status the different water bodies in limfjorden is characterized by different chemical biological and hydro morphological conditions such as salinity food availability water currents stratification and depth resulting in different growth conditions for blue mussels due to the different hydro morphological characteristics the sub basins also have individual environmental targets the target for phytoplankton biomass in catchment 1 catchment 2 and catchment 3 are 3 6 μg chl a l 6 μg chl a l and 9 μg chl a l respectively 31 the nitrogen reduction targets also differ among the water bodies with reduction requirements between 30 and 60 of the current nitrogen loading 31 reduction requirements of this size will likely reduce mussel productivity in limfjorden most of the present mussel harvesting is in the form of fisheries only approximately 10 comes from longline farming two opposite effects of mussel cultivation could influence wild mussel populations one the one hand wild mussels can be affected by food limitation with increasing number of mussel farms on the other hand mussel cultures may reduce the number of hypoxia events and benefit the wild mussels using a relatively simple box model without any spatial dimensions to estimate the consequences of reduced nutrient loads on the wild population 32 found a decrease in wild mussel biomass hence the same effect would probably occur if nutrient and chl levels are reduced due to suspended mussel cultures however this has not yet been estimated for a model with spatial dimensions mussel farms and hypoxia in summary the water bodies from catchments 1 and 2 are currently suitable for cultivation catchment 3 was determined to be unsuitable for mussel farming and was dropped from the analysis potentially catchment 2 mussel farms could maintain the same productivity even when the ecological status becomes classified as good ecological status since target chlorophyll a concentrations will not be limiting for mussel growth 33 however mussel farms in catchment 1 s waters could be expected to have reduced productivity under good ecological status due to reduced chlorophyll a concentrations 33 it should be noted that the impact on productivity of changing ecological status is uncertain research indicate however that the impact is important as the biomass of blue mussels in the fjord has markedly increased during the last three decades as a result of increasing eutrophication resulting in a high phytoplankton biomass 34 the decrease of the nutrient levels in the past years has according to refs 32 decreased the harvest of wild mussels however the effect on cultivated mussels from changes in nutrient levels are not known it is also relevant to acknowledge that a naturally oligotrophic body of water as was the case of limfjorden in the past may go through a regime shift a regime shift happens in broad terms when an ecosystem switches abruptly to a contrasting alternative state 35 studies have strongly indicated the existence of alternative stable states in various ecosystems 36 37 furthermore it is possible that after a shift the system will exhibit hysteresis hysteresis happens when a larger change in environmental conditions is required to reverse back to the original steady state this clearly would be relevant for our study since limfjorden s ecosystem may not respond linearly to reductions in n concentration according to ref 34 limfjorden went through a regime shift in the early nineties however little is known about the nature of the dynamics of the changes in the ecological status of the fjord and it is currently unknown if limfjorden s system will exhibit hysteresis nonetheless it is important to note that if it did restoring the ecosystem to its previous state would require larger changes than simply returning to previous nitrogen load levels this has been demonstrated for other fjords in e g duarte et al 2009 ecological economics models have been used to study the economic implications of regime shifts see ref 38 for an overview as the costs of ecological restorations could be significantly underestimated if important hysteresis effects were ignored recently efforts to link regime shifts to changes in ecosystem services have further highlighted the relevance of understanding the underlying dynamics of the water recipient to which the policy measures are targeted 39 the marine models used for wfd target setting for limfjorden do not account for potential hysteresis effects 31 and the abatement costs we identify could therefore underestimate the required costs to reach intended water quality targets 2 2 the data data sources are the danish general farm register the danish husbandry register the national nitrogen model 40 the danish agricultural advisory service seges and selected publications an overview of the data inputs and sources is presented in table 1 and described in more detail below additional information about the data is presented in appendix 1 for each field block which have a mean area of approximately 70500 m2 the social planner has access to data on crop composition prices and gross margins fertilizer application and nitrogen retention level it is also available for each combination of field block and mitigation measure its effectiveness and potential applicable area see section 2 3 crop composition and fertilizer applications come from the danish general farm register and the danish husbandry register the latter collected annually by authorities for cross compliance control of danish farmers prices and gross margins are calculated per individual crop soil type and use of manure as an average from 2011 to 2013 the data is collected from farmtaonline dlbr dk administered by seges danish agricultural advisory service retention values or the difference between the nutrient load leaving the root zone and what actually reaches the fjord see section 2 3 are taken from the most recent national nitrogen model 40 the model estimates retention coefficients for areas with a mean size of 15 km2 for all of denmark leaching coefficients are available for each specific measure as the difference in kg of n leached per hectare before and after implementation the data is differentiated for soil types and topography costs of land based measures are calculated as opportunity costs incurred from the loss in gross margins due to the implementation of mitigation measures it is estimated at the block field level and crop composition of each block is determined by data from the danish general farm register gross margins are influenced by whether manure is applied to the field the harmony rule which limits the maximum livestock density per hectare and was introduced as a consequence of the eu nitrate directive makes it more costly to implement measures on fields used for spreading manure especially measures that include land retirement mussel production costs mussel feed production costs and mussel feed selling prices are taken from ref 16 19 25 some estimates are updated based on yet unpublished data petersen personal communication these sources describe the best available data to estimate production costs and market conditions in denmark in the model 14 different types of mitigation measures and 26 variations are considered the variations refer to different intensities of the measures whether they are close to waterways low lying areas and whether they are being fertilized with manure harmony areas or not harmony free areas in table 2 they are listed in alphabetical order the table also includes what type of retention each measure is subject to 2 3 the model with detailed and spatially explicit data on land use abatement measures and mussel mitigation we set up a mixed integer cost minimization model the model minimizes the total costs of reaching the n reduction targets of a catchment by choosing the optimal combination of available measures it is subject to constraints on the total amount of n reaching the relevant water body and on each field parcel being able to receive only one measure explained below for the mussels and mussels feed scenarios additional cost of producing mussels and mussel feed are included all model parameters and variables are listed in table 3 the objective function minimizes the total costs of reducing n load to the water body given the available measures it is given by min x ik v i 1 i k 1 k cos t ik x ik cos t mussel are a mussel where i i 1 2 i represent the individual land parcels of a specific catchment and k k 1 2 k denote the set of mitigation measures available table 2 the cost of mussel farming per ha is represented by c o s t m u s s e l and the area occupied by it in ha is denoted by a r e a m u s s e l the costs of all the other measures for each parcel is represented by c o s t i k which calculates the costs of implementing abatement measures k 1 2 k at the field blocks i 1 2 i costs are given in danish kroners dkk 1 dkk 0 13 eur july 04 2019 moreover since each land parcel can be allocated to only one measure or none x i k is a binary variable determining whether the parcel is selected for a measure the restriction is needed because measures such as energy crops wetlands and set aside cannot be implemented at the same time and place as other measures other measures such as catch crops and reduced fertilization could be implemented jointly but there is no data on the combined effects assuming additive effects could result in overestimation of the environmental effectiveness but assuming that two measures cannot be implemented simultaneously might overestimate the relative cost effectiveness of mussel production as the effectiveness of land based measures could be underestimated in order not to overestimate the effectiveness of mitigation measures the binary non additivity approach is chosen additivity issues does not apply to mussel farming because it does not compete with other measures for space having only an upper bound for how much area a r e a m u s s e l can be used for mussel farms the maximum allowed area for mussels is taken from ref 41 the mutual exclusivity constraint is expressed as k 1 k x ij 1 i 1 2 i n reduction compliance constraint to ensure that the n reduction targets are met we include an inequality constraint accounting for the potential and effectiveness of the measures and the retention of n between the field and the recipient water body it is given by the expression below i 1 i

it passes through a series of processes referred to as retention resulting in a reduced quantity of n leaving the system this process can be broadly divided into surface water and ground water retention 6 this is reflected in the model by the parameters r e t s u r surface water and r e t t o t surface water ground water which will reduce the mitigation effects of measures depending on where it is applied retention parameters are assigned to each land parcel according to the latest danish national nitrogen model 40 not all abatement measures are subject to ground water retention since they connect directly to surface waters e g wetlands so they will be affected only by surface retention in the model we create a subset for measures that are subject to groundwater retention k 1 2 k furthermore each parcel measure combination has a potential applicable area given in ha and an effectiveness value given in n kg per ha in the model these parameters are represented by p o t i k and e f f i k respectively potential applicable area refers to the area in each field block that can be used for each measure subtracting the area where measures have been implemented before 2011 effectiveness refers to the estimated reduction in nitrogen loss for each measure for each field block mussel farming has two differences from land based mitigation measures with respect to how it is represented in the model its mitigation impact is not affected by retention since it is located at the coast and the applicable area a r e a m u s s e l has an upper limit determined by the conditions in each catchment but is treated as a variable rather than a fixed parameter e f f m u s s e l which represents the estimated efficiency of mussels to sequester n when multiplied by a r e a m u s s e

perspective the balance after producing the mussels and selling the feed the scenarios are described in the next section 2 4 costfeed is the cost to produce feed from harvested mussels sep is the cost to separate the shells from the mussel meat prodmus is mussel production in kg per ha dry is the cost to dry and grind the meat and per meat is the percentage of meat taken from the whole mussels c o

is justified when analyzing from the perspective of the social planner pricefeed is the selling price for the mussel feed note that in the mussels scenario in which the production and selling of mussel feed is not contemplated c o s t f e e d and p r i c e f e e d can be considered to be zero c o s t m u s s e l b a s e c o s t m u s 2 4 modelled scenarios in order to better understand the impact of introducing mussel cultivation in the mix of abatement measures as well as the sensitivity of the results to different parameters we set up 3 scenarios for each catchment table 4 no mussels mussels and mussels feed catchment 1 which may experience a decrease in mussel productivity has additional sub scenarios to reflect that condition the no mussels scenario allows us to have a reference point using only land based measures comparing it to the other scenarios shows us the potential benefits of mussel farming with and without a market for feed the mussels scenario introduces mussel cultivation as a mitigation measure its parameters for mussel productivity and production costs are derived from ref 16 and petersen personal communication the productivity is set to 92427 kg of harvested mussels per ha of which 1 37 is considered to be sequestered n costs are 104906 dkk per ha for catchment 1 we run sub scenarios for the hypothesized reduction in productivity caused by lower nitrogen concentrations in the fjord the mussels feed scenario introduces the possibility of a market for mussel feed and allows us to visualize the total benefit that such setting would provide at the same time by varying the selling price of the feed it is possible to analyze the sensitivity to this yet uncertain parameter the model parameters for mussel productivity and production costs are the same as for the mussels scenario possible selling prices for mussel feed are based on 19 which estimates it between 11 dkk and 12 dkk per kg we take a conservative approach and test for 10 dkk and 12 dkk for catchment 1 we again estimate the impact of a reduction in mussel productivity due to lower nitrogen concentrations we run the model described in section 2 3 to find the optimal solutions to reach the n reduction targets for each catchment for each scenario described in table 4 and analyze the implication these have for mussel production in limfjorden n reduction targets are defined in the danish river basin management plans 26 reduction targets are 2112100 kg of n for catchment 1 and 681900 kg of n for catchment 2 the definition of these targets take into account the amount of n entering the system from land based sources from atmospheric deposition as well as from nutrient loadings coming from the baltic sea transport of nutrients between catchments is also considered 31 we then analyze and discuss the results in the following sections 3 results 3 1 overview in this section we present the model results for each scenario and catchment we show results for total cost marginal abatement cost n reduction due to mussel farming n reduction due to other measures area used for mussel farming and area used for other measures the results refer to the solutions to the optimization problem for the reduction targets in catchments 1 and 2 we compare results between scenarios and draw marginal abatement curves for each catchment all results are included in tables 5 and 6 and figs 2 and 3 show the corresponding marginal abatement curves for each catchment the marginal abatement curves are calculated from the shadow price of the n reduction compliance constraint section 2 3 scenarios including mussel farming show a flat marginal abatement curve as soon as the cost to reduce an extra kg of n reaches the mussel farm s cost per kg of n reduced this holds if sufficient area for mussel farming is available 3 2 no mussels scenario with only land based measures this baseline scenario has a total cost of 133 0 million dkk for the first catchment and 48 9 million dkk for the second the mean cost for a kg of n reduced is 63 dkk and 72 dkk respectively for catchments 1 and 2 respectively the marginal abatement costs are 125 dkk and 178 dkk per kg of n removed mitigation measures are used on approximately 114 thousand hectares in catchment 1 and 35 thousand hectares in catchment 2 3 3 mussels scenario when mussel farming is included in the pool of available mitigation measures the total cost decreases from 133 0 million dkk to 118 6 million dkk 11 for catchment 1 and from 48 9 million dkk to 37 4 million dkk 24 for catchment 2 the mean cost for reducing one kg n is 56 dkk for catchment 1 and 55 dkk for catchment 2 the marginal abatement cost for both catchments decreases to 83 dkk which is the value of the marginal cost for a kg of n mitigated by mussel farming since it is now responsible for n reductions that would otherwise have higher marginal costs for catchment 1 the n reduction by mussel farming reaches 749 tons of n 35 of the reduction target while other measures are responsible for around 1363 tons the total area used by mussel farming is 593 ha and 95031 ha are used by other measures 17 than the no mussels scenario catchment 2 has 217 tons of n mitigated by mussel farming 32 of the reduction goal and other measures are responsible for around 465 tons of n as for area used mussels occupy 172 ha whereas other measures take up 26045 ha a decrease of 25 from the scenario without mussels 3 4 mussels feed scenario when introducing the possibility to produce mussel feed and sell it at market price both total and marginal costs fall in contrast n reduction due to mussels and the area it occupies rises significantly for catchment 1 with the selling price of feed at 10 dkk the total cost of achieving the target decreases to around 74 4 million dkk a reduction of 44 from the no mussels scenario the mean cost for a kg of n reduced is 35 dkk and the marginal abatement cost falls to 42 dkk n reduction by mussel cultivation reaches 1369 tons 65 of the target and the total area occupied by it is 1084 ha lastly the area allocated to land based measures decreases by 54 to 52963 ha for catchment 2 and a selling price of feed at 10 dkk the total cost decreases to 24 7 million dkk this is a 49 reduction compared to the no mussels scenario the mean cost for reducing emissions by one kg n is 41 dkk the lower marginal abatement cost at 42 dkk leads to mussel farming reaching 63 of the n reduction goal for the catchment the total area used by land based measures drops by 51 to 17072 ha while mussel farming now occupies 343 ha increasing the selling price of mussel feed to 12 dkk per kg further decreases total and marginal costs and increases the share of n reduction done by mussels and the area needed for its cultivation catchment 1 s total cost to achieve the reduction target is reduced by 61 falling to 51 9 million dkk the higher revenue means a lower marginal abatement cost from the social planner s perspective now at 27 dkk per kg of n mussel farming is now responsible for 77 of the catchment s n reduction target removing 1616 tons of n from the fjord the area used by land based measures decreases by 72 to 31956 ha mussel cultivation occupies 1280 ha and the mean cost of reducing n is 25 dkk kg for catchment 2 we see a 65 reduction in total cost decreasing to 17 3 million dkk the mean cost of reducing n is 25 dkk kg with the same parameters for costs and productivity of mussel cultivation as catchment 1 the marginal abatement cost is also 27 dkk consequently the relative weight of mussel farming in n reduction also increases and reaches 82 of the catchment s reduction target at 556 5 tons of n the total area used by mussel farms stands at 441 ha whereas the land based measure s area is reduced by 76 to 8199 ha 3 5 sub scenarios for decreasing productivity lastly we analyze the results for the extra scenarios where the productivity of mussel farming is decreased gradually only catchment 1 is analyzed in these extra scenarios as explained in section 2 1 for the scenario with mussels and no mussel feed the cost reduction starts at 11 and gradually falls until at around 75 of mussel productivity where there would be no savings from having mussel farming as a measure fig 4 when including a market for mussel feed savings start at 61 selling price of feed at 12 dkk and gradually decrease until at around 50 of mussel productivity where there would be no overall cost reduction fig 4 4 discussion this study has demonstrated that mussel farming as a nutrient reduction measure can be cost effective but it has also shown that its suitability is dependent on environmental and market conditions without a market for mussel feed only one of the three catchments initially considered has the environmental conditions to sustain mussels as a mitigation measure even when the environmental status in the fjord waters reached good ecological status catchment 1 would probably see a fall in productivity mainly due to low chl a concentration while the level of reduction in mussel productivity is currently unknown a decrease of 25 50 with a market for feed would remove mussel farming from the most cost effective solutions this would imply that mussel farming should be reduced or even phased out when the water quality reaches good ecological status furthermore catchment 3 does not have suitable environmental conditions for competitive mussel farming even at current conditions our analysis has also shown that the introduction of a market for feed greatly increases the potential for mussel farming as a mitigation measure social costs would fall by as much as 65 catchment 2 price of feed 12 dkk kg when producers can sell the harvested mussels it is clear that the selling price of the feed will have an important impact on how much mussel farming is desirable and also on the total social cost to achieve the reduction targets an increase of 2 dkk in the price per kg of mussel feed increases its share of the reduction target by 12 19 and decreases total cost by 16 17 it is noteworthy however that it is not currently known when the hypothesized reduction in mussel productivity would occur the rate of improvement of the n concentrations in the fjords waters are dependent on the lag time between n loss at the source and its actual arrival at the catchment discharge point this interval may be from a few months to decades 42 however mussel farming has a distinct advantage over most land based measures its effects on n concentration in fjords and coastal waters will happen immediately since it is sequestrating n at its final destination and thus it is not subject to the lag effect experienced by most mitigation measures inland 10 nevertheless it is important to note that it is not effective in reducing nitrogen loads to freshwater bodies such as lakes and rivers in future studies it would be helpful to work in cooperation with hydrological modelers in order to integrate to the analysis knowledge about these lag times the hydrological analysis and subsequent estimation of the specific lag time for a catchment would allow for better analyses of the suitability of mussel farming as an n mitigation measure over time furthermore it is important to consider that in the absence of a market for mussel feed a solution would have to be found for the disposal of the harvested mussels it is not clear yet if farmers would be able to sell it for other purposes such as fertilizer products for agriculture but it might be the case that the disposal of the mussels will come with a cost in that case different conclusions about the cost effectiveness of mussel farming might be drawn especially for catchment 1 as for all empirically based modelling uncertainties in the model parameters can have significant influences on the results however it is expected that our cost estimates for the mussel harvesting and costs of production of feed are likely to decrease in the coming years and improve the competitiveness of mussel farming for nitrogen reduction purposes this paper is based on data from a case study in limfjorden using a pilot mussel farms to evaluate the wider applicability of mussel farms for mitigation purposes it would be important to test transferability of the findings to other settings our analysis illustrates that the factors impacting the potential of mussel farms could come from a range of sources such as leaching coefficients n retention in the area and the opportunity costs from farming the productivity of mussel farms might also vary extensively across space in our study it was possible to collect data on mussel farm productivity from in loco test farms however when such data is not available it is also possible to infer such productivity from growth controlling parameters levels in the area such as temperature salinity and food availability 41 further analysis and test in other localities is needed to evaluate the wider applicability of mussel farms to reach wfd targets at a larger scale it is also important to consider potential negative environmental externalities from mussel cultivation that may occur e g effects on habitats visual amenities and recreation marine habitats close to the farms could be negatively influenced from mussel cultivation as sediments directly below the farms increase in n content 43 conclude that the potential negative water quality effect is outweighed by a net removal of nutrients by harvest but also that there is a knowledge gap related to the potential negative effects on natural habitats mussel farms can also result in negative visual amenity and recreation effects by taking up limited space in the fjords research in limfjorden by ref 44 indicates that the visual impacts of the farms are perceived as negative by local residents and owners of the summer houses in the area but no assessment has been made on the extent and value of this negative externality production costs of mussels can potentially be lowered and productivity increased by introducing new technology such as the smart farm system offered by firms such as smart farm as from norway www smartfarm no accessed on july 04th 2019 according to ref 16 the technology can potentially increase yields up to 300 and while it would require higher capital investments the labor costs for maintenance are estimated to be only around 10 that of traditional systems the initial impression is that the technology is more cost effective than traditional systems however further investigation is required for a full assessment production costs of feed is yet uncertain but there are also efforts to establish a production method that could potentially lower the production costs significantly in the calculations used for this study costs were estimated based on existing technology and methods that were not optimized for mussels especially not smaller mussels which are expected in mussel farming for n mitigation of special importance is to find cheaper ways to separate the meat from the shells and to dry the material to an acceptable level 25 as the organic feed product based on mussel meal is not currently on the market we cannot use market data to reveal the value of the product we have based our scenario assumption on the current market for fishmeal as this is a close substitute however several market trends indicate that this could be a conservative estimate firstly the market for organic farm produce is increasing generating an increased demand for organic feed to animal husbandry secondly it is also expected that the tightening regulations for organic production may also further increase the demand for mussel based feed nielsen personal communication given that mussel farming as an n mitigation measure is a cost effective measure to achieve the wfd targets the next obvious step is to reflect on how this can be integrated into the incentive schemes designed to achieve those targets one proposal could be to include mussel farming in the eu agri environmental schemes and allow national governments to subsidise mussel farmers for their removal of nitrogen for the water bodies in the same way as farmers are paid to implement land based measures such as catch crops 45 also present in the literature is the proposal to develop nutrient trading markets that could potentially integrate land based farmers and mussel farmers 8 14 46 47 such markets are evolving in the us1 in that context a specially interesting proposal is the creation of smart markets for water quality in which similarly to modern electricity markets buyers and sellers submit bids to a central market manager the central manager then uses mathematical optimization to match bids and set prices 48 such system would in theory account for the spatial and temporal interactions that arise from the dispersed and delayed nature of diffuse pollution effects while also addressing the problem of thin trading in nutrient trading markets in such setting as described by ref 49 mussel farmers can help improve market performance by acting as resource banks offering resource permits that would help balance resource allocation over time and increase liquidity 5 conclusion this study has investigated the economic and bio physical conditions under which mussel farming is a cost effective mitigation measure for improving water quality related to excess nitrogen in marine and coastal areas we have developed a mixed integer optimization model including every farm in the catchments surrounding limfjorden denmark scenarios were developed and tested for each catchment varying environmental and market conditions and the results were analyzed in terms of the cost effectiveness and scope of the mitigation measure in contrast to land based measures acknowledging parameter uncertainties the present study has demonstrated that mussel farming is a cost effective measure for n mitigation in two of the three catchments of limfjorden a market for feed albeit greatly increasing its cost effectiveness is not a necessary condition when the environmental conditions are suitable considering the likely scenario that there will be demand for organic mussel feed and that production costs will decrease the parameter space for adequate environmental conditions are expected to increase considerably furthermore the effects of water quality improvements and lower nutrient concentration in water bodies on mussel productivity was shown to have limited consequences in situations where mussel productivity is expected to fall such as in catchment 1 there is still potential for overall cost reductions by including mussel farming as a mitigation measure eutrophication in marine and coastal waters is a cause for concern in europe and arguably worldwide and decision makers are currently striving to find suitable and cost efficient solutions to the problem cost effective land based measures have in many cases already been implemented and efforts to expand implementation are often met with resistance by farmers in that context mussel farming can potentially increase the scope and cost effectiveness of incentive schemes aimed at reducing eutrophication in marine and coastal waters in locations where environmental conditions allow credit authorship contribution statement raphael filippelli conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis data curation writing original draft writing

8684,cost benefit analysis cba of flood risk adaptation strategies offers policymakers insight into economically optimal strategies for adapting to sea level rise however building level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales which may result in sub optimal investment decisions in this paper we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro scale cba at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area we apply this approach to venice beach in los angeles and naples in long beach we subsequently compare our results with the conventional spatially aggregated area based cba approach our findings show that a mix of 35 45 dry floodproofing measures and 55 65 building elevation measures is optimal elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths while dry floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths the optimal mix of measures derived from our micro scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85 higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach we therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale or that cbas are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth keywords adaptation building level climate change cost benefit analysis flood risk analysis sea level rise 1 introduction floods are devastating natural disasters costing thousands of lives in 2017 alone 1 2 population and economic growth have been major drivers of flood risk over time and they are expected to raise future exposure to flooding 3 in addition climate change and sea level rise may further increase the frequency and severity of flood hazards 4 and therefore further increase future flood risk low lying cities in particular are concentrated areas of economic activity population and wealth which makes them vulnerable to the effects of climate change hallegatte 5 and others e g refs 6 7 show the necessity of city and local scale flood risk assessments and the development of adaptation policies to cope with local specificities a number of strategies are available to limit flood risk including structural adaptation measures nature based solutions or building level adaptation measures 8 11 structural adaptation measures and nature based solutions are difficult to implement in certain cases because they often require large upfront investments and their long term benefits are uncertain meaning that decision makers face the risk of making irreversible inefficient economic choices 12 furthermore especially in urban areas or cities space is limited and the need to account for diverse stakeholders interests can make adaptation planning highly complex 9 12 13 alternatively building level adaptation measures usually require less space and the involvement of fewer actors these measures may be divided into three main types 1 elevation of the building to prevent flooding 2 dry floodproofing to prevent flood water from entering the building and 3 wet floodproofing to allow water to enter the building but minimizing damage e g using concrete floors instead of carpets besides often being relatively cheap building level adaptation measures can be enforced by municipalities or flood insurance by specifying a minimum requirement for floodproofing structures in flood zones 14 in addition building level adaptation can be incentivized through a premium discount for flood insurance 15 16 hence building level adaptation is not necessarily an individualistic choice but is often designed implemented and enforced on a community level nevertheless homeowners can go beyond these minimum requirements for example by floodproofing their building up to a higher than required height most studies that evaluate the costs and benefits of flood risk adaptation measures for individual buildings e g refs 17 19 assess the aggregated economic efficiency of applying a single adaptation measure to all buildings in a large area with a particular flood inundation depth for example 1 m 3 3 ft elevation is applied to all buildings in a 100 year flood zone however such an approach can result in economic inefficiencies if say a building in a 100 year flood zone is expected to flood up to 10 cm 0 3 ft it is unlikely that the benefits of adaptation will outweigh related investment costs for that particular building conversely the same 100 year flood zone could include buildings for which the chosen adaptation measure does not offer sufficient protection in particular higher elevation could be more economically efficient for certain buildings because of higher expected inundation depths during a flood such differences cannot be identified through commonly applied cost benefit analyses cba conducted on aggregated spatial scales which can result in sub optimal investment decisions on an individual building scale aggregated scale cba approaches could discourage policymakers from implementing and enforcing individually focused adaptation measures by suggesting that these measures are inefficient at the aggregate level even if they are efficient for particular buildings in this paper we aim to assess the effects of spatial scales when assessing the economic efficiency of building level adaptation we first assess optimal adaptation measures on an individual building level by developing a flood risk model combined with a so called micro scale cba we then compare the economic efficiency yielded by the micro scale cba with that obtained through a conventional area based approach in which a single measure is evaluated for a larger area or a community scale we illustrate our method with a case study of venice beach los angeles ca and naples long beach ca which are both vulnerable to coastal flooding and sea level rise 2 methods fig 1 illustrates our overall methodological approach that is summarized here and explained in more detail in the following subsections the costs and benefits of adaptation measures were assessed in order to evaluate the economic desirability of these measures flood risk was estimated in terms of expected annual damage ead section 2 1 similar to refs 19 21 which can be defined as the product of hazard exposure and vulnerability exposure was considered in terms of the value of individual buildings i e single family home apartment shop school etc at risk of flooding the hazard was represented through inundation maps showing inundation extents and depths for flood events in four climate scenarios the current climate and climates with sea level rises of 75 cm 150 cm and 200 cm 2 5 ft 4 9 ft and 6 7 ft lastly vulnerability was defined as the susceptibility to damage of different building types based on the relationship between inundation depth and building value expressed in the form of depth damage curves individually focused adaptation measures change the vulnerability of individual buildings and this change was used to calculate the reduction in ead in other words the expected annual benefit yielded by the adaptation measure in terms of adaptation costs aerts et al 9 11 provide average figures per building type in los angeles county also see table 1 using an individual building data set for los angeles county the average adaptation costs were converted to costs per square meter next adaptation costs per unique building were determined using unit costs per square meter subsequently a micro scale cba was conducted to calculate the economic efficiency of each adaptation measure for each individual building in the 100 year flood zone expressed as the net present value npv section 2 2 the npv is the sum of discounted costs and discounted benefits over an adaptation measure s lifetime the measure with the highest npv represents the economically optimal measure for a specific building 2 1 flood risk model the usgs coastal storm modeling system cosmos 3 0 22 25 has produced flood hazard maps of flood extent and depth for flood events with 20 and 100 year recurrence intervals which we used for our study 2 2 m resolution these flood hazard maps are available for the current climate and the three sea level rise scenarios 75 cm 150 cm and 200 cm by 2100 in line with the scenarios recommended by the california ocean protection council science advisory team 26 while there is still uncertainty regarding the pace of future sea level rise recent research shows that current projections might be underestimated e g 27 29 griggs et al 26 show that a rise of more than 2 m 6 6 ft in sea levels is not unlikely for the representative concentration pathway 8 5 cosmos couples atmospheric and hydrodynamic computer models to estimate flood hazard potential from coastal storms sea level rise and shoreline change 22 it computes total water levels until 2100 on a regional scale using winds sea level pressures and sea surface temperatures derived from global climate models 22 cosmos dynamically downscales regional storm conditions by using a set of nested models delftrd wave and delftrd flow 22 exposure data was obtained from the los angeles region imagery acquisition consortium s lar iac building level data 30 and the university of southern california spatial sciences institute s usc ssi parcel data 31 resulting in a data set including individual buildings characteristics such as surface area and building type the building types were reclassified to match those used in the hazus mh model 32 a flood damage model commonly used in the us that comprises 33 unique building types see supplementary information 1 the hazus mh model also supplies depth damage curves and maximum damage values per building type depth damage curves represent the relationship between a building type s inundation depth and its associated percentual damage per building the total damage was calculated by multiplying its damage share from the depth damage curves by the associated building type s maximum damage depth damage curves were adjusted according to aerts et al 2014 12 to represent an adapted building fig 2 shows an example of a depth damage curve for a single family dwelling and how it varies with different types of adaptation in the case of elevation the curve is shifted to represent the elevation height similar to aerts et al 12 we assumed a risk reduction of 75 and 30 for dry floodproofing and wet floodproofing heights respectively when inundation levels overtop the floodproofing height dry floodproofing will cease to provide any benefits while wet floodproofing will continue to reduce risk for all adaptation measures we assumed an 80 year lifespan 12 33 the damages per flood event 1 20 and 1 100 were then converted to ead defined as the integral of the probability exceedance curve similar to refs 12 19 eq 1 1 e a d p m i n p m a x d p d p eq 1 d p represents damage caused by a storm event with probability of occurrence p and p m i n and p m a x are the lowest and highest probability storms respectively to work around the limited availability of different storm events we assumed no damage below 10 year storms and 100 year storm damages for lower probability events this yielded a conservative estimation of risk the difference between the ead with and without adaptation are the benefits of the adaptation measure per year as used in the cba 2 2 micro scale cost benefit analysis we applied a scenario based cba approach for each individual building by evaluating the costs and benefits of adaptation measures in four sea level rise scenarios the first case assumed current climatic conditions while the other three involved sea level rises of 75 cm 150 cm and 200 cm 2 5 ft 4 9 ft and 6 7 ft by 2100 we applied three main types of adaptation measures elevation dry floodproofing and wet floodproofing 1 1 theoretically implementation of wet floodproofing can in specific cases reduce flood risk of nearby properties as flood water is retained within the building however this would only occur if the flood water volume is limited which can be the case if local floods are caused by extreme precipitation events but this is not the case for coastal floods as considered in this study each measure is evaluated at 60 cm 122 cm and 183 cm 2 ft 4 ft and 6 ft above current ground floor level we further tested elevation at 244 cm 8 ft we realize that dry floodproofing is often not suitable at more than 122 cm 4 ft above ground floor level due to potential issues of structural stability 34 however structural stability is highly building specific since it depends on a building s age and construction quality therefore most flood adaptation studies still apply a 183 cm 6 ft dry or wet floodproofing scenario to illustrate these measures potential when structural stability allows it 8 9 table 1 shows the average cost estimates for elevation of existing buildings and dry and wet floodproofing buildings these costs are based on estimates from the federal emergency management agency fema and scaled to reflect higher los angeles county construction costs the costs for elevation of existing buildings depend on the foundation building materials and if the building has a basement or crawl space for wet floodproofing the average costs are based on measures such as relocating utility installations above flood levels and using water resistant building materials dry floodproofing measures include sealing walls with waterproof coatings reinforcing walls to resist the hydrostatic pressure of flood water and installing measures to prevent floodwater to enter the building through the sewer for a detail description see fema 34 and aerts et al 14 the npv of the individual building level cba was calculated as per eq 2 2 n p v b a t 1 t b b a t 1 r t c b a 0 the equation shows the npv for building b in the 100 year flood zone and adaptation measure a starting in 2010 for a lifespan t of 80 years and a discount rate r of 4 as commonly used in studies in the us 12 35 a sensitivity analysis with a discount rate of 7 is included in the supplementary information 2 section but the rest of this paper refers to results obtained with the 4 discount rate b b a t are the benefits over time for building b and adaptation measure a c b a 0 are the initial investment costs for building b and adaptation measure a data on adaptation measures maintenance costs are lacking although these costs are often assumed to be negligible 11 subsequently the optimal mix of adaptation measures was composed by selecting the type of measure that yields the highest positive npv per building in the 100 year flood zone eq 3 3 n p v o p t i m a l max b 1 b n p v b a n p v b a 0 we also conducted a conventional spatially aggregated area based approach in which a single measure is evaluated for a whole area in order to compare its results to those yielded by our micro scale cba the aggregated npv of the area based approach was calculated by adding the npv values of all buildings for a specific measure eq 4 4 n p v s i n g l e m e a s u r e b 1 b n p v b s i n g l e m e a s u r e 3 case study venice beach and naples with a population of 9 8 million los angeles county is illustrative of a major metropolitan area vulnerable to coastal flooding due to its low lying geography and high exposure of economic assets 27 36 coastal flooding in los angeles county is mainly caused by tides storm surges wave driven run up or a combination of these factors 22 24 25 the county s current vulnerability was demonstrated in 2010 when an el niño fueled storm produced waves that were 7 5 m 22 ft high causing significant coastal erosion and flooding in certain coastal communities 37 38 current sea level rise projections range from 0 93 m 3 ft by 2100 according to the national research council 39 to a worst case scenario of 3 m 10 ft by 2100 according to a working group of the california ocean protection council science advisory team 26 two vulnerable coastal areas in los angeles county were considered as case studies venice beach including marina del rey and naples see fig 3 venice beach is part of one of the most famous coastal stretches worldwide providing the county with major economic benefits in terms of tourism ecosystem services and coastal protection 9 40 however cosmos s recent projections 22 25 show that sea level rise and erosion threaten to increase flood risk significantly for example de ruig et al 41 have estimated an increase of over 100 mln yr between now and 2100 in a 200 cm 6 6 ft sea level rise scenario in venice beach and santa monica including indirect losses and infrastructure damages naples is a high value residential area in the city of long beach which is already vulnerable to high tides and storms according to projected sea level rise scenarios naples will be highly susceptible to flooding building elevation is a potential way to cope with the increasing flood risk 9 venice beach and naples have distinct characteristics in terms of flood risk flood risk in naples is already high and will only increase further with sea level rise it is currently low in venice beach because of the area s elevated beach front but sea level rise could reach a threshold that results in significantly greater risk currently beach nourishment is used to maintain the beaches that also provide important coastal flood protection 42 furthermore communities participate in the national flood insurance program and most of the coastal cities have agreed to comply with the fema s minimum elevation requirements as well as the california building code regulations for flood zoning and flood proofing 14 aerts et al 14 shows the potential of different types of adaptation strategies which were derived from a 3 year participatory stakeholder approach all these strategies included improved beach nourishment to keep up with the pace of sea level rise other proposed measures include storm surge barriers dikes underneath beaches and roads elevated to act as levees moreover the proposed resilient pathway includes the enforcement of building level adaptation measures on a community level 4 results 4 1 exposure flood risk and the optimal mix of adaptation measures table 2 shows the number of buildings exposed to a 100 year flood zone and the associated risk in the different sea level rise scenarios in addition it shows the percentage of buildings with the possibility of implementing a cost efficient adaptation measure as well as the mix of economically optimal measures 4 1 1 naples we found that a 200 cm sea level rise increased exposure in naples from 2920 buildings currently to 8246 buildings mainly caused by a larger flood extent in the 75 cm sea level rise scenario exposure increased from 2920 buildings to 5242 buildings total flood risk increased due to this rise in exposure in addition the average risk per building increased from 2400 yr to 8600 yr due to higher inundation depths caused by sea level rise a large share of buildings in naples between 93 3 and 99 had at least one cost efficient adaptation option in each scenario buildings for which adaptation measures were not cost efficient tended to be larger than the average single family dwelling and faced minimal expected water depths during a flood event for these buildings repairing the damage would be more economically efficient than investing in adaptation the mix of optimal adaptation types shifted from mainly dry floodproofing 97 8 in the current climate scenario to a more even distribution of dry floodproofing and elevation in the sea level rise scenarios 35 45 dry floodproofing and 55 65 elevation we often found the elevation of existing buildings to be economically efficient only in high sea level rise scenarios due to large upfront investment costs the damage reduction attained through wet floodproofing is less significant than that attained through dry floodproofing but still reduce damage even if inundation depths exceed floodproofing heights in addition certain types of assessed buildings such as multi family dwellings and commercial buildings are not normally elevated leaving only dry floodproofing and wet floodproofing as adaptation options therefore we observe only a small share of wet floodproofed buildings 0 3 1 7 located in areas with high inundation depths where dry floodproofing was not suitable and the building type did not allow for elevation 4 1 2 venice beach table 2 also shows that venice beach was barely vulnerable to flooding in the current climate scenario with only three buildings experiencing flood damage during an 100 year flood event in the 75 cm and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios exposure equaled 112 and 231 vulnerable buildings respectively these values are considerably lower than those obtained for naples still we found the average flood risk per building to be approximately 25 000 yr in the current climate scenario for example naples had an exposure of 2920 buildings and 6 8 mln yr in risk meanwhile in the 150 cm sea level rise scenario venice beach had an exposure of only 231 buildings but 6 6 mln yr in risk this high average risk in venice beach mainly originated from large residential multi dwellings being flooded in marina del rey in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios approximately 97 of the vulnerable buildings in venice beach had a cost efficient adaptation option with dry floodproofing being most cost efficient in these scenarios only buildings in marina del rey flooded since they were mostly large buildings with relatively shallow inundation depths dry floodproofing was the preferred adaptation measure however the 200 cm sea level rise scenario showed a significant increase in exposure and associated risk with 5961 vulnerable buildings and 50 mln yr in risk this sudden increase suggests a potential risk threshold between 150 cm and 200 cm of sea level rise of the 5961 vulnerable buildings in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario 97 3 had a cost efficient adaptation option and the share of dry floodproofing wet floodproofing and elevation 47 1 and 52 respectively was similar to that found in naples in terms of exposure naples and venice beach are comparable they boast high value residential buildings constructed around the beach or harbors however in terms of hazard venice beach s relatively high beachfront and marina would prevent flooding in lower sea level rise scenarios nonetheless results suggest that a comparable mix of dry floodproofing wet floodproofing and elevation measures would be optimal in both areas we analyze these measures spatial distribution in more detail in the following section 4 2 spatial distribution of optimal adaptation measures 4 2 1 naples fig 4 shows the inundation maps for a 100 year storm and the spatial distribution of the most cost efficient mix of adaptation measures for naples inundation depth was relatively shallow 1 m in the current climate scenario in some areas such as the peninsula the islands and a few parts of belmont however the flood extent increases significantly in belmont and expands to marina pacifica in the sea level rise scenarios in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario inundation depths in the peninsula the islands and parts of belmont increased up to 3 m the heavily inundated area shown south of los cerritos channel represents an oil field and a wetland these are not considered in this study in the current climate scenario 2 ft and 4 ft dry floodproofing was often the most cost efficient measure as inundation depth increased due to sea level rise however elevation became cost efficient more frequently this was particularly noticeable when comparing the current climate scenario and the 75 cm sea level rise scenario in other words dry floodproofing was often more efficient at shallow inundation depths even though dry floodproofing is a relatively cheap and effective measure we found it to be inadequate when inundation depths exceeded the floodproofing height as a result elevation was more economically desirable in areas and scenarios with higher inundation depths despite higher investment costs moreover in certain areas increasing sea levels led to a substantial average increase in optimal elevation and dry floodproofing heights said heights however presented a large spatial variety for example in the 75 cm sea level rise scenario both elevation and dry floodproofing were predominantly optimal at 4 ft meanwhile in the peninsula certain island streets and parts of belmont the optimal elevation and dry floodproofing height was 6 ft in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario the optimal elevation height was predominantly 8 ft however especially at the edges of the flooded area or in newly flooded areas optimal dry floodproofing and elevation heights were often found to be 2 ft and 4 ft respectively as previously observed wet floodproofing was only suitable if inundation depth exceeded dry floodproofing height and the building s land use type did not allow for elevation in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario for example wet floodproofing proved to be the most efficient adaptation measure for commercial buildings on east 2nd street in belmont 4 2 2 venice beach as shown in fig 5 inundation caused by a 100 year storm in venice beach was limited in the current climate scenario in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios inundation expanded to marina del rey but remained below 1 m however when sea level rise exceeded a certain threshold inundation was substantial and extended to residential neighborhoods in certain parts inundation depths reached over 3 m overtopping of flood water in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario mainly occurred near ballona lagoon and marina del rey reflecting the beaches importance in protecting other areas from flooding in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios the only noticeable inundation took place in marina del rey as it was relatively shallow inundation dry floodproofing was the most economically efficient option in the 150 cm sea level rise scenario floodproofing heights increased in certain parts of the marina this was also the case in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario with dry floodproofing up to 4 ft and 6 ft being most economically efficient in highly inundated parts of residential neighborhoods 8 ft elevation was the most economically efficient option while dry floodproofing predominated at the edge of the flooded area meanwhile a number of multi family dwellings located around west washington boulevard experienced high inundation depths making dry floodproofing unsuitable and wet floodproofing the most economically efficient measure the spatial variety of adaptation measures and respective heights followed a similar pattern to that found in higher sea level rise scenarios in naples for example even only a small area of about 500 m in radius to the north of marina del rey and to the east of west washington boulevard show a wide variety of optimal measures elevations of 4 ft 6 ft and 8 ft and dry floodproofing of 2 ft 4 ft and 6 ft the following subsection illustrates how our micro scale cba performed against an aggregated approach in which only one measure is evaluated for an entire area 4 3 comparison of area based adaptation vs optimal adaptation efficiencies as shown in fig 6 we compared between the optimal mix of building level adaptation measures yielded by our micro scale cba and the measures yielded by an area based cba in which only one adaptation type was used to evaluate the aggregated npv of implementing a specific measure in that area we have indicated in the area based cba results which height was most cost efficient the electronic supplementary information contains full results for all scenarios and adaptation options see supplementary information 3 in both naples and venice beach the micro scale cba always resulted in a substantially more efficient mix of adaptation measures than the area based cba as an illustration the npv yielded by the micro scale approach in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario in naples was 250 mln higher than that yielded by the area based approach this constitutes an increase of 33 according to the area based cbas in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios a dry floodproofing of 6 ft in naples resulted in the highest npv however this dry floodproofing height is not always suitable for different types of buildings and fema recommends not exceeding 4 ft of dry floodproofing and use elevation instead 34 specifically in the 150 cm sea level rise scenario using 4 ft rather than 6 ft of dry floodproofing decreased the npv by almost 400 mln according to an area based cba when the 6 ft dry floodproofing was removed from the optimal mix of adaptation measures economic efficiency decreased by only 77 mln venice beach has a difference in npv of about 300 mln when comparing the optimal mix of adaptation measures and the area based cba with only 6 ft dry floodproofing for the 200 cm sea level rise scenario this is an increase of 85 in npv almost doubling for the micro scale cba when compared with the area based cba out of 5961 vulnerable buildings only 5 4 had 6 ft dry floodproofing as the most economically efficient measure in the micro scale cba even though 6 ft dry floodproofing was the most efficient measure according to an area based cba in other words while 6 ft dry floodproofing was the best measure on an aggregated scale the area based cba resulted in sub optimal adaptation measures for 94 6 of the buildings in the area for example in areas with high inundation depths i e between 2 m and 3 m elevation was significantly more efficient with 8 ft elevation in particular being optimal in 39 4 of buildings according to the micro scale cba however if 8 ft elevation were to be applied to all vulnerable buildings including those in areas with shallow inundation depths aggregated economic efficiencies would decrease considerably these findings suggest that measures performance and efficiency on an individual building level depend strongly on local inundation depths 5 discussion 5 1 the importance of scales and data availability in many cases studies evaluate the effectiveness of a measure in a given case study area i e a flood zone a neighborhood a sub watershed etc 18 19 43 they implicitly assume that hazard conditions e g water depth are homogenous throughout the studied area this is however rarely the case in particular an increase of up to 85 in economic efficiency can be achieved by optimizing adaptation measures such as floodproofing at an individual building level instead of applying a single measure to an entire area this increase would be even more pronounced in certain areas such as large polder areas in the netherlands which would have high exposure and highly varied flood inundation depths in case of an event 44 45 evaluating a single building level measure in an exceedingly large area can easily result in inefficiencies but this does not mean that a measure cannot be effective in certain specific locations our results show that local scale adaptation assessments should use the smallest scale possible however even in the us building level data are often only collected per county and are not always made publicly available in addition data sets are often outdated because collecting such data is very costly and resource intensive hence using a multi source gis data set or volunteered geographic information sources such as open street maps might become integral to such models as it could provide updated and detailed building level information 46 47 however if building level data sets are persistently difficult to acquire we recommend that these localized assessments disaggregate the evaluated area not only to flood zones based on probability such as 100 or 500 year flood zones but also to different inundation depth ranges our results show a distinct pattern of adaptation types based on inundation depths for example dry floodproofing performs most efficiently in areas with shallow inundation depths buildings inundation depths in smaller disaggregated areas are relatively homogeneous which results in two advantages first a single adaptation measure turns out to be most suitable within each area e g 2 ft dry floodproofing in an area with an expected inundation depth 2 ft second we may evaluate the types of adaptation used in different areas such as dry floodproofing in shallow inundation areas and elevation in deep inundation areas 5 2 building level versus community level adaptation homeowners often do not have access to detailed studies about the costs and benefits of floodproofing their property and their perceptions of flood risk and the effectiveness of floodproofing measures are often incorrect 48 49 in reality data suggests that homeowners are on average not inclined to install floodproofing measures even when living in flood plains communicating about the flood risk homeowners face potentially increases the willingness of homeowners to protect their property 50 51 however communicating only about flood probabilities has been shown to be less effective than also communicating about the options for risk reduction measures 52 54 this study contributes to the design of more effective communication strategies by providing information about the most cost effective floodproofing measure per building instead of about a best practice measure for an aggregated area which has been shown to be less economically efficient furthermore the outcomes of our study are applicable in the design implementation and enforcement of adaptation measures and strategies for communities venice beach and naples are densely populated with high value residences but stakeholders have indicated to prefer adaptation options that have the least amount of impact on the coast both aesthetically and practically for the implementation of larger structural measures local assessments must be made to comply to the regulations set by local coastal programs and the california coastal commission currently building codes are already used to enforce a minimum of building level adaptation measures in an area but we show that using the smallest scale possible for evaluating such measures could significantly increase economic efficiency even if the building level adaptation measures are part of a larger adaptation strategy or designed for a larger area evaluating these measures on the individual level can improve the accuracy of these analyses 5 3 barriers to the implementation of adaptation measures the un has stipulated in the paris agreement that if global temperature rises more than 1 5 c the effects of climate change including sea level rise will become unacceptably high several studies that focused on global risk e g refs 55 56 have found that beyond such a threshold risk can increase substantially in los angeles county a 200 cm sea level rise by 2100 is possible if global warming follows a high emission scenario e g the representative concentration pathway 8 5 26 the case of venice beach illustrates the local impact that rise in sea levels beyond such a threshold would have water would overtop the beaches and the marina flooding the lower back area consequently risk increases substantially once this tipping point has been reached besides illustrating the importance of including extreme scenarios e g a 200 cm sea level rise by 2100 in economic evaluation studies our result also showcases how difficult it is for policymakers to plan for tipping points if a tipping point is likely to be reached in the near future adaptation is necessary however if it is not reached adaptation will have proven economically inefficient certain studies e g refs 41 57 58 have assessed pathways to adjust adaptation strategies based on thresholds for variables such as sea level rise still there are substantial gaps in knowledge when it comes to forecasting the environmental and economic impact of tipping points or planning how to prepare for them large upfront investment costs can also be a major barrier to the implementation of flood adaptation measures 12 59 60 due to the uncertainty of climate change projections and the lack of knowledge on the effects of climate change policymakers are afraid of making sub optimal irreversible investments 12 60 a number of economic evaluation methods have been developed to deal with current uncertainty regarding climate change e g real option analysis portfolio analysis but they are often resource intensive and technically complex 59 even when resources are available and these methods are applied their technical complexity makes them difficult to implement in a practical policy setting especially when large investments are involved 59 cost benefit analysis is generally accepted as a clear means of informing policymakers about the costs and benefits of large adaptation investments however as our study has shown caution should be taken when individual building level adaptation is considered as part of an adaptation strategy the comparison between our micro scale cba and the area based cba shows that the former can result in a significant decrease in upfront investment costs in naples investment costs for the most economically efficient area based elevation options in the 75 150 and 200 cm sea level rise scenarios are approximately 231 mln 316 mln and 414 mln respectively as a result of our micro scale cba these costs decrease by 36 2 32 5 and 26 9 respectively in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario our micro scale cba yields a decrease of 33 in the investment costs of an 8 ft elevation in venice beach relative to the area based cba lower upfront investment costs can drive implementation of adaptation strategies 60 which is a further strength of the micro scale cba approach 6 conclusion climate change and socio economic development are expected to exacerbate the global impact of flooding as a response to increasing flood risk investments in flood adaptation are necessary individual building level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or elevation can be implemented to reduce flood damage to structures cost benefit analysis is often used to evaluate the economic efficiency of flood adaptation strategies however to assess the economic efficiency of individual building level adaptation measures it is standard to apply a spatially aggregated cba in which a single measure is evaluated for an entire area this study presents to our knowledge the first micro scale cba that evaluates and optimizes the economic efficiency of adaptation measures on an individual building level yielding an optimal mix of measures for each given area we compared our findings to those obtained through the conventional spatially aggregated area based approach our new micro scale method is widely applicable to other geographical regions if detailed building data are available the method s local scale makes it helpful to policymakers planning individual building level adaptation measures we applied our method to a case study of two areas of the los angeles county coast that are vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise venice beach and naples both areas have high value beachfront residential properties making individual building adaptation to coastal flooding viable according to our findings the optimal mix of measures consists of 35 45 dry floodproofing and 55 65 elevation elevation is optimal in areas with high inundation depths while dry floodproofing performs best in areas with shallow inundation depths in all evaluated sea level rise scenarios the optimal mix of measures results in higher economic efficiencies than those yielded by the conventional area based cba method in a 200 cm sea level rise scenario in venice beach for example it results in an increase of economic efficiency npv up to 85 our approach can help policymakers explore flood adaptation strategies by providing them with a more complete view on the efficiency of individual adaptation measures in addition it can help educate homeowners on available adaptation options for their properties as well as on the most suitable adaptation type regarding future research we recommend that evaluations of building level adaptation measures be conducted at the smallest possible scale multi source gis data sets or volunteered geographic information sources e g open street maps could be useful platforms in acquiring such micro scale data if other sources are unavailable or inaccessible if individual building data is still not available we recommend that cbas be performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth in order to obtain the optimal mix of adaptation measures per area funding this work was supported by the

8684,cost benefit analysis cba of flood risk adaptation strategies offers policymakers insight into economically optimal strategies for adapting to sea level rise however building level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales which may result in sub optimal investment decisions in this paper we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro scale cba at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area we apply this approach to venice beach in los angeles and naples in long beach we subsequently compare our results with the conventional spatially aggregated area based cba approach our findings show that a mix of 35 45 dry floodproofing measures and 55 65 building elevation measures is optimal elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths while dry floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths the optimal mix of measures derived from our micro scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85 higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach we therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale or that cbas are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth keywords adaptation building level climate change cost benefit analysis flood risk analysis sea level rise 1 introduction floods are devastating natural disasters costing thousands of lives in 2017 alone 1 2 population and economic growth have been major drivers of flood risk over time and they are expected to raise future exposure to flooding 3 in addition climate change and sea level rise may further increase the frequency and severity of flood hazards 4 and therefore further increase future flood risk low lying cities in particular are concentrated areas of economic activity population and wealth which makes them vulnerable to the effects of climate change hallegatte 5 and others e g refs 6 7 show the necessity of city and local scale flood risk assessments and the development of adaptation policies to cope with local specificities a number of strategies are available to limit flood risk including structural adaptation measures nature based solutions or building level adaptation measures 8 11 structural adaptation measures and nature based solutions are difficult to implement in certain cases because they often require large upfront investments and their long term benefits are uncertain meaning that decision makers face the risk of making irreversible inefficient economic choices 12 furthermore especially in urban areas or cities space is limited and the need to account for diverse stakeholders interests can make adaptation planning highly complex 9 12 13 alternatively building level adaptation measures usually require less space and the involvement of fewer actors these measures may be divided into three main types 1 elevation of the building to prevent flooding 2 dry floodproofing to prevent flood water from entering the building and 3 wet floodproofing to allow water to enter the building but minimizing damage e g using concrete floors instead of carpets besides often being relatively cheap building level adaptation measures can be enforced by municipalities or flood insurance by specifying a minimum requirement for floodproofing structures in flood zones 14 in addition building level adaptation can be incentivized through a premium discount for flood insurance 15 16 hence building level adaptation is not necessarily an individualistic choice but is often designed implemented and enforced on a community level nevertheless homeowners can go beyond these minimum requirements for example by floodproofing their building up to a higher than required height most studies that evaluate the costs and benefits of flood risk adaptation measures for individual buildings e g refs 17 19 assess the aggregated economic efficiency of applying a single adaptation measure to all buildings in a large area with a particular flood inundation depth for example 1 m 3 3 ft elevation is applied to all buildings in a 100 year flood zone however such an approach can result in economic inefficiencies if say a building in a 100 year flood zone is expected to flood up to 10 cm 0 3 ft it is unlikely that the benefits of adaptation will outweigh related investment costs for that particular building conversely the same 100 year flood zone could include buildings for which the chosen adaptation measure does not offer sufficient protection in particular higher elevation could be more economically efficient for certain buildings because of higher expected inundation depths during a flood such differences cannot be identified through commonly applied cost benefit analyses cba conducted on aggregated spatial scales which can result in sub optimal investment decisions on an individual building scale aggregated scale cba approaches could discourage policymakers from implementing and enforcing individually focused adaptation measures by suggesting that these measures are inefficient at the aggregate level even if they are efficient for particular buildings in this paper we aim to assess the effects of spatial scales when assessing the economic efficiency of building level adaptation we first assess optimal adaptation measures on an individual building level by developing a flood risk model combined with a so called micro scale cba we then compare the economic efficiency yielded by the micro scale cba with that obtained through a conventional area based approach in which a single measure is evaluated for a larger area or a community scale we illustrate our method with a case study of venice beach los angeles ca and naples long beach ca which are both vulnerable to coastal flooding and sea level rise 2 methods fig 1 illustrates our overall methodological approach that is summarized here and explained in more detail in the following subsections the costs and benefits of adaptation measures were assessed in order to evaluate the economic desirability of these measures flood risk was estimated in terms of expected annual damage ead section 2 1 similar to refs 19 21 which can be defined as the product of hazard exposure and vulnerability exposure was considered in terms of the value of individual buildings i e single family home apartment shop school etc at risk of flooding the hazard was represented through inundation maps showing inundation extents and depths for flood events in four climate scenarios the current climate and climates with sea level rises of 75 cm 150 cm and 200 cm 2 5 ft 4 9 ft and 6 7 ft lastly vulnerability was defined as the susceptibility to damage of different building types based on the relationship between inundation depth and building value expressed in the form of depth damage curves individually focused adaptation measures change the vulnerability of individual buildings and this change was used to calculate the reduction in ead in other words the expected annual benefit yielded by the adaptation measure in terms of adaptation costs aerts et al 9 11 provide average figures per building type in los angeles county also see table 1 using an individual building data set for los angeles county the average adaptation costs were converted to costs per square meter next adaptation costs per unique building were determined using unit costs per square meter subsequently a micro scale cba was conducted to calculate the economic efficiency of each adaptation measure for each individual building in the 100 year flood zone expressed as the net present value npv section 2 2 the npv is the sum of discounted costs and discounted benefits over an adaptation measure s lifetime the measure with the highest npv represents the economically optimal measure for a specific building 2 1 flood risk model the usgs coastal storm modeling system cosmos 3 0 22 25 has produced flood hazard maps of flood extent and depth for flood events with 20 and 100 year recurrence intervals which we used for our study 2 2 m resolution these flood hazard maps are available for the current climate and the three sea level rise scenarios 75 cm 150 cm and 200 cm by 2100 in line with the scenarios recommended by the california ocean protection council science advisory team 26 while there is still uncertainty regarding the pace of future sea level rise recent research shows that current projections might be underestimated e g 27 29 griggs et al 26 show that a rise of more than 2 m 6 6 ft in sea levels is not unlikely for the representative concentration pathway 8 5 cosmos couples atmospheric and hydrodynamic computer models to estimate flood hazard potential from coastal storms sea level rise and shoreline change 22 it computes total water levels until 2100 on a regional scale using winds sea level pressures and sea surface temperatures derived from global climate models 22 cosmos dynamically downscales regional storm conditions by using a set of nested models delftrd wave and delftrd flow 22 exposure data was obtained from the los angeles region imagery acquisition consortium s lar iac building level data 30 and the university of southern california spatial sciences institute s usc ssi parcel data 31 resulting in a data set including individual buildings characteristics such as surface area and building type the building types were reclassified to match those used in the hazus mh model 32 a flood damage model commonly used in the us that comprises 33 unique building types see supplementary information 1 the hazus mh model also supplies depth damage curves and maximum damage values per building type depth damage curves represent the relationship between a building type s inundation depth and its associated percentual damage per building the total damage was calculated by multiplying its damage share from the depth damage curves by the associated building type s maximum damage depth damage curves were adjusted according to aerts et al 2014 12 to represent an adapted building fig 2 shows an example of a depth damage curve for a single family dwelling and how it varies with different types of adaptation in the case of elevation the curve is shifted to represent the elevation height similar to aerts et al 12 we assumed a risk reduction of 75 and 30 for dry floodproofing and wet floodproofing heights respectively when inundation levels overtop the floodproofing height dry floodproofing will cease to provide any benefits while wet floodproofing will continue to reduce risk for all adaptation measures we assumed an 80 year lifespan 12 33 the damages per flood event 1 20 and 1 100 were then converted to ead defined as the integral of the probability exceedance curve similar to refs 12 19 eq 1 1 e a d p m i n p m a x d p d p eq 1 d p represents damage caused by a storm event with probability of occurrence p and p m i n and p m a x are the lowest and highest probability storms respectively to work around the limited availability of different storm events we assumed no damage below 10 year storms and 100 year storm damages for lower probability events this yielded a conservative estimation of risk the difference between the ead with and without adaptation are the benefits of the adaptation measure per year as used in the cba 2 2 micro scale cost benefit analysis we applied a scenario based cba approach for each individual building by evaluating the costs and benefits of adaptation measures in four sea level rise scenarios the first case assumed current climatic conditions while the other three involved sea level rises of 75 cm 150 cm and 200 cm 2 5 ft 4 9 ft and 6 7 ft by 2100 we applied three main types of adaptation measures elevation dry floodproofing and wet floodproofing 1 1 theoretically implementation of wet floodproofing can in specific cases reduce flood risk of nearby properties as flood water is retained within the building however this would only occur if the flood water volume is limited which can be the case if local floods are caused by extreme precipitation events but this is not the case for coastal floods as considered in this study each measure is evaluated at 60 cm 122 cm and 183 cm 2 ft 4 ft and 6 ft above current ground floor level we further tested elevation at 244 cm 8 ft we realize that dry floodproofing is often not suitable at more than 122 cm 4 ft above ground floor level due to potential issues of structural stability 34 however structural stability is highly building specific since it depends on a building s age and construction quality therefore most flood adaptation studies still apply a 183 cm 6 ft dry or wet floodproofing scenario to illustrate these measures potential when structural stability allows it 8 9 table 1 shows the average cost estimates for elevation of existing buildings and dry and wet floodproofing buildings these costs are based on estimates from the federal emergency management agency fema and scaled to reflect higher los angeles county construction costs the costs for elevation of existing buildings depend on the foundation building materials and if the building has a basement or crawl space for wet floodproofing the average costs are based on measures such as relocating utility installations above flood levels and using water resistant building materials dry floodproofing measures include sealing walls with waterproof coatings reinforcing walls to resist the hydrostatic pressure of flood water and installing measures to prevent floodwater to enter the building through the sewer for a detail description see fema 34 and aerts et al 14 the npv of the individual building level cba was calculated as per eq 2 2 n p v b a t 1 t b b a t 1 r t c b a 0 the equation shows the npv for building b in the 100 year flood zone and adaptation measure a starting in 2010 for a lifespan t of 80 years and a discount rate r of 4 as commonly used in studies in the us 12 35 a sensitivity analysis with a discount rate of 7 is included in the supplementary information 2 section but the rest of this paper refers to results obtained with the 4 discount rate b b a t are the benefits over time for building b and adaptation measure a c b a 0 are the initial investment costs for building b and adaptation measure a data on adaptation measures maintenance costs are lacking although these costs are often assumed to be negligible 11 subsequently the optimal mix of adaptation measures was composed by selecting the type of measure that yields the highest positive npv per building in the 100 year flood zone eq 3 3 n p v o p t i m a l max b 1 b n p v b a n p v b a 0 we also conducted a conventional spatially aggregated area based approach in which a single measure is evaluated for a whole area in order to compare its results to those yielded by our micro scale cba the aggregated npv of the area based approach was calculated by adding the npv values of all buildings for a specific measure eq 4 4 n p v s i n g l

to coastal flooding due to its low lying geography and high exposure of economic assets 27 36 coastal flooding in los angeles county is mainly caused by tides storm surges wave driven run up or a combination of these factors 22 24 25 the county s current vulnerability was demonstrated in 2010 when an el niño fueled storm produced waves that were 7 5 m 22 ft high causing significant coastal erosion and flooding in certain coastal communities 37 38 current sea level rise projections range from 0 93 m 3 ft by 2100 according to the national research council 39 to a worst case scenario of 3 m 10 ft by 2100 according to a working group of the california ocean protection council science advisory team 26 two vulnerable coastal areas in los angeles county were considered as case studies venice beach including marina del rey and naples see fig 3 venice beach is part of one of the most famous coastal stretches worldwide providing the county with major economic benefits in terms of tourism ecosystem services and coastal protection 9 40 however cosmos s recent projections 22 25 show that sea level rise and erosion threaten to increase flood risk significantly for example de ruig et al 41 have estimated an increase of over 100 mln yr between now and 2100 in a 200 cm 6 6 ft sea level rise scenario in venice beach and santa monica including indirect losses and infrastructure damages naples is a high value residential area in the city of long beach which is already vulnerable to high tides and storms according to projected sea level rise scenarios naples will be highly susceptible to flooding building elevation is a potential way to cope with the increasing flood risk 9 venice beach and naples have distinct characteristics in terms of flood risk flood risk in naples is already high and will only increase further with sea level rise it is currently low in venice beach because of the area s elevated beach front but sea level rise could reach a threshold that results in significantly greater risk currently beach nourishment is used to maintain the beaches that also provide important coastal flood protection 42 furthermore communities participate in the national flood insurance program and most of the coastal cities have agreed to comply with the fema s minimum elevation requirements as well as the california building code regulations for flood zoning and flood proofing 14 aerts et al 14 shows the potential of different types of adaptation strategies which were derived from a 3 year participatory stakeholder approach all these strategies included improved beach nourishment to keep up with the pace of sea level rise other proposed measures include storm surge barriers dikes underneath beaches and roads elevated to act as levees moreover the proposed resilient pathway includes the enforcement of building level adaptation measures on a community level 4 results 4 1 exposure flood risk and the optimal mix of adaptation measures table 2 shows the number of buildings exposed to a 100 year flood zone and the associated risk in the different sea level rise scenarios in addition it shows the percentage of buildings with the possibility of implementing a cost efficient adaptation measure as well as the mix of economically optimal measures 4 1 1 naples we found that a 200 cm sea level rise increased exposure in naples from 2920 buildings currently to 8246 buildings mainly caused by a larger flood extent in the 75 cm sea level rise scenario exposure increased from 2920 buildings to 5242 buildings total flood risk increased due to this rise in exposure in addition the average risk per building increased from 2400 yr to 8600 yr due to higher inundation depths caused by sea level rise a large share of buildings in naples between 93 3 and 99 had at least one cost efficient adaptation option in each scenario buildings for which adaptation measures were not cost efficient tended to be larger than the average single family dwelling and faced minimal expected water depths during a flood event for these buildings repairing the damage would be more economically efficient than investing in adaptation the mix of optimal adaptation types shifted from mainly dry floodproofing 97 8 in the current climate scenario to a more even distribution of dry floodproofing and elevation in the sea level rise scenarios 35 45 dry floodproofing and 55 65 elevation we often found the elevation of existing buildings to be economically efficient only in high sea level rise scenarios due to large upfront investment costs the damage reduction attained through wet floodproofing is less significant than that attained through dry floodproofing but still reduce damage even if inundation depths exceed floodproofing heights in addition certain types of assessed buildings such as multi family dwellings and commercial buildings are not normally elevated leaving only dry floodproofing and wet floodproofing as adaptation options therefore we observe only a small share of wet floodproofed buildings 0 3 1 7 located in areas with high inundation depths where dry floodproofing was not suitable and the building type did not allow for elevation 4 1 2 venice beach table 2 also shows that venice beach was barely vulnerable to flooding in the current climate scenario with only three buildings experiencing flood damage during an 100 year flood event in the 75 cm and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios exposure equaled 112 and 231 vulnerable buildings respectively these values are considerably lower than those obtained for naples still we found the average flood risk per building to be approximately 25 000 yr in the current climate scenario for example naples had an exposure of 2920 buildings and 6 8 mln yr in risk meanwhile in the 150 cm sea level rise scenario venice beach had an exposure of only 231 buildings but 6 6 mln yr in risk this high average risk in venice beach mainly originated from large residential multi dwellings being flooded in marina del rey in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios approximately 97 of the vulnerable buildings in venice beach had a cost efficient adaptation option with dry floodproofing being most cost efficient in these scenarios only buildings in marina del rey flooded since they were mostly large buildings with relatively shallow inundation depths dry floodproofing was the preferred adaptation measure however the 200 cm sea level rise scenario showed a significant increase in exposure and associated risk with 5961 vulnerable buildings and 50 mln yr in risk this sudden increase suggests a potential risk threshold between 150 cm and 200 cm of sea level rise of the 5961 vulnerable buildings in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario 97 3 had a cost efficient adaptation option and the share of dry floodproofing wet floodproofing and elevation 47 1 and 52 respectively was similar to that found in naples in terms of exposure naples and venice beach are comparable they boast high value residential buildings constructed around the beach or harbors however in terms of hazard venice beach s relatively high beachfront and marina would prevent flooding in lower sea level rise scenarios nonetheless results suggest that a comparable mix of dry floodproofing wet floodproofing and elevation measures would be optimal in both areas we analyze these measures spatial distribution in more detail in the following section 4 2 spatial distribution of optimal adaptation measures 4 2 1 naples fig 4 shows the inundation maps for a 100 year storm and the spatial distribution of the most cost efficient mix of adaptation measures for naples inundation depth was relatively shallow 1 m in the current climate scenario in some areas such as the peninsula the islands and a few parts of belmont however the flood extent increases significantly in belmont and expands to marina pacifica in the sea level rise scenarios in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario inundation depths in the peninsula the islands and parts of belmont increased up to 3 m the heavily inundated area shown south of los cerritos channel represents an oil field and a wetland these are not considered in this study in the current climate scenario 2 ft and 4 ft dry floodproofing was often the most cost efficient measure as inundation depth increased due to sea level rise however elevation became cost efficient more frequently this was particularly noticeable when comparing the current climate scenario and the 75 cm sea level rise scenario in other words dry floodproofing was often more efficient at shallow inundation depths even though dry floodproofing is a relatively cheap and effective measure we found it to be inadequate when inundation depths exceeded the floodproofing height as a result elevation was more economically desirable in areas and scenarios with higher inundation depths despite higher investment costs moreover in certain areas increasing sea levels led to a substantial average increase in optimal elevation and dry floodproofing heights said heights however presented a large spatial variety for example in the 75 cm sea level rise scenario both elevation and dry floodproofing were predominantly optimal at 4 ft meanwhile in the peninsula certain island streets and parts of belmont the optimal elevation and dry floodproofing height was 6 ft in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario the optimal elevation height was predominantly 8 ft however especially at the edges of the flooded area or in newly flooded areas optimal dry floodproofing and elevation heights were often found to be 2 ft and 4 ft respectively as previously observed wet floodproofing was only suitable if inundation depth exceeded dry floodproofing height and the building s land use type did not allow for elevation in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario for example wet floodproofing proved to be the most efficient adaptation measure for commercial buildings on east 2nd street in belmont 4 2 2 venice beach as shown in fig 5 inundation caused by a 100 year storm in venice beach was limited in the current climate scenario in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios inundation expanded to marina del rey but remained below 1 m however when sea level rise exceeded a certain threshold inundation was substantial and extended to residential neighborhoods in certain parts inundation depths reached over 3 m overtopping of flood water in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario mainly occurred near ballona lagoon and marina del rey reflecting the beaches importance in protecting other areas from flooding in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios the only noticeable inundation took place in marina del rey as it was relatively shallow inundation dry floodproofing was the most economically efficient option in the 150 cm sea level rise scenario floodproofing heights increased in certain parts of the marina this was also the case in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario with dry floodproofing up to 4 ft and 6 ft being most economically efficient in highly inundated parts of residential neighborhoods 8 ft elevation was the most economically efficient option while dry floodproofing predominated at the edge of the flooded area meanwhile a number of multi family dwellings located around west washington boulevard experienced high inundation depths making dry floodproofing unsuitable and wet floodproofing the most economically efficient measure the spatial variety of adaptation measures and respective heights followed a similar pattern to that found in higher sea level rise scenarios in naples for example even only a small area of about 500 m in radius to the north of marina del rey and to the east of west washington boulevard show a wide variety of optimal measures elevations of 4 ft 6 ft and 8 ft and dry floodproofing of 2 ft 4 ft and 6 ft the following subsection illustrates how our micro scale cba performed against an aggregated approach in which only one measure is evaluated for an entire area 4 3 comparison of area based adaptation vs optimal adaptation efficiencies as shown in fig 6 we compared between the optimal mix of building level adaptation measures yielded by our micro scale cba and the measures yielded by an area based cba in which only one adaptation type was used to evaluate the aggregated npv of implementing a specific measure in that area we have indicated in the area based cba results which height was most cost efficient the electronic supplementary information contains full results for all scenarios and adaptation options see supplementary information 3 in both naples and venice beach the micro scale cba always resulted in a substantially more efficient mix of adaptation measures than the area based cba as an illustration the npv yielded by the micro scale approach in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario in naples was 250 mln higher than that yielded by the area based approach this constitutes an increase of 33 according to the area based cbas in the 75 and 150 cm sea level rise scenarios a dry floodproofing of 6 ft in naples resulted in the highest npv however this dry floodproofing height is not always suitable for different types of buildings and fema recommends not exceeding 4 ft of dry floodproofing and use elevation instead 34 specifically in the 150 cm sea level rise scenario using 4 ft rather than 6 ft of dry floodproofing decreased the npv by almost 400 mln according to an area based cba when the 6 ft dry floodproofing was removed from the optimal mix of adaptation measures economic efficiency decreased by only 77 mln venice beach has a difference in npv of about 300 mln when comparing the optimal mix of adaptation measures and the area based cba with only 6 ft dry floodproofing for the 200 cm sea level rise scenario this is an increase of 85 in npv almost doubling for the micro scale cba when compared with the area based cba out of 5961 vulnerable buildings only 5 4 had 6 ft dry floodproofing as the most economically efficient measure in the micro scale cba even though 6 ft dry floodproofing was the most efficient measure according to an area based cba in other words while 6 ft dry floodproofing was the best measure on an aggregated scale the area based cba resulted in sub optimal adaptation measures for 94 6 of the buildings in the area for example in areas with high inundation depths i e between 2 m and 3 m elevation was significantly more efficient with 8 ft elevation in particular being optimal in 39 4 of buildings according to the micro scale cba however if 8 ft elevation were to be applied to all vulnerable buildings including those in areas with shallow inundation depths aggregated economic efficiencies would decrease considerably these findings suggest that measures performance and efficiency on an individual building level depend strongly on local inundation depths 5 discussion 5 1 the importance of scales and data availability in many cases studies evaluate the effectiveness of a measure in a given case study area i e a flood zone a neighborhood a sub watershed etc 18 19 43 they implicitly assume that hazard conditions e g water depth are homogenous throughout the studied area this is however rarely the case in particular an increase of up to 85 in economic efficiency can be achieved by optimizing adaptation measures such as floodproofing at an individual building level instead of applying a single measure to an entire area this increase would be even more pronounced in certain areas such as large polder areas in the netherlands which would have high exposure and highly varied flood inundation depths in case of an event 44 45 evaluating a single building level measure in an exceedingly large area can easily result in inefficiencies but this does not mean that a measure cannot be effective in certain specific locations our results show that local scale adaptation assessments should use the smallest scale possible however even in the us building level data are often only collected per county and are not always made publicly available in addition data sets are often outdated because collecting such data is very costly and resource intensive hence using a multi source gis data set or volunteered geographic information sources such as open street maps might become integral to such models as it could provide updated and detailed building level information 46 47 however if building level data sets are persistently difficult to acquire we recommend that these localized assessments disaggregate the evaluated area not only to flood zones based on probability such as 100 or 500 year flood zones but also to different inundation depth ranges our results show a distinct pattern of adaptation types based on inundation depths for example dry floodproofing performs most efficiently in areas with shallow inundation depths buildings inundation depths in smaller disaggregated areas are relatively homogeneous which results in two advantages first a single adaptation measure turns out to be most suitable within each area e g 2 ft dry floodproofing in an area with an expected inundation depth 2 ft second we may evaluate the types of adaptation used in different areas such as dry floodproofing in shallow inundation areas and elevation in deep inundation areas 5 2 building level versus community level adaptation homeowners often do not have access to detailed studies about the costs and benefits of floodproofing their property and their perceptions of flood risk and the effectiveness of floodproofing measures are often incorrect 48 49 in reality data suggests that homeowners are on average not inclined to install floodproofing measures even when living in flood plains communicating about the flood risk homeowners face potentially increases the willingness of homeowners to protect their property 50 51 however communicating only about flood probabilities has been shown to be less effective than also communicating about the options for risk reduction measures 52 54 this study contributes to the design of more effective communication strategies by providing information about the most cost effective floodproofing measure per building instead of about a best practice measure for an aggregated area which has been shown to be less economically efficient furthermore the outcomes of our study are applicable in the design implementation and enforcement of adaptation measures and strategies for communities venice beach and naples are densely populated with high value residences but stakeholders have indicated to prefer adaptation options that have the least amount of impact on the coast both aesthetically and practically for the implementation of larger structural measures local assessments must be made to comply to the regulations set by local coastal programs and the california coastal commission currently building codes are already used to enforce a minimum of building level adaptation measures in an area but we show that using the smallest scale possible for evaluating such measures could significantly increase economic efficiency even if the building level adaptation measures are part of a larger adaptation strategy or designed for a larger area evaluating these measures on the individual level can improve the accuracy of these analyses 5 3 barriers to the implementation of adaptation measures the un has stipulated in the paris agreement that if global temperature rises more than 1 5 c the effects of climate change including sea level rise will become unacceptably high several studies that focused on global risk e g refs 55 56 have found that beyond such a threshold risk can increase substantially in los angeles county a 200 cm sea level rise by 2100 is possible if global warming follows a high emission scenario e g the representative concentration pathway 8 5 26 the case of venice beach illustrates the local impact that rise in sea levels beyond such a threshold would have water would overtop the beaches and the marina flooding the lower back area consequently risk increases substantially once this tipping point has been reached besides illustrating the importance of including extreme scenarios e g a 200 cm sea level rise by 2100 in economic evaluation studies our result also showcases how difficult it is for policymakers to plan for tipping points if a tipping point is likely to be reached in the near future adaptation is necessary however if it is not reached adaptation will have proven economically inefficient certain studies e g refs 41 57 58 have assessed pathways to adjust adaptation strategies based on thresholds for variables such as sea level rise still there are substantial gaps in knowledge when it comes to forecasting the environmental and economic impact of tipping points or planning how to prepare for them large upfront investment costs can also be a major barrier to the implementation of flood adaptation measures 12 59 60 due to the uncertainty of climate change projections and the lack of knowledge on the effects of climate change policymakers are afraid of making sub optimal irreversible investments 12 60 a number of economic evaluation methods have been developed to deal with current uncertainty regarding climate change e g real option analysis portfolio analysis but they are often resource intensive and technically complex 59 even when resources are available and these methods are applied their technical complexity makes them difficult to implement in a practical policy setting especially when large investments are involved 59 cost benefit analysis is generally accepted as a clear means of informing policymakers about the costs and benefits of large adaptation investments however as our study has shown caution should be taken when individual building level adaptation is considered as part of an adaptation strategy the comparison between our micro scale cba and the area based cba shows that the former can result in a significant decrease in upfront investment costs in naples investment costs for the most economically efficient area based elevation options in the 75 150 and 200 cm sea level rise scenarios are approximately 231 mln 316 mln and 414 mln respectively as a result of our micro scale cba these costs decrease by 36 2 32 5 and 26 9 respectively in the 200 cm sea level rise scenario our micro scale cba yields a decrease of 33 in the investment costs of an 8 ft elevation in venice beach relative to the area based cba lower upfront investment costs can drive implementation of adaptation strategies 60 which is a further strength of the micro scale cba approach 6 conclusion climate change and socio economic development are expected to exacerbate the global impact of flooding as a response to increasing flood risk investments in flood adaptation are necessary individual building level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or elevation can be implemented to reduce flood damage to structures cost benefit analysis is often used to evaluate the economic efficiency of flood adaptation strategies however to assess the economic efficiency of individual building level adaptation measures it is standard to apply a spatially aggregated cba in which a single measure is evaluated for an entire area this study presents to our knowledge the first micro scale cba that evaluates and optimizes the economic efficiency of adaptation measures on an individual building level yielding an optimal mix of measures for each given area we compared our findings to those obtained through the conventional spatially aggregated area based approach our new micro scale method is widely applicable to other geographical regions if detailed building data are available the method s local scale makes it helpful to policymakers planning individual building level adaptation measures we applied our method to a case study of two areas of the los angeles county coast that are vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise venice beach and naples both areas have high value beachfront residential properties making individual building adaptation to coastal flooding viable according to our findings the optimal mix of measures consists of 35 45 dry floodproofing and 55 65 elevation elevation is optimal in areas with high inundation depths while dry floodproofing performs best in areas with shallow inundation depths in all evaluated sea level rise scenarios the optimal mix of measures results in higher economic efficiencies than those yielded by the conventional area based cba method in a 200 cm sea level rise scenario in venice beach for example it results in an increase of economic efficiency npv up to 85 our approach can help policymakers explore flood adaptation strategies by providing them with a more complete view on the efficiency of individual adaptation measures in addition it can help educate homeowners on available adaptation options for their properties as well as on the most suitable adaptation type regarding future research we recommend that evaluations of building level adaptation measures be conducted at the smallest possible scale multi source gis data sets or volunteered geographic information sources e g open street maps could be useful platforms in acquiring such micro scale data if other sources are unavailable or inaccessible if individual building data is still not available we recommend that cbas be performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth in order to obtain the optimal mix of adaptation measures per area funding this work was supported by the
