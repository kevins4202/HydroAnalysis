15435,expanding knowledge about new types of antibiotic resistance genes is of great significance in dealing with the global antibiotic resistance crisis herein a novel oxidoreductase capo was discovered to be responsible for oxidative inactivation of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol the antibiotic resistance mechanism was comprehensively deciphered using multi omics and multiscale computational approaches a 66 383 bp dna fragment carrying capo was shared among four chloramphenicol resistant strains and the co occurrence of capo with a mobile genetic element cluster revealed its potential mobility among different taxa metagenomic analysis of 772 datasets indicated that chloramphenicol was the crucial driving factor for the development and accumulation of capo in activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater therefore we should pay sufficient attention to its possible prevalence and transfer to pathogens especially in some hotspot environments contaminated with high concentrations of chloramphenicols this finding significantly expands our knowledge boundary about chloramphenicols resistance mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloramphenicols antibiotic resistance gene oxidative inactivation comparative proteomics metagenomics heterologous expression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction along with the excessive consumption of antibiotics by humans antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb are constantly appearing and spreading in the environment which cause worrying implications for the globe pruden et al 2021 the pathogens can acquire new resistance factors through mutations or horizontal gene transfers from other bacteria challenging medicine against infections ji et al 2022 larsson and flach 2021 antibiotic resistance has become a heavy global burden since about 1 27 million deaths were attributable to antibiotic resistant bacterial infections in the world in 2019 antimicrobial resistance collaborators 2022 the world health organization proposed an improvement in awareness and understanding of antibiotic resistance as well as strengthening surveillance which is a prerequisite for assessing their risks however the limited knowledge about args usually underestimates their risks as novel args are in development along with microbial evolution which may be associated with vast medical risks larsson and flach 2021 cai et al 2021 therefore discovering novel antibiotic resistance types and mechanisms is of great significance to risk assessment prevention and control of args chloramphenicols also known as amphenicols are derivatives of dichloroacetamide with a phenylpropanoid structure dowling 2013 chloramphenicol cap thiamphenicol tap and florfenicol ff are three common chloramphenicols cap consists of a p nitrophenyl group a propanediol side chain and a dichloromethyl moiety dowling 2013 tap is a derivative of cap in which the nitro group is replaced with methyl sulfonyl while ff is a fluorinated analog of tap dowling 2013 they have broad spectrum inhibitory effects on a wide variety of microorganisms such as aerobes anaerobes and rickettsiae by blocking the peptidyl transferase activity on the 50s ribosome subunit hutchings et al 2019 they are widely used as antibacterial agents to treat various pathogen infections in veterinary and aquaculture except for cap which has been banned for usage in foodborne animals in china the united states korea japan canada and australia owing to its negative side effects including aplastic anemia and genotoxic carcinogenicity pastor belda et al 2020 hanekamp and bast 2015 however cap is still consumed in great quantity in these countries for instance it has been estimated that 1230 tons of cap are used annually in china zhang et al 2015 notably cap residues were still detected with a high incidence in aquatic products of shenzhen south china in a recent report luo et al 2021 besides some developing countries exhibit excessive consumption of cap for antibacterial infection treatments due to its easy availability and low production costs pastor belda et al 2020 it was reported that the concentrations of chloramphenicols ranged from ng l 1 to mg l 1 levels in aquatic and soil environments worldwide nguyen et al 2022 al riyami et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the occurrence and accumulation of chloramphenicols in some hotspots like hospital wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and livestock and poultry breeding wastewater is a potential motivator for the development and flourishing of chloramphenicols resistant bacteria several chloramphenicols resistance genes and the corresponding resistance mechanisms have been explored such as the production of inactive enzymes and expression of efflux pumps which are the most common resistance approaches blair et al 2015 three types of enzymes including acetyltransferases amidohydrolases and nitroreductases were found to catalyze intracellular antibiotic inactivation of chloramphenicols the acetylation of the propanediol group of cap and tap catalyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferases was the most common intracellular cap or tap inactivation mechanism in bacteria alcala et al 2020 the amide bond hydrolase estdl136 responsible for amide bond hydrolysis was also proved to be involved in cap tap and ff inactivation in bacteria tao et al 2012 crofts et al 2019 discovered a nitroreductase nfsb that confers resistance to cap by nitroreduction in haemophilus influenzae in our previous study a cap resistant and subsisting strain sphingomonas sp cl5 1 isolated from activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater was found to be able to oxidize the propanediol c3 oh of cap and tap into a carboxyl group zhang et al 2020a the 1 3 propanediol group is an essential pharmacophore for the antibacterial activity of cap and tap dinos et al 2016 therefore we speculated that the oxidation of the propanediol pharmacophore was a novel cap resistance mechanism catalyzed by an unknown enzyme in cells in the current study we aimed to discover the novel chloramphenicols resistance gene and decrypt the resistance mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 strain cultivation three cap resistant strains sphingomonas sp cl5 1 caballeronia sp pc1 and caballeronia sp clc5 were isolated from activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater in our lab they could catabolize cap by oxidizing the propanediol

liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c before protein extraction all the experiments were conducted in duplicate the procedures of protein extraction and tmt labeling proteomics were the same as those reported in the previous study zhang et al 2021 the proteins were identified by searching against the protein database of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 with ms spectra using proteome discoverer v 2 2 thermo fisher scientific the relative expression of each protein was obtained by normalizing it to the intensity of the tmt reporter the significance of protein expression difference between the cap tap treated group and the control group was determined by student s t test the proteins with expression fold change 2 and adjusted p value 0 05 were considered to be significantly up regulated while proteins with expression fold change 0 5 and adjusted p value 0 05 were considered to be significantly down regulated between the treated group and control group 2 4 heterologous expression of capo in p putida kt2440 the gene capo was cloned to p putida kt2440 for functional verification in vivo the procedures of capo cloning and expression were described detailedly in text s1 the batch test of cap and tap oxidation by recombinant strains was conducted as follows p putida kt2440 capo was cultivated in lb containing 50 mg l 1 kanamycin since it harbored a recombinant plasmid with kanamycin resistance the cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 g for 5 min at the exponential phase the cell pellet was washed with fresh msm b three times then it was inoculated into 100 ml fresh msm

activity of purified capo were tested in 50 mm tris hcl buffer at ph 7 5 the activity of the enzyme without impact factors was taken to be 100 as the reference in all the above tests the enzyme was incubated under the corresponding conditions for 10 min before assay in the tests of impact factors on enzyme activity 0 6 mm mpms was used as a cofactor and 1 2 mm cap was used as the substrate reactions to determine michaelis menten kinetics were launched with a substrate mixture containing 0 6 mm mpms and 0 03 1 4 mm cap or tap in triplicate the reaction solution was continuously collected

s6 2 7 the molecular docking and quantum chemical calculation the protein structure prediction molecular docking molecular dynamic simulations and binding free energy calculation were performed according to the method described in texts s2 and s3 besides the local nucleophilicity index of cap and tap was calculated according to the method described in text s4 2 8 the development and dissemination of capo in various environments revealed by metagenomic analysis a total of 20 lab scale activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater including cap lincomycin ampicillin cephalexin tetracycline erythromycin sulfamethazine kanamycin trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin respectively were established in duplicate to investigate the effect of antibiotics on the shaping of microbial community and generation of args zhao et al 2019 2020a 2021 all the above bioreactors including a control treatment without antibiotic addition were set up with the same seed activated sludge the antibiotic concentrations were gradually increased from 20 mg l 1 to a final level and the activated sludge samples were collected for metagenomic sequencing at different stages detailed information about reactor establishment operation process sample preparation dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing has been described in our previous study zhao et al 2019 a total of 81 metagenomic datasets 1 38 tb were utilized to investigate the development law of capo under the pressure of antibiotics the detailed information on these metagenomic datasets was listed in table s3 a total of 691 metagenomic datasets about 6 8 tb were collected from the published literature to evaluate the dissemination of capo in wastewater treatment systems and drinking water treatment systems the metagenomes from wastewater treatment systems mainly included influent activated sludge anaerobic digestion sludge effluent etc the metagenomes from drinking water treatment systems mainly included drinking water reservoir water river water river sediment biofilm from shower hoses showerheads water taps etc the detailed information of these metagenomes was listed in tables s4 and s5 all the raw metagenomic data were filtered using fastp v 0 20 1 chen et al 2018 the filtered data was assembled by metaspades v 3 13 2 nurk et al 2017 the orfs of assembled contigs were predicted by prodigal v 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 orfs were searched against the protein sequence of capo by blastx e value 1e 5 with a similarity cutoff of 80 and alignment length cutoff of 70 to identify capo in the metagenomes zhao et al 2020a the gene abundances of capo flor and catb2 in metagenomes were calculated as follows the reads of metagenomic datasets were mapped to reference dna sequences of capo flor and catb2 using bowtie2 v 2 4 4 langmead and salzberg 2012 and the gene abundance was calculated according to the following formula zhao et al 2020a abun dance cov erage gb r mapp ed reads l reads l gene s where lreads is the length 150 bp of the sequencing reads rmapped reads is the number of the reads mapped to genes lgene is the length of target gene sequences and s is the total base number of the dataset gb 3 results and discussion 3 1 exploration of the enzyme involved in cap and tap oxidation by comparative proteomics sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was isolated from an activated sludge bioreactor treating wastewater containing a high concentration of cap in the previous study zhang et al 2020a it was gifted in the c3 oh oxidation of cap and tap to the carboxyl group producing oxidized cap and tap namely o cap and o tap fig 1 a and b comparative proteomics was conducted to discover the critical enzyme involved in c3 oh oxidation totally 16 shared significantly up regulated proteins of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 were identified in the treatments of cap and tap fig 1c p 0 05 among them a novel gmc family oxidoreductase named capo was speculated to catalyze the oxidation of cap and tap according to the protein function annotation gmc oxidoreductases constitute a large family of proteins with extensive redox activity for more than 17 different known oxidation reaction types aleksenko et al 2020 cavener 1992 alcohol oxidation by gmc oxidoreductases was the most common oxidation reaction type for substances like pyridoxine p anisyl alcohol and methanol romero and gadda 2014 dijkman and fraaije 2014 the expression of capo was significantly up regulated by 2 74 fold and 2 57 fold in the cap and tap treatments compared with the control group respectively fig 1d these clues implied the possibility that this protein functioned in the oxidation of cap and tap protein capo presented a low homology of less than 41 9 similarity with other manually annotated oxidoreductases in the swiss prot database and less than 59 7 similarity with other proteins in the uniprot parc database except for the capo like protein in the genome of sphingobium sp cap 1 via blastp search sphingobium sp cap 1 was isolated from activated sludge by ma et al 2020 and it was also reported to have the ability to oxidize cap however the enzyme responsible for cap oxidation was not identified in their study protein capo in strain sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and sphingobium sp cap 1 was evolutionarily distinguished from other 98 homologous gmc oxidoreductases and formed a novel clade in the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree fig 1e which indicated that capo might have a novel function and substrate specificity different from the other known gmc oxidoreductases 3 2 oxidative inactivation of cap and tap gives rise to chloramphenicols resistance by capo expression in p putida kt2440 gene capo was functionally expressed in p putida kt2440 fig 2 a to manifest its chloramphenicols resistance activity the mic values of cap and tap for p putida kt2440 capo transformed with a plasmid carrying capo were 16 and 8 fold of those for p putida kt2440 vector transformed with empty plasmid fig 2b which indicated that gene capo contributed to the significant enhancement of cap and tap resistance capability p putida kt2440 capo was invested with the function of cap and tap oxidative detoxification by capo it could oxidize about 100 cap in 19 h and 72 4 tap in 96 h at the initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 into oxidized products fig 2c and d while it could not oxidize ff because the hydroxyl group of cap is replaced by a fluorine molecule for ff fig 2e the antibacterial activity of oxidized products produced by p putida kt2440 capo was tested by antibacterial activity assay fig 2f revealed that there was no antibacterial activity of oxidized products for antibiotic susceptible strains including e coli k12 e coli bl21 de3 and s aureus 25 923 the acetylation of cap and tap catalyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferases is the most common intracellular cap and tap inactivation mechanism in bacteria alcala et al 2020 in addition nitroreductase nfsb and amide bond hydrolase estdl136 are involved in cap inactivation via nitroreduction and amide bond hydrolysis in bacteria crofts et al 2019 tao et al 2012 herein we discovered that an oxidoreductase capo mediated a novel cap and tap resistance type via oxidative inactivation of the propanediol pharmacophore which was totally different from the known resistance mechanism of inactive enzymes including acetyltransferases nitroreductases and amide bond hydrolases 3 3 decryption of enzymatic characteristics and oxidative inactivation mechanism of capo gene capo was successfully overexpressed in e coli bl21 de3 and recombinant his6 tagged capo protein was extracted and purified for biochemical analysis fig s1a c its molecular weight was 58 764 da obtained via liquid chromatography mass spectrometer analysis fig s1d commonly gmc family oxidoreductases utilize flavins as the catalytic cofactor to catalyze highly diverse redox reactions aleksenko et al 2020 however we found that capo did not show cap oxidation activity with cofactors including fad fmn pqq coq10 nadp or nad fig 3 a the catalyst activity of capo was only activated by the presence of mpms or pms which usually functions as the electron transport mediator in the enzyme catalyzed reactions hisada and yagi 1977 fig 3a besides the co existence of mpms and other cofactors did not increase the catalyst activity of capo compared to mpms alone which indicated that the other cofactors were not involved in cap oxidization by capo in vitro as shown in fig 3b the reaction system initially appeared rosy pink because of the coloration of mpms and subsequently turned milk white after a 10 min reaction with capo manifesting the chemical conversion of mpms and its involvement in cap oxidation in common oxygen is the hydrogen acceptor for oxidation reactions by oxidoreductases to generate h2o or h2o2 mcnally et al 2003 in this study about 1 1 mmol l 1 h2o2 was detected in the cap oxidation reaction at the initial concentration of 250 mg l 1 fig 3c which proved the generation of h2o2 during cap oxidation initiated by capo purified capo exhibited good catalytic activity for cap oxidation at a ph range of 7 1 8 7 and a temperature range of 30 0 40 0 c and the optimal ph and temperature were 8 3 and 30 c respectively fig 3d and e the effects of various metal ions organic solvents detergents oxidizing agents bleaching agents and other inhibitors on capo activity were investigated to characterize the enzymatic properties of capo and figure out regulatory factors of the enzyme activity these results could guide the better application of this enzyme for oxidative inactivation of cap and tap among these factors only organic solvents including alcohol acetone and isopropyl alcohol 5 v v can promote cap oxidization activity of capo by 4 6 7 4 p 0 01 while most of the tested compounds exerted inhibitory effects on its activity fig 3f and g the promotion of organic solvents at low content 10 v v on various enzymes has been widely observed in previous studies zhao et al 2020b rajput et al 2016 fecl3 alcl3 cuso4 n bromosuccinimide cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate had strong inhibitory effects on capo activity by more than 78 activity reduction p 0 001 in vitro enzyme capo could catalyze oxidization of both cap and tap with k m values of 9 58 10 5 m and 1 96 10 4 m and k cat k m values of 2 78 107 m 1 s 1 and 1 39 107m 1 s 1 respectively fig 3h and i the affinity and catalytic efficiency of capo on cap were remarkably higher than those on tap which was an important reason for the faster and more complete oxidation of cap than tap by p putida kt2440 capo in vivo the molecular surface electrostatic potential analysis further indicated that the oxygen atom at c3 of cap and tap was apt to donate electrons to o2 fig s2a and b the local nucleophilicity indexes of c3 and the oxygen atom at c3 of cap are 0 1292 and 0 0473 which are higher than those 0 0996 and 0 0466 of tap thus the critical active group i e c3 oh of cap has a more powerful electron donating ability than that of tap which means cap is more liable to be oxidized the kinetic k cat k m of capo is far higher than chloramphenicol acetyltransferases 3 86 104 1 29 106m 1 s 1 which are typical chloramphenicol resistance enzymes with modification activity alcala et al 2020 moreover k cat k m of capo is also remarkably higher than the average level 105 m 1 s 1 of several thousands of enzymes collected from the literature by bar even et al 2011 the high catalytic efficiency of capo contributed to the rapid inactivation of antibiotics for bacterial defense against chloramphenicols besides the dramatic decrease of antibiotic concentration around cells may allow other coexisting susceptible bacteria particularly pathogens to flourish thus resulting in the invalidation of antibacterial therapy the oxidized products of cap and tap were identified by hplc qtof ms analysis as shown in fig 4 a h two oxidized products of cap and tap were detected and they were identified to be d cap d tap with an aldehyde group at the c3 position and o cap o tap with a carboxyl group at the c3 position our previous study zhang et al 2020 and ma et al 2020 already proved that the c3 oh of cap could be oxidized to a carboxyl group by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and sphingobium sp cap 1 here we further tracked out that capo performed a four electron double oxidation reaction on cap and tap in which the alcohol group was oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde d cap and d tap and subsequently to the corresponding carboxylic acid o cap and o tap fig 4i the destruction of the reactive pharmacophore of antibiotics is a common approach for bacterial resistance among which hydrolysis acetylation and methylation are widely employed by bacteria wen et al 2021 the discovery of the hydroxy oxidative inactivation mechanism in this study significantly expands our knowledge boundary about chloramphenicols resistance mechanism via enzyme catalyzed antibiotics inactivation the protein structure of capo was predicted by rosettafold and its protein complexes with cap and tap were acquired by molecular docking as shown in fig 4j l cap and tap were buried inside the active pocket of capo the hydrogen bonds formed with residues asn94 tyr 471 and trp 81 may be involved in oxidation catalysis especially two hydrogen bonds formed between c3 oh of cap tap and residue asn94 which probably was a key active site for the oxidation of c3 oh besides the difference in estimated binding free energies of capo cap 36 6 kcal mol 1 and capo tap 31 5 kcal mol 1 complexes also contributes to their difference in catalytic efficiency fig s2c molecular docking helps to understand the interaction of enzymes and substrates by anticipating the preferred orientation when bound to each other morris and lim wilby 2008 to deeply decipher the bonding form and catalytic mechanism a robust and refined enzyme substrate complex of capo should be acquired by protein structure resolution methods like cryo electron microscopy and x ray crystallography in the future 3 4 the mobility of capo revealed by comparative genomic analysis of capo carrying strains three cap subsisting strains including sphingomonas sp cl5 1 caballeronia sp pc1 and caballeronia sp clc5 isolated from a cap degrading consortium zhang et al 2020 were capable of oxidizing cap to o cap and their complete genomes were acquired by combined application of illumina sequencing and oxford nanopore technologies ont sequencing in the present study we compared the genomes of these three strains and another cap oxidizing strain sphingobium sp cap 1 isolated by ma et al 2020 fortuitously a shared fragment of 66 383 bp 99 4 similarity carrying capo in their chromosomal genomes was discovered although they belong to different species and even different classes fig 5 a gene repa encoding a plasmid replication initiation protein is located in the shared fragment fig 5b which hints that the shared fragment may import from the extrachromosomal or even exogenous dna such as conjugative plasmids via the horizontal gene transfer mardanov and ravin 2006 a type iv coupling protein t4cp gene vird4 and a gene cluster of type iv secretion system t4ss consisting of 12 t4ss protein genes including trbi trbg trbf trbl trbk trbj trbe trbd trbc trbb trbn and traf are located in the shared fragment fig 5b as one kind of integrative and conjugative element ice t4ss is responsible for dna and protein translocations among phylogenetically diverse bacterial and eukaryotic taxa as well as dna release or uptake from the extracellular milieu by traversing the cell envelope chandran 2013 grohmann et al 2018 t4ss is a common system to mediate horizontal gene transfer which is the basis for arg spread among diverse bacteria and greatly facilitates bacterial adaptation to environmental changes costa et al 2021 t4cp is an essential constituent for most t4sss in charge of the recruitment of the dna or protein substrate to the t4ss channel llosa and alkorta 2017 besides a relaxase gene vird2 which is also an important component of t4ss padavannil et al 2014 was found to be adjacent to vird4 in the shared fragment fig 5b a recombinase gene is located in the tail end of the shared fragment fig 5b recombinases constitute a large enzyme family with the function of dna recombination and they are also involved in driving the movement of mobile genetic elements smyshlyaev et al 2021 commonly there are four modules including an origin of transfer region orit relaxase t4cp and t4ss in the conjugative transfer region of a typical self transmissible mobile genetic element to support its mobility costa et al 2021 though orit was not found in the shared dna fragment the high homology of the capo carrying dna fragments in different species and the existence of genes encoding relaxase t4cp t4ss and recombinase in this fragment vigorously manifested that these four strains acquired capo by the horizontal gene transfer therefore the shared dna fragment carrying capo probably was mobile among different bacteria the capture dissemination and accumulation of args in bacteria in various environments are primarily by virtue of the horizontal gene transfer events mediated by mobile genetic elements partridge et al 2018 the args associated with mobile genetic elements usually exert more severe potential risks on human health as they have active and frequent mobility among various taxa and maybe occasionally transferred to pathogens thus finally posing a challenge to medical treatment saak et al 2020 therefore as a novel member of args capo went totally unheeded in previous studies it should involve attention due to its association with mobile genetic elements which might facilitate its transferability towards pathogens 3 5 the development and dissemination of capo in various environments revealed by metagenomic analysis metagenomic datasets 1 38 tb of 81 samples collected from lab scale activated sludge reactors treating antibiotic production wastewater including cap lincomycin ampicillin cephalexin tetracycline erythromycin sulfamethazine kanamycin trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin respectively were analyzed to reveal the development and accumulation rules of gene capo in the severely antibiotic contaminated environments table s3 as shown in fig 5c and d gene capo was only detected in activated sludge bioreactors treating cap production wastewater while it was undetectable in activated sludge bioreactors treating other antibiotics it is well known that chloramphenicol acetyltransferase catb2 and bcr cfla family efflux transporter flor are the most common chloramphenicols resistance genes reported in previous studies alcala et al 2020 nevertheless the newly discovered chloramphenicols resistance gene capo is also dominant in all the bioreactors treating cap production wastewater its abundance was even markedly higher than that of flor and catb2 in bioreactors treating wastewater with cap concentration higher than 70 mg l 1 fig 5d the association between cap concentration and capo abundance indicated that cap was the crucial driving factor for the development and accumulation of capo in activated sludge consortia high pressure of antibiotics residues in the hotspot environments associated with human activities e g antibiotic production wastewater livestock and poultry breeding wastewater hospital wastewater etc compels indigenous bacteria to develop resistance and makes the resistance acquirers prevalent liu et al 2022 levin reisman et al 2017 in addition a total of 691 metagenomic datasets about 6 8 tb collected from the published literature were analyzed to evaluate the dissemination of capo in the wastewater treatment systems and drinking water treatment systems which were inextricably linked to human health tables s4 and s5 wastewater treatment systems are regarded as a critical reservoir of antibiotics and args and drinking water treatment systems have a direct bearing on human health li et al 2020 karkman et al 2018 fortunately there was no evidence for the prevalence of capo in the environments closely linked to human activities as it was not detected in these 691 metagenomic samples fig 5e gene capo only emerged and preponderated in the activated sludge bioreactors treating cap production wastewater and the isolated strains carrying capo were all obtained from these bioreactors in both this study and the study conducted by ma et al 2020 thus we concluded that cap was a powerful driving force for the development and prevalence of capo low cap concentrations commonly at ng l 1 μg l 1 level in water nguyen et al 2022 may be an important reason for the undetected capo in municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment systems besides the abundance of capo may be too low in municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment systems to be detected by metagenomic approach in summary an ice mediated novel oxidoreductase capo that confers high level cap and tap resistance was firstly confirmed in this study capo performed a four electron double oxidation reaction to inactivate cap and tap for resistance its association with mobile genetic element endowed with capo potential transferability and thus probably facilitated its dissemination among bacteria although there was no evidence for the prevalence of capo in the environments closely linked to human activities we still should be vigilant about its possibility of prevalence and transfer to pathogens especially in some hotspot environments contaminated with a high concentration of cap or tap such as antibiotic production wastewater livestock and poultry breeding wastewater hospital wastewater etc 4 conclusions in summary a novel oxidoreductase capo responsible for oxidative inactivation of cap and tap was identified via comparative proteomic analysis and its role in chloramphenicols resistance was confirmed through heterogeneous expression high resolution mass spectrometry analysis and multiscale computational chemical analysis indicated that capo performed a four electron double oxidation reaction on the c3 alcohol group of cap and tap accompanied by the generation of h2o2 and the destruction of the reactive chloramphenicols pharmacophore this new finding of oxidative inactivation mechanism significantly expands the knowledge boundary about novel chloramphenicols resistance determinants and mechanisms which was crucial for assessing their risks and reducing their hazard to humans and animals comparative genomic analysis of four capo carrying genomes suggested that capo was associated with a mobile genetic element cluster which endowed with capo potential transferability the large scale metagenomic analysis suggested that cap was the crucial driving factor for the development and accumulation of capo in activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater this gave us a caution that we should be alert to the development and dissemination of capo in some hotspot environments contaminated with a high concentration of cap or tap such as antibiotic production wastewater livestock and poultry breeding wastewater hospital wastewater etc the newly discovered chloramphenicols resistance gene capo should be included in the future survey and assessment of arg risk in specific environments considering the high oxidative catalytic efficiency of capo it provides a choice as a potential biocatalyst for hydroxyl oxidation in chemical synthesis besides the catalysis on the destruction of the reactive pharmacophore manifests that capo can be potentially applied in cap and tap detoxification for enhanced bioremediation of cap and tap contaminated water or soil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15435,expanding knowledge about new types of antibiotic resistance genes is of great significance in dealing with the global antibiotic resistance crisis herein a novel oxidoreductase capo was discovered to be responsible for oxidative inactivation of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol the antibiotic resistance mechanism was comprehensively deciphered using multi omics and multiscale computational approaches a 66 383 bp dna fragment carrying capo was shared among four chloramphenicol resistant strains and the co occurrence of capo with a mobile genetic element cluster revealed its potential mobility among different taxa metagenomic analysis of 772 datasets indicated that chloramphenicol was the crucial driving factor for the development and accumulation of capo in activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater therefore we should pay sufficient attention to its possible prevalence and transfer to pathogens especially in some hotspot environments contaminated with high concentrations of chloramphenicols this finding significantly expands our knowledge boundary about chloramphenicols resistance mechanisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloramphenicols antibiotic resistance gene oxidative inactivation comparative proteomics metagenomics heterologous expression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction along with the excessive consumption of antibiotics by humans antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb are constantly appearing and spreading in the environment which cause worrying implications for the globe pruden et al 2021 the pathogens can acquire new resistance factors through mutations or horizontal gene transfers from other bacteria challenging medicine against infections ji et al 2022 larsson and flach 2021 antibiotic resistance has become a heavy global burden since about 1 27 million deaths were attributable to antibiotic resistant bacterial infections in the world in 2019 antimicrobial resistance collaborators 2022 the world health organization proposed an improvement in awareness and understanding of antibiotic resistance as well as strengthening surveillance which is a prerequisite for assessing their risks however the limited knowledge about args usually underestimates their risks as novel args are in development along with microbial evolution which may be associated with vast medical risks larsson and flach 2021 cai et al 2021 therefore discovering novel antibiotic resistance types and mechanisms is of great significance to risk assessment prevention and control of args chloramphenicols also known as amphenicols are derivatives of dichloroacetamide with a phenylpropanoid structure dowling 2013 chloramphenicol cap thiamphenicol tap and florfenicol ff are three common chloramphenicols cap consists of a p nitrophenyl group a propanediol side chain and a dichloromethyl moiety dowling 2013 tap is a derivative of cap in which the nitro group is replaced with methyl sulfonyl while ff is a fluorinated analog of tap dowling 2013 they have broad spectrum inhibitory effects on a wide variety of microorganisms such as aerobes anaerobes and rickettsiae by blocking the peptidyl transferase activity on the 50s ribosome subunit hutchings et al 2019 they are widely used as antibacterial agents to treat various pathogen infections in veterinary and aquaculture except for cap which has been banned for usage in foodborne animals in china the united states korea japan canada and australia owing to its negative side effects including aplastic anemia and genotoxic carcinogenicity pastor belda et al 2020 hanekamp and bast 2015 however cap is still consumed in great quantity in these countries for instance it has been estimated that 1230 tons of cap are used annually in china zhang et al 2015 notably cap residues were still detected with a high incidence in aquatic products of shenzhen south china in a recent report luo et al 2021 besides some developing countries exhibit excessive consumption of cap for antibacterial infection treatments due to its easy availability and low production costs pastor belda et al 2020 it was reported that the concentrations of chloramphenicols ranged from ng l 1 to mg l 1 levels in aquatic and soil environments worldwide nguyen et al 2022 al riyami et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the occurrence and accumulation of chloramphenicols in some hotspots like hospital wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and livestock and poultry breeding wastewater is a potential motivator for the development and flourishing of chloramphenicols resistant bacteria several chloramphenicols resistance genes and the corresponding resistance mechanisms have been explored such as the production of inactive enzymes and expression of efflux pumps which are the most common resistance approaches blair et al 2015 three types of enzymes including acetyltransferases amidohydrolases and nitroreductases were found to catalyze intracellular antibiotic inactivation of chloramphenicols the acetylation of the propanediol group of cap and tap catalyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferases was the most common intracellular cap or tap inactivation mechanism in bacteria alcala et al 2020 the amide bond hydrolase estdl136 responsible for amide bond hydrolysis was also proved to be involved in cap tap and ff inactivation in bacteria tao et al 2012 crofts et al 2019 discovered a nitroreductase nfsb that confers resistance to cap by nitroreduction in haemophilus influenzae in our previous study a cap resistant and subsisting strain sphingomonas sp cl5 1 isolated from activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater was found to be able to oxidize the propanediol c3 oh of cap and tap into a carboxyl group zhang et al 2020a the 1 3 propanediol group is an essential pharmacophore for the antibacterial activity of cap and tap dinos et al 2016 therefore we speculated that the oxidation of the propanediol pharmacophore was a novel cap resistance mechanism catalyzed by an unknown enzyme in cells in the current study we aimed to discover the novel chloramphenicols resistance gene and decrypt the resistance mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 strain cultivation three cap resistant strains sphingomonas sp cl5 1 caballeronia sp pc1 and caballeronia sp clc5 were isolated from activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater in our lab they could catabolize cap by oxidizing the propanediol

according to the method described in texts s2 and s3 besides the local nucleophilicity index of cap and tap was calculated according to the method described in text s4 2 8 the development and dissemination of capo in various environments revealed by metagenomic analysis a total of 20 lab scale activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater including cap lincomycin ampicillin cephalexin tetracycline erythromycin sulfamethazine kanamycin trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin respectively were established in duplicate to investigate the effect of antibiotics on the shaping of microbial community and generation of args zhao et al 2019 2020a 2021 all the above bioreactors including a control treatment without antibiotic addition were set up with the same seed activated sludge the antibiotic concentrations were gradually increased from 20 mg l 1 to a final level and the activated sludge samples were collected for metagenomic sequencing at different stages detailed information about reactor establishment operation process sample preparation dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing has been described in our previous study zhao et al 2019 a total of 81 metagenomic datasets 1 38 tb were utilized to investigate the development law of capo under the pressure of antibiotics the detailed information on these metagenomic datasets was listed in table s3 a total of 691 metagenomic datasets about 6 8 tb were collected from the published literature to evaluate the dissemination of capo in wastewater treatment systems and drinking water treatment systems the metagenomes from wastewater treatment systems mainly included influent activated sludge anaerobic digestion sludge effluent etc the metagenomes from drinking water treatment systems mainly included drinking water reservoir water river water river sediment biofilm from shower hoses showerheads water taps etc the detailed information of these metagenomes was listed in tables s4 and s5 all the raw metagenomic data were filtered using fastp v 0 20 1 chen et al 2018 the filtered data was assembled by metaspades v 3 13 2 nurk et al 2017 the orfs of assembled contigs were predicted by prodigal v 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 orfs were searched against the protein sequence of capo by blastx e value 1e 5 with a similarity cutoff of 80 and alignment length cutoff of 70 to identify capo in the metagenomes zhao et al 2020a the gene abundances of capo flor and catb2 in metagenomes were calculated as follows the reads of metagenomic datasets were mapped to reference dna sequences of capo flor and catb2 using bowtie2 v 2 4 4 langmead and salzberg 2012 and the gene abundance was calculated according to the following formula zhao et al 2020a abun dance cov erage gb r mapp ed reads l

number of the dataset gb 3 results and discussion 3 1 exploration of the enzyme involved in cap and tap oxidation by comparative proteomics sphingomonas sp cl5 1 was isolated from an activated sludge bioreactor treating wastewater containing a high concentration of cap in the previous study zhang et al 2020a it was gifted in the c3 oh oxidation of cap and tap to the carboxyl group producing oxidized cap and tap namely o cap and o tap fig 1 a and b comparative proteomics was conducted to discover the critical enzyme involved in c3 oh oxidation totally 16 shared significantly up regulated proteins of sphingomonas sp cl5 1 were identified in the treatments of cap and tap fig 1c p 0 05 among them a novel gmc family oxidoreductase named capo was speculated to catalyze the oxidation of cap and tap according to the protein function annotation gmc oxidoreductases constitute a large family of proteins with extensive redox activity for more than 17 different known oxidation reaction types aleksenko et al 2020 cavener 1992 alcohol oxidation by gmc oxidoreductases was the most common oxidation reaction type for substances like pyridoxine p anisyl alcohol and methanol romero and gadda 2014 dijkman and fraaije 2014 the expression of capo was significantly up regulated by 2 74 fold and 2 57 fold in the cap and tap treatments compared with the control group respectively fig 1d these clues implied the possibility that this protein functioned in the oxidation of cap and tap protein capo presented a low homology of less than 41 9 similarity with other manually annotated oxidoreductases in the swiss prot database and less than 59 7 similarity with other proteins in the uniprot parc database except for the capo like protein in the genome of sphingobium sp cap 1 via blastp search sphingobium sp cap 1 was isolated from activated sludge by ma et al 2020 and it was also reported to have the ability to oxidize cap however the enzyme responsible for cap oxidation was not identified in their study protein capo in strain sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and sphingobium sp cap 1 was evolutionarily distinguished from other 98 homologous gmc oxidoreductases and formed a novel clade in the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree fig 1e which indicated that capo might have a novel function and substrate specificity different from the other known gmc oxidoreductases 3 2 oxidative inactivation of cap and tap gives rise to chloramphenicols resistance by capo expression in p putida kt2440 gene capo was functionally expressed in p putida kt2440 fig 2 a to manifest its chloramphenicols resistance activity the mic values of cap and tap for p putida kt2440 capo transformed with a plasmid carrying capo were 16 and 8 fold of those for p putida kt2440 vector transformed with empty plasmid fig 2b which indicated that gene capo contributed to the significant enhancement of cap and tap resistance capability p putida kt2440 capo was invested with the function of cap and tap oxidative detoxification by capo it could oxidize about 100 cap in 19 h and 72 4 tap in 96 h at the initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 into oxidized products fig 2c and d while it could not oxidize ff because the hydroxyl group of cap is replaced by a fluorine molecule for ff fig 2e the antibacterial activity of oxidized products produced by p putida kt2440 capo was tested by antibacterial activity assay fig 2f revealed that there was no antibacterial activity of oxidized products for antibiotic susceptible strains including e coli k12 e coli bl21 de3 and s aureus 25 923 the acetylation of cap and tap catalyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferases is the most common intracellular cap and tap inactivation mechanism in bacteria alcala et al 2020 in addition nitroreductase nfsb and amide bond hydrolase estdl136 are involved in cap inactivation via nitroreduction and amide bond hydrolysis in bacteria crofts et al 2019 tao et al 2012 herein we discovered that an oxidoreductase capo mediated a novel cap and tap resistance type via oxidative inactivation of the propanediol pharmacophore which was totally different from the known resistance mechanism of inactive enzymes including acetyltransferases nitroreductases and amide bond hydrolases 3 3 decryption of enzymatic characteristics and oxidative inactivation mechanism of capo gene capo was successfully overexpressed in e coli bl21 de3 and recombinant his6 tagged capo protein was extracted and purified for biochemical analysis fig s1a c its molecular weight was 58 764 da obtained via liquid chromatography mass spectrometer analysis fig s1d commonly gmc family oxidoreductases utilize flavins as the catalytic cofactor to catalyze highly diverse redox reactions aleksenko et al 2020 however we found that capo did not show cap oxidation activity with cofactors including fad fmn pqq coq10 nadp or nad fig 3 a the catalyst activity of capo was only activated by the presence of mpms or pms which usually functions as the electron transport mediator in the enzyme catalyzed reactions hisada and yagi 1977 fig 3a besides the co existence of mpms and other cofactors did not increase the catalyst activity of capo compared to mpms alone which indicated that the other cofactors were not involved in cap oxidization by capo in vitro as shown in fig 3b the reaction system initially appeared rosy pink because of the coloration of mpms and subsequently turned milk white after a 10 min reaction with capo manifesting the chemical conversion of mpms and its involvement in cap oxidation in common oxygen is the hydrogen acceptor for oxidation reactions by oxidoreductases to generate h2o or h2o2 mcnally et al 2003 in this study about 1 1 mmol l 1 h2o2 was detected in the cap oxidation reaction at the initial concentration of 250 mg l 1 fig 3c which proved the generation of h2o2 during cap oxidation initiated by capo purified capo exhibited good catalytic activity for cap oxidation at a ph range of 7 1 8 7 and a temperature range of 30 0 40 0 c and the optimal ph and temperature were 8 3 and 30 c respectively fig 3d and e the effects of various metal ions organic solvents detergents oxidizing agents bleaching agents and other inhibitors on capo activity were investigated to characterize the enzymatic properties of capo and figure out regulatory factors of the enzyme activity these results could guide the better application of this enzyme for oxidative inactivation of cap and tap among these factors only organic solvents including alcohol acetone and isopropyl alcohol 5 v v can promote cap oxidization activity of capo by 4 6 7 4 p 0 01 while most of the tested compounds exerted inhibitory effects on its activity fig 3f and g the promotion of organic solvents at low content 10 v v on various enzymes has been widely observed in previous studies zhao et al 2020b rajput et al 2016 fecl3 alcl3 cuso4 n bromosuccinimide cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate had strong inhibitory effects on capo activity by more than 78 activity reduction p 0 001 in vitro enzyme capo could catalyze oxidization of both cap and tap with k m values of 9 58 10 5 m and 1 96 10 4 m and k cat k m values of 2 78 107 m 1 s 1 and 1 39 107m 1 s 1 respectively fig 3h and i the affinity and catalytic efficiency of capo on cap were remarkably higher than those on tap which was an important reason for the faster and more complete oxidation of cap than tap by p putida kt2440 capo in vivo the molecular surface electrostatic potential analysis further indicated that the oxygen atom at c3 of cap and tap was apt to donate electrons to o2 fig s2a and b the local nucleophilicity indexes of c3 and the oxygen atom at c3 of cap are 0 1292 and 0 0473 which are higher than those 0 0996 and 0 0466 of tap thus the critical active group i e c3 oh of cap has a more powerful electron donating ability than that of tap which means cap is more liable to be oxidized the kinetic k cat k m of capo is far higher than chloramphenicol acetyltransferases 3 86 104 1 29 106m 1 s 1 which are typical chloramphenicol resistance enzymes with modification activity alcala et al 2020 moreover k cat k m of capo is also remarkably higher than the average level 105 m 1 s 1 of several thousands of enzymes collected from the literature by bar even et al 2011 the high catalytic efficiency of capo contributed to the rapid inactivation of antibiotics for bacterial defense against chloramphenicols besides the dramatic decrease of antibiotic concentration around cells may allow other coexisting susceptible bacteria particularly pathogens to flourish thus resulting in the invalidation of antibacterial therapy the oxidized products of cap and tap were identified by hplc qtof ms analysis as shown in fig 4 a h two oxidized products of cap and tap were detected and they were identified to be d cap d tap with an aldehyde group at the c3 position and o cap o tap with a carboxyl group at the c3 position our previous study zhang et al 2020 and ma et al 2020 already proved that the c3 oh of cap could be oxidized to a carboxyl group by sphingomonas sp cl5 1 and sphingobium sp cap 1 here we further tracked out that capo performed a four electron double oxidation reaction on cap and tap in which the alcohol group was oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde d cap and d tap and subsequently to the corresponding carboxylic acid o cap and o tap fig 4i the destruction of the reactive pharmacophore of antibiotics is a common approach for bacterial resistance among which hydrolysis acetylation and methylation are widely employed by bacteria wen et al 2021 the discovery of the hydroxy oxidative inactivation mechanism in this study significantly expands our knowledge boundary about chloramphenicols resistance mechanism via enzyme catalyzed antibiotics inactivation the protein structure of capo was predicted by rosettafold and its protein complexes with cap and tap were acquired by molecular docking as shown in fig 4j l cap and tap were buried inside the active pocket of capo the hydrogen bonds formed with residues asn94 tyr 471 and trp 81 may be involved in oxidation catalysis especially two hydrogen bonds formed between c3 oh of cap tap and residue asn94 which probably was a key active site for the oxidation of c3 oh besides the difference in estimated binding free energies of capo cap 36 6 kcal mol 1 and capo tap 31 5 kcal mol 1 complexes also contributes to their difference in catalytic efficiency fig s2c molecular docking helps to understand the interaction of enzymes and substrates by anticipating the preferred orientation when bound to each other morris and lim wilby 2008 to deeply decipher the bonding form and catalytic mechanism a robust and refined enzyme substrate complex of capo should be acquired by protein structure resolution methods like cryo electron microscopy and x ray crystallography in the future 3 4 the mobility of capo revealed by comparative genomic analysis of capo carrying strains three cap subsisting strains including sphingomonas sp cl5 1 caballeronia sp pc1 and caballeronia sp clc5 isolated from a cap degrading consortium zhang et al 2020 were capable of oxidizing cap to o cap and their complete genomes were acquired by combined application of illumina sequencing and oxford nanopore technologies ont sequencing in the present study we compared the genomes of these three strains and another cap oxidizing strain sphingobium sp cap 1 isolated by ma et al 2020 fortuitously a shared fragment of 66 383 bp 99 4 similarity carrying capo in their chromosomal genomes was discovered although they belong to different species and even different classes fig 5 a gene repa encoding a plasmid replication initiation protein is located in the shared fragment fig 5b which hints that the shared fragment may import from the extrachromosomal or even exogenous dna such as conjugative plasmids via the horizontal gene transfer mardanov and ravin 2006 a type iv coupling protein t4cp gene vird4 and a gene cluster of type iv secretion system t4ss consisting of 12 t4ss protein genes including trbi trbg trbf trbl trbk trbj trbe trbd trbc trbb trbn and traf are located in the shared fragment fig 5b as one kind of integrative and conjugative element ice t4ss is responsible for dna and protein translocations among phylogenetically diverse bacterial and eukaryotic taxa as well as dna release or uptake from the extracellular milieu by traversing the cell envelope chandran 2013 grohmann et al 2018 t4ss is a common system to mediate horizontal gene transfer which is the basis for arg spread among diverse bacteria and greatly facilitates bacterial adaptation to environmental changes costa et al 2021 t4cp is an essential constituent for most t4sss in charge of the recruitment of the dna or protein substrate to the t4ss channel llosa and alkorta 2017 besides a relaxase gene vird2 which is also an important component of t4ss padavannil et al 2014 was found to be adjacent to vird4 in the shared fragment fig 5b a recombinase gene is located in the tail end of the shared fragment fig 5b recombinases constitute a large enzyme family with the function of dna recombination and they are also involved in driving the movement of mobile genetic elements smyshlyaev et al 2021 commonly there are four modules including an origin of transfer region orit relaxase t4cp and t4ss in the conjugative transfer region of a typical self transmissible mobile genetic element to support its mobility costa et al 2021 though orit was not found in the shared dna fragment the high homology of the capo carrying dna fragments in different species and the existence of genes encoding relaxase t4cp t4ss and recombinase in this fragment vigorously manifested that these four strains acquired capo by the horizontal gene transfer therefore the shared dna fragment carrying capo probably was mobile among different bacteria the capture dissemination and accumulation of args in bacteria in various environments are primarily by virtue of the horizontal gene transfer events mediated by mobile genetic elements partridge et al 2018 the args associated with mobile genetic elements usually exert more severe potential risks on human health as they have active and frequent mobility among various taxa and maybe occasionally transferred to pathogens thus finally posing a challenge to medical treatment saak et al 2020 therefore as a novel member of args capo went totally unheeded in previous studies it should involve attention due to its association with mobile genetic elements which might facilitate its transferability towards pathogens 3 5 the development and dissemination of capo in various environments revealed by metagenomic analysis metagenomic datasets 1 38 tb of 81 samples collected from lab scale activated sludge reactors treating antibiotic production wastewater including cap lincomycin ampicillin cephalexin tetracycline erythromycin sulfamethazine kanamycin trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin respectively were analyzed to reveal the development and accumulation rules of gene capo in the severely antibiotic contaminated environments table s3 as shown in fig 5c and d gene capo was only detected in activated sludge bioreactors treating cap production wastewater while it was undetectable in activated sludge bioreactors treating other antibiotics it is well known that chloramphenicol acetyltransferase catb2 and bcr cfla family efflux transporter flor are the most common chloramphenicols resistance genes reported in previous studies alcala et al 2020 nevertheless the newly discovered chloramphenicols resistance gene capo is also dominant in all the bioreactors treating cap production wastewater its abundance was even markedly higher than that of flor and catb2 in bioreactors treating wastewater with cap concentration higher than 70 mg l 1 fig 5d the association between cap concentration and capo abundance indicated that cap was the crucial driving factor for the development and accumulation of capo in activated sludge consortia high pressure of antibiotics residues in the hotspot environments associated with human activities e g antibiotic production wastewater livestock and poultry breeding wastewater hospital wastewater etc compels indigenous bacteria to develop resistance and makes the resistance acquirers prevalent liu et al 2022 levin reisman et al 2017 in addition a total of 691 metagenomic datasets about 6 8 tb collected from the published literature were analyzed to evaluate the dissemination of capo in the wastewater treatment systems and drinking water treatment systems which were inextricably linked to human health tables s4 and s5 wastewater treatment systems are regarded as a critical reservoir of antibiotics and args and drinking water treatment systems have a direct bearing on human health li et al 2020 karkman et al 2018 fortunately there was no evidence for the prevalence of capo in the environments closely linked to human activities as it was not detected in these 691 metagenomic samples fig 5e gene capo only emerged and preponderated in the activated sludge bioreactors treating cap production wastewater and the isolated strains carrying capo were all obtained from these bioreactors in both this study and the study conducted by ma et al 2020 thus we concluded that cap was a powerful driving force for the development and prevalence of capo low cap concentrations commonly at ng l 1 μg l 1 level in water nguyen et al 2022 may be an important reason for the undetected capo in municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment systems besides the abundance of capo may be too low in municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment systems to be detected by metagenomic approach in summary an ice mediated novel oxidoreductase capo that confers high level cap and tap resistance was firstly confirmed in this study capo performed a four electron double oxidation reaction to inactivate cap and tap for resistance its association with mobile genetic element endowed with capo potential transferability and thus probably facilitated its dissemination among bacteria although there was no evidence for the prevalence of capo in the environments closely linked to human activities we still should be vigilant about its possibility of prevalence and transfer to pathogens especially in some hotspot environments contaminated with a high concentration of cap or tap such as antibiotic production wastewater livestock and poultry breeding wastewater hospital wastewater etc 4 conclusions in summary a novel oxidoreductase capo responsible for oxidative inactivation of cap and tap was identified via comparative proteomic analysis and its role in chloramphenicols resistance was confirmed through heterogeneous expression high resolution mass spectrometry analysis and multiscale computational chemical analysis indicated that capo performed a four electron double oxidation reaction on the c3 alcohol group of cap and tap accompanied by the generation of h2o2 and the destruction of the reactive chloramphenicols pharmacophore this new finding of oxidative inactivation mechanism significantly expands the knowledge boundary about novel chloramphenicols resistance determinants and mechanisms which was crucial for assessing their risks and reducing their hazard to humans and animals comparative genomic analysis of four capo carrying genomes suggested that capo was associated with a mobile genetic element cluster which endowed with capo potential transferability the large scale metagenomic analysis suggested that cap was the crucial driving factor for the development and accumulation of capo in activated sludge bioreactors treating antibiotic production wastewater this gave us a caution that we should be alert to the development and dissemination of capo in some hotspot environments contaminated with a high concentration of cap or tap such as antibiotic production wastewater livestock and poultry breeding wastewater hospital wastewater etc the newly discovered chloramphenicols resistance gene capo should be included in the future survey and assessment of arg risk in specific environments considering the high oxidative catalytic efficiency of capo it provides a choice as a potential biocatalyst for hydroxyl oxidation in chemical synthesis besides the catalysis on the destruction of the reactive pharmacophore manifests that capo can be potentially applied in cap and tap detoxification for enhanced bioremediation of cap and tap contaminated water or soil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15436,reservoirs are active reactors for the biogeochemical cycling of carbon c and nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p and silica si however our in depth understanding of c and nutrient cycling in reservoirs is still limited by the fact that it involves a variety of closely linked and coupled biogeochemical and hydrological processes in this study the updated process based barman model was applied to three reservoirs of the seine basin during 2019 2020 considering the variations of carbon dioxide co2 concentrations and key water quality variables the model simulations captured well the observed seasonal variations of water quality variables although discrepancies remained for some variables according to the model we found that 1 the three reservoirs are autotrophic ecosystems and showed high removal efficiency of dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrients during 2019 2020 2 phytoplankton assimilation benthic denitrification precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate and gas exchange at the water air interface are the dominant processes for water quality variations in reservoirs 3 based on scenarios results trophic state and mean water depth of reservoir would impact the biogeochemical processes and the retention efficiency of nitrate and dissolved silicate finally we expect that the successful application of barman model in the reservoirs of the seine basin could provide a useful tool for simulating reservoir water quality changes and thus evaluating the impacts of reservoirs on downstream water quality keywords nutrient fate co2 concentration modeling approach scenario analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction inland water ecosystems river reservoir lake and pond have been characterized as active sites for carbon c and nutrients e g nitrogen n phosphorus p and silica si biogeochemical cycles bastviken et al 2011 cole et al 2007 deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2020a tranvik et al 2009 van cappellen and maavara 2016 anthropogenic activities may affect nutrient biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems in several ways for example through the increase of nutrient loads to inland waters due to intensive agricultural fertilization and domestic wastewater discharge bouwman et al 2013 garnier et al 2021 grizzetti et al 2021 and through disturbances along the aquatic continuum friedl and wüest 2002 maavara et al 2020a van cappellen and maavara 2016 the construction of reservoirs represents a significant human disturbance to the integrity of inland water ecosystems and its impact on the c and nutrient biogeochemical cycles has led to substantial interest in reservoir biogeochemical research in recent years chen et al 2020 deemer et al 2016 harrison et al 2021 maavara et al 2020b 2020a wang et al 2018 2021 yan et al 2021a reservoirs are usually built by damming a river significantly altering hydrological conditions transforming a lotic ecosystem into a lentic ecosystem schmutz and moog 2018 impeding the natural flow of water and the associated c and nutrients and acting as the in stream reactors maavara et al 2020a typically reservoirs increase the water residence time and sedimentation rate and thus decrease turbidity and light attenuation in the reservoir water column providing favorable conditions for promoting photosynthesis and enhancing c and nutrient biogeochemical cycling van cappellen and maavara 2016 photosynthesis assimilates dissolved inorganic carbon dic and nutrients into organic matter which is further decomposed by several processes e g aerobic respiration denitrification dissolution of biogenic silica and thereby impacts the concentrations of carbon dioxide co2 and nutrients in the water column li et al 2022 wang et al 2020a 2020b xiao et al 2021 therefore the variations of co2 and nutrient concentrations in reservoirs are indeed closely linked through multiple biogeochemical processes however these processes remain difficult to understand through in situ measurements kong et al 2019 process based biogeochemical models have been well developed to simulate the water quality variables e g water temperature and nutrient budgets in inland aquatic ecosystems mooij et al 2010 there are a number of well established aquatic ecosystem models simulating water quality that have been applied to reservoirs including the ce qual w2 e g lindenschmidt et al 2019 sadeghian et al 2018 wu et al 2022 efdc e g tong et al 2021 and delft3d models e g chen et al 2019 in addition some other models were specifically designed for stagnant systems and for simulating the dynamics of water quality variables in reservoirs such as the pclake kong et al 2019 barman garnier et al 2000 thieu et al 2006 dylem 1d bonnet and poulin 2004 and glm model weber et al 2017 winton et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge few studies have assessed both nutrient fate and co2 concentrations in reservoirs using process based biogeochemical models as mentioned previously the variations of co2 and nutrient concentrations are co impacted by the biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoirs therefore we argue that models that take into account both nutrient fate and co2 variations could provide new insights into the biogeochemical functioning of reservoirs to address the aforementioned question we focused on investigating the applicability of an existing process based biogeochemical model in the main reservoirs of the seine basin france the nutrient budgets in these reservoirs have been explored by in situ measurements mass balance methods garnier et al 1999 yan et al 2022 2021b and an initial modeling approach garnier et al 2000 thieu et al 2006 here we applied the barman model which newly contains an inorganic carbon module based on a previous study on the seine river marescaux et al 2020 the specific goals of the present study are as follows 1 to evaluate the performance of the barman model in simulating the variations of nutrient and co2 concentrations in the reservoirs 2 to quantify the nutrient fate and related biogeochemical processes 3 to discuss the impact of potential scenarios including trophic states hydrological management strategies and morphological characteristics on the ecological functions of these reservoirs and 4 to propose science based options and implications for the downstream targeted nutrient management in reservoirs 2 material and methods 2 1 the marne aube and seine reservoirs the three main reservoirs marne aube and seine are located upstream of the seine basin with a maximum surface area of 48 km2 23 km2 and 23 km2 respectively fig 1 they are managed by the public institution seine grand lac sgl https www seinegrandslacs fr these reservoirs are diverted from their upstream rivers and linked to downstream rivers through artificial canals the aube reservoir contains two distinct lakes lake amance and lake temple the two main hydrological functions of these reservoirs are to prevent downstream flooding during winter and spring and to support downstream low water flow in summer and autumn therefore the annual hydrological cycle from december 2019 to november 2020 of these three reservoirs is similar see fig 1c and d and can be characterized by two periods the filling period water flows into the reservoirs from december to june of the following year and the emptying period water flows out of the reservoirs from july to november the main characteristics of the three reservoirs were presented in table 1 2 2 data collected on the field the water quality in the three reservoirs and their upstream rivers was acquired through monthly field measurements during 2019 and 2020 the sampling strategy for each site see yan et al 2022 was to take water with a bucket from bridges or pontoons 5 l high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled all samples were conditioned e g filtration and kept at 10 c in the field after returning to the laboratory they were stored at 4 c or frozen until the analysis in the field ph water temperature t c and dissolved oxygen do mg l 1 were measured using a multiparameter instrument ysi 6600 v2 for co2 measurements 30 ml of water was kept in four syringes 60 ml with 30 ml of ambient air and were shaken for 10 min a fifth syringe was filled with ambient air to measure the atmospheric co2 the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water was determined through a non dispersive infrared gas analyzer licor li 820 usa using the syringe headspace equilibrium method abril et al 2015 marescaux et al 2018 in the laboratory dissolved nutrient concentrations including nitrate no3 mg n l 1 nitrite no2 mg n l 1 ammonium nh4 mg n l 1 orthophosphate po4 3 mg p l 1 and dissolved silicate dsi mg si l 1 were measured spectrophotometrically according to slawyk and macisaac 1972 rodier 1984 and jones 1984 respectively suspended particulate matters sm mg l 1 were determined as the weight of material retained on a whatman gf f membrane per volume unit after drying the filter for 2 h at 120 c the total inorganic phosphorus tip mg p l 1 was calculated by po4 3 and sm according to billen et al 2007 and némery et al 2005 for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc mg c l 1 water samples were filtered with gf f whatman grilled filters gf f 0 7 μm at 500 c for 4 h collected in grilled glass flasks and acidified 0 1 ml h2so4 4 m in 30 ml of water and then analyzed with a toc analyzer aurora 1030 toc analyzer oi analytical chlorophyll a concentrations chl a μg l 1 algal cells retained on gf c membrane filters were determined spectrophotometrically after extraction using 90 acetone according to lorenzen 1967 ta mmol l 1 was measured by 20 ml of filtered water gf f 0 7 μm using an automatic titrator titrando 905 and hcl hydrochloric acid 0 01 m dic mg c l 1 concentrations were calculated from water temperature ph and ta using co2sys pierrot et al 2006 2 3 the barman model the barman model was applied to the marne reservoir during 1993 1995 with a simplified representation of the hydraulic conditions of the reservoir considered as a perfectly mixed biogeochemical reactor garnier et al 2000 and coupled with a detailed process based biogeochemical model the rive model billen et al 1994 garnier et al 2002 additional developments have introduced a simplified representation of the reservoir s morphology as idealized parabolic or spherical shapes and the possibility to simulate the average depth of the reservoir according to the management of the water volumes at each time step thieu et al 2006 recently recoded in python both the rive v3 2 https gitlab in2p3 fr rive pyrive and barman https gitlab in2p3 fr rive barman models have been published under the terms of the epl 2 0 eclipse public license and the gnu gpl 3 0 general public license the current version of the barman model has embedded the latest version of the rive code pyrive v3 2 including the calculations of the biogeochemical processes and nutrient exchanges at the water sediment interface by a simplified algorithm method billen et al 2015 and the inorganic carbon module was implemented to simulate co2 concentrations in rivers marescaux et al 2020 detailed descriptions of the barman including morphological characteristics table s1 and fig s1 and the rive models are presented in the supplementary information si text s1 and fig s2 the parameters used in the rive model are shown in table s2 additionally we updated the calculations of total alkalinity ta and dic based on marescaux et al 2020 in these reservoirs we found that precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate caco3 are significant see text s2 fig s3 therefore we considered the effect of caco3 precipitation and dissolution on changes in ta and dic the equations for calculating ta and dic are as follows 1 t a t a t 1 d t d t a d t 2 d t a d t 14 106 r e s p b a c t r e s p z o o r e s p b e

respzoo and respbent represent the respiration of bacteria zooplankton and benthic respiration mg c l 1 h 1 respectively denit and nitr aob are respectively the denitrification and nitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob mg n l 1 h 1 uptphyn is the nitrogen uptake by phytoplankton mg n l 1 h 1 consisting of nitrate uptphyno3 mg n l 1 h 1 and ammonium uptphynh4 mg n l 1 h 1 uptphyc is the

represents the mixing effect caused by water entering the reservoir h 1 caprecip is the caco3 precipitation dissolution rate which was reflected by the obvious seasonal dynamics of ca2 concentrations in the three reservoirs see text s2 once ta and dic are calculated the hydrogen ion concentration h can be calculated based on ta and dic and co2 can be derived from h and ta dic stumm and morgan 1996 the calculation procedures of h and co2 are presented in text s3 2 4 model implementation and evaluation the quantity and quality of water flowing into the reservoir are the main boundary conditions of the barman model the daily dynamics of volume and mean depth of the reservoir were calculated according to the idealized morphology and the water discharge flowing into and out of the reservoir provided by the sgl the water quality variables used are those collected on the field see section 2 2 interpolation methods were applied to derive the input data at the daily time step the wrtds weighted regressions on time discharge and season method was used for water quality variables including no3 dsi sm and po4 3 e g hirsch et al 2010 zhang and blomquist 2018 which are presented in fig s4 a simple linear interpolation method was used for other water variables the rmse root mean square error and bias were used to evaluate the performance of the barman model 5 rmse i 1 n o b s i s i m

our understanding of the factors influencing reservoir biogeochemical processes and functions an analysis of three possible scenarios were conducted using the marne reservoir as an example including 1 trophic state different tip concentration in the incoming river flow 2 hydrological management alterations delaying and advancing the emptying period for one month 3 morphological characteristic theoretical reservoir shape was created on the basis of the initial calibration of the reservoir morphology text s1 and using maximum depth dmax and surface area smax parameters to estimate the daily variation in the mean depth and volume of the marne reservoir the detailed scenario setup is presented in table 2 3 results 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 validation of the dynamics in water quality variables because the dynamics of the water quality variables were similar in the three reservoirs we present here the marne reservoir as an example fig 2 and the results of the other two reservoirs are presented in si figs s5 s7 overall despite some discrepancies between observations and simulations the simulation well results reproduce the observations of key water variables in the three reservoirs during 2019 2020 the rmse and bias which indicate the deviation and the over underestimations between observations and simulations in the three reservoirs respectively show values well in the range except for the high values of po4 3 and nh4 concentrations table 3 the model successfully simulated phytoplankton development fig 2a during december march and april august respectively however the model led to a lag in simulating the gradual increase of chl a during september december and did not capture the peak value of chl a in december the model showed a good simulation of no3 dynamics during december july but it slightly overestimated the low no3 concentrations during september november at the end of the emptying period for do the model successfully captured the general trend in the reservoirs with high and low values during december march and august september respectively moreover the seasonal variations of dsi concentrations in the three reservoirs were successfully simulated by the model during 2019 2020 including the gradual decrease during december august of the following year and the increase during september november fig 2 in addition the model also captured most observations of po4 3 and nh4 except for some high values e g po4 3 in may and july of 2020 and nh4 in november of 2019 and 2020 in the marne reservoir 3 1 2 validation of the co2 simulation in the carbonate systems the model successfully simulated the dynamics of ta and dic in the three reservoirs during 2019 2020 figs 3 and s5 s7 in addition we also found that the precipitation and dissolution of caco3 play a significant role in regulating the dynamics of ta and dic in the three reservoirs compared with the effect of the biogeochemical processes text s4 and fig s8 although the observed values of ph in the reservoirs fluctuated the model still captured the general level of ph however discrepancies between simulations and observations still exist during march july 2020 not adhering well to the trend and with some underestimations of the ph nevertheless the simulations of co2 were generally consistent with the observations i e the relatively high and low values and the decrease in co2 was captured 3 2 the biogeochemical processes and nutrient fate in the three reservoirs 3 2 1 the ecosystem metabolism primary production and respiration rates showed synchronized variations in the three reservoirs gradually increasing from january to july while decreasing from july to december fig 4 for the marne reservoir the others refer to fig s9 the highest rates of primary production i e phytoplankton uptake were found during june july from 23 tons c d 1 in aube amance to 115 tons c d 1 in marne which is the largest reservoir with twice the surface area of the former reservoirs the highest respiration rates were very close to the phytoplankton uptake rates in terms of net ecosystem primary production nep i e photosynthesis minus respiration the three reservoirs were generally autotrophic ecosystems with average nep values from 0 16 to 0 79 tons c d 1 ranging from 57 aube temple to 288 marne tons c yr 1 during one annual hydrological cycle in the model respiration represents the sum of bacteria respbact zooplankton respzoo and benthic respiration respbent the results revealed that respbact and respbent were the dominant components of total respiration while respzoo made only a small contribution to this total in the three reservoirs indeed respbact represented more than 75 of the total respiration during march october which corresponded to the period with high primary production and a high respbent rate was found during november february of the following hydrological year in the three reservoirs 3 2 2 nutrient fate and corresponding biogeochemical processes the input and output fluxes of no3 tip dsi and dic and the main biogeochemical processes related to their transformations were quantified during 2019 and 2020 fig 5 for marne for the others refer to figs s10 12 in terms of the fate of nutrients the results revealed that phytoplankton uptake was one of the most significant processes affecting the transformations of no3 tip dsi and dic in the three reservoirs benthic denitrification especially and nitrification in the water column were also two important processes affecting no3 dynamics in the three reservoirs internal cycling of p was enhanced by phytoplankton uptake respiration and benthic release while the sedimentation of tip had a marginal impact on tip in the water column compared with the other processes for dsi diatom uptake played an important role in dsi concentrations in the water column and benthic flux released by biogenic silica dissolution bsi did not compensate for this in terms of the dic transformation phytoplankton uptake and respiration were two dominant processes regulating the internal cycling of dic while the precipitation of caco3 and co2 emissions was the dominant process driving the net change of dic concentrations in the water column 3 2 3 nutrient budgets during one hydrological cycle in the three reservoirs the n budgets including no3 and nh4 p tip si dsi and bsi and c including total organic carbon and inorganic carbon during one annual hydrological cycle were calculated according to the multiple processes considered by the barman model here we show schematic diagrams of nutrient transformation and transport in the example of the marne reservoir fig 6 details on the nutrient fate of the three reservoirs are provided in table s3 all three reservoirs affected a high no3 retention ranging from 36 aube amance to 51 marne the intensity of phytoplankton uptake 71 312 tons n yr 1 and benthic denitrification 178 1102 tons n yr 1 i e no3 removal is clearly illustrated in fig 5 and table s3 ammonification 459 1789 tons n yr 1 and phytoplankton uptake 520 2048 tons n yr 1 were the main processes driving nh4 transformations compared with nh4 oxidation 48 213 tons n yr 1 and benthic flux 80 349 tons n yr 1 the three reservoirs showed high retention of dsi ranging from 49 aube temple to 69 marne and phytoplankton uptake 172 940 tons si yr 1 was the dominant process responsible for the dsi removal sinking as bsi with diatom biomass the three reservoirs also showed high bsi retention rates ranging from 38 aube temple to 89 marne in addition 64 79 of tip was retained in the three reservoirs with phytoplankton uptake of po4 3 being the dominant process retaining tip in these reservoirs from 98 aube temple to 391 marne tons p yr 1 in terms of dic the three reservoirs showed retention rates ranging from 25 aube amance to 65 aube temple the caco3 precipitation 913 4875 tons c yr 1 and co2 emission 859 5773 tons c yr 1 were the most significant processes for dic removal in the water column additionally the annual net burial of toc total organic carbon in sediments of the three reservoirs ranged from 61 aube temple to 458 marne tons c yr 1 3 3 scenario analysis in the marne reservoir 3 3 1 assessing the impact of different trophic states primary production respiration and nep all increased with tip concentration in the inflowing river water and their increasing rates were higher according to the range of tip concentrations of 1 50 μg p l 1 the gradual increases of nep also indicated an increased autotrophy with increasing tip concentrations fig 7 a in addition the trophic state of the reservoir significantly impacted the retention of no3 and dsi the retention rate of no3 showed an increase from 38 1 μg p l 1 to 63 100 μg p l 1 but this increase of the no3 retention rate was the highest from 38 to 51 in the lower range of the tip concentrations explored 1 25 μg p l 1 fig 7b the retention rate of dsi was greater in response to the increasing tip concentrations of 1 25 μg p l 1 from 29 to 68 with a slight decrease from 70 to 54 as the tip loads continued to increase from 50 to 100 μg p l 1 fig 7b 3 3 2 changes in hydrological management strategies without significantly affecting the primary function of the marne reservoir i e to prevent flooding and support water flow the changes in hydrological management strategies involve advancing or delaying for 1 month the start of the emptying period in the reservoir fig 8 compared with the reference scenario primary production and respiration showed similar patterns with values respectively of only 1 6 and 1 7 higher in the delayed hydrological scenario and of 3 8 and 3 9 i e lower in the advanced scenario fig 8b c regarding retention rates those of no3 decreased only slightly by 2 advanced and increased by 1 delayed fig 8d similarly the dsi retention did not change delayed or did so by only 2 advanced fig 8e overall the ecosystem metabolism and nutrient retention did not change significantly under these possible modifications of the hydrological management strategies for the marne reservoir 3 3 3 different morphological characteristics in the marne reservoir changes in morphological parameters maximum depth and maximum surface that were used to define the idealized spherical shape of the reservoir logically had strong impacts on the mean depths of the water column calculated daily according to hydrological conditions fig 9 the ecosystem metabolism changed only slightly compared with the reference situation primary production and respiration decreased respectively by 5 8 and 5 6 for the large shallow scenario similarly lower percentages of both primary production and respiration were obtained for the small deep scenario 8 and 8 3 respectively relative to the reference fig 9b c for the nutrient retention rates the large shallow reservoir showed a slight increased no3 retention rate from 51 ref to 53 and a small decreased rate from 51 ref to 47 for the small deep scenario fig 9d however the low dsi retention rate was significantly lowered in the large shallow reservoir from 69 ref to 38 while it only increased marginally from 69 ref to 73 for the small deep reservoir fig 9e in addition we further found that the benthic denitrification 1140 tons n yr 1 and benthic flux of dsi 390 tons si yr 1 in the large shallow reservoir were 1 1 and 1 6 times higher than the small deep reservoir respectively fig s13 although primary production in the large shallow scenario was slightly higher than in the small deep scenario the dsi assimilation was nevertheless 1 2 times lower than in the latter 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the model performance and limitations overall the barman model showed satisfactory simulation results for the key water quality variables and co2 dynamics during 2019 2020 in the three reservoirs of the seine basin despite some discrepancies figs 2 and s5 s7 in the three reservoirs the peak value of chl a was generally observed during the end of the emptying period when water levels are relatively low which may enhance the nutrient exchanges from the sediment to the water column increase light availability and thereby stimulate the development of phytoplankton in reservoirs see yan et al 2022 for no3 concentrations the lowest values were also observed with low water depth which were not fully captured by the model a possible explanation is that the resuspension process that increases sm concentrations in the water column when water levels are low was not considered in the model while the concentration of sm has been shown to significantly influence the denitrification process in aquatic ecosystems e g jia et al 2016 xia et al 2017 moreover although stratification could occasionally occur during summer when temperature and water level were high in these reservoirs see garnier et al 2000 the zero dimension barman model in fact does not consider such stratification but assumes that the three reservoirs are well mixed systems the barman model which needs fewer input data and lesser running time than multi dimension models e g the delft3d and ce qual w2 models lindenschmidt et al 2019 wu et al 2022 fails to reproduce possible low oxygen concentrations in bottom waters suitable for denitrification processes nevertheless the model captured fairly well the dynamics of no3 and other variables e g nutrients in the water column which shows its usefulness in simulating biogeochemical processes in these reservoirs for the simulation of the variations in co2 concentrations the gas transfer coefficient k600 plays an important role in simulating co2 in the three reservoirs e g in the marne reservoir fig s14 in this study the daily wind speed was not available and we used monthly average wind speed in a single location and selected a k600 constant value of 0 08 m h 1 median value calculated from six different methods see text s5 given the importance of gas transfer velocity k for modeling the co2 dynamics we believe that the high resolution measurement of k is needed in future studies additionally we have only estimated the precipitation and dissolution rates of caco3 see text s4 based on seven dates in the three reservoirs during 2020 despite the satisfactory simulation results of ta and dic found in the marne seine and aube lake temple reservoirs specific research efforts are still required focusing on the precipitation and dissolution rates of caco3 in these reservoirs with generic kinetics equations in a future version of barman model 4 2 nutrients in reservoirs budgets and transformations nutrient budgets in the three reservoirs were estimated using a mass balance method based on the uneven temporal frequency measurements bimonthly monthly and seasonal during 1993 1995 garnier et al 1999 and 1998 2018 yan et al 2021b which indicated that reservoirs play an important role in nutrient retention whatever the measurement strategy in this study the biogeochemical processes responsible for the nutrient transformations were analyzed with the barman model and the nutrient retention rates were thus calculated based on simulations at a daily time step our results are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that reservoirs exhibit a strong capacity for retention of dic and nutrients n p si akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2017 2015b 2014 mendonça et al 2017 and they are also close to our previous long term assessments using monthly or seasonal measurements during 1998 2018 yan et al 2021b uneven and low frequency measurements may not capture the seasonal patterns of nutrient concentrations in water and thereby lead to uncertainty in evaluating their budgets see kong et al 2019 for no3 however the different data series gathered from these reservoirs showed similar retention rates according to our previous study yan et al 2021b which would support our simulation results high frequency measurements are well adapted for nep determination but probe availability for establishing the nutrient budgets of interest is still limited and the maintenance of probes for frequent or continuous measurements is costly although several statistical models have been used for nutrient retention rates in lakes and reservoirs including n alexander et al 2002 harrison et al 2009 seitzinger et al 2002 and si maavara et al 2014 the underlying biological processes could not be fully described based on the mechanistic barman model i e process based which describes the major processes involved in the biogeochemical transformations of c and nutrients see si texts1 fig s2 we could explicitly unravel both the fate of carbon and nutrients and the importance of physical processes in the three reservoirs see 3 2 3 therefore our results would provide a deep understanding of seasonal variations in water quality variables in these reservoirs and also a potential utility to minimize the impact of the reservoirs on their downstream water quality 4 3 effects of external phosphorus management on reservoir ecological function taking the marne reservoir as an example the response of the ecosystem metabolism to the external p loads clearly revealed the importance of p concentrations in the primary production respiration and nep it is well known that primary production combines the biogeochemical cycles of c and nutrients in aquatic ecosystems bernhardt 2013 interestingly our results indicated that the retention efficiency of no3 and dsi varied with the external p loads for no3 retention denitrification dominantly in the sediment was shown to be the main process responsible for no3 elimination in the three reservoirs see 3 2 2 in addition to the levels of do and no3 the availability of biodegradable organic matter is one of the factors controlling denitrification rates seitzinger et al 2006 therefore at low p concentration low phytoplankton biomass was supported and less organic matter fell to the sediment thus ultimately limiting the denitrification rate and thereby lowering the no3 retention rate in the reservoirs bernhardt 2013 finlay et al 2013 similarly the elimination of dsi was mainly induced by diatom uptake which was significantly affected by dip concentrations in the reservoirs maavara et al 2015a xiao et al 2019 increasing p concentrations in the range of 1 25 μg p l 1 stimulates the development of diatoms in the marne reservoir and thus dsi uptake without other limitations the growth of diatoms would increase with p concentrations however other groups of phytoplankton non diatoms show a greater competitive advantage than diatoms in freshwaters with high p concentrations burson et al 2018 which may further impact the uptake and retention rate of dsi in reservoirs for instance the biomass of diatoms as calculated by the model was essentially constant for p loads ranging from 25 to 50 μg p l 1 and levelled off or decreased instead when p loads exceeded 50 μg p l 1 see text s6 fig s15 which resulted in a reduced dsi retention efficiency when the tip concentration exceeded 50 μg p l 1 this result confirms that changes in dip concentrations clearly affect biogeochemical processes on the one hand denitrification and no3 retention may be reduced at low p concentrations without playing a positive role in removing no3 for downstream rivers on the other hand increasing dip may lead to an undesirable change in phytoplankton composition from diatoms to non diatoms the latter being often unpalatable for zooplankton or is even toxic overall the response of the biogeochemical processes e g metabolism and ecological functions e g nutrient retention to external p loads explored here provided new insight into the impact of the reservoir on downstream nutrient concentrations a topic of great interest especially for the seine river water quality which is mainly used to produce drinking water for the 12 m inhabitants of the paris conurbation flipo et al 2021 4 4 implications of hydrological management strategies and morphological characteristics for reservoir water quality the fluctuation in water levels induced by the hydrological management strategies is one of the typical features of reservoirs and has been recognized to impact biogeochemical processes geraldes and boavida 2005 in this study advancing the emptying period by 1 month i e in june could support downstream low water flows earlier at the end of spring whereas delaying the water release would maintain high water levels in the reservoirs for recreational activities in summer we found that changing hydrological management strategies only slightly impacts the ecosystem metabolism and the retention of no3 and dsi in the marne reservoir due to the fact that the concentrations of no3 and dsi were already low in june several studies have explored the impact of hydrological management strategies on downstream water quality such as water temperature do and nutrient concentrations which however mainly focused on optimizing the withdrawal depth of the dam e g calamita et al 2021 sadeghian et al 2015 in contrast to most large reservoirs in the world the three reservoirs of the seine river system are diverted from their related rivers and connected with them by artificial canals rather than being constructed by damming a river thanks to a few sgl measurements in the canals and in the reservoirs we assumed the impact of the canals to be low so that downstream changes in the rivers is due to changes in the reservoirs interestingly we found that modifying the mean depth of a reservoir without modifying the hydrological management strategy can play a role in the nutrient retention efficiency indeed a shallower reservoir showed a 6 higher no3 retention rate than a deeper reservoir but a significantly lower 35 dsi retention rate fig 9 with the same volume the shallow reservoir has a higher area of sediment interacting with the overlying thinner water column which has been considered as the critical attribute regulating in lake nutrient biogeochemical cycles qin et al 2020 denitrification is the dominant process resulting in no3 elimination in the reservoirs which is determined by the availability of no3 biodegradable organic matter and anaerobic aerobic conditions seitzinger et al 2006 in this study although primary production in the shallow scenario was 5 8 lower than the reference scenario benthic denitrification was higher than the latter fig s13 dsi retention in the reservoir is the net result of the interactions between several biogeochemical processes including external input of si in reservoir formation of bsi and dissolution and burial of bsi lauerwald et al 2013 maavara et al 2015a teodoru et al 2006 here we found that a shallower shaped reservoir favored a high dsi flux from benthic release to the water column and relatively lower uptake in the water column fig s13 which led to a low dsi retention efficiency thus when combining the benthic fluxes of no3 and dsi the reservoir with lower mean depth potentially enhances nutrient exchanges at the water and sediment interface and further impacts the nutrient retention efficiencies 5 conclusions the barman model was successfully applied to the three diverted reservoirs of the seine basin demonstrating its ability to reproduce the seasonal variations both of the nutrients and the co2 concentrations the biogeochemical processes and nutrient fate were systematically analyzed and quantified for each of the three reservoirs we found that 1 the three reservoirs are autotrophic ecosystems and showed high removal efficiency of c and nutrient during 2019 2020 2 benthic denitrification is the most significant process accounting for no3 elimination diatom uptake is the key process for dsi elimination precipitation and dissolution of caco3 and co2 emissions are dominant drivers for the decrease in dic and the assimilation of po4 3 by phytoplankton uptake represents the main source of retention of tip 3 trophic state and mean water depth of reservoirs impact the biogeochemical processes and the retention efficiency of no3 and dsi based on scenarios analysis results overall this study unravels the fate of c and nutrients in the three reservoirs based on the barman model and scenario results

15436,reservoirs are active reactors for the biogeochemical cycling of carbon c and nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p and silica si however our in depth understanding of c and nutrient cycling in reservoirs is still limited by the fact that it involves a variety of closely linked and coupled biogeochemical and hydrological processes in this study the updated process based barman model was applied to three reservoirs of the seine basin during 2019 2020 considering the variations of carbon dioxide co2 concentrations and key water quality variables the model simulations captured well the observed seasonal variations of water quality variables although discrepancies remained for some variables according to the model we found that 1 the three reservoirs are autotrophic ecosystems and showed high removal efficiency of dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrients during 2019 2020 2 phytoplankton assimilation benthic denitrification precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate and gas exchange at the water air interface are the dominant processes for water quality variations in reservoirs 3 based on scenarios results trophic state and mean water depth of reservoir would impact the biogeochemical processes and the retention efficiency of nitrate and dissolved silicate finally we expect that the successful application of barman model in the reservoirs of the seine basin could provide a useful tool for simulating reservoir water quality changes and thus evaluating the impacts of reservoirs on downstream water quality keywords nutrient fate co2 concentration modeling

carbon c and nutrients e g nitrogen n phosphorus p and silica si biogeochemical cycles bastviken et al 2011 cole et al 2007 deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2020a tranvik et al 2009 van cappellen and maavara 2016 anthropogenic activities may affect nutrient biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems in several ways for example through the increase of nutrient loads to inland waters due to intensive agricultural fertilization and domestic wastewater discharge bouwman et al 2013 garnier et al 2021 grizzetti et al 2021 and through disturbances along the aquatic continuum friedl and wüest 2002 maavara et al 2020a van cappellen and maavara 2016 the construction of reservoirs represents a significant human disturbance to the integrity of inland water ecosystems and its impact on the c and nutrient biogeochemical cycles has led to substantial interest in reservoir biogeochemical research in recent years chen et al 2020 deemer et al 2016 harrison et al 2021 maavara et al 2020b 2020a wang et al 2018 2021 yan et al 2021a reservoirs are usually built by damming a river significantly altering hydrological conditions transforming a lotic ecosystem into a lentic ecosystem schmutz and moog 2018 impeding the natural flow of water and the associated c and nutrients and acting as the in stream reactors maavara et al 2020a typically reservoirs increase the water residence time and sedimentation rate and thus decrease turbidity and light attenuation in the reservoir water column providing favorable conditions for promoting photosynthesis and enhancing c and nutrient biogeochemical cycling van cappellen and maavara 2016 photosynthesis assimilates dissolved inorganic carbon dic and nutrients into organic matter which is further decomposed by several processes e g aerobic respiration denitrification dissolution of biogenic silica and thereby impacts the concentrations of carbon dioxide co2 and nutrients in the water column li et al 2022 wang et al 2020a 2020b xiao et al 2021 therefore the variations of co2 and nutrient concentrations in reservoirs are indeed closely linked through multiple biogeochemical processes however these processes remain difficult to understand through in situ measurements kong et al 2019 process based biogeochemical models have been well developed to simulate the water quality variables e g water temperature and nutrient budgets in inland aquatic ecosystems mooij et al 2010 there are a number of well established aquatic ecosystem models simulating water quality that have been applied to reservoirs including the ce qual w2 e g lindenschmidt et al 2019 sadeghian et al 2018 wu et al 2022 efdc e g tong et al 2021 and delft3d models e g chen et al 2019 in addition some other models were specifically designed for stagnant systems and for simulating the dynamics of water quality variables in reservoirs such as the pclake kong et al 2019 barman garnier et al 2000 thieu et al 2006 dylem 1d bonnet and poulin 2004 and glm model weber et al 2017 winton et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge few studies have assessed both nutrient fate and co2 concentrations in reservoirs using process based biogeochemical models as mentioned previously the variations of co2 and nutrient concentrations are co impacted by the biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoirs therefore we argue that models that take into account both nutrient fate and co2 variations could provide new insights into the biogeochemical functioning of reservoirs to address the aforementioned question we focused on investigating the applicability of an existing process based biogeochemical model in the main reservoirs of the seine basin france the nutrient budgets in these reservoirs have been explored by in situ measurements mass balance methods garnier et al 1999 yan et al 2022 2021b and an initial modeling approach garnier et al 2000 thieu et al 2006 here we applied the barman model which newly contains an inorganic carbon module based on a previous study on the seine river marescaux et al 2020 the specific goals of the present study are as follows 1 to evaluate the performance of the barman model in simulating the variations of nutrient and co2 concentrations in the reservoirs 2 to quantify the nutrient fate and related biogeochemical processes 3 to discuss the impact of potential scenarios including trophic states hydrological management strategies and morphological characteristics on the ecological functions of these reservoirs and 4 to propose science based options and implications for the downstream targeted nutrient management in reservoirs 2 material and methods 2 1 the marne aube and seine reservoirs the three main reservoirs marne aube and seine are located upstream of the seine basin with a maximum surface area of 48 km2 23 km2 and 23 km2 respectively fig 1 they are managed by the public institution seine grand lac sgl https www seinegrandslacs fr these reservoirs are diverted from their upstream rivers and linked to downstream rivers through artificial canals the aube reservoir contains two distinct lakes lake amance and lake temple the two main hydrological functions of these reservoirs are to prevent downstream flooding during winter and spring and to support downstream low water flow in summer and autumn therefore the annual hydrological cycle from december 2019 to november 2020 of these three reservoirs is similar see fig 1c and d and can be characterized by two periods the filling period water flows into the reservoirs from december to june of the following year and the emptying period water flows out of the reservoirs from july to november the main characteristics of the three reservoirs were presented in table 1 2 2 data collected on the field the water quality in the three reservoirs and their upstream rivers was acquired through monthly field measurements during 2019 and 2020 the sampling strategy for each site see yan et al 2022 was to take water with a bucket from bridges or pontoons 5 l high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled all samples were conditioned e g filtration and kept at 10 c in the field after returning to the laboratory they were stored at 4 c or frozen until the analysis in the field ph water temperature t c and dissolved oxygen do mg l 1 were measured using a multiparameter instrument ysi 6600 v2 for co2 measurements 30 ml of water was kept in four syringes 60 ml with 30 ml of ambient air and were shaken for 10 min a fifth syringe was filled with ambient air to measure the atmospheric co2 the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water was determined through a non dispersive infrared gas analyzer licor li 820 usa using the syringe headspace equilibrium method abril et al 2015 marescaux et al 2018 in the laboratory dissolved nutrient concentrations including nitrate no3 mg n l 1 nitrite no2 mg n l 1 ammonium nh4 mg n l 1 orthophosphate po4 3 mg p l 1 and dissolved silicate dsi mg si l 1 were measured spectrophotometrically according to slawyk and macisaac 1972 rodier 1984 and jones 1984 respectively suspended particulate matters sm mg l 1 were determined as the weight of material retained on a whatman gf f membrane per volume unit after drying the filter for 2 h at 120 c the total inorganic phosphorus tip mg p l 1 was calculated by po4 3 and sm according to billen

model the barman model was applied to the marne reservoir during 1993 1995 with a simplified representation of the hydraulic conditions of the reservoir considered as a perfectly mixed biogeochemical reactor garnier et al 2000 and coupled with a detailed process based biogeochemical model the rive model billen et al 1994 garnier et al 2002 additional developments have introduced a simplified representation of the reservoir s morphology as idealized parabolic or spherical shapes and the possibility to simulate the average depth of the reservoir according to the management of the water volumes at each time step thieu et al 2006 recently recoded in python both the rive v3 2 https gitlab in2p3 fr rive pyrive and barman https gitlab in2p3 fr rive barman models have been published under the terms of the epl 2 0 eclipse public license and the gnu gpl 3 0 general public license the current version of the barman model has embedded the latest version of the rive code pyrive v3 2 including the calculations of the biogeochemical processes and nutrient exchanges at the water sediment interface by a simplified algorithm method billen et al 2015 and the inorganic carbon module was implemented to simulate co2 concentrations in rivers marescaux et al 2020 detailed descriptions of the barman including morphological characteristics table s1 and fig s1 and the rive models are presented in the supplementary information si text s1 and fig s2 the parameters used in the rive model are shown in table s2 additionally we updated the calculations of total alkalinity ta and dic based on marescaux et al 2020 in these reservoirs we found that precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate caco3 are significant see text s2 fig s3 therefore we considered the effect of caco3 precipitation and dissolution on changes in ta and dic the equations for calculating ta and dic are as follows 1 t a t a t 1 d t d t a d t 2 d t a d t 14 106 r e s p b a c t r e s p z o o r e s p b e

in the three reservoirs see text s2 once ta and dic are calculated the hydrogen ion concentration h can be calculated based on ta and dic and co2 can be derived from h and ta dic stumm and morgan 1996 the calculation procedures of h and co2 are presented in text s3 2 4 model implementation and evaluation the quantity and quality of water flowing into the reservoir are the main boundary conditions of the barman model the daily dynamics of volume and mean depth of the reservoir were calculated according to the idealized morphology and the water discharge flowing into and out of the reservoir provided by the sgl the water quality variables used are those collected on the field see section 2 2 interpolation methods were applied to derive the input data at the daily time step the wrtds weighted regressions on time discharge and season method was used for water quality variables including no3 dsi sm and po4 3 e g hirsch et al 2010 zhang and blomquist 2018 which are presented in fig s4 a simple linear interpolation method was used for other water variables the rmse root mean square error and bias were used to evaluate the performance of the barman model 5 rmse i 1 n o b s i s i m

our understanding of the factors influencing reservoir biogeochemical processes and functions an analysis of three possible scenarios were conducted using the marne reservoir as an example including 1 trophic state different tip concentration in the incoming river flow 2 hydrological management alterations delaying and advancing the emptying period for one month 3 morphological characteristic theoretical reservoir shape was created on the basis of the initial calibration of the reservoir morphology text s1 and using maximum depth dmax and surface area smax parameters to estimate the daily variation in the mean depth and volume of the marne reservoir the detailed scenario setup is presented in table 2 3 results 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 validation of the dynamics in water quality variables because the dynamics of the water quality variables were similar in the three reservoirs we present here the marne reservoir as an example fig 2 and the results of the other two reservoirs are presented in si figs s5 s7 overall despite some discrepancies between observations and simulations the simulation well results reproduce the observations of key water variables in the three reservoirs during 2019 2020 the rmse and bias which indicate the deviation and the over underestimations between observations and simulations in the three reservoirs respectively show values well in the range except for the high values of po4 3 and nh4 concentrations table 3 the model successfully simulated phytoplankton development fig 2a during december march and april august respectively however the model led to a lag in simulating the gradual increase of chl a during september december and did not capture the peak value of chl a in december the model showed a good simulation of no3 dynamics during december july but it slightly overestimated the low no3 concentrations during september november at the end of the emptying period for do the model successfully captured the general trend in the reservoirs with high and low values during december march and august september respectively moreover the seasonal variations of dsi concentrations in the three reservoirs were successfully simulated by the model during 2019 2020 including the gradual decrease during december august of the following year and the increase during september november fig 2 in addition the model also captured most observations of po4 3 and nh4 except for some high values e g po4 3 in may and july of 2020 and nh4 in november of 2019 and 2020 in the marne reservoir 3 1 2 validation of the co2 simulation in the carbonate systems the model successfully simulated the dynamics of ta and dic in the three reservoirs during 2019 2020 figs 3 and s5 s7 in addition we also found that the precipitation and dissolution of caco3 play a significant role in regulating the dynamics of ta and dic in the three reservoirs compared with the effect of the biogeochemical processes text s4 and fig s8 although the observed values of ph in the reservoirs fluctuated the model still captured the general level of ph however discrepancies between simulations and observations still exist during march july 2020 not adhering well to the trend and with some underestimations of the ph nevertheless the simulations of co2 were generally consistent with the observations i e the relatively high and low values and the decrease in co2 was captured 3 2 the biogeochemical processes and nutrient fate in the three reservoirs 3 2 1 the ecosystem metabolism primary production and respiration rates showed synchronized variations in the three reservoirs gradually increasing from january to july while decreasing from july to december fig 4 for the marne reservoir the others refer to fig s9 the highest rates of primary production i e phytoplankton uptake were found during june july from 23 tons c d 1 in aube amance to 115 tons c d 1 in marne which is the largest reservoir with twice the surface area of the former reservoirs the highest respiration rates were very close to the phytoplankton uptake rates in terms of net ecosystem primary production nep i e photosynthesis minus respiration the three reservoirs were generally autotrophic ecosystems with average nep values from 0 16 to 0 79 tons c d 1 ranging from 57 aube temple to 288 marne tons c yr 1 during one annual hydrological cycle in the model respiration represents the sum of bacteria respbact zooplankton respzoo and benthic respiration respbent the results revealed that respbact and respbent were the dominant components of total respiration while respzoo made only a small contribution to this total in the three reservoirs indeed respbact represented more than 75 of the total respiration during march october which corresponded to the period with high primary production and a high respbent rate was found during november february of the following hydrological year in the three reservoirs 3 2 2 nutrient fate and corresponding biogeochemical processes the input and output fluxes of no3 tip dsi and dic and the main biogeochemical processes related to their transformations were quantified during 2019 and 2020 fig 5 for marne for the others refer to figs s10 12 in terms of the fate of nutrients the results revealed that phytoplankton uptake was one of the most significant processes affecting the transformations of no3 tip dsi and dic in the three reservoirs benthic denitrification especially and nitrification in the water column were also two important processes affecting no3 dynamics in the three reservoirs internal cycling of p was enhanced by phytoplankton uptake respiration and benthic release while the sedimentation of tip had a marginal impact on tip in the water column compared with the other processes for dsi diatom uptake played an important role in dsi concentrations in the water column and benthic flux released by biogenic silica dissolution bsi did not compensate for this in terms of the dic transformation phytoplankton uptake and respiration were two dominant processes regulating the internal cycling of dic while the precipitation of caco3 and co2 emissions was the dominant process driving the net change of dic concentrations in the water column 3 2 3 nutrient budgets during one hydrological cycle in the three reservoirs the n budgets including no3 and nh4 p tip si dsi and bsi and c including total organic carbon and inorganic carbon during one annual hydrological cycle were calculated according to the multiple processes considered by the barman model here we show schematic diagrams of nutrient transformation and transport in the example of the marne reservoir fig 6 details on the nutrient fate of the three reservoirs are provided in table s3 all three reservoirs affected a high no3 retention ranging from 36 aube amance to 51 marne the intensity of phytoplankton uptake 71 312 tons n yr 1 and benthic denitrification 178 1102 tons n yr 1 i e no3 removal is clearly illustrated in fig 5 and table s3 ammonification 459 1789 tons n yr 1 and phytoplankton uptake 520 2048 tons n yr 1 were the main processes driving nh4 transformations compared with nh4 oxidation 48 213 tons n yr 1 and benthic flux 80 349 tons n yr 1 the three reservoirs showed high retention of dsi ranging from 49 aube temple to 69 marne and phytoplankton uptake 172 940 tons si yr 1 was the dominant process responsible for the dsi removal sinking as bsi with diatom biomass the three reservoirs also showed high bsi retention rates ranging from 38 aube temple to 89 marne in addition 64 79 of tip was retained in the three reservoirs with phytoplankton uptake of po4 3 being the dominant process retaining tip in these reservoirs from 98 aube temple to 391 marne tons p yr 1 in terms of dic the three reservoirs showed retention rates ranging from 25 aube amance to 65 aube temple the caco3 precipitation 913 4875 tons c yr 1 and co2 emission 859 5773 tons c yr 1 were the most significant processes for dic removal in the water column additionally the annual net burial of toc total organic carbon in sediments of the three reservoirs ranged from 61 aube temple to 458 marne tons c yr 1 3 3 scenario analysis in the marne reservoir 3 3 1 assessing the impact of different trophic states primary production respiration and nep all increased with tip concentration in the inflowing river water and their increasing rates were higher according to the range of tip concentrations of 1 50 μg p l 1 the gradual increases of nep also indicated an increased autotrophy with increasing tip concentrations fig 7 a in addition the trophic state of the reservoir significantly impacted the retention of no3 and dsi the retention rate of no3 showed an increase from 38 1 μg p l 1 to 63 100 μg p l 1 but this increase of the no3 retention rate was the highest from 38 to 51 in the lower range of the tip concentrations explored 1 25 μg p l 1 fig 7b the retention rate of dsi was greater in response to the increasing tip concentrations of 1 25 μg p l 1 from 29 to 68 with a slight decrease from 70 to 54 as the tip loads continued to increase from 50 to 100 μg p l 1 fig 7b 3 3 2 changes in hydrological management strategies without significantly affecting the primary function of the marne reservoir i e to prevent flooding and support water flow the changes in hydrological management strategies involve advancing or delaying for 1 month the start of the emptying period in the reservoir fig 8 compared with the reference scenario primary production and respiration showed similar patterns with values respectively of only 1 6 and 1 7 higher in the delayed hydrological scenario and of 3 8 and 3 9 i e lower in the advanced scenario fig 8b c regarding retention rates those of no3 decreased only slightly by 2 advanced and increased by 1 delayed fig 8d similarly the dsi retention did not change delayed or did so by only 2 advanced fig 8e overall the ecosystem metabolism and nutrient retention did not change significantly under these possible modifications of the hydrological management strategies for the marne reservoir 3 3 3 different morphological characteristics in the marne reservoir changes in morphological parameters maximum depth and maximum surface that were used to define the idealized spherical shape of the reservoir logically had strong impacts on the mean depths of the water column calculated daily according to hydrological conditions fig 9 the ecosystem metabolism changed only slightly compared with the reference situation primary production and respiration decreased respectively by 5 8 and 5 6 for the large shallow scenario similarly lower percentages of both primary production and respiration were obtained for the small deep scenario 8 and 8 3 respectively relative to the reference fig 9b c for the nutrient retention rates the large shallow reservoir showed a slight increased no3 retention rate from 51 ref to 53 and a small decreased rate from 51 ref to 47 for the small deep scenario fig 9d however the low dsi retention rate was significantly lowered in the large shallow reservoir from 69 ref to 38 while it only increased marginally from 69 ref to 73 for the small deep reservoir fig 9e in addition we further found that the benthic denitrification 1140 tons n yr 1 and benthic flux of dsi 390 tons si yr 1 in the large shallow reservoir were 1 1 and 1 6 times higher than the small deep reservoir respectively fig s13 although primary production in the large shallow scenario was slightly higher than in the small deep scenario the dsi assimilation was nevertheless 1 2 times lower than in the latter 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the model performance and limitations overall the barman model showed satisfactory simulation results for the key water quality variables and co2 dynamics during 2019 2020 in the three reservoirs of the seine basin despite some discrepancies figs 2 and s5 s7 in the three reservoirs the peak value of chl a was generally observed during the end of the emptying period when water levels are relatively low which may enhance the nutrient exchanges from the sediment to the water column increase light availability and thereby stimulate the development of phytoplankton in reservoirs see yan et al 2022 for no3 concentrations the lowest values were also observed with low water depth which were not fully captured by the model a possible explanation is that the resuspension process that increases sm concentrations in the water column when water levels are low was not considered in the model while the concentration of sm has been shown to significantly influence the denitrification process in aquatic ecosystems e g jia et al 2016 xia et al 2017 moreover although stratification could occasionally occur during summer when temperature and water level were high in these reservoirs see garnier et al 2000 the zero dimension barman model in fact does not consider such stratification but assumes that the three reservoirs are well mixed systems the barman model which needs fewer input data and lesser running time than multi dimension models e g the delft3d and ce qual w2 models lindenschmidt et al 2019 wu et al 2022 fails to reproduce possible low oxygen concentrations in bottom waters suitable for denitrification processes nevertheless the model captured fairly well the dynamics of no3 and other variables e g nutrients in the water column which shows its usefulness in simulating biogeochemical processes in these reservoirs for the simulation of the variations in co2 concentrations the gas transfer coefficient k600 plays an important role in simulating co2 in the three reservoirs e g in the marne reservoir fig s14 in this study the daily wind speed was not available and we used monthly average wind speed in a single location and selected a k600 constant value of 0 08 m h 1 median value calculated from six different methods see text s5 given the importance of gas transfer velocity k for modeling the co2 dynamics we believe that the high resolution measurement of k is needed in future studies additionally we have only estimated the precipitation and dissolution rates of caco3 see text s4 based on seven dates in the three reservoirs during 2020 despite the satisfactory simulation results of ta and dic found in the marne seine and aube lake temple reservoirs specific research efforts are still required focusing on the precipitation and dissolution rates of caco3 in these reservoirs with generic kinetics equations in a future version of barman model 4 2 nutrients in reservoirs budgets and transformations nutrient budgets in the three reservoirs were estimated using a mass balance method based on the uneven temporal frequency measurements bimonthly monthly and seasonal during 1993 1995 garnier et al 1999 and 1998 2018 yan et al 2021b which indicated that reservoirs play an important role in nutrient retention whatever the measurement strategy in this study the biogeochemical processes responsible for the nutrient transformations were analyzed with the barman model and the nutrient retention rates were thus calculated based on simulations at a daily time step our results are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that reservoirs exhibit a strong capacity for retention of dic and nutrients n p si akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2017 2015b 2014 mendonça et al 2017 and they are also close to our previous long term assessments using monthly or seasonal measurements during 1998 2018 yan et al 2021b uneven and low frequency measurements may not capture the seasonal patterns of nutrient concentrations in water and thereby lead to uncertainty in evaluating their budgets see kong et al 2019 for no3 however the different data series gathered from these reservoirs showed similar retention rates according to our previous study yan et al 2021b which would support our simulation results high frequency measurements are well adapted for nep determination but probe availability for establishing the nutrient budgets of interest is still limited and the maintenance of probes for frequent or continuous measurements is costly although several statistical models have been used for nutrient retention rates in lakes and reservoirs including n alexander et al 2002 harrison et al 2009 seitzinger et al 2002 and si maavara et al 2014 the underlying biological processes could not be fully described based on the mechanistic barman model i e process based which describes the major processes involved in the biogeochemical transformations of c and nutrients see si texts1 fig s2 we could explicitly unravel both the fate of carbon and nutrients and the importance of physical processes in the three reservoirs see 3 2 3 therefore our results would provide a deep understanding of seasonal variations in water quality variables in these reservoirs and also a potential utility to minimize the impact of the reservoirs on their downstream water quality 4 3 effects of external phosphorus management on reservoir ecological function taking the marne reservoir as an example the response of the ecosystem metabolism to the external p loads clearly revealed the importance of p concentrations in the primary production respiration and nep it is well known that primary production combines the biogeochemical cycles of c and nutrients in aquatic ecosystems bernhardt 2013 interestingly our results indicated that the retention efficiency of no3 and dsi varied with the external p loads for no3 retention denitrification dominantly in the sediment was shown to be the main process responsible for no3 elimination in the three reservoirs see 3 2 2 in addition to the levels of do and no3 the availability of biodegradable organic matter is one of the factors controlling denitrification rates seitzinger et al 2006 therefore at low p concentration low phytoplankton biomass was supported and less organic matter fell to the sediment thus ultimately limiting the denitrification rate and thereby lowering the no3 retention rate in the reservoirs bernhardt 2013 finlay et al 2013 similarly the elimination of dsi was mainly induced by diatom uptake which was significantly affected by dip concentrations in the reservoirs maavara et al 2015a xiao et al 2019 increasing p concentrations in the range of 1 25 μg p l 1 stimulates the development of diatoms in the marne reservoir and thus dsi uptake without other limitations the growth of diatoms would increase with p concentrations however other groups of phytoplankton non diatoms show a greater competitive advantage than diatoms in freshwaters with high p concentrations burson et al 2018 which may further impact the uptake and retention rate of dsi in reservoirs for instance the biomass of diatoms as calculated by the model was essentially constant for p loads ranging from 25 to 50 μg p l 1 and levelled off or decreased instead when p loads exceeded 50 μg p l 1 see text s6 fig s15 which resulted in a reduced dsi retention efficiency when the tip concentration exceeded 50 μg p l 1 this result confirms that changes in dip concentrations clearly affect biogeochemical processes on the one hand denitrification and no3 retention may be reduced at low p concentrations without playing a positive role in removing no3 for downstream rivers on the other hand increasing dip may lead to an undesirable change in phytoplankton composition from diatoms to non diatoms the latter being often unpalatable for zooplankton or is even toxic overall the response of the biogeochemical processes e g metabolism and ecological functions e g nutrient retention to external p loads explored here provided new insight into the impact of the reservoir on downstream nutrient concentrations a topic of great interest especially for the seine river water quality which is mainly used to produce drinking water for the 12 m inhabitants of the paris conurbation flipo et al 2021 4 4 implications of hydrological management strategies and morphological characteristics for reservoir water quality the fluctuation in water levels induced by the hydrological management strategies is one of the typical features of reservoirs and has been recognized to impact biogeochemical processes geraldes and boavida 2005 in this study advancing the emptying period by 1 month i e in june could support downstream low water flows earlier at the end of spring whereas delaying the water release would maintain high water levels in the reservoirs for recreational activities in summer we found that changing hydrological management strategies only slightly impacts the ecosystem metabolism and the retention of no3 and dsi in the marne reservoir due to the fact that the concentrations of no3 and dsi were already low in june several studies have explored the impact of hydrological management strategies on downstream water quality such as water temperature do and nutrient concentrations which however mainly focused on optimizing the withdrawal depth of the dam e g calamita et al 2021 sadeghian et al 2015 in contrast to most large reservoirs in the world the three reservoirs of the seine river system are diverted from their related rivers and connected with them by artificial canals rather than being constructed by damming a river thanks to a few sgl measurements in the canals and in the reservoirs we assumed the impact of the canals to be low so that downstream changes in the rivers is due to changes in the reservoirs interestingly we found that modifying the mean depth of a reservoir without modifying the hydrological management strategy can play a role in the nutrient retention efficiency indeed a shallower reservoir showed a 6 higher no3 retention rate than a deeper reservoir but a significantly lower 35 dsi retention rate fig 9 with the same volume the shallow reservoir has a higher area of sediment interacting with the overlying thinner water column which has been considered as the critical attribute regulating in lake nutrient biogeochemical cycles qin et al 2020 denitrification is the dominant process resulting in no3 elimination in the reservoirs which is determined by the availability of no3 biodegradable organic matter and anaerobic aerobic conditions seitzinger et al 2006 in this study although primary production in the shallow scenario was 5 8 lower than the reference scenario benthic denitrification was higher than the latter fig s13 dsi retention in the reservoir is the net result of the interactions between several biogeochemical processes including external input of si in reservoir formation of bsi and dissolution and burial of bsi lauerwald et al 2013 maavara et al 2015a teodoru et al 2006 here we found that a shallower shaped reservoir favored a high dsi flux from benthic release to the water column and relatively lower uptake in the water column fig s13 which led to a low dsi retention efficiency thus when combining the benthic fluxes of no3 and dsi the reservoir with lower mean depth potentially enhances nutrient exchanges at the water and sediment interface and further impacts the nutrient retention efficiencies 5 conclusions the barman model was successfully applied to the three diverted reservoirs of the seine basin demonstrating its ability to reproduce the seasonal variations both of the nutrients and the co2 concentrations the biogeochemical processes and nutrient fate were systematically analyzed and quantified for each of the three reservoirs we found that 1 the three reservoirs are autotrophic ecosystems and showed high removal efficiency of c and nutrient during 2019 2020 2 benthic denitrification is the most significant process accounting for no3 elimination diatom uptake is the key process for dsi elimination precipitation and dissolution of caco3 and co2 emissions are dominant drivers for the decrease in dic and the assimilation of po4 3 by phytoplankton uptake represents the main source of retention of tip 3 trophic state and mean water depth of reservoirs impact the biogeochemical processes and the retention efficiency of no3 and dsi based on scenarios analysis results overall this study unravels the fate of c and nutrients in the three reservoirs based on the barman model and scenario results

15437,soil derived dissolved organic matter sdom is an important site specific disinfection byproduct dbp precursor in watersheds however it remains unclear how fertilization regime shifts the molecular diversity and chlorine reactivity of sdom in cropland impacted watersheds here we analyzed the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of the sdom from croplands that had different fertilization regimes i e non fertilization chemical fertilization straw return and chemical fertilization plus straw return for 5 years and evaluated the chlorine reactivity of the sdom by determining the 24 h chlorine consumption and specific dbp formation potential sdbp fp the sdom level decreased by chemical fertilization and was not significantly altered by straw return alone or combined with chemical fertilizer however all fertilization regimes elevated the molecular diversity of sdom by increasing the abundance of protein lignin and tannin like compounds the chlorine reactivity of sdom was reduced by chemical fertilization but was significantly increased by straw return typically straw return increased the formation potential of specific trihalomethane and chloral hydrate by 339 and 56 via increasing the aromatics in sdom whereas chemical fertilization could effectively decrease about 231 of the increased specific trihalomethane formation potential caused by straw return this study highlights that fertilization regime can significantly shape the molecular diversity and chlorine reactivity of the sdom in croplands and that partially replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw is an advantageous practice for reducing dbp risks in drinking water in cropland impacted watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter fertilization straw return croplands molecular diversity chlorine reactivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chemical fertilizer application plays an essential role in increasing crop yield but long term excessive use of chemical fertilizer has been known to degrade soil fertility and environmental quality han et al 2016 mcdonald 2016 changing the fertilization regime is thus essential for maintaining soil fertility and environmental health crop straw with a global production of over 4 billion tons yearly is being encouraged to return to croplands as a promising organic fertilizer cui et al 2021 xia et al 2018 in addition to improving soil fertility straw return also introduces a mass of organic matter into croplands xia et al 2018 hao et al 2022 due to changes in land use intensive irrigation and storm events soil derived dissolved organic matter sdom can be transported into surface waters and source watersheds resulting in a reduction in water quality where the dissolved organic carbon levels are typically 3 9 times higher than the references mcdonald et al 2016 oh et al 2013 as crop straw return is increasingly promoted globally the sdom in croplands is expected to be increasingly impacted and strongly alter the quantity and quality of dom in watersheds given the critical roles of sdom in croplands in regulating the fate of contaminants and potentially serving as the precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in source waters padhi 2022 zeng et al 2022 increasing studies aim to understand the levels and characteristics of sdom with various cropland managements cai et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 fertilization the most common and active cropland management practice usually elevates the content of water soluble organic matter to various degrees han et al 2016 hao et al 2022 however how fertilization regimes such as applying chemical fertilizer alone or in combination with crop straw shape the molecular diversity of sdom remains controversial chemical fertilization in temperate croplands was reported to promote microbial degradation of sdom and reduce the complexity of sdom by decreasing the humic like compounds and increasing the microbial derived components as indicated by the humification index hix and the freshness index β α hui et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however chemical fertilization was also found to increase the proportions of humic substances in temperate croplands lapa et al 2011 compared to the control treatment crop straw return alone or combined with chemical fertilizer could decrease the degree of dom humification and aromaticity and increase the labile organic carbon pools hao et al 2022 in contrast more aromatics and less lipid like fractions were also measured for the sdom derived from the croplands jointly fertilized with chemical and organic fertilizer wen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 the contradictory findings make it difficult to evaluate the environmental quality effects of sdom furthermore compared to the temperate croplands tropical croplands have much higher rainfall and temperature more acidic and iron rich soils and distinct crop production oladele and adetunji 2021 while these environmental factors inevitably regulate the production and consumption of sdom it is unknown how sdom diversity and characteristics in tropical cropland would respond to different fertilization regimes sdom derived from croplands is increasingly recognized as a critical dbp precursor in cropland impacted watersheds especially after frequent storms and insensitive irrigation events eckard et al 2020 the formation potential for various dbps is synchronously regulated by the quantity and quality of dom li et al 2020 as fertilization invariably increases the sdom level in croplands han et al 2016 irrigation flows usually have significantly higher doc contents than the reference flows hernes et al 2008 fertilization is thus expected to increase the dbp formation potential dbp fp of the sdom in cropland impacted watersheds in contrast with different fertilization regimes the molecular diversity of sdom varies widely which can contribute to a distinct dbp fp profile of the sdom receiving waters however how the fertilization regimes shift the chlorine reactivity and dbp fp of the sdom in croplands remains unknown recently the aromaticity of dom indicated by the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was measured to positively correlate with specific trihalomethane formation potential sthm fp chen and westerhoff 2010 the relationship provided insight into the underlying dbp formation mechanisms indicating that aromatic fractions in the bulk dom react with chlorine to form trihalomethanes thms however the thm precursors in the dom are not necessarily the main contributors to haloacetonitriles formation milstead and remucal 2021 therefore the chlorine reactivity of sdom in croplands with different fertilization regimes awaits further investigation at both the bulk and molecular levels here we hypothesized that replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw would increase the molecular diversity and chlorine reactivity of sdom due to the possibly accumulated aromatics correspondingly four fertilization regimes control without chemical fertilizer or straw return chemical fertilization straw return and chemical fertilization plus straw return were continuously implemented for five years sdom samples were obtained by water extraction and characterized the bulk and molecular level traits using optical spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms after that the effects of fertilization regimes on the chlorine reactivity of the sdom were assessed by the chlorine demand and specific dbp fp finally the correlations between the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of the sdom were evaluated using correlation analysis and principal component analysis this study provides insights into the potential links between applying chemical fertilizer and crop straw and the water safety in cropland impacted watersheds 2

reflects the average oxidation state of all carbons per formula and mlbl predicts the lability of dom d andrilli et al 2015 2 4 chlorine reactivity tests and analyses the chlorine reactivities of the sdom samples were evaluated by the chlorine demand and specific dbp fp sdbp fp in μg mgc using previously reported methods wang et al 2015 briefly sdom samples 3 mgc l 1 were buffered by h3bo3 naoh solution to ph 8 0 and chlorinated with freshly prepared naocl h3bo3 solution ph 8 0 at a dose of cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh3 n after 24 h of incubation at 25 c in headspace free amber glass vials the residual chlorine in the sdom samples was quantified using a dpd spectrophotometric method and used to calculate the chlorine demand after that the samples were scavenged the residual chlorine using na2so3 and processed for analyses of thms hans haas and chd the concentrations of the four kinds of dbps were quantified according to us epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 with minor modifications in brief 50 ml of the chlorine scavenged samples were acidified to ph 0 5 with h2so4 after adding 12 g of na2so4 thms hans haas and chd were extracted into 4 5 ml of mtbe by mixing at 70 rpm for 30 min and standing at 4 c for 30 min then 3 ml of the mtbe was obtained from the extraction layer to determine the haas the sampled mtbe solutions were esterified by 1 ml of h2so4 acidified ch3oh at 50 c for 2 5 h after that residual acid was neutralized by saturated nahco3 solution finally the obtained mtbe layers were analyzed for thms hans haas and chd using a db 1ms column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm on a shimadzu gc 2010 pro with an electron capture detector 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical differences were identified between treatments using one way anova with post hoc tukey s tests and the significant differences were considered when p 0 05 correlations between the sdbp fps optical properties and ft icr ms parameters of the sdom were determined by pearson s correlation analysis principal component analysis pca was applied to provide rough patterns of the reduced dimensions of the parameters and cluster of samples sdbp fp associated sdom molecular profiles were assessed using spearman s rank correlation analysis all the data are presented as the mean standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality of the soil extracts fertilization can effectively regulate the water quality of the soil extracts especially the ph water soluble ions and doc content the ph significantly decreased from 6 5 0 1 in the ck to 5 9 0 2 in the cf treatment while it was not affected by the fertilization regimes of sr and cfsr table 1 compared to ph the electrical conductivity of soil extracts was more sensitive to fertilization and significantly increased by all fertilization regimes p 0 05 specifically the concentration of tdn and nox n in the extracts was increased by cf but the two water matrices were not significantly affected by cfsr that could be attributed to the role of straw derived organic matter in stimulating microbial denitrification processes pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a in contrast compared to ck the doc contents of the soil extracts were significantly decreased and increased by cf and sr respectively table 1 the distinct responses of sdom quantity to different fertilization regimes are consistent with previous field studies that showed increased soil doc levels with crop straw return and decreased soil doc levels with chemical fertilizer addition in croplands hao et al 2022 mockeviciene et al 2021 notably the opposite functions of crop straw and chemical fertilizer in regulating soil doc level tend to cancel each other out when the two fertilizers are used in combination han et al 2016 as a result comparable sdom contents of the soil extracts were found between the cfsr and the ck treatments in this study 3 2 spectroscopic characteristics of the sdom in addition to the sdom quantity the sdom quality also differed significantly among the fertilization treatments as indicated by the absorbance and fluorescence indices table 1 compared to the sdom in ck the sdom in cf had significantly lower suva254 values and higher e 2 e 3 values low suva254 is typically indicative of low dom aromaticity d andrilli et al 2015 and high e 2 e 3 usually represents the low molecular weight feature of dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the results in this study thus suggest that the sdom in cf had lower aromaticity and molecular weight notably the e 2 e 3 value of the sdom in the cf was higher than that in the sr and cfsr treatments p 0 05 our prior finding also corroborated this phenomenon that long term application of ammonium nitrate could decrease the molecular weight of sdom li et al 2020 no difference was found in fi and hix among the treatments which means that the sdom samples had similar origins and comparable humification degrees cai et al 2020 the ft ir characterization results also confirmed the characteristics indicated by the fi and hix indices showing similar responses of the c c and phenyl structures fig s2 remarkably a significantly high β α value was found for the sdom in the sr treatment which could be attributed to the recently produced dom from the returned straw hao et al 2022 mockeviciene et al 2021 three fluorescence components of sdom were identified by eem parafac model fig 1 fluorescent component 1 c1 peaked at ex em wavelengths of 250 480 nm and can be assigned to terrestrial humic like substances which are usually found in agriculture oriented areas wünsch et al 2017 the fmax doc of c1 was lower in the sr than that in the other fertilization treatments indicating sr shaped the sdom composition similarly except for effectively increasing the content of soil organic matter sr was also determined to make soil organic matter younger by increasing the aliphatic components and decreasing the aromaticity of humic substances cui et al 2017 hao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b component 2 c2 exhibited a maximum fluorescent response at ex em wavelengths of 310 250 415 nm consistent with the spectral characteristics of microbial humic like substances li et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 interestingly the relative abundance of c2 was comparable among the fertilization treatments possibly due to the relatively short term treatment component 3 c3 had a peak at ex em wavelengths of 270 315 nm and was characterized as protein like substances mainly derived from microbial activities murphy et al 2008 c3 had a relatively higher content in the sr than in others possibly due to the primarily introduced exogenous organic matter hao et al 2022 it was consistent with the higher β α values of the sdom in the sr table 1 in the meantime fertilization significantly changed the microbial community fig s3 a and b as indicated by the chao1 and shannon indices the bacterial richness and diversity were increased by sr while the fungal richness and diversity were significantly decreased by sr table s2 sustained organic carbon addition was also previously determined to shape the bacterial community into a more eutrophic state li et al 2019 yang and lu 2022 therefore the abundance of c3 was also related to the increased bacterial biomass and reactivity by the returned straw 3 3 molecular signature of sdom the molecular level composition of the sdom determined by ft icr ms further confirmed the shifts in sdom components induced by different fertilization regimes compared to ck fertilization treatments i e cf sr and cfsr had more assigned sdom molecules with higher chon abundance lower cho abundance and comparable chos abundance table 2 additionally whether applied independently or in combination with chemical fertilizer crop straw invariably elevated the mlbl value of sdom fertilization of crop straw thus was demonstrated to increase the microbial contributions to sdom possibly by introducing a large number of boilable compounds and increasing microbial activity han et al 2016 hao et al 2022 this result was also consistent with the increased fmax c3 doc level for the sdom in the sr fig 1 and the increased bacterial richness and diversity table s2 according to the o c and h c ratios the identified formulas were classified into seven classes using the van krevelen diagram fig s4 including lipid like protein like amino sugar like carbohydrate like lignin like tannin like and dissolved black carbon like substances cai et al 2020 compared to ck all fertilization treatments had unique sdom molecules with molecular weights of 150 600 da most of which were protein lignin and tannin like substances fig s5 this result further corroborated the decreased relative abundance of terrestrial humic like substances fmax c1 doc in the sdom from sr fig 1 in contrast sr increased the percentage content of aromatics in sdom by nearly 1 8 and 2 0 times higher than ck and cf respectively table 2 this result was also demonstrated by the aromaticity indicator suva254 table 1 and could be explained by the accumulation of aromatics in cropland soils since the aromatic molecules derived from straw usually have longer lifetimes than other components in the environment chen et al 2010 therefore cfsr also had sdom with more aromatics than ck and cf the result was also consistent with previous findings that sustained organic carbon addition significantly increased the molecular diversity of sdom and the presence of recalcitrant components li et al 2019 han et al 2016 overall the findings demonstrated our hypothesis that replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw could increase the aromatics in sdom the impacts of fertilization regimes on the molecular level characteristics of sdom were also assessed by ft icr ms compared to ck sr and cfsr had sdom with lower average h c and higher o c dbe and aimod values table 2 the parameters collectively suggest that the sdom in sr and cfsr had higher aromaticity however cf had no significant influence on the aromaticity of sdom the results are consistent with the relatively higher suva254 values in sr and cfsr table 1 and further support straw fertilizer increasing aromatics in sdom notably all fertilization treatments effectively decreased the average molecular weight of sdom table 2 and fig s5 possibly resulting from the promoted sdom degradation and the introduced dom by crop straw cui et al 2017 hao et al 2022 zeng et al 2022 the result is also consistent with the increased e 2 e 3 values of the sdom in cf and cfsr table 1 nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc is a reliable indicator of the carbon state in a specific dom molecule wilson and tfaily 2018 specifically a negative neutral or positive nosc value represents a reduced neutral or oxidized state of the carbon in dom respectively liu et al 2022 wilson and tfaily 2018 in this study the nosc of sdom samples were identified as negative with a decreasing order of cf ck cfsr and sr i e the sdom were feasibly oxidized in order of sr cfsr ck cf straw application thus could effectively reduce the redox state of sdom which could be attributed to the accumulated aromatics this result is also supported by the strong reduction state of the sdom in sr and cfsr indicated by the higher edc values table 1 furthermore nosc is closely related to the h c and o c ratios and can represent the polarity of dom riedel et al 2012 based on the negative relationship between nosc and molecule polarity sr had sdom with the highest polarity followed by cfsr ck and cf in conclusion through ft icr ms analysis cf sr and cfsr treatments elevated the molecular diversity of sdom consistent with the spectroscopic and electrochemical results straw addition was determined to shift sdom to aromatic low molecular weight diverse polar reduced and labile development overall the variations induced by sr would make sdom more readily react with oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite to form dbps which was further discussed in the following sections notably in contrast to our hypothesis chemical fertilization did not significantly change the aromaticity of sdom but it effectively resulted in fertilization specific sdom this might be attributed to the following reasons i cf reconstructed the soil microbial communities especially the bacterial community as cf showed a markedly separated cluster in nonmetric multidimensional scaling plot from ck and other fertilization treatments fig s3 c similar results also found in other temperate zones ling et al 2016 acidobacteria chloroflexi and gemmatimonadetes were determined to be the phyla involved in soil organic matter degradation liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 in this study the accumulated relative abundance of the three bacteria was lowest in the cf followed by the ck cfsr and sr fig s3 a which could be related to the abundance of carbohydrate lignin and lipid like components in sdom fig s6 therefore the sdom in cf was specific compared to ck and other fertilization treatments ii due to the lack of the priming effect of labile organic matter from crop straw the microbial degradation of soil organic matter would be negligible with cf treatment xu et al 2020 3 4 chlorine reactivity of the sdom doc normalized chlorine consumption was the highest for the sdom in sr 0 91 0 06 mg cl2 mgc 1 followed by the sdom in cfsr 0 79 0 03 mg cl2 mgc 1 ck 0 75 0 03 mg cl2 mgc 1 and cf 0 62 0 04 mg cl2 mgc 1 fig 2 a this order was well explained by the average nosc values table 2 which indicates the oxidation state of carbon in a certain dom molecule wilson and tfaily 2018 correspondingly the chlorine consumption order of the sdom was also consistent with their edc order table 1 the 24 h chlorine consumption thus could represent at least partially the chlorine reactivity of the sdom samples compared to ck cf significantly reduced the doc normalized chlorine consumption of the sdom in contrast sr and cfsr significantly increased the doc normalized chlorine consumption of the sdom indicating that sr increased the chlorine reactivity of sdom as chlorine is a selective oxidant that preferentially reacts with electron rich compounds lavonen et al 2013 the role of sr in increasing sdom chlorine consumption thus could be attributed to the increased abundance of aromatics in the sdom the results collectively highlighted that the chlorine reactivity of sdom in croplands was closely related to its aromaticity and oxidation state of carbon which could be regulated by the applied fertilization regimes the sdbp fps for sdom samples depended heavily on the fertilization regimes fig 2b compared to the sthm fp 6 1 8 2 μg mgc 1 and specific chd formation potential schd fp 4 0 5 1 μg mgc 1 of the sdom in ck the sthm fp 25 4 36 9 μg mgc 1 and schd fp 5 8 8 6 μg mgc 1 of sdom were significantly increased by 339 and 56 in sr respectively interestingly cfsr significantly reduced the sthm fp of the sdom in sr by 231 and increased the schd fp of the sdom in sr by 60 generally sr and cfsr played opposite roles in altering the sthm fps of sdom cf had no influence on the sthm fp and significantly decreased the sdbp fps for haas from 5 5 to 2 4 μg mgc 1 and chd from 4 6 to 2 8 μg mgc 1 notably among the used fertilization regimes only sr significantly increased the haloacetonitrile formation potential shan fp of sdom by 98 fig 2b the results collectively indicate that sr can be a main factor in increasing the sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands which mainly stemmed from the shifted sdom molecular composition notably compared to other terrestrial dom in previous studies the sdom in the sr treatment had comparable sdbp fps for thms haas hans and chd cai et al 2020 cawley et al 2017 li et al 2020 padhi 2022 the protein high o c lignin and tannin like molecules are intimately related to the sdbp fps fig 3 the observed variations in sdbp fps in different fertilizations thus were well explained by the changes in aromatics and the individual contribution of sdom molecules to the sdbp fps specifically sr had the most potency in introducing the lignin and tannin like formulas while cfsr mainly increased the abundance of protein and lignin like molecules in sdom fig s5 the results collectively confirm our hypothesis that fertilization regulates the sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands mainly by changing the aromatics similarly aromatic and polyphenolic compounds were also reported as two types of important dbp precursors in prior studies hua et al 2014 milstead and remucal 2021 notably the sthm fp value of the sdom was significantly lower in the cfsr than in the sr fig 2b therefore the combined application of chemical fertilizer with crop straw could be a potential solution for mitigating the dbp fps of sdom induced by straw return 3 5 linking sdbp fp with the characteristics of sdom to gain insight into the molecular characteristics dominating the sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands all the obtained sdom characteristics were incorporated to create a pca biplot and a pearson correlation plot fig 4 the first two principal components explained 55 9 of the total variation of all parameters pc1 36 2 pc2 19 7 pc1 explained the high molecular weight electron rich and highly humified substances as e 2 e 3 and eac were negatively placed on pc1 and hix and edc were placed in the positive direction of pc1 fig 4a this result was further confirmed by the significant correlations in fig 4b and the previous findings on biochar litter and soil derived dom forming dbps in chlorination processes cawley et al 2017 li et al 2022 wang et al 2015 pc2 was associated with the fluorescent components especially the recently produced and terrestrially derived components as indicated by the positive loadings of fmax doc and β α and the negative loadings of fi and suva254 fig 4a however fmax doc β α fi and suva254 had low prediction potency for the sdbp fps as indicated by the weak correlations between the indicators and sdbp fps fig 4b notably the loadings of schd fp sthm fp and shan fp were positively correlated with each other indicating that the three dbps had some similar precursors for instance high molecular weight aromatic dom components were previously found to simultaneously contribute to the production of the dbps during chlorination fabris et al 2008 franklin et al 2021 as e 2 e 3 eac and edc were significantly correlated with the sdbp fps of the sdom the characteristic indicators would be reliable proxies for predicting the chlorine reactivity of dom this result was also supported by prior studies where the edc and ultraviolet absorbance were identified as reliable surrogates for the chlorine demand and dbp fp of dom from wide sources rougé et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the score results presented in fig 4a clearly show that the sdom samples are clustered by fertilization regimes with an increase in pc1 scores in the order of cf ck cfsr sr this finding further confirms that the fertilization regimes effectively shaped the composition and properties of sdom in summary molecular weight and electron transfer potency are critical factors in regulating the sdbp fps of sdom 4 conclusions fertilization is one of the most common cropland management practices that shifts the molecular diversity and the dbp fp of sdom in cropland impacted watersheds this study concluded that the sdom content in croplands was decreased by the 5 year cf and was not significantly changed by sr independent or in combination with chemical fertilizer nevertheless sr significantly increased dom aromaticity and the high o c lignin and protein like components and decreased the terrestrial humic like substances in the sdom the variations in sdom molecular diversity induced by fertilizations significantly regulated the chlorine reactivity of sdom specifically straw application significantly increased the sthm fp and schd fp by 108 339 and 56 116 in sr and cfsr via increasing the aromatics in sdom including the protein high o c lignin and tannin like components sr was the main factor increasing sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands however chemical fertilizer could effectively reduce about 231 of the increased sthm fp aroused by crop straw in cfsr our field based study supports that partially replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw is beneficial for mitigating dbp risks in drinking water in cropland impacted watersheds credit authorship contribution statement ling du methodology investigation formal analysis writing

15437,soil derived dissolved organic matter sdom is an important site specific disinfection byproduct dbp precursor in watersheds however it remains unclear how fertilization regime shifts the molecular diversity and chlorine reactivity of sdom in cropland impacted watersheds here we analyzed the spectroscopic and molecular level characteristics of the sdom from croplands that had different fertilization regimes i e non fertilization chemical fertilization straw return and chemical fertilization plus straw return for 5 years and evaluated the chlorine reactivity of the sdom by determining the 24 h chlorine consumption and specific dbp formation potential sdbp fp the sdom level decreased by chemical fertilization and was not significantly altered by straw return alone or combined with chemical fertilizer however all fertilization regimes elevated the molecular diversity of sdom by increasing the abundance of protein lignin and tannin like compounds the chlorine reactivity of sdom was reduced by chemical fertilization but was significantly increased by straw return typically straw return increased the formation potential of specific trihalomethane and chloral hydrate by 339 and 56 via increasing the aromatics in sdom whereas chemical fertilization could effectively decrease about 231 of the increased specific trihalomethane formation potential caused by straw return this study highlights that fertilization regime can significantly shape the molecular diversity and chlorine reactivity of the sdom in croplands and that partially replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw is an advantageous practice for reducing dbp risks in drinking water in cropland impacted watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter fertilization straw return croplands molecular diversity chlorine reactivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chemical fertilizer application plays an essential role in increasing crop yield but long term excessive use of chemical fertilizer has been known to degrade soil fertility and environmental quality han et al 2016 mcdonald 2016 changing the fertilization regime is thus essential for maintaining soil fertility and environmental health crop straw with a global production of over 4 billion tons yearly is being encouraged to return to croplands as a promising organic fertilizer cui et al 2021 xia et al 2018 in addition to improving soil fertility straw return also introduces a mass of organic matter into croplands xia et al 2018 hao et al 2022 due to changes in land use intensive irrigation and storm events soil derived dissolved organic matter sdom can be transported into surface waters and source watersheds resulting in a reduction in water quality where the dissolved organic carbon levels are typically 3 9 times higher than the references mcdonald et al 2016 oh et al 2013 as crop straw return is increasingly promoted globally the sdom in croplands is expected to be increasingly impacted and strongly alter the quantity and quality of dom in watersheds given the critical roles of sdom in croplands in regulating the fate of contaminants and potentially serving as the precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps in source waters padhi 2022 zeng et al 2022 increasing studies aim to understand the levels and characteristics of sdom with various cropland managements cai et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 fertilization the most common and active cropland management practice usually elevates the content of water soluble organic matter to various degrees han et al 2016 hao et al 2022 however how fertilization regimes such as applying chemical fertilizer alone or in combination with crop straw shape the molecular diversity of sdom remains controversial chemical fertilization in temperate croplands was reported to promote microbial degradation of sdom and reduce the complexity of sdom by decreasing the humic like compounds and increasing the microbial derived components as indicated by the humification index hix and the freshness index β α hui et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however chemical fertilization was also found to increase the proportions of humic substances in temperate croplands lapa et al 2011 compared to the control treatment crop straw return alone or combined with chemical fertilizer could decrease the degree of dom humification and aromaticity and increase the labile organic carbon pools hao et al 2022 in contrast more aromatics and less lipid like fractions were also measured for the sdom derived from the croplands jointly fertilized with chemical and organic fertilizer wen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 the contradictory findings make it difficult to evaluate the environmental quality effects of sdom furthermore compared to the temperate croplands tropical croplands have much higher rainfall and temperature more acidic and iron rich soils and distinct crop production oladele and adetunji 2021 while these environmental factors inevitably regulate the production and consumption of sdom it is unknown how sdom diversity and characteristics in tropical cropland would respond to different fertilization regimes sdom derived from croplands is increasingly recognized as a critical dbp precursor in cropland impacted watersheds especially after frequent storms and insensitive irrigation events eckard et al 2020 the formation potential for various dbps is synchronously regulated by the quantity and quality of dom li et al 2020 as fertilization invariably increases the sdom level in croplands han et al 2016 irrigation flows usually have significantly higher doc contents than the reference flows hernes et al 2008 fertilization is thus expected to increase the dbp formation potential dbp fp of the sdom in cropland impacted watersheds in contrast with different fertilization regimes the molecular diversity of sdom varies widely which can contribute to a distinct dbp fp profile of the sdom receiving waters however how the fertilization regimes shift the chlorine reactivity and dbp fp of the sdom in croplands remains unknown recently the aromaticity of dom indicated by the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was measured to positively correlate with specific trihalomethane formation potential sthm fp chen and westerhoff 2010 the relationship provided insight into the underlying dbp formation mechanisms indicating that aromatic fractions in the bulk dom react with chlorine to form trihalomethanes thms however the thm precursors in the dom are not necessarily the main contributors to haloacetonitriles formation milstead and remucal 2021 therefore the chlorine reactivity of sdom in croplands with different fertilization regimes awaits further investigation at both the bulk and molecular levels here we hypothesized that replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw would increase the molecular diversity and chlorine reactivity of sdom due to the possibly accumulated aromatics correspondingly four fertilization regimes control without chemical fertilizer or straw return chemical fertilization straw return and chemical fertilization plus straw return were continuously implemented for five years sdom samples were obtained by water extraction and characterized the bulk and molecular level traits using optical spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms after that the effects of fertilization regimes on the chlorine reactivity of the sdom were assessed by the chlorine demand and specific dbp fp finally the correlations between the characteristics and chlorine reactivity of the sdom were evaluated using correlation analysis and principal component analysis this study provides insights into the potential links between applying chemical fertilizer and crop straw and the water safety in cropland impacted watersheds 2

temperature of 23 5 c the targeted soil is a latosol derived from basalt comprising 18 6 clay 8 8 fine silt 6 4 coarse silt 14 7 fine sand and 51 5 coarse sand four fertilization regimes were initiated in 2015 with a chili maize rotation as follows i control ck i e non fertilization ii chemical fertilization cf 345 kg n ha 1 273 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 417 kg k2o ha 1 every year iii straw return

a randomized block design with six replicate plots and four treatments separated by cement ridges the size of each plot was 60 m2 7 5 m 8 m the field management practices including irrigation herbicide and pesticide applications were consistent with the practices used by local farmers 2 2 2 soil sampling and preparation a total of 24 composite soil samples with 5 year of different treatments were sampled using the five point sampling method in september 2021 briefly five topsoil cores 0 20 cm collected from each plot after maize harvest were mixed to form one composite soil sample wrapped in ice packs and transported to the laboratory after removing plant residues and stones the soil samples were characterized for the bacterial and fungal communities at the phylum level according to a previous study li et al 2019 and then freeze dried ground and sieved to 2 mm all the prepared soils were sealed in brown glass bottles and stored in the dark until use the physicochemical properties of the soil samples were analyzed and the results are shown in table s1 in the supporting information the detailed analytical procedures are described in text s1 2 3 sdom extraction and characterization 2 3 1 sdom extracts preparation and general water quality analysis sdom was extracted using the procedures described by jones and willett 2006 briefly 20 g of soil was shaken with 200 ml of milli q water for 8 h at 20 c after that the supernatant was passed through a pre rinsed 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane millipore and collected as sdom solution all the prepared sdom extracts were stored at 4 c in the dark until further analysis the general water quality of all the extracts was measured as previously described li et al 2020 specifically ph and electrical conductivity were measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius germany and a conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo switzerland the dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were measured by a total organic carbon nitrogen analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu japan the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including nh4 n no3 n and no2 n was determined using an auto discrete water quality analyzer cleverchem 380 dechem tech germany the dissolved organic nitrogen don concentration was calculated as the difference between the tdn and din concentrations 2 3 2 electron transfer capacity measurements the electron transfer capacities of the sdom samples were measured using the mediated electrochemical reduction mer at eh 0 49 v and oxidation meo at eh 0 61 v methods aeschbacher et al 2010 all measurements were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 1 c and the detailed determination procedures are shown in text s2 the number of electrons transferred from and to the sdom was calculated as the integration of reductive and oxidative current responses respectively finally the quantified electron numbers were normalized to the analyzed sdom mass to represent the electron accepting eac and donating edc capacities 2 3 3 absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis the ultraviolet visible absorbance of the sdom was measured by a spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan as shown in fig s1 the suva254 was calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration and used to indicate sdom aromaticity d andrilli et al 2015 the e 2 e 3 ratio negatively correlated to the molecular weight of dom was calculated as the ratio of a 250 to a 365 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the excitation emission matrices eems of the sdom samples diluted to a 254 0 1 to minimize inner filter effects were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer aqualog horiba usa the excitation wavelengths were set to increase gradually from 240 to 650 nm at 2 nm intervals and the emissions were scanned from 246 077 to 827 273 nm at 2 pixels for each excitation with an integration time of 2 0 s all eems were blank subtracted inner filter effects corrected and normalized to the raman unit the hix was calculated by dividing the emission response at 435 480 nm by 300 345 nm when the excitation wavelength was 254

zhang et al 2021a the β α an indicator for freshly produced dom was the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm to the maximum emission intensity at 420 435 nm when the excitation wavelength was 310 nm wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the functional group characteristics obtained by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis were further confirmed by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy text s3 to quantify the fluorescent components in sdom all eems were further resolved by parallel factor analysis parafac using a dreem toolbox he and hur 2015 murphy et al 2013 the modelled components were further compared with previously reported models in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 the relative abundance of each component was compared as the ratio of its maximum fluorescence intensity f max to the doc content of sdom li et al 2020 2 3 4 ft icr ms analysis molecular level information of sdom was further obtained by ft icr ms analysis specifically sdom samples for ft icr ms analysis were prepared using solid phase extraction cartridges varian bond elute ppl 1 g 6 ml following a general procedure dittmar et al 2008 the doc recoveries were 54 61 comparable to those reported in previous studies dittmar et al 2008 the isolated sdom was then dissolved in 1 ml methanol water 1 1 v v and analyzed on an ft icr ms instrument bruker solarix 15 0 t in negative electrospray ionization mode the mass limits were set at m z 153 1000 da spectra were first externally calibrated with sodium formate and then internally calibrated with a known series of compounds covering the entire relevant mass range the obtained peaks with a signal to noise ratio 4 and a mass error 1 ppm were assigned molecular formulas using data analysis 4 4 software bruker daltonics the

divided into non aromatic aimod 0 5 aromatic 0 5 aimod 0 67 and condensed aromatic aimod 0 67 categories koch and dittmar 2006 h c and o c ratios were used for drawing the van krevelen diagram seven biochemical groups of compounds were classified by a previously used method cai et al 2020 as follows 1 lipid like h c 1 5 2 3 o c 0 0 2 2 protein like h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 2 0 52 3 amino sugar like h c

reveal the detailed characteristics of the sdom various molecular parameters were also calculated including the double bond equivalence dbe modified aromaticity index aimod nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc and molecular lability boundary for labile like compounds mlbl dbe and aimod represent the unsaturation and aromaticity of the assigned molecular formula respectively hao et al 2017 nosc reflects the average oxidation state of all carbons per formula and mlbl predicts the lability of dom d andrilli et al 2015 2 4 chlorine reactivity tests and analyses the chlorine reactivities of the sdom samples were evaluated by the chlorine demand and specific dbp fp sdbp fp in μg mgc using previously reported methods wang et al 2015 briefly sdom samples 3 mgc l 1 were buffered by h3bo3 naoh solution to ph 8 0 and chlorinated with freshly prepared naocl h3bo3 solution ph 8 0 at a dose of cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh3 n after 24 h of incubation at 25 c in headspace free amber glass vials the residual chlorine in the sdom samples was quantified using a dpd spectrophotometric method and used to calculate the chlorine demand after that the samples were scavenged the residual chlorine using na2so3 and processed for analyses of thms hans haas and chd the concentrations of the four kinds of dbps were quantified according to us epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 with minor modifications in brief 50 ml of the chlorine scavenged samples were acidified to ph 0 5 with h2so4 after adding 12 g of na2so4 thms hans haas and chd were extracted into 4 5 ml of mtbe by mixing at 70 rpm for 30 min and standing at 4 c for 30 min then 3 ml of the mtbe was obtained from the extraction layer to determine the haas the sampled mtbe solutions were esterified by 1 ml of h2so4 acidified ch3oh at 50 c for 2 5 h after that residual acid was neutralized by saturated nahco3 solution finally the obtained mtbe layers were analyzed for thms hans haas and chd using a db 1ms column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm on a shimadzu gc 2010 pro with an electron capture detector 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical differences were identified between treatments using one way anova with post hoc tukey s tests and the significant differences were considered when p 0 05 correlations between the sdbp fps optical properties and ft icr ms parameters of the sdom were determined by pearson s correlation analysis principal component analysis pca was applied to provide rough patterns of the reduced dimensions of the parameters and cluster of samples sdbp fp associated sdom molecular profiles were assessed using spearman s rank correlation analysis all the data are presented as the mean standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality of the soil extracts fertilization can effectively regulate the water quality of the soil extracts especially the ph water soluble ions and doc content the ph significantly decreased from 6 5 0 1 in the ck to 5 9 0 2 in the cf treatment while it was not affected by the fertilization regimes of sr and cfsr table 1 compared to ph the electrical conductivity of soil extracts was more sensitive to fertilization and significantly increased by all fertilization regimes p 0 05 specifically the concentration of tdn and nox n in the extracts was increased by cf but the two water matrices were not significantly affected by cfsr that could be attributed to the role of straw derived organic matter in stimulating microbial denitrification processes pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a in contrast compared to ck the doc contents of the soil extracts were significantly decreased and increased by cf and sr respectively table 1 the distinct responses of sdom quantity to different fertilization regimes are consistent with previous field studies that showed increased soil doc levels with crop straw return and decreased soil doc levels with chemical fertilizer addition in croplands hao et al 2022 mockeviciene et al 2021 notably the opposite functions of crop straw and chemical fertilizer in regulating soil doc level tend to cancel each other out when the two fertilizers are used in combination han et al 2016 as a result comparable sdom contents of the soil extracts were found between the cfsr and the ck treatments in this study 3 2 spectroscopic characteristics of the sdom in addition to the sdom quantity the sdom quality also differed significantly among the fertilization treatments as indicated by the absorbance and fluorescence indices table 1 compared to the sdom in ck the sdom in cf had significantly lower suva254 values and higher e 2 e 3 values low suva254 is typically indicative of low dom aromaticity d andrilli et al 2015 and high e 2 e 3 usually represents the low molecular weight feature of dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the results in this study thus suggest that the sdom in cf had lower aromaticity and molecular weight notably the e 2 e 3 value of the sdom in the cf was higher than that in the sr and cfsr treatments p 0 05 our prior finding also corroborated this phenomenon that long term application of ammonium nitrate could decrease the molecular weight of sdom li et al 2020 no difference was found in fi and hix among the treatments which means that the sdom samples had similar origins and comparable humification degrees cai et al 2020 the ft ir characterization results also confirmed the characteristics indicated by the fi and hix indices showing similar responses of the c c and phenyl structures fig s2 remarkably a significantly high β α value was found for the sdom in the sr treatment which could be attributed to the recently produced dom from the returned straw hao et al 2022 mockeviciene et al 2021 three fluorescence components of sdom were identified by eem parafac model fig 1 fluorescent component 1 c1 peaked at ex em wavelengths of 250 480 nm and can be assigned to terrestrial humic like substances which are usually found in agriculture oriented areas wünsch et al 2017 the fmax doc of c1 was lower in the sr than that in the other fertilization treatments indicating sr shaped the sdom composition similarly except for effectively increasing the content of soil organic matter sr was also determined to make soil organic matter younger by increasing the aliphatic components and decreasing the aromaticity of humic substances cui et al 2017 hao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b component 2 c2 exhibited a maximum fluorescent response at ex em wavelengths of 310 250 415 nm consistent with the spectral characteristics of microbial humic like substances li et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 interestingly the relative abundance of c2 was comparable among the fertilization treatments possibly due to the relatively short term treatment component 3 c3 had a peak at ex em wavelengths of 270 315 nm and was characterized as protein like substances mainly derived from microbial activities murphy et al 2008 c3 had a relatively higher content in the sr than in others possibly due to the primarily introduced exogenous organic matter hao et al 2022 it was consistent with the higher β α values of the sdom in the sr table 1 in the meantime fertilization significantly changed the microbial community fig s3 a and b as indicated by the chao1 and shannon indices the bacterial richness and diversity were increased by sr while the fungal richness and diversity were significantly decreased by sr table s2 sustained organic carbon addition was also previously determined to shape the bacterial community into a more eutrophic state li et al 2019 yang and lu 2022 therefore the abundance of c3 was also related to the increased bacterial biomass and reactivity by the returned straw 3 3 molecular signature of sdom the molecular level composition of the sdom determined by ft icr ms further confirmed the shifts in sdom components induced by different fertilization regimes compared to ck fertilization treatments i e cf sr and cfsr had more assigned sdom molecules with higher chon abundance lower cho abundance and comparable chos abundance table 2 additionally whether applied independently or in combination with chemical fertilizer crop straw invariably elevated the mlbl value of sdom fertilization of crop straw thus was demonstrated to increase the microbial contributions to sdom possibly by introducing a large number of boilable compounds and increasing microbial activity han et al 2016 hao et al 2022 this result was also consistent with the increased fmax c3 doc level for the sdom in the sr fig 1 and the increased bacterial richness and diversity table s2 according to the o c and h c ratios the identified formulas were classified into seven classes using the van krevelen diagram fig s4 including lipid like protein like amino sugar like carbohydrate like lignin like tannin like and dissolved black carbon like substances cai et al 2020 compared to ck all fertilization treatments had unique sdom molecules with molecular weights of 150 600 da most of which were protein lignin and tannin like substances fig s5 this result further corroborated the decreased relative abundance of terrestrial humic like substances fmax c1 doc in the sdom from sr fig 1 in contrast sr increased the percentage content of aromatics in sdom by nearly 1 8 and 2 0 times higher than ck and cf respectively table 2 this result was also demonstrated by the aromaticity indicator suva254 table 1 and could be explained by the accumulation of aromatics in cropland soils since the aromatic molecules derived from straw usually have longer lifetimes than other components in the environment chen et al 2010 therefore cfsr also had sdom with more aromatics than ck and cf the result was also consistent with previous findings that sustained organic carbon addition significantly increased the molecular diversity of sdom and the presence of recalcitrant components li et al 2019 han et al 2016 overall the findings demonstrated our hypothesis that replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw could increase the aromatics in sdom the impacts of fertilization regimes on the molecular level characteristics of sdom were also assessed by ft icr ms compared to ck sr and cfsr had sdom with lower average h c and higher o c dbe and aimod values table 2 the parameters collectively suggest that the sdom in sr and cfsr had higher aromaticity however cf had no significant influence on the aromaticity of sdom the results are consistent with the relatively higher suva254 values in sr and cfsr table 1 and further support straw fertilizer increasing aromatics in sdom notably all fertilization treatments effectively decreased the average molecular weight of sdom table 2 and fig s5 possibly resulting from the promoted sdom degradation and the introduced dom by crop straw cui et al 2017 hao et al 2022 zeng et al 2022 the result is also consistent with the increased e 2 e 3 values of the sdom in cf and cfsr table 1 nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc is a reliable indicator of the carbon state in a specific dom molecule wilson and tfaily 2018 specifically a negative neutral or positive nosc value represents a reduced neutral or oxidized state of the carbon in dom respectively liu et al 2022 wilson and tfaily 2018 in this study the nosc of sdom samples were identified as negative with a decreasing order of cf ck cfsr and sr i e the sdom were feasibly oxidized in order of sr cfsr ck cf straw application thus could effectively reduce the redox state of sdom which could be attributed to the accumulated aromatics this result is also supported by the strong reduction state of the sdom in sr and cfsr indicated by the higher edc values table 1 furthermore nosc is closely related to the h c and o c ratios and can represent the polarity of dom riedel et al 2012 based on the negative relationship between nosc and molecule polarity sr had sdom with the highest polarity followed by cfsr ck and cf in conclusion through ft icr ms analysis cf sr and cfsr treatments elevated the molecular diversity of sdom consistent with the spectroscopic and electrochemical results straw addition was determined to shift sdom to aromatic low molecular weight diverse polar reduced and labile development overall the variations induced by sr would make sdom more readily react with oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite to form dbps which was further discussed in the following sections notably in contrast to our hypothesis chemical fertilization did not significantly change the aromaticity of sdom but it effectively resulted in fertilization specific sdom this might be attributed to the following reasons i cf reconstructed the soil microbial communities especially the bacterial community as cf showed a markedly separated cluster in nonmetric multidimensional scaling plot from ck and other fertilization treatments fig s3 c similar results also found in other temperate zones ling et al 2016 acidobacteria chloroflexi and gemmatimonadetes were determined to be the phyla involved in soil organic matter degradation liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 in this study the accumulated relative abundance of the three bacteria was lowest in the cf followed by the ck cfsr and sr fig s3 a which could be related to the abundance of carbohydrate lignin and lipid like components in sdom fig s6 therefore the sdom in cf was specific compared to ck and other fertilization treatments ii due to the lack of the priming effect of labile organic matter from crop straw the microbial degradation of soil organic matter would be negligible with cf treatment xu et al 2020 3 4 chlorine reactivity of the sdom doc normalized chlorine consumption was the highest for the sdom in sr 0 91 0 06 mg cl2 mgc 1 followed by the sdom in cfsr 0 79 0 03 mg cl2 mgc 1 ck 0 75 0 03 mg cl2 mgc 1 and cf 0 62 0 04 mg cl2 mgc 1 fig 2 a this order was well explained by the average nosc values table 2 which indicates the oxidation state of carbon in a certain dom molecule wilson and tfaily 2018 correspondingly the chlorine consumption order of the sdom was also consistent with their edc order table 1 the 24 h chlorine consumption thus could represent at least partially the chlorine reactivity of the sdom samples compared to ck cf significantly reduced the doc normalized chlorine consumption of the sdom in contrast sr and cfsr significantly increased the doc normalized chlorine consumption of the sdom indicating that sr increased the chlorine reactivity of sdom as chlorine is a selective oxidant that preferentially reacts with electron rich compounds lavonen et al 2013 the role of sr in increasing sdom chlorine consumption thus could be attributed to the increased abundance of aromatics in the sdom the results collectively highlighted that the chlorine reactivity of sdom in croplands was closely related to its aromaticity and oxidation state of carbon which could be regulated by the applied fertilization regimes the sdbp fps for sdom samples depended heavily on the fertilization regimes fig 2b compared to the sthm fp 6 1 8 2 μg mgc 1 and specific chd formation potential schd fp 4 0 5 1 μg mgc 1 of the sdom in ck the sthm fp 25 4 36 9 μg mgc 1 and schd fp 5 8 8 6 μg mgc 1 of sdom were significantly increased by 339 and 56 in sr respectively interestingly cfsr significantly reduced the sthm fp of the sdom in sr by 231 and increased the schd fp of the sdom in sr by 60 generally sr and cfsr played opposite roles in altering the sthm fps of sdom cf had no influence on the sthm fp and significantly decreased the sdbp fps for haas from 5 5 to 2 4 μg mgc 1 and chd from 4 6 to 2 8 μg mgc 1 notably among the used fertilization regimes only sr significantly increased the haloacetonitrile formation potential shan fp of sdom by 98 fig 2b the results collectively indicate that sr can be a main factor in increasing the sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands which mainly stemmed from the shifted sdom molecular composition notably compared to other terrestrial dom in previous studies the sdom in the sr treatment had comparable sdbp fps for thms haas hans and chd cai et al 2020 cawley et al 2017 li et al 2020 padhi 2022 the protein high o c lignin and tannin like molecules are intimately related to the sdbp fps fig 3 the observed variations in sdbp fps in different fertilizations thus were well explained by the changes in aromatics and the individual contribution of sdom molecules to the sdbp fps specifically sr had the most potency in introducing the lignin and tannin like formulas while cfsr mainly increased the abundance of protein and lignin like molecules in sdom fig s5 the results collectively confirm our hypothesis that fertilization regulates the sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands mainly by changing the aromatics similarly aromatic and polyphenolic compounds were also reported as two types of important dbp precursors in prior studies hua et al 2014 milstead and remucal 2021 notably the sthm fp value of the sdom was significantly lower in the cfsr than in the sr fig 2b therefore the combined application of chemical fertilizer with crop straw could be a potential solution for mitigating the dbp fps of sdom induced by straw return 3 5 linking sdbp fp with the characteristics of sdom to gain insight into the molecular characteristics dominating the sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands all the obtained sdom characteristics were incorporated to create a pca biplot and a pearson correlation plot fig 4 the first two principal components explained 55 9 of the total variation of all parameters pc1 36 2 pc2 19 7 pc1 explained the high molecular weight electron rich and highly humified substances as e 2 e 3 and eac were negatively placed on pc1 and hix and edc were placed in the positive direction of pc1 fig 4a this result was further confirmed by the significant correlations in fig 4b and the previous findings on biochar litter and soil derived dom forming dbps in chlorination processes cawley et al 2017 li et al 2022 wang et al 2015 pc2 was associated with the fluorescent components especially the recently produced and terrestrially derived components as indicated by the positive loadings of fmax doc and β α and the negative loadings of fi and suva254 fig 4a however fmax doc β α fi and suva254 had low prediction potency for the sdbp fps as indicated by the weak correlations between the indicators and sdbp fps fig 4b notably the loadings of schd fp sthm fp and shan fp were positively correlated with each other indicating that the three dbps had some similar precursors for instance high molecular weight aromatic dom components were previously found to simultaneously contribute to the production of the dbps during chlorination fabris et al 2008 franklin et al 2021 as e 2 e 3 eac and edc were significantly correlated with the sdbp fps of the sdom the characteristic indicators would be reliable proxies for predicting the chlorine reactivity of dom this result was also supported by prior studies where the edc and ultraviolet absorbance were identified as reliable surrogates for the chlorine demand and dbp fp of dom from wide sources rougé et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the score results presented in fig 4a clearly show that the sdom samples are clustered by fertilization regimes with an increase in pc1 scores in the order of cf ck cfsr sr this finding further confirms that the fertilization regimes effectively shaped the composition and properties of sdom in summary molecular weight and electron transfer potency are critical factors in regulating the sdbp fps of sdom 4 conclusions fertilization is one of the most common cropland management practices that shifts the molecular diversity and the dbp fp of sdom in cropland impacted watersheds this study concluded that the sdom content in croplands was decreased by the 5 year cf and was not significantly changed by sr independent or in combination with chemical fertilizer nevertheless sr significantly increased dom aromaticity and the high o c lignin and protein like components and decreased the terrestrial humic like substances in the sdom the variations in sdom molecular diversity induced by fertilizations significantly regulated the chlorine reactivity of sdom specifically straw application significantly increased the sthm fp and schd fp by 108 339 and 56 116 in sr and cfsr via increasing the aromatics in sdom including the protein high o c lignin and tannin like components sr was the main factor increasing sdbp fps of the sdom in croplands however chemical fertilizer could effectively reduce about 231 of the increased sthm fp aroused by crop straw in cfsr our field based study supports that partially replacing chemical fertilizer with crop straw is beneficial for mitigating dbp risks in drinking water in cropland impacted watersheds credit authorship contribution statement ling du methodology investigation formal analysis writing

15438,lake taihu suffers from severe algal blooms every year which is attributed primarily to the release of sediment phosphorus p namely the internal p loading however the overall internal p loading and the p hotspots in sediment have not been fully studied this paper presents several methods including sequential p extraction the use of diffusive gradient in thin film dgt and intact core incubation to give a detailed investigation of sediment internal p loading as well as its roles in algal dominated zones adzs and grass dominated zones gdzs in lake taihu sediment microbial composition was also analyzed to investigate its relationship with p fractions the results indicate that the total p and the mobile p fraction in the adz sediments are generally higher than those of the gdz sediments the percentage of sediment mobile p to tp is similar to the mobile p in their distributions in contrast calcium bound p accounts for most of the tp in gdz while mobile p contributes the most to tp in adz overall sediment can release 256 tons of tp and 217 tons of soluble reactive phosphorus srp over a period of six months in the warmer seasons similarly a high concentration of dgt measured p was observed in adzs that are recognized as p hotspots in lake taihu sediments in adz and gdz was dominated by the bacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria respectively and which were closely related with mobile p and calcium bound p in sediment respectively gzd seems to be able to retain more p in sediments thereby reducing its contribution to of internal p loading these results indicate that the difference in sediment composition between adz and gdz affects their roles in sediment internal p loading therefore different management strategies should be used to combat sediment internal p loads in the two zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal and grass dominated zone sediment internal p loading sediment flux mobile p p hotspot area in sediment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limiting nutrient that supports primary production in freshwater ecosystems schindler et al 2016 therefore it is important to understand p biogeochemistry in wetlands lakes and rivers it was found that more than 50 of external p loading can be retained in lake sediment carey and rydin 2011 and sediment stored p also called internal p loading is responsible for the continuous lake eutrophication søndergaard et al 2003 eutrophication supported by internal p loading can last decades even after the external p loading being effectively controlled this is because p can continue to be released from sediment under favorable conditions anoxic sediment resuspension or oxidation reduction thereby supplementing the overlying water p wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 sediment internal p can be adsorbed by iron and manganese oxides clay minerals and fine sediment particles heinrich et al 2021 markovic et al 2019 sediment p presents in different forms many of which are labile and not entirely buried in sediment markovic et al 2019 traditionally the total p tp in sediment can be operationally classified into six forms including loosely adsorbed p iron bound p organic p al bound p calcium bound p and residual p using the sequential p extraction procedures rydin et al 2017 tammeorg et al 2020 other p extraction procedures have been developed to better understand p biogeochemistry in sediment zhu et al 2013 these operationally defined p forms and have been widely used to understand p biogeochemistry in lakes barik et al 2019 gikuma njuru et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 the sum of the three forms of p including loosely sorbed p iron bound p and organic phosphorus in sediment are referred to as potential mobile p hupfer et al 2019 mobile p can be released into sediment porewater and overlying water consequently making it a p source for algal while other inert forms of p al p or ca p would be minor contribution to the p fluxes from sediment markovic et al 2019 in surface sediments microorganisms degrade the bioavailable organic matter and consume electron donors such oxygen and nitrate gibbons and bridgeman 2020 this process will release phosphate and the loosely adsorbed phosphorus wang et al 2022 the anoxic condition caused by degradation of organic matter in surface sediment will also reduce ferric iron hydro oxides which leads to the release of iron bound phosphorus anderson et al 2021 high concentrations of p in sediment porewater can lead to p release into overlying water due to the strong chemical gradient or sediment resuspension which is especially evident in shallow lakes ding et al 2018 therefore higher sediment mobile p would be associated with more intensive p flux especially during high temperature seasons such as summer and autumn gibbons and bridgeman 2020 yao et al 2021 sediment with high p mobility and flux are considered areas of p hotspot that can lead to severe eutrophication p sequential extractions diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and intact sediment core incubation were three techniques frequently used to assess sediment p mobility and hotspots in lake sediment ding et al 2015 rydin et al 2017 sequential extraction can measure potential mobile p and dgt can measure its two dimensional 2d vertical distribution these techniques have been widely used to investigate the effects of bioturbation inactivation and submerged plant rhizospheres on the p vertical distribution in sediment hupfer et al 2019 li et al 2019 p fluxes across the sediment water interface can be calculated by monitoring the changes in nutrient concentrations in the overlying water over a certain period of core incubation which can reflect the sediment internal p loads james 2017b these methods combined can help to understand p biogeochemistry in lakes larson et al 2020 assisting in the management of sediment internal p loading large eutrophic lakes with surface water areas of hundreds to thousands of square kilometer contain large areas of sediment beds within a lake the physical and chemical characteristics of sediment in different areas can vary greatly due to the heterogeneous nature of sedimentology pollutant history and hydrodynamic processes zhu et al 2013 this also leads to heterogeneous sediment p biogeochemistry including p forms fluxes and related microbial activities making the management of internal p loads more difficult hence it is necessary to carried out detail investigations of p biogeochemistry in the sediment of large lakes in this study we carried out a detailed survey of sediment p chemistry in different areas of the large eutrophic lake taihu in china our objective was to gain a better understanding of lake taihu s sediment internal p loads by studying sediment p forms and fluxes we also analyzed the microbial community in surface sediment this is the first time such a detailed investigation has been carried out on lake taihu s sediment internal p loads the main tasks of this study are to 1 understand the distributions of various p fractions in the surface sediment 2 quantify sediment p fluxes in the p hotspot areas in lake taihu 3 elucidate the relationship between microbial community and p fractions in surface sediment and 4 understand the role of sediment in internal p loads in lake taihu 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description lake taihu 30 5 32 8 n and 119 8 121 55 e is the third largest freshwater lake in china it is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and has a surface area of 2338 km2 the average water depth of lake taihu is 2 0 m which classifies it a shallow eutrophic freshwater lake the taihu watershed is one of the most developed areas in china and populated by about 60 million people with the rapid development of economic and urbanization since the 1980s huge external pollution has been discharged into lake taihu without treatment nowadays the lake experiences severe eutrophication and algal blooms each year especially in warmer seasons although huge efforts have been made to reduce the input of external phosphorus loading lake taihu still suffers from heavy algal blooms each year internal p loading from sediments is considered one of the main reasons for the continuous algal bloom xu et al 2021 at present lake taihu is mainly characterized by two ecological types algal dominated zones adz and grass dominated zone gdzs which are categorized spatially according to the distribution domain of algal and submerged plants generally zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay yueliang bay the west coast area and the south area can be considered adz while eastern lake taihu and the east area are the gdz table s1 and fig s1 the planned sampling sites were distributed into the nine regions which are described in detail in the following section 2 2 sediment collection and handling to give a detailed investigation of the sediment internal p loads in different areas of lake taihu we collected sediment cores no less than 50 cm long from lake taihu using a core sampler 8 8 cm in diameter and 60 cm in length during august 2020 fig 1 in total 53 sampling sites were selected covering a range of water depths and four sediment cores were collected from each site these sediment cores were kept upright and transported to the laboratory within 4 h after collection and then stored in the dark approximately 5 l of water was collected from each sampling site for the experiments the surface sediment 0 10 cm was sliced and homogenized some parts of the sediment were freeze dried for p fraction analysis in this study only the sediment in the surface layer 0 10 cm was used for p fraction analysis because 0 10 cm of the sediment contribute to 60 80 of the p released from the sediment and is the most important in terms of internal p loading wang et al 2021 2 3 sediment core incubation and flux calculation in this study 32 sampling sites were selected to measure the total phosphorus tp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp fluxes across sediment water interface in all of lake taihu fig 1 the nutrient fluxes across the sediment water interface were measured using the static release method which has been adopted by many researchers for sediment nutrient flux measurement larson et al 2020 liu et al 2016 in brief the sediment cores were drained to deplete the overlying water and cut down to 20 cm only the upper 20 cm were kept then filtered lake water about 1000 ml was siphoned onto the sediment to serve as overlying water this process was carefully conducted to avoid disturbing the sediment surface these sediment cores three replicates at each site were incubated at 25 2 c for 72 h in the dark the temperature was kept at an average lake bottom temperature simulating the conditions from may to october in lake taihu anaerobic conditions are seldom observed in lake taihu water therefore the overlying water was gently aerated to avoid the formation of anaerobic conditions fifty milliliter 50 ml water samples were collected from the middle of the water column at the following time intervals 0 6 12 24 36 48 60 and 72 h in situ lake water was added to the column immediately after sampling to maintain the water volume the release rates of tp and srp were calculated as 1 f n v c n c 0 j 1 n v j 1 c j 1 c i s t where f n is the nutrient flux on the nth day mg m 2 d 1 and c 0 is the initial nutrient concentration mg l 1 v and v j represent the volume of overlying water and sampling water l respectively c n and c j 1 are the nutrient concentration mg l 1 on the nth and j 1th sampling day respectively c i is the nutrient concentration of the replenished water mg l 1 s is the cross sectional area of the column m2 and t is the incubation time d the tp value and the srp flux for each site was averaged for 36 to 72 h 2 4 dgt measurement to investigate the p hotspot area in the lake taihu sediment the commercial zr oxide diffusive gradients in thin films zr oxide dgt probes zhongke zhigan nanjing environmental technology ltd nanjing china were used to measure the 2d labile p for sediment cores from 32 sampling sites after the collected sediment cores arrived at the laboratory the dgt probes were inserted vertically into the sediment cores and retrieved after 24 h after retrieval the sediment water interface swi was marked immediately the dgt probe surfaces were rinsed several times by deionized water to remove sediment particles before analysis means of obtaining the high resolution 2d labile p images and the testing protocol can be found in ding et al 2015 2 5 analysis phosphorus fractions in the surface sediment were determined using the sequential extraction method developed by rydin 2000 and described in the supplementary material in brief sediment p was fractioned using nh4cl p l p bd p fe p naoh nrp org p naoh rp al p hcl p ca p and residual p res p the p concentration in each step was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method and reported as an average of the two duplicate analyses the total phosphorus tp in sediment was estimated as the sum of the six p fractions and the mobile p was the sum of loosely sorbed p fe p and org p fractions the benthic microbial community composition in surface sediment was analyzed from the 53 sampling sites in brief around 1 0 g fresh sediment from each site was used for dna extraction using a soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions and then sequenced on an illumina miseq platform personal biotechnology company shanghai china detailed information on sequencing and data analysis is provided in the supplementary material 2 6 statistical analysis significant differences in variables tp content p fractions p flux and microbial community were identified among the different areas of lake taihu through one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test homogeneity of variance for the obtained data was tested and data of the test values 0 05 were adopted for anova analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics 19 0 ibm armonk new york usa with significant p levels p 0 05 and p 0 01 reported correlations between bacteria community structure phylum level and sediment p fractions were explored with linear model based redundancy analysis rda using the software canoco for windows ver 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of p fractions in surface sediment the tp content in surface sediment 0 10 cm was in the range of 332 to 1462 mg kg with an average value of 613 287 mg kg fig s2 n 53 which fell within the ranges reported by previous studies liu et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 zhu reported that the average tp content in surface sediment 0 3 cm of lake taihu was 496 mg kg based on a sampling taken in august 2010 zhu et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge the number of sampling sites in this study was more than previously reported among the six p fractions l p fe p org p al p ca p and res p analyzed in this study the l p fraction had the lowest value 0 42 8 16 mg kg and a mean value of 2 07 mg kg which only accounts for 0 11 to 0 98 of tp in sediment representing an average 0 3 in many previously reported studies the l p fraction was generally found to be the lowest fraction among all of the p fractions extracted and accounted for with 5 tp in most of the lake sediment investigated wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2013 although l p has a low content in most lake sediment it has the greatest bioavailability among the six p fractions and can be easily released and used by algae the content of naoh nrp org p ranked the second lowest p fraction in sediment was in the range of 10 6 to 233 mg kg with a mean value of 37 mg kg org p accounted for 1 40 16 8 average 5 4 of the tp in this study meanwhile fe p ranged from 51 to 585 mg kg with a mean value of 147 mg kg in this study accounting for an average of 22 of the tp the sum of l p org p and fe p called mobile p represent the three forms of p fractions that contributed most to the internal p loads this is because the mobile p can be become bioavailable to algal under suitable conditions such as the anoxic condition or during the degradation of organic matter rydin et al 2017 the content of sediment mobile p accounted for 15 46 of tp average 27 with concentrations ranging between 68 4 and 638 mg kg average 181 mg kg compared with other eutrophic lakes in the world the mobile p content in lake taihu s surface sediment was not very high in comparison the average mobile p in the surface sediment 0 5 cm of lake chaohu was 205 mg kg yang et al 2022 in lake dianchi s surface sediment 0 10 cm the mobile p content accounted for 242 mg kg li et al 2015 both lake chaohu and lake dianchi are large eutrophic lakes in china one fraction of the mobile p org p was found to reach as high as around 500 mg kg in lake chilika which is asia s largest brackish water lake barik et al 2019 the three p fractions naoh rp al p hcl p ca p and res p were stable in lake sediment and were not accessible to algal the al p fraction ranged between 43 mg kg and 539 mg kg with a mean value of 175 mg kg which accounted for 26 of the tp in sediment these results were consistent with other studies verifying that the al p content normally accounted for most of the tp in sediment wang et al 2021 although al p was thought to be an inert p fraction in sediment research indicated that the dissolution of al p would happen under alkaline conditions ph 9 especially during the heavy algal bloom seasons huser et al 2016 high ph values 10 in overlying water during lake taihu s algal bloom season has been observed which could cause the al p in suspended sediment to become bioavailable to the lake s phytoplankton fang et al 2018 however more work is needed to confirm this hypothesis the ca p ranged between 116 and 338 mg kg accounting for 9 8 66 of the tp in sediments while res p ranged between 32 and 118 mg kg accounting for 5 9 14 of the sediment tp of lake taihu normally the two inert p fractions would not be bioavailable to algal and often become buried in sediment permanently spatially the composition of p fractions and their content varied largely across lake taihu on average the mobile p fractions l p fe p and org p were the highest in zhushan bay followed by westcoast area and then in meiliang bay it was reported that about of 50 approx 1000 t of external p pollution in lake taihu comes from zhushan bay and the westcoast area each year and most of that p is stored in the sediment another reason is that these areas are also algal dominated zones and the settlement of organic matter produced in the water column algal detritus with high content of n and p will naturally increase the concentration of n and p in the surface sediments of these areas in contrast the p fractions l p fe p and org p were generally lower in the central east area and eastern lake taihu the east area and eastern lake taihu are grass macrophyte dominated areas which can lead to fe and mn oxidation around rhizosphere sediment causing the subsequent elevation of p absorption in the sediment thereby slowing the release of p and increasing the sediment s p retention zhao et al 2021 the assimilation of p by the submerged water plants could reduce the content of sediment mobile p li et al 2021 in addition these zones also received little or no external p pollution similar to the distribution pattern of sediment mobile p the naoh nrp al p ca p and res p are also concentrated in zhushan bay however no evident distribution pattern was found in the other studied areas the percentage of p fractions to sediment tp suggests a very interesting distribution pattern the highest percentage of mobile p to tp in sediment was observed in zhushan bay with a mean value of 38 4 followed by meiliang bay and then the westcoast area in contrast mobile p only accounted for 20 of the tp in lake center these results indicate that the higher the pollution is in sediment the higher the percentage of sediment mobile p is with regard to the percentage of ca p to tp in sediment the highest average value was observed in the grass dominated zones of eastern lake taihu with an average of 49 4 followed by lake center averaging 42 7 and then the east area averaging 38 9 the lowest value of sediment mobile p to tp was observed in zhushan bay averaging 18 6 these results indicate that sediment p in the algal dominated areas have high mobile potential while the submerged plants grass dominated areas seemed to have retained more inert p in sediment these results are consistent with previous studies which indicate that submerged plants have the ability to transform sediment mobile p especially fe p to inert p fractions such as ca p and res p li et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 higher concentration of calcium ions were found in the sediment porewater of the macrophyte dominated zones also known as the grass dominated zones which react with phosphate to form ca p precipitation zhao et al 2021 this benefits the management of sediment internal p and helps reduce the fluxes accordingly therefore the restoration of submerged plants is strongly recommended as an effective tool to control sediment internal p in eutrophic lakes such as lake taihu fig 2 3 2 phosphorus fluxes across sediment water interface and amount of p released from sediment in warmer seasons total p and srp fluxes from sediment are presented in fig 3 the results indicate similar patterns of tp and srp fluxes in lake taihu tp fluxes range from 4 56 to 25 2 mg m2 d with an average value of 2 65 mg m2 d the sampling sites with higher tp flux are concentrated in zhushan bay 9 65 mg m2 d yueliang bay 7 09 mg m2 d and eastern lake taihu 4 83 mg m2 d table 1 on average the highest tp flux was found in zhushan bay followed by yueliang bay the third highest amount of tp flux was found in the sediment of eastern lake taihu this is consistent with previous results and the higher p fluxes in zhushan bay and yueliang bay were mainly due to the heavy pollution suffered in the past decades xu et al 2021 however it was surprising that sediment in eastern lake taihu has a relatively high tp flux value as discussed above eastern lake taihu is a grass dominated zone and sediment in this area tend to retain more p the low release of sediment srp flux in east taihu would probably confirm the above hypothesis results indicate that sediment in eastern lake taihu has a higher org p content in comparison to other studied area therefore the release of organic p would contribute most to tp release however further study should be done to test this hypothesis fig 4 the srp flux ranged from 4 53 to 21 8 mg m2 d with an average value of 1 61 mg m2 d in the sediment of lake taihu the srp flux is higher than that of srp flux in the sediment found in the lake of the woods around 0 4 mg m2 d at this stage the sediment in the lake of the woods was incubated in an aerobic condition at 20 c james 2017b however the srp flux in this study is comparable to the srp flux in the lake erie sediment under oxic condition 0 71 1 90 mg m2 d gibbons and bridgeman 2020 both oxygen and temperature can substantially affect srp flux from sediment anderson et al 2021 when anoxic condition was formed near sediment water interface during warmer seasons then high srp flux would be observed yang et al 2020 however we only investigate the srp flux at oxic condition in lake taihu this is because lake taihu is a shallow eutrophic lake and oxygen concentration in overlying water is normally high occasionally the anoxic condition could be formed in some area of lake taihu therefore the srp flux in this study would be a conservative estimate the highest value srp flux rate was observed in zhushan bay followed by yueliang bay this is because higher mobile p contents were found in these areas the srp flux was positively correlated with surface sediment mobile p p 0 01 in this study fig s2 consistent with previous study in a different lake james 2017a mobile p can be released into the overlying water to sustain tp concentrations in the water column via redox reduction and decomposition of organic matter by microbial activity in contrast the grass dominated zones have relatively lower srp fluxes due to the assimilation of p by plants and the high p sorption capacity in the rhizospheres in the sediment normally sediment p will exert an internal effect in seasons with high temperatures that means that sediment internal p will be released into overlying water in summer or autumn when the lake bottom water temperature is warmer this phenomenon has been observed in many temperature monitored eutrophic lakes gibbons and bridgeman 2020 the continuous release of sediment p will sustain a high p concentration in overlying water thereby sustaining the continuous bloom of algal the overlying water temperature of lake taihu fluctuates largely during the seasonal variations it is reported that the days of overlying water with an average of 25 c has around 170 days each year and the sediment internal effect was strong during this period fan et al 2004 we therefore estimated the amount of p released from sediment from this period and the results were listed in table 1 around 256 tons of tp and 217 tons of srp could be released into overlying water as estimated in half of a year it was estimated that about 2000 tons of external p can enter lake taihu each year and about half of the external p is retained xu et al 2021 therefore the amount of tp and srp released from sediment accounted for 12 8 and 10 9 of the external p loading respectively the released p would be quickly used by algal and sustain the bloom area of lake taihu while algal bloom can pump more p from sediment according to the theory of pumping theory found in previous study xie et al 2003 therefore the role of sediment internal p loads would be far more than we expected 3 3 sediment hotspot phosphorus areas identified by the measurement of 2d dgt the sediment labile p measured by 2d dgt is presented in fig 5 and the hotspot area can be visually observed the concentrations of 2d dgt measured labile p shows a high heterogeneity both laterally and vertically on average the highest concentration of dgt labile p was found in zhushan bay with the second highest in meiliang bay and the third highest was in the westcoast area while the concentration of dgt labile p was generally lower in eastern lake taihu lake center and the southwestern area these dgt distribution pattern in the sediment of lake taihu were consistent with previous studies ding et al 2015 however the measured average dgt labile p concentration was a lot higher than the dgt labile p concentration recorded in previous findings ding et al 2015 this is probably because the dgt labile p measured in this study was at the hottest time of the year august when the sediment received more p deposition from the water column and had highest reactivity generally the distribution pattern of dgt measured labile p was consistent with distributions of sediment mobile p and p flux the dgt measured p was a reflection of the diffusion ability of sediment mobile p to porewater and can also be expressed as the release potential of sediment mobile p to water almeida et al 2019 therefore the high sediment mobile p release can be compared to the high dgt measured labile p due to its consistency with the distribution characteristics of sediment mobile p and p flux vertically the dgt measured labile p also shows different distribution patterns among the sampling sites fig 5 notably dgt labile p measurements all showed very high concentrations vertically in sites zs1 zs3 and zs10 from zhushan bay however higher dgt labile p concentrations were distributed randomly either at 6 mm or at 8 mm in sediment from meiliang bay and yueliang bay this phenomena was assumed to be the iron plaque or organic matter distribution heterogenicity in sediment chen et al 2018 the decomposition of organic matter and the reduction of iron bound p in summer could cause such distribution pattern these results confirmed that sediment mobile p shows a high heterogenicity vertically even within a small area of sediment the 1d distribution of labile p was determined based on average horizontal concentrations at each depth as shown in fig s3 the sediment 1d labile p profiles were consistent with the 2d dgt measured results in most of the sampling sites the concentrations of dgt labile p increased with sediment depth peaked at 20 60 mm and then decreased with sediment depth these trends were mostly observed in algal dominated zones zhushan bay meiliang bay and westcoast area the results of this study also indicated that p in the upper 6 cm or 8 cm sediment layer in the algal dominated zone had the most reactivity in contrast some sites showed small changes along sediment profiles and these sites were mainly distributed in grass dominated zones lake center eastern lake taihu and the east area this was mostly due to the low p reactivity in the sediment of the grass dominated area the heterogenicity p distribution has also been observed in previous studies and was the results of small scale chemical and microbial processes involved p cycling in sediment chen et al 2018 3 4 microbial community in surface sediment the bacterial community diversity in the surface sediment from the 53 sampling sites are listed in table s2 and the average value of different zones are presented in table 2 the results indicate that the sequencing depth of each site was enough because the coverage of the samples were more than 94 which means that most of the bacterial otus in each sample were determined the bacterial diversity of the sediment shows large spatial variation in all of lake taihu the bacterial diversity indexes such as chao l and shannon in the sediment of grass dominated zones east lake taihu and the east area were higher than those for the sediment in the algal dominated zone zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay p 0 05 in contrast the value of simpson s diversity index shows the converse distribution in algal and grass dominated zones the results were consistent with previous studies and the higher bacteria diversity in the sediment of the grass dominated zone were due to the oxygenation environment caused by the macrophyte roots huang et al 2020 this subsequently induced a more diverse and organize into more interconnected co occurrence networks among the bacteria in the grass dominated zone huang et al 2020 the relative abundance of various bacterial taxa at the phylum level in surface sediments from each phylum is listed in table s3 and the average values in different zones are presented in fig 6 the most dominant phyla were proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes nitrospirae chloroflexi acidobacteria while other bacteria such as verrucomicrobia are also presented in fig 6 the remaining bacteria only accounted for around 10 of the total bacteria community the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied between 31 and 43 in the nine studied zones the results indicate that the relative abundance of proteobacteria in zhushan bay was significantly higher than that in other areas p 0 01 the possible relationship between sediment bacterial communities and different p forms or tp and srp fluxes were analyzed using the method of representational difference analysis rda a positive close relationship was found between proteobacteria and the fraction of ca p in sediment fig 6 as confirmed in previous studies the bacteria of proteobacteria is the common phylum of phosphorus accumulating bacteria pseudomonas erythrocyte acinetobacter aeromonas which play an important role in sediment p immobilization lópez vázquez et al 2007 the results of the present study confirmed the above results this is because very high relative abundance of proteobacteria and the percentage of ca p to tp was simultaneously founded in the sediment of the grass dominated zone submerged plants seem to favor the growth of proteobacteria in sediment a positive relationship was found between the abundance of firmicutes and the mobile fractions of p l p fe p and org p and p fluxes tp and srp previous study indicates that the abundance of firmicutes in sediments is relative to the eutrophication degree zhou et al 2021 the abundance of firmicutes is positively correlated with eutrophication and a relatively high abundance of firmicutes was found in the algal dominated zones of zhushan bay meiliang bay and yueliang bay a high degree of eutrophication and sediment pollution favored the growth of firmicutes in sediment which was confirmed in this study 3 5 possible role of sediment internal p loading in lake taihu sediment internal p loading can continuously deteriorate overlying water quality even though the external p pollution has been controlled effectively an internal p load does not add more p to lake instead it repeatedly recycles the past stored p in sediment to water and thus expands its influence in the lake ecosystem anderson et al 2021 at present the qualitative contribution of internal p loads to the overlying water tp concentration and the bloom of algal in lake taihu is still questioned another question is the time of the internal p loads that can affect algal bloom in lake taihu during the seasonal source sink conversion of sediment it is generally recognized that sediment internal p loading has the most effect on p concentration in overlying water in warmer seasons the results of this study indicate that sediment internal p loading and the p fractions show contrasting difference in grass and algal dominated zone the algal dominated zone contains a higher mobile p content than the grass dominated zone results also indicate that the tp and srp fluxes were positively correlated with the content of surface sediment mobile p higher internal effects were observed in algal dominated zones such as zhushan bay meiliang bay yueliang bay gonghu bay and the westcoast area therefore sediment internal p in these areas would lead to high concentrations of overlying water p and algal bloom however the external p pollution from the northern bay and the westcoast areas are still high and have not been completely controlled in recent years a combination of external and internal p pollution can lead to high p concentration in overlying water and algal bloom although the results suggested a high tp flux in the grass dominated zone such as the eastern lake taihu the sediment s internal p loading would be diminished or reduced largely by the submerged plant the released p can be used or adsorbed by leaf of the plants and be returned to sediment rapidly the rapid returning of p into sediments in the grass dominated zone are not favorable for the development of algal in this area this is consistent with the water quality in this area which is significantly lower than the average p concentration in lake taihu however the released p from the sediment of the algal dominated zone will be used by algae or will induce the continuous blooms of algae another finding of this study is that the grass dominated zone contains a higher percentage of ca p to tp in sediment than that of the ratio of ca p to tp in the sediment of algal dominated zone the submerged plant seems to have the ability to transform sediment mobile p into inert ca p thereby reducing the srp release potential in sediment therefore restoration of aquatic plants in areas where applicable would be favorable for the management of sediment internal p loads in lake taihu in contrast high percentage of mobile p to tp was found in sediment of the algal dominated zone than that of in the glass dominated zone with the increasing of external p input the content or proportion of mobile p will also increase further worsening the water quality in the algal dominated zone sediment microbial activity seems to play a different role in recycling different p forms in algal and grass dominated zones they would probably accelerate the decomposition of the mobile p in algal dominated sediment on the other hand bacteria can retain more inert p in the sediment of grass dominated zones therefore more attention should be given to the internal p loads in the sediment of algal dominated zones 4 conclusions in this study a detailed investigation was carried out to study the sediment internal p loads in lake taihu both tp and p fractions showed very high spatial heterogenicity in different areas of lake taihu exhibiting higher contents in the algal dominated zone than in grass dominated zones the percentage of mobile p to tp was also higher in the sediment of the algal dominated zone than that in the sediment of grass dominated zone conversely higher percentages of ca p were found in the sediment of grass dominated zones the coverage of submerged plants appeared to be capable of transforming sediment mobile p to inert forms of ca p which decreased sediment internal p loads the high p flux rate and p hotspot area were also found in algal dominated zones due to the high mobile p contained in these sediments the estimated tp and srp released from lake taihu was around 256 tons and 217 tons respectively in a period of six months accounting for 12 8 and 10 9 of external p loads analysis of the bacteria community indicates that the algal dominated zone mainly possesses the firmicutes bacteria which positively correlates with mobile fractions of p in sediment comparatively proteobacteria proved to be the dominating bacteria in the sediment of grass dominated areas which shows a positive relationship with the inert form of ca p overall the results show contrasting internal p loads from the algal and grass dominated zones suggesting the importance

15438,lake taihu suffers from severe algal blooms every year which is attributed primarily to the release of sediment phosphorus p namely the internal p loading however the overall internal p loading and the p hotspots in sediment have not been fully studied this paper presents several methods including sequential p extraction the use of diffusive gradient in thin film dgt and intact core incubation to give a detailed investigation of sediment internal p loading as well as its roles in algal dominated zones adzs and grass dominated zones gdzs in lake taihu sediment microbial composition was also analyzed to investigate its relationship with p fractions the results indicate that the total p and the mobile p fraction in the adz sediments are generally higher than those of the gdz sediments the percentage of sediment mobile p to tp is similar to the mobile p in their distributions in contrast calcium bound p accounts for most of the tp in gdz while mobile p contributes the most to tp in adz overall sediment can release 256 tons of tp and 217 tons of soluble reactive phosphorus srp over a period of six months in the warmer seasons similarly a high concentration of dgt measured p was observed in adzs that are recognized as p hotspots in lake taihu sediments in adz and gdz was dominated by the bacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria respectively and which were closely related with mobile p and calcium bound p in sediment respectively gzd seems to be able to retain more p in sediments thereby reducing its contribution to of internal p loading these results indicate that the difference in sediment composition between adz and gdz affects their roles in sediment internal p loading therefore different management strategies should be used to combat sediment internal p loads in the two zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords algal and grass dominated zone sediment internal p loading sediment flux mobile p p hotspot area in sediment data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limiting nutrient that supports primary production in freshwater ecosystems schindler et al 2016 therefore it is important to understand p biogeochemistry in wetlands lakes and rivers it was found that more than 50 of external p loading can be retained in lake sediment carey and rydin 2011 and sediment stored p also called internal p loading is responsible for the continuous lake eutrophication søndergaard et al 2003 eutrophication supported by internal p loading can last decades even after the external p loading being effectively controlled this is because p can continue to be released from sediment under favorable conditions anoxic sediment resuspension or oxidation reduction thereby supplementing the overlying water p wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 sediment internal p can be adsorbed by iron and manganese oxides clay minerals and fine sediment particles heinrich et al 2021 markovic et al 2019 sediment p presents in different forms many of which are labile and not entirely buried in sediment markovic et al 2019 traditionally the total p tp in sediment can be operationally classified into six forms including loosely adsorbed p iron bound p organic p al bound p calcium bound p and residual p using the sequential p extraction procedures rydin et al 2017 tammeorg et al 2020 other p extraction procedures have been developed to better understand p biogeochemistry in sediment zhu et al 2013 these operationally defined p forms and have been widely used to understand p biogeochemistry in lakes barik et al 2019 gikuma njuru et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 the sum of the three forms of p including loosely sorbed p iron bound p and organic phosphorus in sediment are referred to as potential mobile p hupfer et al 2019 mobile p can be released into sediment porewater and overlying water consequently making it a p source for algal while other inert forms of p al p or ca p would be minor contribution to the p fluxes from sediment markovic et al 2019 in surface sediments microorganisms degrade the bioavailable organic matter and consume electron donors such oxygen and nitrate gibbons and bridgeman 2020 this process will release phosphate and the loosely adsorbed phosphorus wang et al 2022 the anoxic condition caused by degradation of organic matter in surface sediment will also reduce ferric iron hydro oxides which leads to the release of iron bound phosphorus anderson et al 2021 high concentrations of p in sediment porewater can lead to p release into overlying water due to the strong chemical gradient or sediment resuspension which is especially evident in shallow lakes ding et al 2018 therefore higher sediment mobile p would be associated with more intensive p flux especially during high temperature seasons such as summer and autumn gibbons and bridgeman 2020 yao et al 2021 sediment with high p mobility and flux are considered areas of p hotspot that can lead to severe eutrophication p sequential extractions diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and intact sediment core incubation were three techniques frequently used to assess sediment p mobility and hotspots in lake sediment ding et al 2015 rydin et al 2017 sequential extraction can measure potential mobile p and dgt can measure its two dimensional 2d vertical distribution these techniques have been widely used to investigate the effects of bioturbation inactivation and submerged plant rhizospheres on the p vertical distribution in sediment hupfer et al 2019 li et al 2019 p fluxes across the sediment water interface can be calculated by monitoring the changes in nutrient concentrations in the overlying water over a certain period of core incubation which can reflect the sediment internal p loads james 2017b these methods combined can help to understand p biogeochemistry in lakes larson et al 2020 assisting in the management of sediment internal p loading large eutrophic lakes with surface water areas of hundreds to thousands of square kilometer contain large areas of sediment beds within a lake the physical and chemical characteristics of sediment in different areas can vary greatly due to the heterogeneous nature of sedimentology pollutant history and hydrodynamic processes zhu et al 2013 this also leads to heterogeneous sediment p biogeochemistry including p forms fluxes and related microbial activities making the management of internal p loads more difficult hence it is necessary to carried out detail investigations of p biogeochemistry in the sediment of large lakes in this study we carried out a detailed survey of sediment p chemistry in different areas of the large eutrophic lake taihu in china our objective was to gain a better understanding of lake taihu s sediment internal p loads by studying sediment p forms and fluxes we also analyzed the microbial community in surface sediment this is the first time such a detailed investigation has been carried out on lake taihu s sediment internal p loads the main tasks of this study are to 1 understand the distributions of various p fractions in the surface sediment 2 quantify sediment p fluxes in the p hotspot areas in lake taihu 3 elucidate the relationship between microbial community and p fractions in surface sediment and 4 understand the role of sediment in internal p loads in lake taihu 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description lake taihu 30 5 32 8 n and 119 8 121 55 e is the third largest freshwater lake in china it is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and has a surface area of 2338 km2 the average water depth of lake taihu is 2 0 m which classifies it a shallow eutrophic freshwater lake the taihu watershed is one of the most developed areas in china and populated by about 60 million people with the rapid development of economic and urbanization since the 1980s huge external pollution has been discharged into lake taihu without treatment nowadays the lake experiences severe eutrophication and algal blooms each year especially in warmer seasons although huge efforts have been made to reduce the input of external phosphorus loading lake taihu still suffers from heavy algal blooms each year internal p loading from sediments is considered one of the main reasons for the continuous algal bloom xu et al 2021 at present lake taihu is mainly characterized by two ecological types algal dominated zones adz and grass dominated zone gdzs which are categorized spatially according to the distribution domain of algal and submerged plants generally zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay yueliang bay the west coast area and the south area can be considered adz while eastern lake taihu and the east area are the gdz table s1 and fig s1 the planned sampling sites were distributed into the nine regions which are described in detail in the following section 2 2 sediment collection and handling to give a detailed investigation of the sediment internal p loads in different areas of lake taihu we collected sediment cores no less than 50 cm long from lake taihu using a core sampler 8 8 cm in diameter and 60 cm in length during august 2020 fig 1 in total 53 sampling sites were selected covering a range of water depths and four sediment cores were collected from each site these sediment cores were kept upright and transported to the laboratory within 4 h after collection and then stored in the dark approximately 5 l of water was collected from each sampling site for the experiments the surface sediment 0 10 cm was sliced and homogenized some parts of the sediment were freeze dried for p fraction analysis in this study only the sediment in the surface layer 0 10 cm was used for p fraction analysis because 0 10 cm of the sediment contribute to 60 80 of the p released from the sediment and is the most important in terms of internal p loading wang et al 2021 2 3 sediment core incubation and flux calculation in this study 32 sampling sites were selected to measure the total phosphorus tp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp fluxes across sediment water interface in all of lake taihu fig 1 the nutrient fluxes across the sediment water interface were measured using the static release method which has been adopted by many researchers for sediment nutrient flux measurement larson et al 2020 liu et al 2016 in brief the sediment cores were drained to deplete the overlying water and cut down to 20 cm only the upper 20 cm were kept then filtered lake water about 1000 ml was siphoned onto the sediment to serve as overlying water this process was carefully conducted to avoid disturbing the sediment surface these sediment cores three replicates at each site were incubated at 25 2 c for 72 h in the dark the temperature was kept at an average lake bottom temperature simulating the conditions from may to october in lake taihu anaerobic conditions are seldom observed in lake taihu water therefore the overlying water was gently aerated to avoid the formation of anaerobic conditions fifty milliliter 50 ml water samples were collected from the middle of the water column at the following time intervals 0 6 12 24 36 48 60 and 72 h in situ lake water was added to the column immediately after sampling to maintain the water volume the release rates of tp and srp were calculated as 1 f n v c n c 0 j 1 n v j 1 c j 1 c i s t where f n is the nutrient flux on the nth day mg m 2 d 1 and c 0 is the initial nutrient concentration mg l 1 v and v j represent the volume of overlying water and sampling water l respectively c n and c j 1 are the nutrient concentration mg l 1 on the nth and j 1th sampling day respectively c i is the nutrient concentration of the replenished water mg l 1 s is the cross sectional area of the column m2 and t is the incubation time d the tp value and the srp flux for each site was averaged for 36 to 72 h 2 4 dgt measurement to investigate the p hotspot area in the lake taihu sediment the commercial zr oxide diffusive gradients in thin films zr oxide dgt probes zhongke zhigan nanjing environmental technology ltd nanjing china were used to measure the 2d labile p for sediment cores from 32 sampling sites after the collected sediment cores arrived at the laboratory the dgt probes were inserted vertically into the sediment cores and retrieved after 24 h after retrieval the sediment water interface swi was marked immediately the dgt probe surfaces were rinsed several times by deionized water to remove sediment particles before analysis means of obtaining the high resolution 2d labile p images and the testing protocol can be found in ding et al 2015 2 5 analysis phosphorus fractions in the surface sediment were determined using the sequential extraction method developed by rydin 2000 and described in the supplementary material in brief sediment p was fractioned using nh4cl p l p bd p fe p naoh nrp org p naoh rp al p hcl p ca p and residual p res p the p concentration in each step was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method and reported as an average of the two duplicate analyses the total phosphorus tp in sediment was estimated as the sum of the six p fractions and the mobile p was the sum of loosely sorbed p fe p and org p fractions the benthic microbial community composition in surface sediment was analyzed from the 53 sampling sites in brief around 1 0 g fresh sediment from each site was used for dna extraction using a soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions and then sequenced on an illumina miseq platform personal biotechnology company shanghai china detailed information on sequencing and data analysis is provided in the supplementary material 2 6 statistical analysis significant differences in variables tp content p fractions p flux and microbial community were identified among the different areas of lake taihu through one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test homogeneity of variance for the obtained data was tested and data of the test values 0 05 were adopted for anova analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics 19 0 ibm armonk new york usa with significant p levels p 0 05 and p 0 01 reported correlations between bacteria community structure phylum level and sediment p fractions were explored with linear model based redundancy analysis rda using the software canoco for windows ver 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of p fractions in surface sediment the tp content in surface sediment 0 10 cm was in the range of 332 to 1462 mg kg with an average value of 613 287 mg kg fig s2 n 53 which fell within the ranges reported by previous studies liu et al 2013 zhu et al 2013 zhu reported that the average tp content in surface sediment 0 3 cm of lake taihu was 496 mg kg based on a sampling taken in august 2010 zhu et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge the number of sampling sites in this study was more than previously reported among the six p fractions l p fe p org p al p ca p and res p analyzed in this study the l p fraction had the lowest value 0 42 8 16 mg kg and a mean value of 2 07 mg kg which only accounts for 0 11 to 0 98 of tp in sediment representing an average 0 3 in many previously reported studies the l p fraction was generally found to be the lowest fraction among all of the p fractions extracted and accounted for with 5 tp in most of the lake sediment investigated wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2013 although l p has a low content in most lake sediment it has the greatest bioavailability among the six p fractions and can be easily released and used by algae the content of naoh nrp org p ranked the second lowest p fraction in sediment was in the range of 10 6 to 233 mg kg with a mean value of 37 mg kg org p accounted for 1 40 16 8 average 5 4 of the tp in this study meanwhile fe p ranged from 51 to 585 mg kg with a mean value of 147 mg kg in this study accounting for an average of 22 of the tp the sum of l p org p and fe p called mobile p represent the three forms of p fractions that contributed most to the internal p loads this is because the mobile p can be become bioavailable to algal under suitable conditions such as the anoxic condition or during the degradation of organic matter rydin et al 2017 the content of sediment mobile p accounted for 15 46 of tp average 27 with concentrations ranging between 68 4 and 638 mg kg average 181 mg kg compared with other eutrophic lakes in the world the mobile p content in lake taihu s surface sediment was not very high in comparison the average mobile p in the surface sediment 0 5 cm of lake chaohu was 205 mg kg yang et al 2022 in lake dianchi s surface sediment 0 10 cm the mobile p content accounted for 242 mg kg li et al 2015 both lake chaohu and lake dianchi are large eutrophic lakes in china one fraction of the mobile p org p was found to reach as high as around 500 mg kg in lake chilika which is asia s largest brackish water lake barik et al 2019 the three p fractions naoh rp al p hcl p ca p and res p were stable in lake sediment and were not accessible to algal the al p fraction ranged between 43 mg kg and 539 mg kg with a mean value of 175 mg kg which accounted for 26 of the tp in sediment these results were consistent with other studies verifying that the al p content normally accounted for most of the tp in sediment wang et al 2021 although al p was thought to be an inert p fraction in sediment research indicated that the dissolution of al p would happen under alkaline conditions ph 9 especially during the heavy algal bloom seasons huser et al 2016 high ph values 10 in overlying water during lake taihu s algal bloom season has been observed which could cause the al p in suspended sediment to become bioavailable to the lake s phytoplankton fang et al 2018 however more work is needed to confirm this hypothesis the ca p ranged between 116 and 338 mg kg accounting for 9 8 66 of the tp in sediments while res p ranged between 32 and 118 mg kg accounting for 5 9 14 of the sediment tp of lake taihu normally the two inert p fractions would not be bioavailable to algal and often become buried in sediment permanently spatially the composition of p fractions and their content varied largely across lake taihu on average the mobile p fractions l p fe p and org p were the highest in zhushan bay followed by westcoast area and then in meiliang bay it was reported that about of 50 approx 1000 t of external p pollution in lake taihu comes from zhushan bay and the westcoast area each year and most of that p is stored in the sediment another reason is that these areas are also algal dominated zones and the settlement of organic matter produced in the water column algal detritus with high content of n and p will naturally increase the concentration of n and p in the surface sediments of these areas in contrast the p fractions l p fe p and org p were generally lower in the central east area and eastern lake taihu the east area and eastern lake taihu are grass macrophyte dominated areas which can lead to fe and mn oxidation around rhizosphere sediment causing the subsequent elevation of p absorption in the sediment thereby slowing the release of p and increasing the sediment s p retention zhao et al 2021 the assimilation of p by the submerged water plants could reduce the content of sediment mobile p li et al 2021 in addition these zones also received little or no external p pollution similar to the distribution pattern of sediment mobile p the naoh nrp al p ca p and res p are also concentrated in zhushan bay however no evident distribution pattern was found in the other studied areas the percentage of p fractions to sediment tp suggests a very interesting distribution pattern the highest percentage of mobile p to tp in sediment was observed in zhushan bay with a mean value of 38 4 followed by meiliang bay and then the westcoast area in contrast mobile p only accounted for 20 of the tp in lake center these results indicate that the higher the pollution is in sediment the higher the percentage of sediment mobile p is with regard to the percentage of ca p to tp in sediment the highest average value was observed in the grass dominated zones of eastern lake taihu with an average of 49 4 followed by lake center averaging 42 7 and then the east area averaging 38 9 the lowest value of sediment mobile p to tp was observed in zhushan bay averaging 18 6 these results indicate that sediment p in the algal dominated areas have high mobile potential while the submerged plants grass dominated areas seemed to have retained more inert p in sediment these results are consistent with previous studies which indicate that submerged plants have the ability to transform sediment mobile p especially fe p to inert p fractions such as ca p and res p li et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 higher concentration of calcium ions were found in the sediment porewater of the macrophyte dominated zones also known as the grass dominated zones which react with phosphate to form ca p precipitation zhao et al 2021 this benefits the management of sediment internal p and helps reduce the fluxes accordingly therefore the restoration of submerged plants is strongly recommended as an effective tool to control sediment internal p in eutrophic lakes such as lake taihu fig 2 3 2 phosphorus fluxes across sediment water interface and amount of p released from sediment in warmer seasons total p and srp fluxes from sediment are presented in fig 3 the results indicate similar patterns of tp and srp fluxes in lake taihu tp fluxes range from 4 56 to 25 2 mg m2 d with an average value of 2 65 mg m2 d the sampling sites with higher tp flux are concentrated in zhushan bay 9 65 mg m2 d yueliang bay 7 09 mg m2 d and eastern lake taihu 4 83 mg m2 d table 1 on average the highest tp flux was found in zhushan bay followed by yueliang bay the third highest amount of tp flux was found in the sediment of eastern lake taihu this is consistent with previous results and the higher p fluxes in zhushan bay and yueliang bay were mainly due to the heavy pollution suffered in the past decades xu et al 2021 however it was surprising that sediment in eastern lake taihu has a relatively high tp flux value as discussed above eastern lake taihu is a grass dominated zone and sediment in this area tend to retain more p the low release of sediment srp flux in east taihu would probably confirm the above hypothesis results indicate that sediment in eastern lake taihu has a higher org p content in comparison to other studied area therefore the release of organic p would contribute most to tp release however further study should be done to test this hypothesis fig 4 the srp flux ranged from 4 53 to 21 8 mg m2 d with an average value of 1 61 mg m2 d in the sediment of lake taihu the srp flux is higher than that of srp flux in the sediment found in the lake of the woods around 0 4 mg m2 d at this stage the sediment in the lake of the woods was incubated in an aerobic condition at 20 c james 2017b however the srp flux in this study is comparable to the srp flux in the lake erie sediment under oxic condition 0 71 1 90 mg m2 d gibbons and bridgeman 2020 both oxygen and temperature can substantially affect srp flux from sediment anderson et al 2021 when anoxic condition was formed near sediment water interface during warmer seasons then high srp flux would be observed yang et al 2020 however we only investigate the srp flux at oxic condition in lake taihu this is because lake taihu is a shallow eutrophic lake and oxygen concentration in overlying water is normally high occasionally the anoxic condition could be formed in some area of lake taihu therefore the srp flux in this study would be a conservative estimate the highest value srp flux rate was observed in zhushan bay followed by yueliang bay this is because higher mobile p contents were found in these areas the srp flux was positively correlated with surface sediment mobile p p 0 01 in this study fig s2 consistent with previous study in a different lake james 2017a mobile p can be released into the overlying water to sustain tp concentrations in the water column via redox reduction and decomposition of organic matter by microbial activity in contrast the grass dominated zones have relatively lower srp fluxes due to the assimilation of p by plants and the high p sorption capacity in the rhizospheres in the sediment normally sediment p will exert an internal effect in seasons with high temperatures that means that sediment internal p will be released into overlying water in summer or autumn when the lake bottom water temperature is warmer this phenomenon has been observed in many temperature monitored eutrophic lakes gibbons and bridgeman 2020 the continuous release of sediment p will sustain a high p concentration in overlying water thereby sustaining the continuous bloom of algal the overlying water temperature of lake taihu fluctuates largely during the seasonal variations it is reported that the days of overlying water with an average of 25 c has around 170 days each year and the sediment internal effect was strong during this period fan et al 2004 we therefore estimated the amount of p released from sediment from this period and the results were listed in table 1 around 256 tons of tp and 217 tons of srp could be released into overlying water as estimated in half of a year it was estimated that about 2000 tons of external p can enter lake taihu each year and about half of the external p is retained xu et al 2021 therefore the amount of tp and srp released from sediment accounted for 12 8 and 10 9 of the external p loading respectively the released p would be quickly used by algal and sustain the bloom area of lake taihu while algal bloom can pump more p from sediment according to the theory of pumping theory found in previous study xie et al 2003 therefore the role of sediment internal p loads would be far more than we expected 3 3 sediment hotspot phosphorus areas identified by the measurement of 2d dgt the sediment labile p measured by 2d dgt is presented in fig 5 and the hotspot area can be visually observed the concentrations of 2d dgt measured labile p shows a high heterogeneity both laterally and vertically on average the highest concentration of dgt labile p was found in zhushan bay with the second highest in meiliang bay and the third highest was in the westcoast area while the concentration of dgt labile p was generally lower in eastern lake taihu lake center and the southwestern area these dgt distribution pattern in the sediment of lake taihu were consistent with previous studies ding et al 2015 however the measured average dgt labile p concentration was a lot higher than the dgt labile p concentration recorded in previous findings ding et al 2015 this is probably because the dgt labile p measured in this study was at the hottest time of the year august when the sediment received more p deposition from the water column and had highest reactivity generally the distribution pattern of dgt measured labile p was consistent with distributions of sediment mobile p and p flux the dgt measured p was a reflection of the diffusion ability of sediment mobile p to porewater and can also be expressed as the release potential of sediment mobile p to water almeida et al 2019 therefore the high sediment mobile p release can be compared to the high dgt measured labile p due to its consistency with the distribution characteristics of sediment mobile p and p flux vertically the dgt measured labile p also shows different distribution patterns among the sampling sites fig 5 notably dgt labile p measurements all showed very high concentrations vertically in sites zs1 zs3 and zs10 from zhushan bay however higher dgt labile p concentrations were distributed randomly either at 6 mm or at 8 mm in sediment from meiliang bay and yueliang bay this phenomena was assumed to be the iron plaque or organic matter distribution heterogenicity in sediment chen et al 2018 the decomposition of organic matter and the reduction of iron bound p in summer could cause such distribution pattern these results confirmed that sediment mobile p shows a high heterogenicity vertically even within a small area of sediment the 1d distribution of labile p was determined based on average horizontal concentrations at each depth as shown in fig s3 the sediment 1d labile p profiles were consistent with the 2d dgt measured results in most of the sampling sites the concentrations of dgt labile p increased with sediment depth peaked at 20 60 mm and then decreased with sediment depth these trends were mostly observed in algal dominated zones zhushan bay meiliang bay and westcoast area the results of this study also indicated that p in the upper 6 cm or 8 cm sediment layer in the algal dominated zone had the most reactivity in contrast some sites showed small changes along sediment profiles and these sites were mainly distributed in grass dominated zones lake center eastern lake taihu and the east area this was mostly due to the low p reactivity in the sediment of the grass dominated area the heterogenicity p distribution has also been observed in previous studies and was the results of small scale chemical and microbial processes involved p cycling in sediment chen et al 2018 3 4 microbial community in surface sediment the bacterial community diversity in the surface sediment from the 53 sampling sites are listed in table s2 and the average value of different zones are presented in table 2 the results indicate that the sequencing depth of each site was enough because the coverage of the samples were more than 94 which means that most of the bacterial otus in each sample were determined the bacterial diversity of the sediment shows large spatial variation in all of lake taihu the bacterial diversity indexes such as chao l and shannon in the sediment of grass dominated zones east lake taihu and the east area were higher than those for the sediment in the algal dominated zone zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay p 0 05 in contrast the value of simpson s diversity index shows the converse distribution in algal and grass dominated zones the results were consistent with previous studies and the higher bacteria diversity in the sediment of the grass dominated zone were due to the oxygenation environment caused by the macrophyte roots huang et al 2020 this subsequently induced a more diverse and organize into more interconnected co occurrence networks among the bacteria in the grass dominated zone huang et al 2020 the relative abundance of various bacterial taxa at the phylum level in surface sediments from each phylum is listed in table s3 and the average values in different zones are presented in fig 6 the most dominant phyla were proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes nitrospirae chloroflexi acidobacteria while other bacteria such as verrucomicrobia are also presented in fig 6 the remaining bacteria only accounted for around 10 of the total bacteria community the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied between 31 and 43 in the nine studied zones the results indicate that the relative abundance of proteobacteria in zhushan bay was significantly higher than that in other areas p 0 01 the possible relationship between sediment bacterial communities and different p forms or tp and srp fluxes were analyzed using the method of representational difference analysis rda a positive close relationship was found between proteobacteria and the fraction of ca p in sediment fig 6 as confirmed in previous studies the bacteria of proteobacteria is the common phylum of phosphorus accumulating bacteria pseudomonas erythrocyte acinetobacter aeromonas which play an important role in sediment p immobilization lópez vázquez et al 2007 the results of the present study confirmed the above results this is because very high relative abundance of proteobacteria and the percentage of ca p to tp was simultaneously founded in the sediment of the grass dominated zone submerged plants seem to favor the growth of proteobacteria in sediment a positive relationship was found between the abundance of firmicutes and the mobile fractions of p l p fe p and org p and p fluxes tp and srp previous study indicates that the abundance of firmicutes in sediments is relative to the eutrophication degree zhou et al 2021 the abundance of firmicutes is positively correlated with eutrophication and a relatively high abundance of firmicutes was found in the algal dominated zones of zhushan bay meiliang bay and yueliang bay a high degree of eutrophication and sediment pollution favored the growth of firmicutes in sediment which was confirmed in this study 3 5 possible role of sediment internal p loading in lake taihu sediment internal p loading can continuously deteriorate overlying water quality even though the external p pollution has been controlled effectively an internal p load does not add more p to lake instead it repeatedly recycles the past stored p in sediment to water and thus expands its influence in the lake ecosystem anderson et al 2021 at present the qualitative contribution of internal p loads to the overlying water tp concentration and the bloom of algal in lake taihu is still questioned another question is the time of the internal p loads that can affect algal bloom in lake taihu during the seasonal source sink conversion of sediment it is generally recognized that sediment internal p loading has the most effect on p concentration in overlying water in warmer seasons the results of this study indicate that sediment internal p loading and the p fractions show contrasting difference in grass and algal dominated zone the algal dominated zone contains a higher mobile p content than the grass dominated zone results also indicate that the tp and srp fluxes were positively correlated with the content of surface sediment mobile p higher internal effects were observed in algal dominated zones such as zhushan bay meiliang bay yueliang bay gonghu bay and the westcoast area therefore sediment internal p in these areas would lead to high concentrations of overlying water p and algal bloom however the external p pollution from the northern bay and the westcoast areas are still high and have not been completely controlled in recent years a combination of external and internal p pollution can lead to high p concentration in overlying water and algal bloom although the results suggested a high tp flux in the grass dominated zone such as the eastern lake taihu the sediment s internal p loading would be diminished or reduced largely by the submerged plant the released p can be used or adsorbed by leaf of the plants and be returned to sediment rapidly the rapid returning of p into sediments in the grass dominated zone are not favorable for the development of algal in this area this is consistent with the water quality in this area which is significantly lower than the average p concentration in lake taihu however the released p from the sediment of the algal dominated zone will be used by algae or will induce the continuous blooms of algae another finding of this study is that the grass dominated zone contains a higher percentage of ca p to tp in sediment than that of the ratio of ca p to tp in the sediment of algal dominated zone the submerged plant seems to have the ability to transform sediment mobile p into inert ca p thereby reducing the srp release potential in sediment therefore restoration of aquatic plants in areas where applicable would be favorable for the management of sediment internal p loads in lake taihu in contrast high percentage of mobile p to tp was found in sediment of the algal dominated zone than that of in the glass dominated zone with the increasing of external p input the content or proportion of mobile p will also increase further worsening the water quality in the algal dominated zone sediment microbial activity seems to play a different role in recycling different p forms in algal and grass dominated zones they would probably accelerate the decomposition of the mobile p in algal dominated sediment on the other hand bacteria can retain more inert p in the sediment of grass dominated zones therefore more attention should be given to the internal p loads in the sediment of algal dominated zones 4 conclusions in this study a detailed investigation was carried out to study the sediment internal p loads in lake taihu both tp and p fractions showed very high spatial heterogenicity in different areas of lake taihu exhibiting higher contents in the algal dominated zone than in grass dominated zones the percentage of mobile p to tp was also higher in the sediment of the algal dominated zone than that in the sediment of grass dominated zone conversely higher percentages of ca p were found in the sediment of grass dominated zones the coverage of submerged plants appeared to be capable of transforming sediment mobile p to inert forms of ca p which decreased sediment internal p loads the high p flux rate and p hotspot area were also found in algal dominated zones due to the high mobile p contained in these sediments the estimated tp and srp released from lake taihu was around 256 tons and 217 tons respectively in a period of six months accounting for 12 8 and 10 9 of external p loads analysis of the bacteria community indicates that the algal dominated zone mainly possesses the firmicutes bacteria which positively correlates with mobile fractions of p in sediment comparatively proteobacteria proved to be the dominating bacteria in the sediment of grass dominated areas which shows a positive relationship with the inert form of ca p overall the results show contrasting internal p loads from the algal and grass dominated zones suggesting the importance

15439,reactive oxygen species ros are omnipresent in natural aquatic environments and play an important role in biogeochemical cycles one of the dominant sources of ros in surface waters was thought to be from dissolved organic matter dom interacting with photochemical process the properties of dom were different between the flood and drought periods in lakes yet information on how these variations influence ros photoproduction is unknown through a three year study the photochemical properties of dom and the resultant ros photoproduction between the flood and drought period were determined in the largest freshwater lake in china lake poyang results found that quantum yield coefficients of excited triplets 3cdom apparent quantum yields of singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh were holistically higher in the flood period than those in the drought period the optical properties of dom showed that dom in the flood period featured an allochthonous input accompanied by higher molecular size e2 e3 aromatic content suva254 humification degree hix while dom in the drought period was mainly internal input fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fi icr ms further revealed that some refractory components such as lignin like and carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram presented higher abundance in the flood period and played the positive impacts on ros production orthogonal partial least squares opls were used to build novel multivariate predictive models for indicating the spatio temporal ros production also the relatively higher steady state concentrations of 3cdom and 1o2 in the flood period could significantly diminish the half lives of acetochlor considering the photochemical activity of dom varied considerably at different periods this study provided a new method to predict ros production and contributed to a new insight into stage specific emerging contaminants removing in natural aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive oxygen species dissolved organic matter photoproduction quantum yields contaminant lake data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction reactive oxygen species ros including the excited triplets 3cdom singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide o2 were intermediates formed during the sequential one electron reduction of o2 to h2o in most oxic natural waters morris et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 ros performed crucial roles in the degradation and transformation of organic pollutants and refractory organic matters in aquatic environment fujii et al 2017 song et al 2020 they also reacted with trace elements in water such as iron chromium copper and manganese thereby affecting the chemical behavior and bioavailability of trace elements morris et al 2022 among them oh 1o2 and 3cdom are of prime importance for their contribution to organic fate in sunlit aquifers al housari et al 2010 in natural aquatic environments the dominant source of ros in surface waters was thought to be from dissolved organic matter dom interacting with photochemical process mccabe et al 2016 and 2018 in fact the dominant light absorber was the chromophoric fraction of dom cdom zafiriou et al 1984 cdom was the only source of 3cdom and 1o2 and it was an important oh source as well glover and rosario ortiz 2013 cdom could absorb photons and enter an excited triplet state capable of reducing o2 to o2 which could then undergo spontaneous dismutation to h2o2 and o2 the light absorbing properties of dom depended on its sources and chemical composition lin and guo 2020 allochthonous and the terrestrially derived organic matter had been found to contain higher molecular weights and have more aromatic moieties than autochthonous xenopoulos et al 2021 but microbially derived organic matter was enriched in nitrogen and sulfur content but was lower in molecular weight distribution guerard et al 2009 many studies had also sought to link photochemical characteristics and physicochemical properties with different types of dom isolates single dom components such as humic acids del vecchio et al 2017 fulvic acids fujii and otani 2017 amino acids amado et al 2015 and lignin phenols benner and kaiser 2011 had been previously explored for the photochemical mineralization of dom the photochemical potential was widely linked with the physicochemical properties of doms with different origins or types de laurentiis et al 2013 maizel et al 2017 peterson et al 2012 actually the complex composition of dom in aquatic environments was mainly attributed to the sensitivity to local hydrogeochemical variations ejarque et al 2018 periodical variations in water depth were associated with alternative flood and drought periods which could directly alter the dom photochemical reaction dynamics and associated conversion pathways koehler et al 2018 vione et al 2014 it was found that dom inputs derived primarily from groundwater had a more protin like biolabile composition during the drought conditions fasching et al 2016 while higher concentration and export of nutrients and c rich dom with higher molecular weight and more aromatic dom properties had frequently been observed during the high flow flood events wilson et al 2016 in nature seasonality and confounding factors influence the solar photon flux massively fasching et al 2016 subsequently ros formation in natural systems is also tried to the same fluctuations cooper et al 1988 however despite differences in dom photochemical properties for lakes during floods and droughts the relevant information on how these varied dom properties affected ros production was currently unknown floodplains are hydrologically dynamic systems characterized by highly complex surface hydrodynamics that are subjected to wider ranging wetting and drying over seasonal timeframe li et al 2019 poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is a typical flood plain the lake and its surrounding catchments have suffered from frequent droughts and floods in recent decades annual precipitation in the catchment shows a wet and a dry season and a short transition period in between ye et al 2013 floodplains form into a large lake with an inundation area of over 4000 km2 during floods yet shrinking into a narrow and meandering channel during droughts zhang et al 2018 the obvious compositional changes in dom fluorescence in poyang lake had been found to be related to the hydrodynamic differences controlled by water regimen yao et al 2015 in this study a three year water samples which covered the whole floods droughts transformation process in poyang lake were collected the collected samples were probed by absorption spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and indoor photochemical simulation experiments to characterize the photochemistry potential of dom the objectives of this study were 1 to compare the photochemical production of ros including 3cdom 1o2 and oh during the floods and droughts periods in poyang lake china 2 to reveal the contributions of specific components within dom pool to ros generation at the molecular levels and 3 to predict the ros production using opls modeling and assess the environmental effects of ros in terms of contaminant attenuation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study field and sample collection poyang lake which is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 28º24 29º46 n 115º49 116º46 e has a

the northern end of the lake fig 1 in fact there is a time lag in the peak discharge of the yangtze river july september relative to the maximum catchment inflow april june as a result poyang lake experiences different hydrological periods flood season and drought season rainfall decreases sharpy from july to september after september the drought season starts and lasts through december and the surface flow of the catchment is very low during the drought period yao et al 2019 water samples were collected from nine sampling sites during the drought january and the flood july periods in 2018

before the photochemical experiment we did several pre experiments and found that environmental temperature had no obvious effect on the photochemical production of free radicals fig s2 so the temperature was set as room temperature about 27 c during the whole photochemical experiments the absolute irradiance spectra of simulated solar light were measured using a spectroradiometer usb 4000

cylindrical quartz cells diameter 4 cm height 2 5 cm thickness 5 mm and were irradiated for a given period time under ambient conditions the p nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr was used as the actinometer to estimate the photon output of the lamp and the quantum yields of ros laszakovits et al 2017 the solutions in the cells were irradiated from the top and the optical path length was 1 6 cm with an irradiance of 9 w m 2 after the scheduled irradiation time 0 5 ml aliquots were withdrawn from the cells and analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography diode array detector hplc dad equipped

alcohol ffa and benzene respectively vione et al 2014 during the scheduled irradiation time no conversion of three probes was observed in ultrapure water so the direct photodegradation of these three chemical probes was negligible under our experimental conditions the analysis was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection hplc dad vwr hitachi elite instrument equipped with a uv detector the ability to produce ros by irradiated dom can be evaluated by the apparent quantum yield of ros detailed settings are shown in table s2 of the supporting information si 2 4 dom optical spectroscopy measurements the absorbance spectrum of all the water samples was obtained in 1 cm quartz cuvettes on a shimadzu uv 2550 uv vis spectrometer and was set at wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm at intervals of 1 nm all the original absorbance values were corrected to the napierian absorption coefficients huguet et al 2009 spectral parameters including the specific uv

k compound ros is the second order rate constants for reactions with ros and ros ss is the ros steady state concentrations the secondary rate constants were 6 1 108 5 3 105 and 7 3 109 m 1 s 1 for the reaction of acetochlor with 3cdom 1o2 and oh zeng et al 2013 data was analyzed based on the spearman s rank correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression mlr analysis using spss 19 0 software the p 0 05 and p 0 001 were considered as significant and highly significant correlation respectively orthogonal partial least squares opls analysis can eliminate systematic deviations in predictor variables with no statistical correlation to response variables wold et al 2001 which was conducted using simca 31 2 software for model management of predictor variables e g water chemistry and dom parameters and response variables e g ros quantum yields predictor variables were ranked by their explanatory degree of response variables based on their variable importance for the projection vip scores with vip scores higher than 1 0 indicating the most influence galindo prieto et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 changing of the basic physicochemical properties and dom components of lake water during the flood and drought seasons 3 1 1 the basic physicochemical properties of water samples the basic physicochemical properties of the water samples in poyang lake during three years were summarized in fig 2 the average ph significantly increased from the flood to drought season p 0 001 in general the lake water was mildly acidic 6 35 0 13 during the flood period but weakly alkaline 7 68 0 32 in the drought period ph was generally perceived as the limiting factor for photo fenton systems as some photo active complex under uv a and visible solar light showed the higher ability of ros production ruales lonfat et al 2015 the average doc and cdom concentrations significantly decreased by 40 and 50 respectively from flood to drought season p 0 001 the average inorganic nutrients concentration such as ammonia nitrogen nitrate and phosphate were significantly increased from flood to drought season p 0 001 while the average nitrite tn and tp varied little between the two seasons p 0 05 these results demonstrated that the lake was typically between mesotrophic and light eutrophic levels huang et al 2022 and the nutrient concentration in poyang lake changed obviously during the flood and drought seasons we also found that contents of tp in the flood period in 2019 and 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2018 but the po4 3 was similar it was speculated that the changing of particulate phosphorus during different periods han et al 2018 doc accounted for 70 of the total organic matter duan et al 2022 one of the main origins of doc in the flood season was that organic degrading leaching from terrestrial landscapes into aquatic ecosystems li et al 2020 however although the contents of organic matter showed decreasing intendency from the flood to drought seasons bacterial biomass increased significantly p 0 001 the previous research suggested that variation in water level controls bacterial abundance either indirectly by altering availability of doc xenopoulos et al 2021 or directly by importing allochthonous bacteria from the terrestrial floodplain into aquatic habitats palijian 2012 ion concentration ca2 fe2 mn2 were also compared between the two periods and more ion were found during the flood period table s3 in fact metal dom complexation had been found to inhibit the photogeneration of ros wan et al 2019 but this effect was still much weaker than that of the photogenerated ros from dom in the large lake 3 1 2 characterization of dom optical properties to figure out how the composition of organic matter changed during different seasons dom optical properties were firstly characterized box charts of the absorption and fluorescence spectral parameters were shown in figs 3 and 4 higher values of fi 2 30 0 08 vs 1 21 0 07 and β α 0 84 0 08 vs 0 38 0 05 during the drought period suggested that these dom contained much more newly arisings and accompanied by a stronger endogenous signature fig 3 brandao et al 2018 by contrary the lower suva254 6 63 2 08 vs 11 83 8 45 l mg c m 1 e2 e3 4 97 0 54 vs 5 19 0 51 s r 1 07 0 07 vs 1 10 0 13 and hix 0 63 0 07 vs 0 77 0 04 values in the drought period indicated that these dom also had lower aromaticity and lower average molecular size dalrymple et al 2010 three parafac components identified in this study were all successfully cross referenced to the openfluor database using a criterion of 95 similarity to indicate a match murphy et al 2013 split half analysis residual analysis and visual inspection identified that six components were appropriate fig s4 six fluorescent components were identified by eem parafac modeling fig 4 c1 c3 and c5 were the humic like component c1 showed an excitation emission ex em at 330 422 nm which was similar to agricultural humic like substances or terrestrial derived reprocessed materials osburn et al 2012 c3 showed ex em maximum at 280 378 nm representing microbial humic like compounds murphy et al 2013 c5 showed spectral characteristics similar to terrestrial humic like materials with ex em maximum at 265 466 nm murphy et al 2013 c2 and c4 were attributed to fulvic acid components bai et al 2013 c6 was identified as the autochthonous tyrosine like component stedmon et al 2003 results showed that the relative proportions of humic acids 92 69 2 46 and fulvic acids 93 64 0 46 during floods period were significantly higher than those during droughts indicating a robust signature of allochthonous dom influx it was also found that the relative proportion of c6 during droughts 83 52 11 27 was notably higher than that in the floods period suggesting that endogenous organic matter was dominated in lake water during the drought period 3 1 3 dom molecular results revealed using ft icr ms ft icr ms analysis was further applied to compare the compositions of dom samples at the molecular level tables 1 and s4 it was shown that the average molecular formulas were 5549 807 and 4028 442 for dom collected from the drought and flood periods respectively which indicated a higher heterogeneity in structural compositions for the former table s3 ratios of unique molecular formulae followed a similar pattern of chon chons cho chons in both the two periods the molecular formulae number and relative intensity of each molecular group were also analyzed table 1 results showed that doms collected in the drought period were characterized with higher percentage of lipids 25 97 3 29 proteins 14 60 0 9 unsaturated aliphatic compounds 15 11 1 23 and peptides 32 80 1 82 than those sampled in the flood period indicating that the endogenous proportion of dom in drought season is higher than that in flood season lin and guo 2020 in contrast in the flood period some refractory components such as lignin like 25 63 2 12 and carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram 6 97 1 02 were exhibited higher abundance than those in the drought period in addition the relative abundance of bio and photo active components such as hydrocarbons 5 54 1 05 and unsaturated hydrocarbons 11 47 0 83 in flood period were significantly higher than those in the drought period indicating that they were more easily degraded by both photochemistry and microorganisms spence and kelleher 2016 3 2 ros production during the flood and drought period 3 2 1 the quantum yield coefficients f t m p of 3cdom quantum yield of φ 1 o 2 and ф oh taking into account of the wavelength dependence of ros photochemical production ros apparent quantum yields in the 290 600 nm wavelength range were calculated as shown in table 2 the quantum yield coefficients f t m p of 3cdom were 44 41 4 84 m 1 in the flood period which were significantly higher than those in the drought period 30 68 4 82 m 1 p 0 001 the f t m p values observed herein were significantly higher than those reported for the wetland 5 2 6 7 m 1 maizel and remucal 2017 and wastewater samples 16 2 34 7 m 1 bodhipaksha et al 2015 but slightly lower than that for natural lakes e g lake big muskellunge and lake sparkling 61 3 67 1 m 1 maizel and remucal 2017 analogous scenarios in 1o2 apparent quantum yield φ 1 o 2 showed that φ 1 o 2 ranged from 7 30 10 3 to 1 51 10 2 with a mean value of 1 01 0 22 10 2 in the flood period which were higher than those in the drought period 3 91 10 3 1 01 10 2 with a mean value of 6 66 1 71 10 3 previous studies showed that the quantum yields of 3cdom and 1o2 were correlated with the molecular sizes of dom samples mccabe and arnold 2018 the low molecular weight lmw fraction of dissolved organic matter had a higher f tmp and φ 1 o 2 than the high molecular weight hmw fraction marchisio et al 2015 it was also testified by the correlation between e2 e3 and f tmp or φ 1 o 2 in this study fig s5 the quantum yields of ф oh was also higher in the flood period although there was no significant difference p 0 05 3 2 2 steady state concentrations of 3cdom 1o2 and oh dom emerged as a major supplier of ros in natural freshwater bodies and they also quenched the majority of ros vione et al 2014 jointly determined by the ros formation rates and scavenging products the steady state concentrations of ros r o s ss eventually surmount the dom induced light attenuation and quenching effects table 2 the average steady state concentrations of 3cdom 3 c d o m ss in the flood period 6 96 0 95 10 15 m was significantly higher than those in the drought period 5 06 0 78 10 15 m p 0 05 the average steady state concentrations of 1o2 1 o 2 ss showed the same changing tendency which were 1 21 0 25 10 14 m and 8 25 2 06 10 15 m in the flood and drought periods respectively changing tendencies of 3 c d o m ss and 1 o 2 ss during the two periods were consistent with those of f t m p and φ 1 o 2 however the steady state concentrations of oh o h ss during the flood and the droughts period showed no significant changing p 0 05 table 1 in natural aquatic environments nitrate and nitrite are also the important source of oh morris et al 2022 in this study in order to quantitate the contribution of dom to the production of oh additional runs had been conducted with solutions containing various nitrate or nitrite concentrations under the same reaction conditions fig s6 and table s5 nitrite photochemically induced r o h were 5 26 10 6 m s 1 per m nitrite which was nearly 27 times higher than nitrate suggested that nitrite tended to exhibit a strong capability for oh production morris et al 2022 combined with the changes of nitrate contents in flood and drought seasons it was reasonable to speculate that the photocatalysis of dom was the main source of oh in flood season while in drought season the main source of oh changed to nitrite 3 2 3 conversion efficiencies of 3cdom to 1o2 3cdom was the primary precursor for the reaction with oxygen to form 1o2 so the further conversion of 3cdom to 1o2 under photoexcitation was important for revealing the transfer process of 1o2 efficiencies of 1o2 generation from 3cdom were observed from 1o2 production rates r 1 o 2 versus 3cdom production rates r 3 c d o m depicted in fig 5 o connor et al 2019 among the three year dom samples the conversion efficiency of 85 7 in poyang lake was considerably higher than 54 as reported by o connor et al in effluent samples o connor et al 2019 demonstrating that 3cdom in natural waters less frequently undergoes other decay processes typified by thermal relaxation self extinction with toc above 10 mg c l 1 etc bianco et al 2015 rosario ortiz et al 2016 the conversion efficiency for 3cdom to form 1o2 during floods was 87 75 higher than that of 81 83 during the drought season indicating that proportionately larger fractions of the low energy 3cdom in the flood samples was not involved in tmp oxidation mccabe et al 2016 the energy required to facilitate molecular oxygen to the singlet state was 94 kj mol 1 significantly lower than 250 kj mol 1 for tmp oxidation with single electron transfer mcneill et al 2016 3 3 effects of dom fractions on ros production the effects of dom components on ros production showed significantly seasonal difference fig 6 more abundance dom components such as peptides unsaturated aliphatic compounds c1 c5 hix and e2 e3 ρ 0 30 exhibited salient positive correlation with f t m p and 3 c d o m ss during the flood period but these components showed weak positive or even negative correlation with f t m p and 3 c d o m ss during the drought seasons these results determined that dom dominated by exogenous organic matter had a positive effect on 3cdom production in flood season while dom components dominated by endogenous organic matter in dry season had a low production efficiency on 3cdom φ 1 o 2 showed the same changing tendency with f t m p conforming to the subordinate relationship between 3cdom and 1o2 o connor et al 2019 φ o h showed a weak negative correlation 0 456 0 055 with various types of dom molecules in the flood and drought seasons while it showed a significant positive correlation ρ 0 474 0 791 with nitrate and nitrite in drought seasons these results further proved that the main contribution of oh in drought season was nitrate and nitrite in order to determine the role of major components more clearly the heat map were simplified to analyze only the highly significant correlation with ros p 0 01 fig s7 satisfactory collinearity of f t m p with lignin ρ 0 814 and cram ρ 0 809 evidenced that photoexcitation of the triplet states might be intimately tied to plant derived dom xu et al 2020 coincided with our previous findings on the joint photo microbial degradation of plant residues to produce ros song et al 2020 combined with the prior evaluation on f t m p we speculated that the organic constituents liberated by the plant residue degradation course under flooding modified the dom sources and compositions and the photosensitive portions e g lignin and cram contributed to the higher f t m p complementary fluorescence and parafac results supported our conjectures salient dependences of f t m p on fi ρ 0 826 β α ρ 0 863 and hix ρ 0 881 attested to the fact that stronger territorial source higher non novelty proportions and for dom were associated with higher 3cdom yields groeneveld et al 2016 stedmon et al 2003 humified dom e g c1 c3 c5 with f t m p having spearman coefficients of ρ 0 802 0 821 generally emanated from the decomposition of plant and animal residues with a predominance of photo degradation rossel et al 2013 hence humic substances formed by the preliminary decomposition e g microbial dissolution of dom released from terrestrial plant residues in the flooding period could serve as an essential cause for the 3cdom production preferential microbial depletion of plant residual macromolecules led to the formation of biologically recalcitrant molecules such as lignin and cram 3 4 using opls modeling to predict the ros production in poyang lake to explore the most influential factors on dom photoreactivity of poyang lake during different periods the opls model was developed with ros quantum yields representing the response variables and water chemistry and dom properties representing the predictor variables wold et al 2001 the opls predictive modeling analysis and evaluation of f t m p φ 1 o 2 φ o h and φ o h d o m y variables were carried out using 27 predictor variables x variables the explanatory degree of the opls model for ros quantum yields presented a varying regularity of f t m p 0 83 φ 1 o 2 0 67 φ o h 0 43 the average explained fraction in ros quantum yields after cross validation r2 for this model was 0 64 results suggested that the selected physicochemical variables could capture the production efficiency of 3cdom and 1o2 with high accuracy in the loading scatter plot fig 3a f t m p and φ 1 o 2 congregated with the positively impacted parameters e g hix interpreted by the first opls predicted component but remote from the negatively influential parameters e g β α and fi φ o h and φ o h d o m were separated significantly from f t m p and φ 1 o 2 on the second opls predicted component suggesting the consistency with the less predictive potential for oh production by physicochemical parameters the vip plot summarized 13 influential predictor variables on ros yields vip scores 1 fig 3b with scores following the order β α fi c5 c2 c4 c1 nitrate c3 hix ligin cram hac huc hysteresis of some dom properties e g dom molecular scale aromaticity do not act as the key predictors of spatio temporal ros yields we further simplified the predictor variables by mlr analysis until all variance inflation factors diminished to 2 and the best fit was obtained wasswa et al 2020 of all prediction models the freshness index β α was the most effective predictor of f t m p φ 1 o 2 φ o h and φ o h d o m fig 3c f the incorporation of other predictive variables achieved the optimal fit for f t m p and φ 1 o 2 i e hix φ o h i e nitrite and φ o h d o m i e cram abundance under binary regression the β α construed as a chronological index that is the most recently produced dom compared to the last humified dom thus the result revealed that a higher dom humification resulted in a higher ros yield zeng et al 2021 the new model predictor variables partly captured the heterogeneity of dom but differed from other univariate variables of the previous work e g e2 e3 doc suv254 s r etc peterson et al 2012 lin et al 2017 sunday et al 2020 the differences resulted mainly from i spatial samples for a specific period from previous studies did not consider the various periods typically e g flood and drought periods four season variations etc thus giving rise to the presentation of multiple variable prediction factors peterson et al 2012 lin et al 2017 sunday et al 2020 ii limited by the quantity of dom properties e g lack of fluorescence and molecular level metrics peterson et al 2012 from this study a new opls multivariate model was established to draw up the best predictive variables of ros production based on the inclusion of three year samples in both floods and droughts β α based photochemical prediction models could be generalized to other inland waters along the yangtze river with simultaneous temporal duration significant hydrological fluctuations e g the rotation of flood and drought periods and geographical spans further dom molecular moisture characterization interpretations and wide ranging natural sample analyses are known to further refine the photochemical predictability on dom 3 5 impacts on contaminants attenuation between the flood and drought period due to the influence of anthropogenic and environmental variations enhanced concentrations of contaminants were usually detected in poyang lake sunday et al 2020 to elucidate the significance of ros for contaminant degradation the half lives of acetochlors were investigated as shown in table 3 acetochlor was one of the most widely deployed herbicides with prone to bioaccumulation and biomagnification in food chains photodegradation reactions of acetochlor induced by ros were found related to r o s ss and the second order rate constants between the contaminants and ros felcyn et al 2012 li et al 2016 the half lives of acetochlors calculated by 3 c d o m ss 1 o 2 ss and o h ss in the flood period were 36 31 4 73 h which were significantly lower than those in the drought period 46 63 8 71 h p 0 05 suggested that the indirect photodegradation of 3cdom 1o2 and oh on organic contaminants played an important role in poyang lake especially during the flood period previous work on the photodegradation of acetochlor in prairie pothole waters also showed the decisive role of 3 c d o m ss and 1 o 2 ss zeng and arnold 2013 ros played a key role in nutrients biogeochemical cycles which also had significant impacts on environmental pollutants migration toxicity and bioavailability morris et al 2022 the change of production of ros during flood and drought periods may also affect the environmental behavior of nutrients and pollutants during the flood periods the main origin of surface water pollution is the flow of organic contaminants from catchments agricultural soils and ponds urban areas wetlands a great photoproduction capacity of 3cdom 1o2 and oh had a positive effect on the refractory contaminants during the drought periods weak photochemical capacity might lead to the accumulation of pollutants considering the difference of photochemical activity during different periods it was also of great significance for understanding emerging contaminants prevention 4 conclusions doms in poyang lake were characterized with endogenous sources in droughts period but strong allochthonous inputs in the floods period the terrestrial plant lysis and soil leaching were important entry pathways for nearshore dom sources during the flood period the inclusion of heterogenous dom promoted the photochemical quantum yields of ros new multivariate prediction models based on β α upon the inclusion of temporal scale dom samples facilitated the comprehension of dom photoactivity characteristics and elucidated the significance of ros produced from dom for contaminant degradation considering that steady state concentrations of ros dramatically diminished the half lives of organic contaminants during floods this study can contribute to a new insight into stage specific self purification process for natural water bodies

15439,reactive oxygen species ros are omnipresent in natural aquatic environments and play an important role in biogeochemical cycles one of the dominant sources of ros in surface waters was thought to be from dissolved organic matter dom interacting with photochemical process the properties of dom were different between the flood and drought periods in lakes yet information on how these variations influence ros photoproduction is unknown through a three year study the photochemical properties of dom and the resultant ros photoproduction between the flood and drought period were determined in the largest freshwater lake in china lake poyang results found that quantum yield coefficients of excited triplets 3cdom apparent quantum yields of singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh were holistically higher in the flood period than those in the drought period the optical properties of dom showed that dom in the flood period featured an allochthonous input accompanied by higher molecular size e2 e3 aromatic content suva254 humification degree hix while dom in the drought period was mainly internal input fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fi icr ms further revealed that some refractory components such as lignin like and carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram presented higher abundance in the flood period and played the positive impacts on ros production orthogonal partial least squares opls were used to build novel multivariate predictive models for indicating the spatio temporal ros production also the relatively higher steady state concentrations of 3cdom and 1o2 in the flood period could significantly diminish the half lives of acetochlor considering the photochemical activity of dom varied considerably at different periods

introduction reactive oxygen species ros including the excited triplets 3cdom singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide o2 were intermediates formed during the sequential one electron reduction of o2 to h2o in most oxic natural waters morris et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 ros performed crucial roles in the degradation and transformation of organic pollutants and refractory organic matters in aquatic environment fujii et al 2017 song et al 2020 they also reacted with trace elements in water such as iron chromium copper and manganese thereby affecting the chemical behavior and bioavailability of trace elements morris et al 2022 among them oh 1o2 and 3cdom are of prime importance for their contribution to organic fate in sunlit aquifers al housari et al 2010 in natural aquatic environments the dominant source of ros in surface waters was thought to be from dissolved organic matter dom interacting with photochemical process mccabe et al 2016 and 2018 in fact the dominant light absorber was the chromophoric fraction of dom cdom zafiriou et al 1984 cdom was the only source of 3cdom and 1o2 and it was an important oh source as well glover and rosario ortiz 2013 cdom could absorb photons and enter an excited triplet state capable of reducing o2 to o2 which could then undergo spontaneous dismutation to h2o2 and o2 the light absorbing properties of dom depended on its sources and chemical composition lin and guo 2020 allochthonous and the terrestrially derived organic matter had been found to contain higher molecular weights and have more aromatic moieties than autochthonous xenopoulos et al 2021 but microbially derived organic matter was enriched in nitrogen and sulfur content but was lower in molecular weight distribution guerard et al 2009 many studies had also sought to link photochemical characteristics and physicochemical properties with different types of dom isolates single dom components such as humic acids del vecchio et al 2017 fulvic acids fujii and otani 2017 amino acids amado et al 2015 and lignin phenols benner and kaiser 2011 had been previously explored for the photochemical mineralization of dom the photochemical potential was widely linked with the physicochemical properties of doms with different origins or types de laurentiis et al 2013 maizel et al 2017 peterson et al 2012 actually the complex composition of dom in aquatic environments was mainly attributed to the sensitivity to local hydrogeochemical variations ejarque et al 2018 periodical variations in water depth were associated with alternative flood and drought periods which could directly alter the dom photochemical reaction dynamics and associated conversion pathways koehler et al 2018 vione et al 2014 it was found that dom inputs derived primarily from groundwater had a more protin like biolabile composition during the drought conditions fasching et al 2016 while higher concentration and export of nutrients and c rich dom with higher molecular weight and more aromatic dom properties had frequently been observed during the high flow flood events wilson et al 2016 in nature seasonality and confounding factors influence the solar photon flux massively fasching et al 2016 subsequently ros formation in natural systems is also tried to the same fluctuations cooper et al 1988 however despite differences in dom photochemical properties for lakes during floods and droughts the relevant information on how these varied dom properties affected ros production was currently unknown floodplains are hydrologically dynamic systems characterized by highly complex surface hydrodynamics that are subjected to wider ranging wetting and drying over seasonal timeframe li et al 2019 poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is a typical flood plain the lake and its surrounding catchments have suffered from frequent droughts and floods in recent decades annual precipitation in the catchment shows a wet and a dry season and a short transition period in between ye et al 2013 floodplains form into a large lake with an inundation area of over 4000 km2 during floods yet shrinking into a narrow and meandering channel during droughts zhang et al 2018 the obvious compositional changes in dom fluorescence in poyang lake had been found to be related to the hydrodynamic differences controlled by water regimen yao et al 2015 in this study a three year water samples which covered the whole floods droughts transformation process in poyang lake were collected the collected samples were probed by absorption spectroscopy

objectives of this study were 1 to compare the photochemical production of ros including 3cdom 1o2 and oh during the floods and droughts periods in poyang lake china 2 to reveal the contributions of specific components within dom pool to ros generation at the molecular levels and 3 to predict the ros production using opls modeling and assess the environmental effects of ros in terms of contaminant attenuation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study field and sample collection poyang lake which is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 28º24 29º46 n 115º49 116º46 e has a catchment area of 162 225 km2 fig 1 spanning approximately 74 km from east to west and 170 km from north to south variation of water level in poyang lake is mainly via a narrow channel hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake fig 1 in fact there is a time lag in the peak discharge of the yangtze river july september relative to the maximum catchment inflow april june as a result poyang lake experiences different hydrological periods flood season and drought season rainfall decreases sharpy from july to september after september the drought season starts and lasts through december and the surface flow of the catchment is very low during the drought period yao et al 2019 water samples were collected from nine sampling sites during the drought january and the flood july periods in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 and table s1 surface water samples 0 5 1 0 m were collected in 2 l acid cleaned plastic bottles and vacuum filtered with millipore mf membranes mixed cellulose ester with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm then transported to lab at 4 c as soon as possible between 3 and 10 water samples were collected from each sampling sites during each sampling occasion 2 2 photochemical experiments photochemical experiments were performed using a solar simulator oriel sol3a newport equipped with a 1500 w xenon lamp schemes of experimental setup were shown in fig s1 before the photochemical experiment we did several pre experiments and found that environmental temperature had no obvious effect on the photochemical production of free radicals fig s2 so the temperature was set as room temperature about 27 c during the whole photochemical experiments the absolute irradiance spectra of simulated solar light were measured using a spectroradiometer usb 4000 ocean optics inc and spectral photon flux density i λ were presented in fig s3 before experiments the ph of all samples was adjusted to 6 5 0 2 20 ml of liquid solutions were placed in specially made cylindrical quartz cells diameter 4 cm height 2 5 cm thickness 5 mm and were irradiated for a given period time under ambient conditions the p nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr was used as the actinometer to estimate the photon output of the lamp and the quantum yields of ros laszakovits et al 2017 the solutions in the cells were irradiated from the top and the optical path length was 1 6 cm with an irradiance of 9 w m 2 after the scheduled irradiation time 0 5 ml aliquots were withdrawn from the cells and analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography diode array detector hplc dad equipped with a uv detector irradiation experiments were performed in triplicate 2 3 ros measurement the ros including 3cdom 1o2 and oh were quantified via the reaction of 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp furfuryl alcohol ffa and benzene respectively vione et al 2014 during the scheduled irradiation time no conversion of three probes was observed in ultrapure water so the direct photodegradation of these three chemical probes was negligible under our experimental conditions the analysis was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection hplc dad vwr hitachi elite instrument equipped with a uv detector the ability to produce ros by irradiated dom can be evaluated by the apparent quantum yield of ros detailed settings are shown in table s2 of the supporting information si 2 4 dom optical spectroscopy measurements the absorbance spectrum of all the water samples was obtained in 1 cm quartz cuvettes on a shimadzu uv 2550 uv vis spectrometer and was set at wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm at intervals of 1 nm all the original absorbance values were corrected to the napierian absorption coefficients huguet et al 2009 spectral parameters including the specific uv absorption of doc at 254 nm suva254 the absorption coefficients ratio e2 e3 spectral slopes ratio s r were used in the study the carbon specific absorption at 300 nm a 300 was used as an indicator of cdom abundance fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems of each sample were acquired using a hitachi f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer in a 1 cm quartz cuvette eems were recorded across an excitation wavelength range of 200 to 450 nm in 5 nm increments and an emission wavelength range of 250 to 600 nm in 1 nm increments with an integration time of 1 s and a medium ccd gain three fluorescence parameters humification index hix fluorescence index fi and freshness index β α were used to reflect the origin and aromaticity of dom parallel factor parafac analysis was performed by loading the domflur toolbox using matlab 22 0 software lin and guo 2020 2 5 ft icr ms measurements and data processing a total of 36 water samples sampled in 2019 and 2020 were extracted with solid phase extraction cartridges for the composition of doc using the bruker daltonics 7 t apex qe ft icr ms molecular formulas which contained the elements of c h o n and s were assigned using a self written software routine the molecular formulae were categorized as follows 1 sugar like compounds h c 1 5 or o c 0 9 2 peptide like 2 0 h c 1 5 and n 0 3 aliphatic 2 0 h c 1 5 and n 0 4 highly

argon laser 488 nm 80 mw zhou et al 2021 data of all parameters was presented as averages in triplicate in this study 2 7 data analysis the half lives for the indirect photodegradation of acetazolamide by three kinds of ros were calculated using eq 1 1 t 1 2 0 693 k c o m p o u n d 1 0 693 k c o m p o u n d r o s r o s s s 1 where k compound is the contaminant compound photolysis rate k compound ros is the second order rate constants for reactions with ros and ros ss is the ros steady state concentrations the secondary rate constants were 6 1 108 5 3 105 and 7 3 109 m 1 s 1 for the reaction of acetochlor with 3cdom 1o2 and oh zeng et al 2013 data was analyzed based on the spearman s rank correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression mlr analysis using spss 19 0 software the p 0 05 and p 0 001 were considered as significant and highly significant correlation respectively orthogonal partial least squares opls analysis can eliminate systematic deviations in predictor variables with no statistical correlation to response variables wold et al 2001 which was conducted using simca 31 2 software for model management of predictor variables e g water chemistry and dom parameters and response variables e g ros quantum yields predictor variables were ranked by their explanatory degree of response variables based on their variable importance for the projection vip scores with vip scores higher than 1 0 indicating the most influence galindo prieto et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 changing of the basic physicochemical properties and dom components of lake water during the flood and drought seasons 3 1 1 the basic physicochemical properties of water samples the basic physicochemical properties of the water samples in poyang lake during three years were summarized in fig 2 the average ph significantly increased from the flood to drought season p 0 001 in general the lake water was mildly acidic 6 35 0 13 during the flood period but weakly alkaline 7 68 0 32 in the drought period ph was generally perceived as the limiting factor for photo fenton systems as some photo active complex under uv a and visible solar light showed the higher ability of ros production ruales lonfat et al 2015 the average doc and cdom concentrations significantly decreased by 40 and 50 respectively from flood to drought season p 0 001 the average inorganic nutrients concentration such as ammonia nitrogen nitrate and phosphate were significantly increased from flood to drought season p 0 001 while the average nitrite tn and tp varied little between the two seasons p 0 05 these results demonstrated that the lake was typically between mesotrophic and light eutrophic levels huang et al 2022 and the nutrient concentration in poyang lake changed obviously during the flood and drought seasons we also found that contents of tp in the flood period in 2019 and 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2018 but the po4 3 was similar it was speculated that the changing of particulate phosphorus during different periods han et al 2018 doc accounted for 70 of the total organic matter duan et al 2022 one of the main origins of doc in the flood season was that organic degrading leaching from terrestrial landscapes into aquatic ecosystems li et al 2020 however although the contents of organic matter showed decreasing intendency from the flood to drought seasons bacterial biomass increased significantly p 0 001 the previous research suggested that variation in water level controls bacterial abundance either indirectly by altering availability of doc xenopoulos et al 2021 or directly by importing allochthonous bacteria from the terrestrial floodplain into aquatic habitats palijian 2012 ion concentration ca2 fe2 mn2 were also compared between the two periods and more ion were found during the flood period table s3 in fact metal dom complexation had been found to inhibit the photogeneration of ros wan et al 2019 but this effect was still much weaker than that of the photogenerated ros from dom in the large lake 3 1 2 characterization of dom optical properties to figure out how the composition of organic matter changed during different seasons dom optical properties were firstly characterized box charts of the absorption and fluorescence spectral parameters were shown in figs 3 and 4 higher values of fi 2 30 0 08 vs 1 21 0 07 and β α 0 84 0 08 vs 0 38 0 05 during the drought period suggested that these dom contained much more newly arisings and accompanied by a stronger endogenous signature fig 3 brandao et al 2018 by contrary the lower suva254 6 63 2 08 vs 11 83 8 45 l mg c m 1 e2 e3 4 97 0 54 vs 5 19 0 51 s r 1 07 0 07 vs 1 10 0 13 and hix 0 63 0 07 vs 0 77 0 04 values in the drought period indicated that these dom also had lower aromaticity and lower average molecular size dalrymple et al 2010 three parafac components identified in this study were all successfully cross referenced to the openfluor database using a criterion of 95 similarity to indicate a match murphy et al 2013 split half analysis residual analysis and visual inspection identified that six components were appropriate fig s4 six fluorescent components were identified by eem parafac modeling fig 4 c1 c3 and c5 were the humic like component c1 showed an excitation emission ex em at 330 422 nm which was similar to agricultural humic like substances or terrestrial derived reprocessed materials osburn et al 2012 c3 showed ex em maximum at 280 378 nm representing microbial humic like compounds murphy et al 2013 c5 showed spectral characteristics similar to terrestrial humic like materials with ex em maximum at 265 466 nm murphy et al 2013 c2 and c4 were attributed to fulvic acid components bai et al 2013 c6 was identified as the autochthonous tyrosine like component stedmon et al 2003 results showed that the relative proportions of humic acids 92 69 2 46 and fulvic acids 93 64 0 46 during floods period were significantly higher than those during droughts indicating a robust signature of allochthonous dom influx it was also found that the relative proportion of c6 during droughts 83 52 11 27 was notably higher than that in the floods period suggesting that endogenous organic matter was dominated in lake water during the drought period 3 1 3 dom molecular results revealed using ft icr ms ft icr ms analysis was further applied to compare the compositions of dom samples at the molecular level tables 1 and s4 it was shown that the average molecular formulas were 5549 807 and 4028 442 for dom collected from the drought and flood periods respectively which indicated a higher heterogeneity in structural compositions for the former table s3 ratios of unique molecular formulae followed a similar pattern of chon chons cho chons in both the two periods the molecular formulae number and relative intensity of each molecular group were also analyzed table 1 results showed that doms collected in the drought period were characterized with higher percentage of lipids 25 97 3 29 proteins 14 60 0 9 unsaturated aliphatic compounds 15 11 1 23 and peptides 32 80 1 82 than those sampled in the flood period indicating that the endogenous proportion of dom in drought season is higher than that in flood season lin and guo 2020 in contrast in the flood period some refractory components such as lignin like 25 63 2 12 and carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules cram 6 97 1 02 were exhibited higher abundance than those in the drought period in addition the relative abundance of bio and photo active components such as hydrocarbons 5 54 1 05 and unsaturated hydrocarbons 11 47 0 83 in flood period were significantly higher than those in the drought period indicating that they were more easily degraded by both photochemistry and microorganisms spence and kelleher 2016 3 2 ros production during the flood and drought period 3 2 1 the quantum yield coefficients f t m p of 3cdom quantum yield of φ 1 o 2 and ф oh taking into account of the wavelength dependence of ros photochemical production ros apparent quantum yields in the 290 600 nm wavelength range were calculated as shown in table 2 the quantum yield coefficients f t m p of 3cdom were 44 41 4 84 m 1 in the flood period which were significantly higher than those in the drought period 30 68 4 82 m 1 p 0 001 the f t m p values observed herein were significantly higher than those reported for the wetland 5 2 6 7 m 1 maizel and remucal 2017 and wastewater samples 16 2 34 7 m 1 bodhipaksha et al 2015 but slightly lower than that for natural lakes e g lake big muskellunge and lake sparkling 61 3 67 1 m 1 maizel and remucal 2017 analogous scenarios in 1o2 apparent quantum yield φ 1 o 2 showed that φ 1 o 2 ranged from 7 30 10 3 to 1 51 10 2 with a mean value of 1 01 0 22 10 2 in the flood period which were higher than those in the drought period 3 91 10 3 1 01 10 2 with a mean value of 6 66 1 71 10 3 previous studies showed that the quantum yields of 3cdom and 1o2 were correlated with the molecular sizes of dom samples mccabe and arnold 2018 the low molecular weight lmw fraction of dissolved organic matter had a higher f tmp and φ 1 o 2 than the high molecular weight hmw fraction marchisio et al 2015 it was also testified by the correlation between e2 e3 and f tmp or φ 1 o 2 in this study fig s5 the quantum yields of ф oh was also higher in the flood period although there was no significant difference p 0 05 3 2 2 steady state concentrations of 3cdom 1o2 and oh dom emerged as a major supplier of ros in natural freshwater bodies and they also quenched the majority of ros vione et al 2014 jointly determined by the ros formation rates and scavenging products the steady state concentrations of ros r o s ss eventually surmount the dom induced light attenuation and quenching effects table 2 the average steady state concentrations of 3cdom 3 c d o m ss in the flood period 6 96 0 95 10 15 m was significantly higher than those in the drought period 5 06 0 78 10 15 m p 0 05 the average steady state concentrations of 1o2 1 o 2 ss showed the same changing tendency which were 1 21 0 25 10 14 m and 8 25 2 06 10 15 m in the flood and drought periods respectively changing tendencies of 3 c d o m ss and 1 o 2 ss during the two periods were consistent with those of f t m p and φ 1 o 2 however the steady state concentrations of oh o h ss during the flood and the droughts period showed no significant changing p 0 05 table 1 in natural aquatic environments nitrate and nitrite are also the important source of oh morris et al 2022 in this study in order to quantitate the contribution of dom to the production of oh additional runs had been conducted with solutions containing various nitrate or nitrite concentrations under the same reaction conditions fig s6 and table s5 nitrite photochemically induced r o h were 5 26 10 6 m s 1 per m nitrite which was nearly 27 times higher than nitrate suggested that nitrite tended to exhibit a strong capability for oh production morris et al 2022 combined with the changes of nitrate contents in flood and drought seasons it was reasonable to speculate that the photocatalysis of dom was the main source of oh in flood season while in drought season the main source of oh changed to nitrite 3 2 3 conversion efficiencies of 3cdom to 1o2 3cdom was the primary precursor for the reaction with oxygen to form 1o2 so the further conversion of 3cdom to 1o2 under photoexcitation was important for revealing the transfer process of 1o2 efficiencies of 1o2 generation from 3cdom were observed from 1o2 production rates r 1 o 2 versus 3cdom production rates r 3 c d o m depicted in fig 5 o connor et al 2019 among the three year dom samples the conversion efficiency of 85 7 in poyang lake was considerably higher than 54 as reported by o connor et al in effluent samples o connor et al 2019 demonstrating that 3cdom in natural waters less frequently undergoes other decay processes typified by thermal relaxation self extinction with toc above 10 mg c l 1 etc bianco et al 2015 rosario ortiz et al 2016 the conversion efficiency for 3cdom to form 1o2 during floods was 87 75 higher than that of 81 83 during the drought season indicating that proportionately larger fractions of the low energy 3cdom in the flood samples was not involved in tmp oxidation mccabe et al 2016 the energy required to facilitate molecular oxygen to the singlet state was 94 kj mol 1 significantly lower than 250 kj mol 1 for tmp oxidation with single electron transfer mcneill et al 2016 3 3 effects of dom fractions on ros production the effects of dom components on ros production showed significantly seasonal difference fig 6 more abundance dom components such as peptides unsaturated aliphatic compounds c1 c5 hix and e2 e3 ρ 0 30 exhibited salient positive correlation with f t m p and 3 c d o m ss during the flood period but these components showed weak positive or even negative correlation with f t m p and 3 c d o m ss during the drought seasons these results determined that dom dominated by exogenous organic matter had a positive effect on 3cdom production in flood season while dom components dominated by endogenous organic matter in dry season had a low production efficiency on 3cdom φ 1 o 2 showed the same changing tendency with f t m p conforming to the subordinate relationship between 3cdom and 1o2 o connor et al 2019 φ o h showed a weak negative correlation 0 456 0 055 with various types of dom molecules in the flood and drought seasons while it showed a significant positive correlation ρ 0 474 0 791 with nitrate and nitrite in drought seasons these results further proved that the main contribution of oh in drought season was nitrate and nitrite in order to determine the role of major components more clearly the heat map were simplified to analyze only the highly significant correlation with ros p 0 01 fig s7 satisfactory collinearity of f t m p with lignin ρ 0 814 and cram ρ 0 809 evidenced that photoexcitation of the triplet states might be intimately tied to plant derived dom xu et al 2020 coincided with our previous findings on the joint photo microbial degradation of plant residues to produce ros song et al 2020 combined with the prior evaluation on f t m p we speculated that the organic constituents liberated by the plant residue degradation course under flooding modified the dom sources and compositions and the photosensitive portions e g lignin and cram contributed to the higher f t m p complementary fluorescence and parafac results supported our conjectures salient dependences of f t m p on fi ρ 0 826 β α ρ 0 863 and hix ρ 0 881 attested to the fact that stronger territorial source higher non novelty proportions and for dom were associated with higher 3cdom yields groeneveld et al 2016 stedmon et al 2003 humified dom e g c1 c3 c5 with f t m p having spearman coefficients of ρ 0 802 0 821 generally emanated from the decomposition of plant and animal residues with a predominance of photo degradation rossel et al 2013 hence humic substances formed by the preliminary decomposition e g microbial dissolution of dom released from terrestrial plant residues in the flooding period could serve as an essential cause for the 3cdom production preferential microbial depletion of plant residual macromolecules led to the formation of biologically recalcitrant molecules such as lignin and cram 3 4 using opls modeling to predict the ros production in poyang lake to explore the most influential factors on dom photoreactivity of poyang lake during different periods the opls model was developed with ros quantum yields representing the response variables and water chemistry and dom properties representing the predictor variables wold et al 2001 the opls predictive modeling analysis and evaluation of f t m p φ 1 o 2 φ o h and φ o h d o m y variables were carried out using 27 predictor variables x variables the explanatory degree of the opls model for ros quantum yields presented a varying regularity of f t m p 0 83 φ 1 o 2 0 67 φ o h 0 43 the average explained fraction in ros quantum yields after cross validation r2 for this model was 0 64 results suggested that the selected physicochemical variables could capture the production efficiency of 3cdom and 1o2 with high accuracy in the loading scatter plot fig 3a f t m p and φ 1 o 2 congregated with the positively impacted parameters e g hix interpreted by the first opls predicted component but remote from the negatively influential parameters e g β α and fi φ o h and φ o h d o m were separated significantly from f t m p and φ 1 o 2 on the second opls predicted component suggesting the consistency with the less predictive potential for oh production by physicochemical parameters the vip plot summarized 13 influential predictor variables on ros yields vip scores 1 fig 3b with scores following the order β α fi c5 c2 c4 c1 nitrate c3 hix ligin cram hac huc hysteresis of some dom properties e g dom molecular scale aromaticity do not act as the key predictors of spatio temporal ros yields we further simplified the predictor variables by mlr analysis until all variance inflation factors diminished to 2 and the best fit was obtained wasswa et al 2020 of all prediction models the freshness index β α was the most effective predictor of f t m p φ 1 o 2 φ o h and φ o h d o m fig 3c f the incorporation of other predictive variables achieved the optimal fit for f t m p and φ 1 o 2 i e hix φ o h i e nitrite and φ o h d o m i e cram abundance under binary regression the β α construed as a chronological index that is the most recently produced dom compared to the last humified dom thus the result revealed that a higher dom humification resulted in a higher ros yield zeng et al 2021 the new model predictor variables partly captured the heterogeneity of dom but differed from other univariate variables of the previous work e g e2 e3 doc suv254 s r etc peterson et al 2012 lin et al 2017 sunday et al 2020 the differences resulted mainly from i spatial samples for a specific period from previous studies did not consider the various periods typically e g flood and drought periods four season variations etc thus giving rise to the presentation of multiple variable prediction factors peterson et al 2012 lin et al 2017 sunday et al 2020 ii limited by the quantity of dom properties e g lack of fluorescence and molecular level metrics peterson et al 2012 from this study a new opls multivariate model was established to draw up the best predictive variables of ros production based on the inclusion of three year samples in both floods and droughts β α based photochemical prediction models could be generalized to other inland waters along the yangtze river with simultaneous temporal duration significant hydrological fluctuations e g the rotation of flood and drought periods and geographical spans further dom molecular moisture characterization interpretations and wide ranging natural sample analyses are known to further refine the photochemical predictability on dom 3 5 impacts on contaminants attenuation between the flood and drought period due to the influence of anthropogenic and environmental variations enhanced concentrations of contaminants were usually detected in poyang lake sunday et al 2020 to elucidate the significance of ros for contaminant degradation the half lives of acetochlors were investigated as shown in table 3 acetochlor was one of the most widely deployed herbicides with prone to bioaccumulation and biomagnification in food chains photodegradation reactions of acetochlor induced by ros were found related to r o s ss and the second order rate constants between the contaminants and ros felcyn et al 2012 li et al 2016 the half lives of acetochlors calculated by 3 c d o m ss 1 o 2 ss and o h ss in the flood period were 36 31 4 73 h which were significantly lower than those in the drought period 46 63 8 71 h p 0 05 suggested that the indirect photodegradation of 3cdom 1o2 and oh on organic contaminants played an important role in poyang lake especially during the flood period previous work on the photodegradation of acetochlor in prairie pothole waters also showed the decisive role of 3 c d o m ss and 1 o 2 ss zeng and arnold 2013 ros played a key role in nutrients biogeochemical cycles which also had significant impacts on environmental pollutants migration toxicity and bioavailability morris et al 2022 the change of production of ros during flood and drought periods may also affect the environmental behavior of nutrients and pollutants during the flood periods the main origin of surface water pollution is the flow of organic contaminants from catchments agricultural soils and ponds urban areas wetlands a great photoproduction capacity of 3cdom 1o2 and oh had a positive effect on the refractory contaminants during the drought periods weak photochemical capacity might lead to the accumulation of pollutants considering the difference of photochemical activity during different periods it was also of great significance for understanding emerging contaminants prevention 4 conclusions doms in poyang lake were characterized with endogenous sources in droughts period but strong allochthonous inputs in the floods period the terrestrial plant lysis and soil leaching were important entry pathways for nearshore dom sources during the flood period the inclusion of heterogenous dom promoted the photochemical quantum yields of ros new multivariate prediction models based on β α upon the inclusion of temporal scale dom samples facilitated the comprehension of dom photoactivity characteristics and elucidated the significance of ros produced from dom for contaminant degradation considering that steady state concentrations of ros dramatically diminished the half lives of organic contaminants during floods this study can contribute to a new insight into stage specific self purification process for natural water bodies
