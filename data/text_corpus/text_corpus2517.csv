12585,phosphorus is one of the pollutant s parameters causing environmental pollution known as eutrophication coagulation flocculation is a widely known technology to treat phosphorus containing wastewater however using metal based coagulants raises some environmental concerns related to their toxicity natural coagulants offer an option to treat wastewater containing phosphorus with comparable performance to chemical coagulants the utilization of natural coagulants removed phosphorus as phosphate from wastewater with an efficiency of up to 99 6 removal of phosphate from wastewater by natural coagulant was highly correlated with the charge neutralization mechanism the use of phosphate rich resultant sludge as soil conditioner fertilizer is made possible by using natural coagulant compared to metal based coagulant due to its lower metal content and toxicity to plants and aquatic organisms the combination of treatment with other technologies such as the filtration unit showed significant improvement in phosphorus removal which also alleviated the load of the next unit including ultraviolet disinfection whose performance might be affected by high solid content despite its promising performance the selection of raw materials extraction and purification of natural coagulants become the major challenge in the further application of this option this review article discusses the aforementioned topics and highlights future research directions of developing simpler extraction purification processes of natural coagulants and analysis of natural coagulants performance in treating different speciation of phosphorus in wastewater to enhance this particular knowledge graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coagulation environmental pollution natural coagulant phosphate phosphorus removal wastewater treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction wastewater generally exhibits only a low phosphorus concentration therein the harm lies in the discharge of the water into the larger water body resulting in adverse environmental setbacks phosphorus is a vital nutrient for plant growth because phosphorus is usually present in very low concentrations it acts as a growth limiting factor however excess phosphorus in the soil reduces the plant s ability to absorb essential micronutrients especially iron and zinc 1 2 eutrophication occurs due to the profuse growth of algae and aquatic plants simulated by abundant nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus in water this causes extreme dissolved oxygen changing during the day and night abundant during the day as photosynthesis results and depleted during the night due to respiration resulting in the death of fish and other aquatic animals in the water competing with the respiration with algae and aquatic plants 3 water quality will be depreciated regarding extreme turbidity unpleasant smell and taste and low dissolved oxygen concentration identifying as a health hazard to humans and animals phosphate substances are among the most challenging pollutants significantly affecting surface and groundwater negatively globally thus the presence of phosphate and eutrophication will cause an increase in the cost of water treatment the weeds and algae grown may also obstruct the water filters and pollute the drinking water the world health organization permits a maximum of 5 mg l of phosphate level in the form of total p as safe in drinking water 4 5 the complexity of phosphorus removal from wastewater is because of its varying modes and compositions in the water the primary sources of phosphate accumulation in wastewater are agricultural manure generated during livestock production domestic human excreta and synthetic detergents and industrial activities shown in fig 1 fertilizers used on agricultural or domesticated land are also transferred into surface water by storm runoff rain and melting snow 6 thus water phosphates can be primarily reduced by regulating phosphate content in soap detergents installing domestic sewage wastewater collection and treatment plants and measures to recover animal wastes according to parsons and smith 7 municipal wastewater contains both dissolved and particulate forms of phosphorus the majority which is present as dissolved phosphate comprises about 50 orthophosphate 35 condensed phosphates and 15 organic phosphates municipal wastewater typically contains between 6 and 8 mg l of total phosphorus 7 household detergents are one of the most contributing materials that increase phosphorus the internationally accepted level of phosphates is set at an overall limit of 0 5 by weight by the european union 8 9 phosphates sodium pyrophosphate and sodium tripolyphosphate are used in dish and laundry detergent production to aid water softening remove oil grease and soil and prevent spotting and film build up in the detergents furthermore phosphate acted as a hardness caused by ca2 and mg2 ions binding agent aid preventing fatty soil oil and grease from emulsifying by the surfactant in addition phosphate in the form of tripolyphosphate has a ph of 10 which then helps stabilise the surfactants alkalinity 10 alkaline ph was known to facilitate the reactions between impurities and detergent composition such as sodium disilicate and sodium carbonate maintaining the dispersed dirt in the water and preventing them from penetrating the clothes 11 phosphorus is commonly found in wastewaters as organic compounds orthophosphates and polyphosphates orthophosphates and polyphosphate make up about 70 90 of the phosphorus in drain liquids while the former is usually available for biological metabolism without further breakdown the polyphosphates require hydrolysis to regress the orthophosphates making the breakdown process very slow 12 13 phosphorus management is complex because it requires detecting extremely low concentrations as low as 0 01 mg l on the other hand low phosphorus concentrations can still significantly impact the water bodies table 1 shows the various tests for measuring phosphorus in water 16 most of these tests frequently rely on orthophosphate measurement because the measurements depend on the digestion and transformation of other forms of phosphorus to orthophosphate the two general approaches for determining phosphorus are converting the targeted form of phosphorus to dissolved orthophosphate and colorimetrically evaluating the dissolved orthophosphate the ascorbic acid method is the most reliable technique to assess phosphate in the form of orthophosphate in terms of reagent usage and test time taken with an accurate reading of low phosphate concentration in the range of 0 02 to 0 2 mg l 17 thus wastewater treatment plants are tasked to reduce the phosphorus content in the water to a maximum p concentration of 2 mg l before discharging into the environment biological aerobic and anaerobic removal processes physical use of filters and chemical ion exchange electro coagulation 19 coagulation flocculation 20 electrodialysis chemical and precipitation 21 methods are currently used to remove phosphorus from water 22 the biological treatment processes were reported to exhibit poor performance in removing phosphate although unreliably the enhanced biological phosphate removal techniques have achieved nearly 100 phosphorus removal 23 the treatment methods demand a large land area high energy and optimal aeration to function correctly the inefficiency in phosphate removal and the high cost of some physical techniques such as membrane filtration electrodialysis and reverse osmosis have been the significant drawbacks of their usage the membrane reactors experience a significant problem of membrane fouling which leads to poor performance it causes a reduction in the filter s lifespan and increases the energy required for the process the phosphorus retention capacity of most filter materials also critically diminishes after a 5 year timeline of usage 24 the physicochemical treatment methods are effective and reliable they are used singularly as primary treatment or advanced for other phosphorus removal methods 25 common coagulation flocculation involves the application of metal salts including aluminium iron and calcium to act as coagulants for example polyaluminium chloride was used by wang et al 26 to treat municipal wastewater with 80 of total phosphorus removal efficiency swami et al 27 reported the utilization of aluminium sulphates to remove phosphate from wastewater with removal efficiency reaching 90 chemical coagulant was also used by liu zhou 20 which resulted in 68 phosphate removal from glycine wastewater however these chemical coagulants have been reported to be detrimental to human health and the environment due to the presence of residual metal ions in the excess amount of the generated sludge and the cost could also increase the operating cost 28 furthermore aluminium residues in treated wastewater or marine habitats may be linked to alzheimer s disease 29 studies claimed that aluminium ions are responsible for major cholinergic signaling mechanisms in the brain alteration of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway and bound with beta amyloid which may cause alzheimer s disease 30 33 natural coagulants offer an option to substitute the utilization of metal based coagulants alnawajha et al 34 mentioned the effectiveness of using leucaena leucocephala seeds to treat turbid water with a removal efficiency of turbidity reaching 93 05 chitosan was also found effective in removing solids and organic contents from aquaculture wastewater 35 ahmad et al 36 also mentioned the use of azadirachta indica which was able to remove turbidity 82 7 suspended solid 81 4 and color 65 8 turunen et al 37 used a tannic coagulant tanfloc obtained from acacia mearnsii de wild bark is effective at 5 8 ml l doses to treat agricultural wastewater the coagulant reduced the toc turbidity and phosphorus by 22 82 and 70 respectively rajesh et al 38 attempted to reduce the phosphorus level in industrial wastewater obtained firework production industry the potential of cassia alata hyacinth bean banana leaves carica papaya acacia mearnsii jatropha curcas cactus and tamarind seeds as coagulants were investigated achieving a removal of 75 the hyacinth bean was the most effective coagulant followed by casuarina leaves 74 and banana leaves 73 while at 56 tamarind seed exhibits the least removal other coagulants including rice husk and moringa oleifera seed coagulants were reported to exhibit high phosphate removal performance 39 to the best of our knowledge a review on phosphorus removal from wastewater using natural coagulants is currently rare while research on this topic is still scarce 2 bibliometric analysis on natural coagulants research bibliometric analysis was conducted based on kurniawan et al 1 with metadata extracted from the scopus database showed that research on coagulation and natural coagulant is highly increasing for the past 10 years fig 2 however natural coagulant research is still considered low composition for the whole coagulation research comprised of only 1 9 of the total indexed articles in scopus in addition to the increasing number of articles for the past 10 years keyword and term co occurrence maps fig 3 constructed following ramadan et al 33 based on the natural coagulant research showed that phosphate is currently still limitedly discussed as indicated by the absence of phosphorus related compounds in both keyword and term co occurrence maps based on the extracted natural coagulant article s metadata for the last 10 years n 1481 the parameter of chemical oxygen demand dissolved organic carbon natural organic matter color iron and sulphur compounds showed a strength keyword link with a natural coagulant solid particle color and chemical oxygen demand parameters from the term analysis showed the strongest term correlation 40 both keyword and term co occurrence maps revealed that research on phosphate removal using natural coagulants is currently very limited considering the presented literature gaps this review article discusses using natural coagulants in phosphate removal from wastewater the involved mechanism during removal and the potential utilization of the recovered sludge after treatment in addition this review also details the history of utilization and production of natural coagulants from various sources as well as the practical concerns and future approaches for further applications and research directions 3 phosphate removal by coagulation process chemical precipitation of phosphate which requires the addition of a coagulant and mixing the wastewater with the coagulant is used to remove inorganic forms of phosphate pollutants in wastewater are usually negatively charged with repulsive forces resulting from the similarity in their charges preventing settling the coagulation process is achieved by charge neutralization polymer bridging adsorption and sweep flocculation mechanisms to destabilize the particles and facilitate floc development coagulants remove turbidity color heavy metals dye chemical oxygen demand cod natural organic matter nom and biochemical oxygen demand bod from wastewater 28 the coagulation and flocculation processes work simultaneously with coagulation preceding coagulation is also used as a primary treatment to further improve the efficiency of secondary treatment techniques flocculation improves sedimentation by increasing floc size density and settling rate it is noteworthy that several coagulants have been used in phosphate removal with remarkable accomplishments the advantages and disadvantages of phosphorus removal via the coagulation process are tabulated in table 2 3 1 technologies of phosphate removal by coagulation coagulation and flocculation are vital processes in the formation of precipitates flocs first the added coagulants are rapidly stirred in the wastewater and then the speed is reduced for slow mixing for the specified time the mixing is stopped to allow sedimentation few studies have shown the technologies of phosphate removal from wastewater which could be based on adsorption or chemical precipitation both mechanisms effectively recover phosphates in the liquid phase 22 the chemical reactions in this process help the formerly soluble phosphates in water by precipitation to form insoluble phosphate products the precipitate will then be removed by sedimentation 28 broadly the incorporation of phosphates to the solid particles in the water direct adsorption of phosphate ions of the products from hydrolysis reactions formed after the addition of the coagulants to the water and the formation of insoluble solids with the ions from the coagulants are mechanisms attributed to phosphate removal from wastewater however adsorption was reported to play a more critical part in phosphate removal than precipitation 42 the most satisfactory mechanism considers phosphorus removal a continuous series of adsorption and precipitation which involves reversible and irreversible precipitation processes the selection of suitable coagulants is crucial as the coagulation process itself chemical precipitation of phosphates via coagulation flocculation and sedimentation process has been practiced for many years to remove and recover phosphate from wastewater although wastewater is discharged in large volumes from the industries this treatment technique allows the high volume of waste to be considerably decreased and removed before further treatments the phosphates will thus be removed alongside the solid particulates in the water 43 adsorption reaction is another chemical technique for phosphate removal from wastewater polyphosphates and organic phosphorus are removed by this method but with limitations rather than precipitation the adsorption was described as removing phosphorus using aluminium or iron hydroxides with ph being a significant factor in the removal process nevertheless chemical precipitation is dependable and efficient for achieving lower phosphate effluent levels with high coagulant doses at the same time the treatment costs can be minimized by combining the process with sophisticated filtering equipment to remove fine phosphate precipitates 44 multi valent cations usually ca2 al3 and fe3 react with the soluble phosphates to precipitate insoluble compounds such as ca3 po4 2 alpo4 and fepo4 the subsequent solid residues are then removed either by sedimentation or filtration technique for chemical coagulants the most used coagulants include aluminium sulphate ferric chloride and calcium oxide lime 42 aluminium sulphate is an expensive but highly effective coagulant it reacts with the soluble phosphate in the water to produce insoluble aluminium phosphates its optimum ph range for phosphate removal is 5 7 although the coagulant dosage and ph play a vital role in the removal efficiency the coagulant was reported to achieve an 80 90 removal efficiency at a dosage between 50 and 200 mg l and decreased at a higher coagulant dosage although a coagulant dose above 150 mg l does not significantly affect the bod or tss removal it negatively affects the microbial population in the sludge and increases the residual metal ions 27 ferric based coagulants ferric sulphate or chloride and ferrous sulphate are less expensive and more effective on average than aluminium based coagulants they react with phosphates to form ferric phosphate and are reportedly more efficient under acidic conditions the optimum coagulation ph for ferric salts is considered to be around 3 7 to 4 5 45 therefore ferric chloride is the most used chemical coagulant in phosphate removal from wastewater treatment calcium based coagulants are the least used due to their difficulty handling and high sludge production the calcium ions provided by lime efficiently react in alkaline wastewater of ph beyond 10 and the calcium ions react with the soluble phosphate to produce a hydroxylapatite precipitate 46 lime is economical and highly effective for the precipitation of phosphates and a few other trace metals some researchers reported the removal of total phosphorus up to 93 the phosphate precipitate formed by the action of the sweep coagulation mechanism captures the colloidal particles and increases their density to improve sedimentation 47 alum ferric based salts polyaluminum chloride pacl and other chemical coagulants commonly used in typical coagulation wastewater treatment processes are reportedly effective and expensive nevertheless they are not entirely safe as they deposit some metal salt residues in their sludge and the treated water they are non biodegradable and are found to be toxic to the aquatic habitat and human health 28 48 3 2 introduction to natural coagulants and their use for phosphate removal coagulation flocculation electro coagulation reverse osmosis biofiltration membrane filtration and sorption are chemical physical and biological processes used for water wastewater treatment 49 among these processes coagulation flocculation is one of the widely used water wastewater treatment methods the coagulation flocculation processes were reported to be dated early 1500 bce when the egyptians used aluminium sulfate alum to remove suspended solids 50 51 although the early romans were also familiar with alum its utilization was mentioned only until 77 ce as a coagulant in water treatment 51 52 the application of coagulants in modern use for full scale water treatment started 100 years ago with ferric chloride and alum used as coagulants the most common chemical coagulants consist of alum salts alum aluminium chloride and sodium aluminate and iron salts ferric chloride ferric sulfate and ferric chloride sulphate 51 the coagulant is an essential element in the coagulation and flocculation process to agglomerate the colloidal particles which later form settleable flocs through stirring and the flocs can be separated with sedimentation flotation or filtration 53 with using chemical coagulants the drawbacks could come from the increased corrosivity of product water caused by sulphate and chlorine derived from alum and ferric salts and the high risk of plant toxicity and disease in animals and humans such as alzheimer s disease 54 55 with the growing concern to overcome the drawbacks of chemical coagulants the interest has shifted towards investigating natural coagulants as alternative sources are considered more environmentally friendly the coagulants known as natural coagulants can be derived from the natural source of plants leaves seeds mucilage waste animals chitin and microorganisms bacteria fungi algae 56 57 natural coagulants are considered low cost biodegradable and abundant in the source 57 however its metallic characteristics cause the toxicities of chemical coagulants alzheimer s disease is related to aluminium al the plant toxicity of utilized produced sludge is associated with the high concentration of fe and al while the aquatic microorganism is also harmed by the fe and al salts 58 60 removing the metallic characteristics from produced sludge after coagulation by substituting the metal based chemical coagulants with bio based coagulants may reduce the produced sludge toxicity and its environmental impacts 61 62 the resultant biodegradable biopolymer sludge could be readily used as a phosphorus fertilizer researchers have explored the usage of natural coagulants in water and wastewater treatment to investigate and find the best natural coagulant that could substitute chemical coagulants presented in table 4 research conducted by pandey et al 63 in urban wastewater treatment by using mixed plant coagulants of guar gum gg seeds duckweed dw and indian plum ip to investigate the removal of nutrient phosphate and nitrate turbidity and cod the initial phosphate concentration was at 15 62 mg l and various ranges of coagulant dosage were introduced 1 2 3 and 5 ml l the result indicated that the experiment removed phosphate within 78 3 96 9 and the optimum dosage used was 3 ml l the adsorption bridging mechanism is suggested to be predominant in removing phosphate from wastewater 64 the biopolymers in the coagulants cluster the colloidal charges and destabilize them to form larger flocs that eventually settle due to flocculation and accumulate the larger flocs to settle at the base as sludge the biopolymer in the coagulant uses a polymer bridging and charge neutralization mechanism through colloidal charge adsorption to reduce phosphate and other nutrients in the water in the form of precipitates and flocs the flocs settled contain the attached and unattached particles of polymer with the pollutants in conclusion applying crude extract coagulants derived from gg seed ip and dw leaves are practical low cost coagulants for pollutant removal from urban wastewater 63 mohamed et al 65 evaluated the efficiency of natural coagulants moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum in car wash wastewater treatment they compared them with chemical coagulants alum and ferrous sulphate to remove phosphorus turbidity cod total suspended solids tss and ph with the coagulant dosage varying from 3 mg l 200 mg l the obtained result for moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum was 75 and 65 of phosphorus removal respectively while alum and ferrous sulphate indicated 81 and 65 of phosphorus removal respectively based on the data the seed from both plants of natural coagulants contained coagulating substances that can also remove turbidity up to 99 some of the advantages and limitations of using natural coagulants for phosphorus removal from wastewater are given in table 3 4 preparation of natural coagulant for phosphate removal natural coagulants have required some preparations to be valuable products for water and wastewater treatment this preparation method is divided into three primary secondary and tertiary stages from powder formation to purification 56 69 the flowchart of the natural coagulant processing stage is presented in fig 4 in the first stage the important key is to select the usable parts from the selected natural sources to be used as natural coagulants by considering their respective coagulating properties which are essential for the coagulation and flocculation process the usable part might be unique for the different species as for cacti the vascular tissue is the usable part for the process and the rest skin and spine of the plant will be eliminated but for aloe species the functional parts could be from mature leaves and spines 70 the selected parts will be cleaned with water to remove any impurities sandstones grains however in some instances the pre treatment is introduced by washing the usable parts with chemicals acid alkaline solutions such as acetone n methyl piperazinium chloride ethanol hcl mercaptoacetic acid propane sulfonic acid the function of the acid is to remove any minerals on the surface while alkali acts as a neutralizing agent for acid 69 71 after cleaning the usable parts will be dried using an oven or direct sunlight based on preferred and respective methods available and then blended into a raw powder this raw powder can be directly used as a natural coagulant for water wastewater treatment but is not encouraged due to the findings that the coagulating properties are not fully extracted and may lead to a low removal performance 56 72 thus this raw powder will undergo the secondary stage knowns as extraction where different extracted solutions extractants such as water alcohols and salts 73 the mixture extractants with the raw powder will be stirred and then filtered to remove any suspended solids the supernatant from the mixture will be collected and could be used as a natural coagulant the contents of coagulating properties will be evaluated and compared with the different extractants and the best will be selected where the extractant produces high coagulating properties the selected supernatant can be further processed into pure powder by a more complex process in the final stage tertiary where the purification methods such as lyophilization ion exchange and dialysis can be introduced for example the supernatant can be processed through freeze drying to produce a purer powder of natural coagulant changing the form of the supernatant liquid form into powder pure could reduce the deterioration rate of the supernatant 56 and better the surface morphology solubility and water activity 74 however the tertiary stage is rarely performed and is limited for the research study due to the expensive costs 69 5 phosphate removal mechanism using natural coagulant phosphate is mentioned as the most existing phosphorus speciation to exist in wastewater 75 phosphate has high solubility making it difficult for mechanical separation processes 76 omwene et al 77 mentioned that electrodialysis and reverse osmosis had unsatisfactory total phosphate removal from water with only 10 maximum removal the high phosphate solubility causes the mechanical processes such as centrifugation and screw press separator to become too expensive to be applied with efficiency reaching only 40 78 79 coagulation and flocculation remove the soluble phosphate in wastewater by destabilising the negative charge of phosphate via charge neutralization which may only be performed by a positively charged green coagulant 80 m oleifera was reported to be one of the most used green coagulants with a highly positive zeta potential charge 81 83 the proposed mechanism of coagulation and flocculation of phosphate using a positively charged green coagulant is depicted in fig 5 positively charged natural coagulants have the potential to remove phosphate from the water via a process known as co precipitation when added to water these coagulants can interact with negatively charged phosphorus molecules to produce insoluble precipitates following that processes like sedimentation or filtration can be used to remove these precipitates from the water co precipitation is caused by the formation of chemical bonds between the negatively charged phosphorus ions and the positively charged coagulant ions coagulant ions can donate electrons to phosphorus ions resulting in the formation of a chemical bond as a result of this bond the phosphorus ions become less soluble in water forming a precipitate 84 85 additionally phosphorus can be removed from water using natural coagulants through an adsorption process in which the coagulant ions attach to the surface of the phosphorus molecules this is notably useful for removing dissolved phosphorus from water 86 the phosphorus removal mechanism via natural coagulants depends on the coagulant used and the treatment conditions 6 hybridization with other techniques most phosphorus compounds in wastewater are water soluble and only chemical precipitation may not remove them satisfactorily hence to improve the efficiency of the coagulation process the chemical precipitation technique is fused with other techniques to remove the phosphorus from the wastewater before discharge various other methods for phosphorus removal have been effective but have individual shortcomings physical processes i e electrodialysis and reverse osmosis are too expensive furthermore the phosphorus removal effectiveness of biological treatment approaches is often limited this could be due to the presence of phosphorus in water in various forms including organic and inorganic forms and some forms are more difficult to remove than others 87 in addition the limitation could result from the presence of other contaminants in the water such as high levels of nitrogen or other pollutants that can interfere with the biological processes responsible for phosphorus removal 88 89 thus the treatments are inadequate for complete removal and other methods and technologies are needed to reinforce and improve removal efficiency however the techniques or processes should be economically feasible less expensive and highly efficient techniques with minimum chemical and energy usage required 90 for example although it is highly ph dependent the electro coagulation process could remove up to 97 65 phosphorus from wastewater using aluminium electrodes 91 in addition electro coagulation can be used as a secondary technique to further precipitate the phosphorus in the coagulation treated water membrane and dual media filtration are other technologies combined with the coagulation flocculation process for efficient phosphate removal although membrane filtration requires high energy consumption and media filtration also demands a large footprint they are techniques considered an advancement in wastewater treatment plants 92 furthermore as a kind of development several researchers have researched and reported the possibility of merging some filtering procedures with the coagulation flocculation process such as reactive filtration the techniques include the microsieve technology 92 and pile cloth filtration 93 which could be hybridized with the coagulation process to improve phosphate removal recovery from wastewater microsieve technology is one of the most recent advancements in membrane filtration and it is a technology reported as precision technology for absolute filtration micro sieves are also said to outperform regular membranes by 50 100 times additionally they feature a smooth microscopic surface a well defined pore shape and an absolute pore sized distribution with a standard deviation of 1 gidstedt et al 94 reported combining coagulation flocculation units supplemented with al3 coagulant and polymers and microsieve technology resulting in 37 removal of sulfamethoxazole microsieve technology also removed 73 of solids from wastewater which improved the uv disinfection performance afterwards by 18 95 furthermore coagulation is achieved by adding chemicals that cause the particles to form larger aggregates which can then be removed by sedimentation or filtration using calcium rich hydrated ash as filter material can also effectively remove phosphorus from water combining coagulation and using calcium rich hydrated ash filters can effectively remove phosphorus from water to maintain water quality other technologies combined with the coagulation process to increase phosphate removal while lowering the treatment cost include ion exchange magnetic microsorbents and electrodialysis 44 7 recovery and further use of recovered po4 rich sludge phosphate rich pollutants from domestic sewage agricultural and industrial sources contaminate the larger water bodies making them unsafe for consumption the primary objective of the coagulation flocculation process is to remove the phosphate however during the sedimentation process phosphate is present in the sludge one of the negative aspects of using this technique is the increased sludge production thus to balance the cost of treatment the recovered phosphorus rich sludge may be used directly or recycled into fertilizers soil conditioners and other raw materials 96 these products can be used in agricultural and chemical industries phosphorus is one of the three most essential ingredients in fertilizer making the others nitrogen and potassium phosphorus sources with high concentrations such as animal waste and manure usually have lower quantities while phosphorus from sewage and municipal wastewater is in low concentrations with high volumes up to 20 mg l 41 the free orthophosphate can be taken directly by water plants and algae this type of phosphorus can be used directly in their production to mitigate the economic and environmental expenses associated with sludge transport and management the generated sludge is proposed to be used as a raw material for thermal energy i e biogas production via anaerobic digestion after undesirable components such as heavy metals phosphate and nitrate rich sludge have been removed the sludge may compose impurities such as organic pollutants and heavy metals which should be removed before further processing 43 composting was reported to be a suitable technology to process sludge further before being used as a soil conditioner or fertilizer composting may further degrade the residual organic materials while improving the sludge quality due to stabilizing the c n ratio 97 suppose the residual heavy metals in sludge are under the permissible limit in that case it may be used directly as a soil conditioner or fertilizer since it can be useful for plants under trace concentration 98 at the same time the acid leaching procedure was reported to be the most suitable technology to remove heavy metals from sludge before further utilization 99 100 magnesium ammonium phosphate commonly known as struvite has fewer impurities than commercial phosphates it also has a broad range of soil ph at acidity and neutral making it a potential for soil fertilizer material 41 101 8 practical concerns and future approaches compared to other biological or chemical methods researchers still have limitedly discussed the separation of phosphate by green coagulant 102 104 the limited utilization of green coagulants to remove phosphate is highly related to the various speciation of phosphorus in wastewater 76 and the inadequate studies on the mechanism of phosphorus removal by green coagulants 105 phosphorus may exist in various speciations like phosphate orthophosphate organic p inorganic p and poly p the variation of p speciation in wastewater requires different handling to achieve high removal efficiency 43 for example poly p is a complex compound produced from the complexation with chemicals or microbial enzymatic reactions 106 which is considered harder to be removed by coagulation and flocculation since the p removal by coagulation and flocculation using green coagulant mostly relayed to the destabilization of surface charge analysis of specific green coagulant species for specific p speciation is considered to shorten the decision making for wastewater treatment specific green coagulant species will perform differently for different p speciation which makes the coagulation flocculation mechanism study is also interesting to be studied further 9 conclusions although several techniques are currently available the coagulation flocculation process has shown great potency in removing phosphorus from wastewater the coagulants typically used are based on metal ions while guar gum tamarindus indica moringa oleifera seeds duckweed leaf and tannins are a few natural coagulants potentially used to remove phosphate from water natural coagulants performance in treating wastewater reached 99 removal of solids while phosphate removal ranged from 65 to 99 6 phosphate removal in wastewater by natural coagulant is subjected to charge neutralization mechanisms the selection of raw materials and complex purification of raw materials for natural coagulants are currently the major challenges for further application of this option on a larger scale developing more straightforward extraction procedures with high purification efficiency may advance this research further the hybridization of coagulation technology by natural coagulants with other treatment technologies such as filtration including microsieve reverse osmosis and pile cloth units was reported to enhance phosphate removal from wastewater significantly the utilization of natural coagulants also showed a positive side regarding resultant sludge utilization as soil condition or fertilizer since it consisted of low metal ions and low toxicity compared to the resulting sludge from the treatment with metal based coagulants to plants and even aquatic organisms research in the performance and mechanisms of different natural coagulants to various speciation of phosphorus in wastewater is highly suggested as future research direction to enrich the knowledge of phosphorus

12585,phosphorus is one of the pollutant s parameters causing environmental pollution known as eutrophication coagulation flocculation is a widely known technology to treat phosphorus containing wastewater however using metal based coagulants raises some environmental concerns related to their toxicity natural coagulants offer an option to treat wastewater containing phosphorus with comparable performance to chemical coagulants the utilization of natural coagulants removed phosphorus as phosphate from wastewater with an efficiency of up to 99 6 removal of phosphate from wastewater by natural coagulant was highly correlated with the charge neutralization mechanism the use of phosphate rich resultant sludge as soil conditioner fertilizer is made possible by using natural coagulant compared to metal based coagulant due to its lower metal content and toxicity to plants and aquatic organisms the combination of treatment with other technologies such as the filtration unit showed significant improvement in phosphorus removal which also alleviated the load of the next unit including ultraviolet disinfection whose performance might be affected by high solid content despite its promising performance the selection of raw materials extraction and purification of natural coagulants become the major challenge in the further application of this option

globally thus the presence of phosphate and eutrophication will cause an increase in the cost of water treatment the weeds and algae grown may also obstruct the water filters and pollute the drinking water the world health organization permits a maximum of 5 mg l of phosphate level in the form of total p as safe in drinking water 4 5 the complexity of phosphorus removal from wastewater is because of its varying modes and compositions in the water the primary sources of phosphate accumulation in wastewater are agricultural manure generated during livestock production domestic human excreta and synthetic detergents and industrial activities shown in fig 1 fertilizers used on agricultural or domesticated land are also transferred into surface water by storm runoff rain and melting snow 6 thus water phosphates can be primarily reduced by regulating phosphate content in soap detergents installing domestic sewage wastewater collection and treatment plants and measures to recover animal wastes according to parsons and smith 7 municipal wastewater contains both dissolved and particulate forms of phosphorus the majority which is present as dissolved phosphate comprises about 50 orthophosphate 35 condensed phosphates and 15 organic phosphates municipal wastewater typically contains between 6 and 8 mg l of total phosphorus 7 household detergents are one of the most contributing materials that increase phosphorus the internationally accepted level of phosphates is set at an overall limit of 0 5 by weight by the european union 8 9 phosphates sodium pyrophosphate and sodium tripolyphosphate are used in dish and laundry detergent production to aid water softening remove oil grease and soil and prevent spotting and film build up in the detergents furthermore phosphate acted as a hardness caused by ca2 and mg2 ions binding agent aid preventing fatty soil oil and grease from emulsifying by the surfactant in addition phosphate in the form of tripolyphosphate has a ph of 10 which then helps stabilise the surfactants alkalinity 10 alkaline ph was known to facilitate the reactions between impurities and detergent composition such as sodium disilicate and sodium carbonate maintaining the dispersed dirt in the water and preventing them from penetrating the clothes 11 phosphorus is commonly found in wastewaters as organic compounds orthophosphates and polyphosphates orthophosphates and polyphosphate make up about 70 90 of the phosphorus in drain liquids while the former is usually available for biological metabolism without further breakdown the polyphosphates require hydrolysis to regress the orthophosphates making the breakdown process very slow 12 13 phosphorus management is complex because it requires detecting extremely low concentrations as low as 0 01 mg l on the other hand low phosphorus concentrations can still significantly impact the water bodies table 1 shows the various tests for measuring phosphorus in water 16 most of these tests frequently rely on orthophosphate measurement because the measurements depend on the digestion and transformation of other forms of phosphorus to orthophosphate the two general approaches for determining phosphorus are converting the targeted form of phosphorus to dissolved orthophosphate and colorimetrically evaluating the dissolved orthophosphate the ascorbic acid method is the most reliable technique to assess phosphate in the form of orthophosphate in terms of reagent usage and test time taken with an accurate reading of low phosphate concentration in the range of 0 02 to 0 2 mg l 17 thus wastewater treatment plants are tasked to reduce the phosphorus content in the water to a maximum p concentration of 2 mg l before discharging into the environment biological aerobic and anaerobic removal processes physical use of filters and chemical ion exchange electro coagulation 19 coagulation flocculation 20 electrodialysis chemical and precipitation 21 methods are currently used to remove phosphorus from water 22 the biological treatment processes were reported to exhibit poor performance in removing phosphate although unreliably the enhanced biological phosphate removal techniques have achieved nearly 100 phosphorus removal 23 the treatment methods demand a large land area high energy and optimal aeration to function correctly the inefficiency in phosphate removal and the high cost of some physical techniques such as membrane filtration electrodialysis and reverse osmosis have been the significant drawbacks of their usage the membrane reactors experience a significant problem of membrane fouling which leads to poor performance it causes a reduction in the filter s lifespan and increases the energy required for the process the phosphorus retention capacity of most filter materials also critically diminishes after a 5 year timeline of usage 24 the physicochemical treatment methods are effective and reliable they are used singularly as primary treatment or advanced for other phosphorus removal methods 25 common coagulation flocculation involves the application of metal salts including aluminium iron and calcium to act as coagulants for example polyaluminium chloride was used by wang et al 26 to treat municipal wastewater with 80 of total phosphorus removal efficiency swami et al 27 reported the utilization of aluminium sulphates to remove phosphate from wastewater with removal efficiency reaching 90 chemical coagulant was also used by liu zhou 20 which resulted in 68 phosphate removal from glycine wastewater however these chemical coagulants have been reported to be detrimental to human health and the environment due to the presence of residual metal ions in the excess amount of the generated sludge and the cost could also increase the operating cost 28 furthermore aluminium residues in treated wastewater or marine habitats may be linked to alzheimer s disease 29 studies claimed that aluminium ions are responsible for major cholinergic signaling mechanisms in the brain alteration of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway and bound with beta amyloid which may cause alzheimer s disease 30 33 natural coagulants offer an option to substitute the utilization of metal based coagulants alnawajha et al 34 mentioned the effectiveness of using leucaena leucocephala seeds to treat turbid water with a removal efficiency of turbidity reaching 93 05 chitosan was also found effective in removing solids and organic contents from aquaculture wastewater 35 ahmad et al 36 also mentioned the use of azadirachta indica which was able to remove turbidity 82 7 suspended solid 81 4 and color 65 8 turunen et al 37 used a tannic coagulant tanfloc obtained from acacia mearnsii de wild bark is effective at 5 8 ml l doses to treat agricultural wastewater the coagulant reduced the toc turbidity and phosphorus by 22 82 and 70 respectively rajesh et al 38 attempted to reduce the phosphorus level in industrial wastewater obtained firework production industry the potential of cassia alata hyacinth bean banana leaves carica papaya acacia mearnsii jatropha curcas cactus and tamarind seeds as coagulants were investigated achieving a removal of 75 the hyacinth bean was the most effective coagulant followed by casuarina leaves 74 and banana leaves 73 while at 56 tamarind seed exhibits the least removal other coagulants including rice husk and moringa oleifera seed coagulants were reported to exhibit high phosphate removal performance 39 to the best of our knowledge a review on phosphorus removal from wastewater using natural coagulants is currently rare while research on this topic is still scarce 2 bibliometric analysis on natural coagulants research bibliometric analysis was conducted based on kurniawan et al 1 with metadata extracted from the scopus database showed that research on coagulation and natural coagulant is highly increasing for the past 10 years fig 2 however natural coagulant research is still considered low composition for the whole coagulation research comprised of only 1 9 of the total indexed articles in scopus in addition to the increasing number of articles for the past 10 years keyword and term co occurrence maps fig 3 constructed following ramadan et al 33 based on the natural coagulant research showed that phosphate is currently still limitedly discussed as indicated by the absence of phosphorus related compounds in both keyword and term co occurrence maps based on the extracted natural coagulant article s metadata for the last 10 years n 1481 the parameter of chemical oxygen demand dissolved organic carbon natural organic matter color iron and sulphur compounds showed a strength keyword link with a natural coagulant solid particle color and chemical oxygen demand parameters from the term analysis showed the strongest term correlation 40 both keyword and term co occurrence maps revealed that research on phosphate removal using natural coagulants is currently very limited considering the presented literature gaps this review article discusses using natural coagulants in phosphate removal from wastewater the involved mechanism during removal and the potential utilization of the recovered sludge after treatment in addition this review also details the history of utilization and production of natural coagulants from various sources as well as the practical concerns and future approaches for further applications and research directions 3 phosphate removal by coagulation process chemical precipitation of phosphate which requires the addition of a coagulant and mixing the wastewater with the coagulant is used to remove inorganic forms of phosphate pollutants in wastewater are usually negatively charged with repulsive forces resulting from the similarity in their charges preventing settling the coagulation process is achieved by charge neutralization polymer bridging adsorption and sweep flocculation mechanisms to destabilize the particles and facilitate floc development coagulants remove turbidity color heavy metals dye chemical oxygen demand cod natural organic matter nom and biochemical oxygen demand bod from wastewater 28 the coagulation and flocculation processes work simultaneously with coagulation preceding coagulation is also used as a primary treatment to further improve the efficiency of secondary treatment techniques flocculation improves sedimentation by increasing floc size density and settling rate it is noteworthy that several coagulants have been used in phosphate removal with remarkable accomplishments the advantages and disadvantages of phosphorus removal via the coagulation process are tabulated in table 2 3 1 technologies of phosphate removal by coagulation coagulation and flocculation are vital processes in the formation of precipitates flocs first the added coagulants are rapidly stirred in the wastewater and then the speed is reduced for slow mixing for the specified time the mixing is stopped to allow sedimentation few studies have shown the technologies of phosphate removal from wastewater which could be based on adsorption or chemical precipitation both mechanisms effectively recover phosphates in the liquid phase 22 the chemical reactions in this process help the formerly soluble phosphates in water by precipitation to form insoluble phosphate products the precipitate will then be removed by sedimentation 28 broadly the incorporation of phosphates to the solid particles in the water direct adsorption of phosphate ions of the products from hydrolysis reactions formed after the addition of the coagulants to the water and the formation of insoluble solids with the ions from the coagulants are mechanisms attributed to phosphate removal from wastewater however adsorption was reported to play a more critical part in phosphate removal than precipitation 42 the most satisfactory mechanism considers phosphorus removal a continuous series of adsorption and precipitation which involves reversible and irreversible precipitation processes the selection of suitable coagulants is crucial as the coagulation process itself chemical precipitation of phosphates via coagulation flocculation and sedimentation process has been practiced for many years to remove and recover phosphate from wastewater although wastewater is discharged in large volumes from the industries this treatment technique allows the high volume of waste to be considerably decreased and removed before further treatments the phosphates will thus be removed alongside the solid particulates in the water 43 adsorption reaction is another chemical technique for phosphate removal from wastewater polyphosphates and organic phosphorus are removed by this method but with limitations rather than precipitation the adsorption was described as removing phosphorus using aluminium or iron hydroxides with ph being a significant factor in the removal process nevertheless chemical precipitation is dependable and efficient for achieving lower phosphate effluent levels with high coagulant doses at the same time the treatment costs can be minimized by combining the process with sophisticated filtering equipment to remove fine phosphate precipitates 44 multi valent cations usually ca2 al3 and fe3 react with the soluble phosphates to precipitate insoluble compounds such as ca3 po4 2 alpo4 and fepo4 the subsequent solid residues are then removed either by sedimentation or filtration technique for chemical coagulants the most used coagulants include aluminium sulphate ferric chloride and calcium oxide lime 42 aluminium sulphate is an expensive but highly effective coagulant it reacts with the soluble phosphate in the water to produce insoluble aluminium phosphates its optimum ph range for phosphate removal is 5 7 although the coagulant dosage and ph play a vital role in the removal efficiency the coagulant was reported to achieve an 80 90 removal efficiency at a dosage between 50 and 200 mg l and decreased at a higher coagulant dosage although a coagulant dose above 150 mg l does not significantly affect the bod or tss removal it negatively affects the microbial population in the sludge and increases the residual metal ions 27 ferric based coagulants ferric sulphate or chloride and ferrous sulphate are less expensive and more effective on average than aluminium based coagulants they react with phosphates to form ferric phosphate and are reportedly more efficient under acidic conditions the optimum coagulation ph for ferric salts is considered to be around 3 7 to 4 5 45 therefore ferric chloride is the most used chemical coagulant in phosphate removal from wastewater treatment calcium based coagulants are the least used due to their difficulty handling and high sludge production the calcium ions provided by lime efficiently react in alkaline wastewater of ph beyond 10 and the calcium ions react with the soluble phosphate to produce a hydroxylapatite precipitate 46 lime is economical and highly effective for the precipitation of phosphates and a few other trace metals some researchers reported the removal of total phosphorus up to 93 the phosphate precipitate formed by the action of the sweep coagulation mechanism captures the colloidal particles and increases their density to improve sedimentation 47 alum ferric based salts polyaluminum chloride pacl and other chemical coagulants commonly used in typical coagulation wastewater treatment processes are reportedly effective and expensive nevertheless they are not entirely safe as they deposit some metal salt residues in their sludge and the treated water they are non biodegradable and are found to be toxic to the aquatic habitat and human health 28 48 3 2 introduction to natural coagulants and their use for phosphate removal coagulation flocculation electro coagulation reverse osmosis biofiltration membrane filtration and sorption are chemical physical and biological processes used for water wastewater treatment 49 among these processes coagulation flocculation is one of the widely used water wastewater treatment methods the coagulation flocculation processes were reported to be dated early 1500 bce when the egyptians used aluminium sulfate alum to remove suspended solids 50 51 although the early romans were also familiar with alum its utilization was mentioned only until 77 ce as a coagulant in water treatment 51 52 the application of coagulants in modern use for full scale water treatment started 100 years ago with ferric chloride and alum used as coagulants the most common chemical coagulants consist of alum salts alum aluminium chloride and sodium aluminate and iron salts ferric chloride ferric sulfate and ferric chloride sulphate 51 the coagulant is an essential element in the coagulation and flocculation process to agglomerate the colloidal particles which later form settleable flocs through stirring and the flocs can be separated with sedimentation flotation or filtration 53 with using chemical coagulants the drawbacks could come from the increased corrosivity of product water caused by sulphate and chlorine derived from alum and ferric salts and the high risk of plant toxicity and disease in animals and humans such as alzheimer s disease 54 55 with the growing concern to overcome the drawbacks of chemical coagulants the interest has shifted towards investigating natural coagulants as alternative sources are considered more environmentally friendly the coagulants known as natural coagulants can be derived from the natural source of plants leaves seeds mucilage waste animals chitin and microorganisms bacteria fungi algae 56 57 natural coagulants are considered low cost biodegradable and abundant in the source 57 however its metallic characteristics cause the toxicities of chemical coagulants alzheimer s disease is related to aluminium al the plant toxicity of utilized produced sludge is associated with the high concentration of fe and al while the aquatic microorganism is also harmed by the fe and al salts 58 60 removing the metallic characteristics from produced sludge after coagulation by substituting the metal based chemical coagulants with bio based coagulants may reduce the produced sludge toxicity and its environmental impacts 61 62 the resultant biodegradable biopolymer sludge could be readily used as a phosphorus fertilizer researchers have explored the usage of natural coagulants in water and wastewater treatment to investigate and find the best natural coagulant that could substitute chemical coagulants presented in table 4 research conducted by pandey et al 63 in urban wastewater treatment by using mixed plant coagulants of guar gum gg seeds duckweed dw and indian plum ip to investigate the removal of nutrient phosphate and nitrate turbidity and cod the initial phosphate concentration was at 15 62 mg l and various ranges of coagulant dosage were introduced 1 2 3 and 5 ml l the result indicated that the experiment removed phosphate within 78 3 96 9 and the optimum dosage used was 3 ml l the adsorption bridging mechanism is suggested to be predominant in removing phosphate from wastewater 64 the biopolymers in the coagulants cluster the colloidal charges and destabilize them to form larger flocs that eventually settle due to flocculation and accumulate the larger flocs to settle at the base as sludge the biopolymer in the coagulant uses a polymer bridging and charge neutralization mechanism through colloidal charge adsorption to reduce phosphate and other nutrients in the water in the form of precipitates and flocs the flocs settled contain the attached and unattached particles of polymer with the pollutants in conclusion applying crude extract coagulants derived from gg seed ip and dw leaves are practical low cost coagulants for pollutant removal from urban wastewater 63 mohamed et al 65 evaluated the efficiency of natural coagulants moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum in car wash wastewater treatment they compared them with chemical coagulants alum and ferrous sulphate to remove phosphorus turbidity cod total suspended solids tss and ph with the coagulant dosage varying from 3 mg l 200 mg l the obtained result for moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum was 75 and 65 of phosphorus removal respectively while alum and ferrous sulphate indicated 81 and 65 of phosphorus removal respectively based on the data the seed from both plants of natural coagulants contained coagulating substances that can also remove turbidity up to 99 some of the advantages and limitations of using natural coagulants for phosphorus removal from wastewater are given in table 3 4 preparation of natural coagulant for phosphate removal natural coagulants have required some preparations to be valuable products for water and wastewater treatment this preparation method is divided into three primary secondary and tertiary stages from powder formation to purification 56 69 the flowchart of the natural coagulant processing stage is presented in fig 4 in the first stage the important key is to select the usable parts from the selected natural sources to be used as natural coagulants by considering their respective coagulating properties which are essential for the coagulation and flocculation process the usable part might be unique for the different species as for cacti the vascular tissue is the usable part for the process and the rest skin and spine of the plant will be eliminated but for aloe species the functional parts could be from mature leaves and spines 70 the selected parts will be cleaned with water to remove any impurities sandstones grains however in some instances the pre treatment is introduced by washing the usable parts with chemicals acid alkaline solutions such as acetone n methyl piperazinium chloride ethanol hcl mercaptoacetic acid propane sulfonic acid the function of the acid is to remove any minerals on the surface while alkali acts as a neutralizing agent for acid 69 71 after cleaning the usable parts will be dried using an oven or direct sunlight based on preferred and respective methods available and then blended into a raw powder this raw powder can be directly used as a natural coagulant for water wastewater treatment but is not encouraged due to the findings that the coagulating properties are not fully extracted and may lead to a low removal performance 56 72 thus this raw powder will undergo the secondary stage knowns as extraction where different extracted solutions extractants such as water alcohols and salts 73 the mixture extractants with the raw powder will be stirred and then filtered to remove any suspended solids the supernatant from the mixture will be collected and could be used as a natural coagulant the contents of coagulating properties will be evaluated and compared with the different extractants and the best will be selected where the extractant produces high coagulating properties the selected supernatant can be further processed into pure powder by a more complex process in the final stage tertiary where the purification methods such as lyophilization ion exchange and dialysis can be introduced for example the supernatant can be processed through freeze drying to produce a purer powder of natural coagulant changing the form of the supernatant liquid form into powder pure could reduce the deterioration rate of the supernatant 56 and better the surface morphology solubility and water activity 74 however the tertiary stage is rarely performed and is limited for the research study due to the expensive costs 69 5 phosphate removal mechanism using natural coagulant phosphate is mentioned as the most existing phosphorus speciation to exist in wastewater 75 phosphate has high solubility making it difficult for mechanical separation processes 76 omwene et al 77 mentioned that electrodialysis and reverse osmosis had unsatisfactory total phosphate removal from water with only 10 maximum removal the high phosphate solubility causes the mechanical processes such as centrifugation and screw press separator to become too expensive to be applied with efficiency reaching only 40 78 79 coagulation and flocculation remove the soluble phosphate in wastewater by destabilising the negative charge of phosphate via charge neutralization which may only be performed by a positively charged green coagulant 80 m oleifera was reported to be one of the most used green coagulants with a highly positive zeta potential charge 81 83 the proposed mechanism of coagulation and flocculation of phosphate using a positively charged green coagulant is depicted in fig 5 positively charged natural coagulants have the potential to remove phosphate from the water via a process known as co precipitation when added to water these coagulants can interact with negatively charged phosphorus molecules to produce insoluble precipitates following that processes like sedimentation or filtration can be used to remove these precipitates from the water co precipitation is caused by the formation of chemical bonds between the negatively charged phosphorus ions and the positively charged coagulant ions coagulant ions can donate electrons to phosphorus ions resulting in the formation of a chemical bond as a result of this bond the phosphorus ions become less soluble in water forming a precipitate 84 85 additionally phosphorus can be removed from water using natural coagulants through an adsorption process in which the coagulant ions attach to the surface of the phosphorus molecules this is notably useful for removing dissolved phosphorus from water 86 the phosphorus removal mechanism via natural coagulants depends on the coagulant used and the treatment conditions 6 hybridization with other techniques most phosphorus compounds in wastewater are water soluble and only chemical precipitation may not remove them satisfactorily hence to improve the efficiency of the coagulation process the chemical precipitation technique is fused with other techniques to remove the phosphorus from the wastewater before discharge various other methods for phosphorus removal have been effective but have individual shortcomings physical processes i e electrodialysis and reverse osmosis are too expensive furthermore the phosphorus removal effectiveness of biological treatment approaches is often limited this could be due to the presence of phosphorus in water in various forms including organic and inorganic forms and some forms are more difficult to remove than others 87 in addition the limitation could result from the presence of other contaminants in the water such as high levels of nitrogen or other pollutants that can interfere with the biological processes responsible for phosphorus removal 88 89 thus the treatments are inadequate for complete removal and other methods and technologies are needed to reinforce and improve removal efficiency however the techniques or processes should be economically feasible less expensive and highly efficient techniques with minimum chemical and energy usage required 90 for example although it is highly ph dependent the electro coagulation process could remove up to 97 65 phosphorus from wastewater using aluminium electrodes 91 in addition electro coagulation can be used as a secondary technique to further precipitate the phosphorus in the coagulation treated water membrane and dual media filtration are other technologies combined with the coagulation flocculation process for efficient phosphate removal although membrane filtration requires high energy consumption and media filtration also demands a large footprint they are techniques considered an advancement in wastewater treatment plants 92 furthermore as a kind of development several researchers have researched and reported the possibility of merging some filtering procedures with the coagulation flocculation process such as reactive filtration the techniques include the microsieve technology 92 and pile cloth filtration 93 which could be hybridized with the coagulation process to improve phosphate removal recovery from wastewater microsieve technology is one of the most recent advancements in membrane filtration and it is a technology reported as precision technology for absolute filtration micro sieves are also said to outperform regular membranes by 50 100 times additionally they feature a smooth microscopic surface a well defined pore shape and an absolute pore sized distribution with a standard deviation of 1 gidstedt et al 94 reported combining coagulation flocculation units supplemented with al3 coagulant and polymers and microsieve technology resulting in 37 removal of sulfamethoxazole microsieve technology also removed 73 of solids from wastewater which improved the uv disinfection performance afterwards by 18 95 furthermore coagulation is achieved by adding chemicals that cause the particles to form larger aggregates which can then be removed by sedimentation or filtration using calcium rich hydrated ash as filter material can also effectively remove phosphorus from water combining coagulation and using calcium rich hydrated ash filters can effectively remove phosphorus from water to maintain water quality other technologies combined with the coagulation process to increase phosphate removal while lowering the treatment cost include ion exchange magnetic microsorbents and electrodialysis 44 7 recovery and further use of recovered po4 rich sludge phosphate rich pollutants from domestic sewage agricultural and industrial sources contaminate the larger water bodies making them unsafe for consumption the primary objective of the coagulation flocculation process is to remove the phosphate however during the sedimentation process phosphate is present in the sludge one of the negative aspects of using this technique is the increased sludge production thus to balance the cost of treatment the recovered phosphorus rich sludge may be used directly or recycled into fertilizers soil conditioners and other raw materials 96 these products can be used in agricultural and chemical industries phosphorus is one of the three most essential ingredients in fertilizer making the others nitrogen and potassium phosphorus sources with high concentrations such as animal waste and manure usually have lower quantities while phosphorus from sewage and municipal wastewater is in low concentrations with high volumes up to 20 mg l 41 the free orthophosphate can be taken directly by water plants and algae this type of phosphorus can be used directly in their production to mitigate the economic and environmental expenses associated with sludge transport and management the generated sludge is proposed to be used as a raw material for thermal energy i e biogas production via anaerobic digestion after undesirable components such as heavy metals phosphate and nitrate rich sludge have been removed the sludge may compose impurities such as organic pollutants and heavy metals which should be removed before further processing 43 composting was reported to be a suitable technology to process sludge further before being used as a soil conditioner or fertilizer composting may further degrade the residual organic materials while improving the sludge quality due to stabilizing the c n ratio 97 suppose the residual heavy metals in sludge are under the permissible limit in that case it may be used directly as a soil conditioner or fertilizer since it can be useful for plants under trace concentration 98 at the same time the acid leaching procedure was reported to be the most suitable technology to remove heavy metals from sludge before further utilization 99 100 magnesium ammonium phosphate commonly known as struvite has fewer impurities than commercial phosphates it also has a broad range of soil ph at acidity and neutral making it a potential for soil fertilizer material 41 101 8 practical concerns and future approaches compared to other biological or chemical methods researchers still have limitedly discussed the separation of phosphate by green coagulant 102 104 the limited utilization of green coagulants to remove phosphate is highly related to the various speciation of phosphorus in wastewater 76 and the inadequate studies on the mechanism of phosphorus removal by green coagulants 105 phosphorus may exist in various speciations like phosphate orthophosphate organic p inorganic p and poly p the variation of p speciation in wastewater requires different handling to achieve high removal efficiency 43 for example poly p is a complex compound produced from the complexation with chemicals or microbial enzymatic reactions 106 which is considered harder to be removed by coagulation and flocculation since the p removal by coagulation and flocculation using green coagulant mostly relayed to the destabilization of surface charge analysis of specific green coagulant species for specific p speciation is considered to shorten the decision making for wastewater treatment specific green coagulant species will perform differently for different p speciation which makes the coagulation flocculation mechanism study is also interesting to be studied further 9 conclusions although several techniques are currently available the coagulation flocculation process has shown great potency in removing phosphorus from wastewater the coagulants typically used are based on metal ions while guar gum tamarindus indica moringa oleifera seeds duckweed leaf and tannins are a few natural coagulants potentially used to remove phosphate from water natural coagulants performance in treating wastewater reached 99 removal of solids while phosphate removal ranged from 65 to 99 6 phosphate removal in wastewater by natural coagulant is subjected to charge neutralization mechanisms the selection of raw materials and complex purification of raw materials for natural coagulants are currently the major challenges for further application of this option on a larger scale developing more straightforward extraction procedures with high purification efficiency may advance this research further the hybridization of coagulation technology by natural coagulants with other treatment technologies such as filtration including microsieve reverse osmosis and pile cloth units was reported to enhance phosphate removal from wastewater significantly the utilization of natural coagulants also showed a positive side regarding resultant sludge utilization as soil condition or fertilizer since it consisted of low metal ions and low toxicity compared to the resulting sludge from the treatment with metal based coagulants to plants and even aquatic organisms research in the performance and mechanisms of different natural coagulants to various speciation of phosphorus in wastewater is highly suggested as future research direction to enrich the knowledge of phosphorus

composition by cg ms and 3d fluorescence spectroscopy it was showed the removal efficiency of polar substance such as phenol was higher than non polar substance such as n butane due to the

graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ceramic membrane electrodialysis reverse osmosis shale gas hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction shale gas as a typical unconventional energy source was an important component of the adjustment of the world energy structure hydraulic fracturing was widely used to improve shale gas production 1 fractures were created in shale gas reservoirs by injecting large quantities of liquids mixed with inert solid materials proppants and chemical additives known as fracturing fluids into shale gas reservoirs increasing their permeability and gas recovery 2 3 thus the hydraulic fracturing process was the most water intensive operation in shale gas exploiting 4 requiring volumes of 7 to 19 106 l about 2 to 5 million gallons per well typically 5 7 and then the mixture of injected fracturing fluid and formation connate water known as flowback fluid returns to the surface within a few weeks fracturing flowback fluid has the characteristics of high cod chemical oxygen demand high tds total dissolved solids and high tss total suspended solids there were lots of organic pollutants including oilfield chemicals additive and their oxidation products in the fracturing flowback fluid such as macromolecular hydrocarbons polyacrylamides as well as organic matter from the formation such as aliphatic aromatic hydrocarbons alkanes asphaltenes heterocyclic and halogenated hydrocarbons 8 10 the tds was composed of soluble salts in fracturing flowback fluid mainly including cation ions such as sodium potassium calcium magnesium and barium as well as anions such as cl and sulfate ions 11 it was reported that the tds in produced water from marcellus shale play can reach 300 000 mg l 12 in addition the tss in fracturing flowback fluid was composed of cuttings and clay which will seriously harm the ecological environment if not treated effectively unlike other countries shale gas development areas of china were mainly located in sichuan and chongqing where the population density was high and the water resources were scarce therefore it was necessary to apply advanced treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid and realize resource recycling at present membrane technology was used for seawater desalination for example ro reverse osmosis was used after ultrafiltration for desalination showing that the tds varied from 120 to 510 mg l 13 however the treatment efficiency of ro was reduced significantly for the irreversible pollution of organic membranes by organic components for shale gas fracturing flowback fluid in which the organic membrane had strong surface hydrophobicity and lipophilicity it was easy to adsorb small molecular organic matter in seawater forming an adsorption layer and a gel layer on the membrane surface which aggravates membrane fouling compared with ro ed electrodialysis was considered as higher resistance to organic pollution and desalination efficiency than ro reporting that tds was concentrated to 10 w w in the application of ed edr 14 thus the high efficiency desalination technology for shale gas fracturing flowback fluid with high tds high cod and high tss has received extensive attention the ceramic membrane ed h l pressure ro process was constructed for treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid in this research coagulation ceramic membrane was used for pretreatment which had better stability and anti pollution ability to remove suspended matter hardness and organic pollution in order to overcome the blocking and fouling problem of ro membrane and ed membrane according to the advantage of the characteristics of resist to pollution especially for dissolved organic matter ed was used to treat the shale gas fracturing flowback fluid pretreated by ceramic membranes in order to improve stability of ro through removing organic and inorganic ions especially cations in water 15

differences may be caused by the difference in geological conditions of shale areas 3 1 2 pretreatment through coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration the pollutants in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid can be effectively removed by coagulation and ceramic membrane pretreatment and the treatment effect was shown in table 2 the removal efficiency of tss was high in coagulation process with a value of approximately 82 3 the removal efficiency of cod was approximately 24 4 and the removal efficiency of tds was only approximately 4 1 after being filtered by the ceramic membrane the content of tss dropped to 4 6 mg l and the removal efficiency reached 97 5 the removal efficiency of tds was small which was 12 7 and the removal efficiency of cod was 31 9 it was shown that the removal efficiency was high for tss in coagulation ceramic membrane pretreatment and the removal efficiency was low for cod the tds was hardly removed in pretreatment in the process of coagulation ceramic membrane pretreatment suspended matter composed of colloidal particles in hydraulic fracturing backflow water was removed though physical and chemical processes such as coagulation adsorption and precipitation at the same time in coagulation 20 the remaining suspended solids was almost completely removed by ceramic membrane filtration for the organic matter it was revealed that the organic matter in the form of colloidal particles was removed significantly which was retained through bridging and adsorption with tss in the coagulation process and then removed by the ceramic membrane it was reported that the molecular weight of organic matter was mainly below 1 kda in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid and its main components include alkanes aromatic hydrocarbons halogenated hydrocarbons alcohols esters and ketones etc 21 the low removal efficiency of organics was caused by the low molecular weight and good solubility of organics in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid therefore it was revealed that low removal efficiency of organics was caused by low molecular weight and good solubility of organics in the backflow water 22 3 1 3 fluctuation of water flux treated by ceramic membrane the variation of relative membrane flux obtained according to eq 1 was shown in fig 5 during the operation of the ceramic membrane in ceramic membrane filtering process the relative flux decreased rapidly from 96 2 to 61 4 in 2 h and then the membrane flux remains stable at the beginning of filtration operation the membrane flux decreased rapidly because of the rapid accumulation of suspended solids salts and organic pollutants in hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas the ceramic membrane filtration was operated in cross flow operation mode in which the flow of the liquid phase would clean the pollutants attached to the membrane surface in the filtration the formation and peeling of the filter cake layer formed by pollutants on the membrane surface reached an equilibrium state maintaining a relatively stable membrane flux at 58 6 61 4 of the initial flux for a long time revealing that the ceramic membrane was contaminated slightly due to cross flow operation 3 1 4 characteristics of membrane fouling during filtration for the decrease of ceramic membrane flux caused by membrane fouling sem was used to characterize the morphology of solid fouling on the organic filter membrane the results were shown in fig 6 it was showed that the floccules as well as spherical quadrangular prism and hexagonal columnar crystals were adsorbed on inorganic membrane surface indicating that during the filtration process decrease of the flux of membrane might be caused by composite of organic and inorganic matter in the shale gas fracturing flowback fluid instead of tss combined with the morphological analysis of sem images of different magnifications eds element analysis and characteristics of fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas it was shown that al element did not exist but si element could be detected it was revealed that the spherical crystals on the membrane surface were clay silica particles which were derived from oilfield chemicals the quadrilateral and hexagonal columns were salt crystals the flocculent entrapment around the crystals might be organic macromolecules 23 according to the water quality characteristics of changning weiyuan shale gas hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid organic macromolecules mainly came from oilfield chemical additives in fracturing fluid of shale gas especially polyacrylamide pam and organic substances in shale gas reservoir therefore the flocculent were caused by pam which was an oilfield chemical agent in the fracturing fluid combined with eds element analysis fig 8 fig 9 the salt crystals were mainly formed by metal ion scaling in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid indicating that submicron particles in the flowback fluid cause severe fouling of the membrane 22 the composition of the fouling on the membrane surface was analyzed through ftir and eds shown in figs 7 9 as shown in ftir the complex morphology of organic and inorganic scaling on the surface of ceramic membrane was analyzed after the treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid in which the main absorption peaks at 3700 3200 cm 1 indicating oh and nh bond stretching peaks at 1690 1620 cm 1 and 1460 1380 cm 1 could indicate cc cn and ch bond stretching respectively peaks at 1300 1000 cm 1 reflected co bond stretching in addition the absorption peak at 870 700 cm 1 and 680 600 cm 1 could indicate the presence of co3 2 and so4 2 respectively these functional groups were consistent with the organic matter detected by gc ms qualitative analysis in the following as shown in figs 8 and 9 the carbon and oxygen account for a large proportion in scale indicating the existence of organic matters in scale deposits according to eds analysis as well as iron sodium silicon chlorine manganese calcium and barium were observed in membrane scale deposits for the pollution caused by inorganic salts to reverse osmosis membrane scaling the main reason was the deposition of metal oxides in scaling therefore based on the generation and characteristics of fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas it was revealed that iron silicon and manganese were mainly from the particles in fracturing flowback fluid while calcium and barium were mainly inorganic scale deposits according to nh in the scale detected by ftir and the gc ms to determine material composition analysis the nh functional group detected by ftir would the characteristic functional group of pam it was indicated that the macromolecular polymer pam and the calcium and barium scale forming ions reacted forming an organic and inorganic composite system during the ceramic membrane filtration process the interaction between organics and inorganics in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid had a significant impact on the fouling of ceramic membranes based on the characteristics of fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas it was revealed that in the presence of hpam the morphology of the calcium sulfate scale would change forming chelates through coordination bonds of polyacrylamide molecules and ca2 in the solution formed it was indicated that the macromolecular organic compounds would reduce the formation of calcium sulfate crystals 24 therefore the content was relatively low although calcium and barium scale forming ions existed in scale forming substances 3 2 treatment performance of ed 3 2 1 removal of organic matter by ed the fluctuation of zeta potential and cod in concentrated and diluted water were determined as shown in table 3 and fig 10 the stability of organic matter in concentrated water and diluted water were analyzed by zeta potential the organic matter content in the concentrated water after ed treatment was the highest at about 236 18 mg l and the zeta potential was about 1 89 mv when the operating voltage was 20 v relatively the organic matter content was the lowest at about 39 45 mg l and the zeta potential was about 26 35 mv the zeta potential value reflects the stability of the colloid in the liquid the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential of the water sample the stronger the stability of the colloid in the liquid system compared with the treatment effect of ed on the operating voltage of 20 v and 5 v the results showed that on 20 v of the operating voltage the organic matter content in the diluted water was low with the higher water quality stability indicating that the colloidal particles would be difficult to aggregate which was beneficial to the subsequent ro treatment however the content was high in concentrated water with a state of condensation for the organic matter colloid which could be quickly removed through the coagulation and sedimentation process before further processing the separation efficiency of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid was affected by operating voltage determines in ed showing that the removal of organic pollutants was positively correlated with operating voltage in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid relative concentration and removal efficiency could be obtained according to eq 1 and eq 3 when the operating voltage was increased from 5 v to 20 v the removal efficiency of cod increased from 61 7 to 79 4 after ed treatment for 120 min compared with the removal efficiency of cod at different stages in the treatment process the results showed that the removal rate of cod increased significantly in the initial stage 0 40 min and the removal efficiency on 5 v 10 v 15 v and 20 v were 42 8 48 4 52 4 and 68 7 respectively in the later stage 40 120 min the removal efficiency of cod increased by 18 9 19 3 21 4 and 10 7 respectively on the voltages of 5 v 10 v 15 v and 20 v indicating that the removal efficiency of cod in ed process was mainly in the initial stage of the reaction in the ed treatment the organic matter was transported in the electric field and then separated by the ed membrane after separation the concentrated water contained a large amount of unstable colloidal organic matter and the diluted water contained a small amount of organic matter the organic composition and organic compounds with different functional groups of the hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid after ed treatment was investigated by gc ms and 3d fluorescence as shown in figs 11 and 12 the phenol dibutyl phthalate and n butane were detected in raw water according to the nist library the substances corresponding to the peaks with retention time of 12 758 min and 15 427 min were phenol and butane respectively and the substance corresponding to the peaks with retention time of 26 317 min and 30 57 min was dbp the functional groups oh ch co and cc were detected through ft ir and these functional groups corresponded to the characteristic functional groups of phenol dibutyl phthalate and n butane detected by gc ms therefore combining gc ms and ft ir it was further confirmed that most organic compounds in raw water are indeed phenol dibutyl phthalate and n butane after treatment the phenol dibutyl phthalate were hardly detected in diluted water while n butane was still detected it was revealed that in the process of ed treatment on the one hand the migration effect in the electric field was the way to concentrate organic matter by ed so polar substances such as phenol had higher migration efficiency and non polar substances such as n butane had a slightly weaker migration ability on the other hand during the ed treatment process the hydroxyl radicals generated by the electric field had a certain oxidation effect on the organic matter 25 26 therefore the removal of organic matter was the coupling synergy between migration in electric field and hydroxyl radical generated by electric field in the ed treatment process of the shale gas fracturing flowback fluid treatment organic compounds with different functional groups have different removal efficiency in ed process in the 3d fluorescence diagram of diluted water on different voltages the fluorescence region was mainly concentrated in the region where λ ex 200 500 nm λ em 250 600 nm the result showed two clear fluorescence peaks at λ ex 200 300 nm λ em 250 400 nm however a clear fluorescence peak and a fuzzy peak were observed although the fluorescence intensity was weak in the region of λ ex 200 300 nm λ em 400 600 nm in general there were few fluorescence areas the related research showed that the λ ex λ em 230 305 nm may be related to the fluorescence of benzene compounds such as benzene and phenol near this peak while the λ ex λ em 220 320 230 440 nm region showed a close relationship with hydrocarbons but except the peak λ ex λ em 230 305 nm 27 therefore weak electrolyte substances such as phenols with hydroxyl functional groups can be removed by ed while hydrocarbon substances without functional groups cannot be removed by ed the removal efficiency of organic matter under different electric fields is different in ed for the removal of weak electrolyte organic matter the weak electrolyte substances such as phenol in the fracturing flowback fluid migrated to the concentrating chamber under the combined action of electric field force and concentration difference the fluorescence intensity was the smallest on ed operating voltages of 15 and 20 v based on the comparison of the 3d fluorescence diagram in different ed operating voltage it was revealed that the ion concentration and the relative removal rate of organic matter rapidly increased and the larger the concentration difference the faster the increase in the initial period of time when the concentrations on both sides of the ion exchange membrane were close to each other the positive effect of the concentration difference was no longer obvious mainly because of the migration of counter ions in the electric field under the electric field the counter ions penetrated the ion exchange membrane and the ionization rate increased with the increase of electric field intensity 27 therefore the migration rate of the weak electrolyte substances on 5 v was obviously lower than that on 15 and 20 v and the fluorescence intensity was the smallest on ed operating voltages of 15 and 20 v in addition the migration rate of organic matter on 15 v was similar to that on 20 v it was revealed that the current was relatively small and the electric field was weak which slightly influenced the weak electrolyte mainly because of the influence of concentration difference at the initial stage of the reaction when a concentration difference was present between the initial feed concentrations of the concentrated and dilute chamber the organic matter in the fracturing flowback fluid migrated to the concentrating chamber under the action of concentration difference therefore the migration rate of organic matter on 15 v was similar to that on 20 v for the removal of non electrolyte organic matter polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds were removed by concentration dialysis the fluorescence values of each component in the 3d fluorescence diagram were in direct proportion to the corresponding effluent cod and the fluorescence values of each component changed correspondingly with the value of the corresponding solution cod resulting in fewer fluorescence areas 28 29 it was revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds the main luminescent substances in shale gas fracturing effluent were non electrolytes which were only transported by concentration and dialysis resulting in a small organic content in diluted water after ed treatment 3 2 2 removal of inorganic ion by ed the variation of typical inorganic ions e g k na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 after ed treatment with treatment time was shown in fig 13 it showed that the removal effect of ed process on different forms of ions was quite different among the anions so4 2 reached the maximum removal rate within 5 min about 90 cl removal rate was about 54 within 5 min and the final removal rates of so4 2 and cl reached 99 3 and 96 4 respectively it was revealed that so4 2 had a higher activity in the ion exchange membrane and a faster ion exchange rate as a divalent ion meanwhile the high content of cl hardly affect the selective permeability of ions by ed in fracturing flowback fluid there were non significant different of removal efficiency between different cations in fracturing flowback fluid by ed and the removal efficiency ca2 mg2 na and k reached 99 7 99 6 95 8 and 99 2 respectively after 60 min as shown in fig 13 divalent cations was slightly faster than that of monovalent cations for their small ionic hydration radius and the slight difference between them resulting in high activities in addition ca2 and mg2 carry two charges which were faster than na and k in both the migration speed in the electric field and the ion exchange speed in the ion exchange membrane it was revealed that ion valence state had a great influence on ion removal in ed in the above ed process concentration dialysis made the small molecular organic matter and ionic substances in the concentrated chamber reversely diffused to the diluted chamber thus hindering the electromigration process 30 31 however the ionization balance shifted to the ionic state to produce more ionic organics reducing the concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane 32 which was beneficial to the electromigration process of ed therefore the energy consumption of concentrating the same amount of ions under the same concentration difference would be reduced 3 3 treatment performance of ro in high and low pressure operation after ed treatment the organic matter and tds migrate from the diluted water to the concentrated water accompanied by the electrochemical reaction process the volume proportion of concentrated water was low for shale gas fracturing flowback fluid after ed treatment and the organic matter and tds were enriched in concentrated water therefore high operating pressure was applied to ro for the treatment the proportion of diluted water was high with low organic matter and tds thus low operating pressure was applied the ed combined with high and low pressure operation for ro was constructed for the treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid 3 3 1 treatment performance of ro in high pressure operation concentrated water of ed at a concentration efficiency with 80 5 treated by the ro in high pressure operation was shown in table 4 the amount of concentrated water treated by ro in high pressure operation could be reduced significantly at a concentration efficiency with 60 after the treatment by ed meanwhile the tds ec and cl in the diluted water after treatment were removed through ro in high pressure operation it was shown that the tds cl and cod concentration of diluted water was 490 mg l 294 2 mg l and 61 6 mg l respectively which met discharge standard of water pollutants in sichuan province in which tds 1000 mg l cl 300 mg l cod 100 mg l the flux change of ro membrane by the ro in high pressure operation was shown in fig 14 in the stage the membrane flux decreased smaller and smaller with the extension of time in the first 30 min the decline efficiency was 17 8 and in the last 50 min the decline efficiency changed to 5 and finally stabilized in the range of 36 06 36 21 l m2 h revealing the slight membrane fouling for ro it was found that the membrane fouling rate of ro might be related to the interaction of dom with the ionic strength and concentration of divalent cations 33 37 cations interact with the negatively charged carboxyl functional groups within the humic fraction of dom by charge interaction and adsorptive behaviour 38 thus decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between humic macromolecules 39 42 the duction in dom repulsion increases dom deposition on the membrane surface and causes the formation of a compact dense and thick fouling layer accordingly fouling increases with increasing ionic strength 43 it was showed that ro membrane in high pressure had certain resistance to cations most removed by ed resulting in slight membrane fouling 44 3 3 2 treatment performance of ro in low pressure operation diluted water of ed at a concentration efficiency with 80 5 treated by ro in low pressure operation was shown in table 5 and fig 15 for the diluted water treated by ed the tds conductivity and cod was removed efficiently by ro in the low pressure operation showing that the tds ec cod and cl were reduced to about 2 7 5 4 mg l 5 8 11 7 μs cm 18 3 26 8 mg l and 0 7 1 7 mg l respectively in other report multi stage ro was used for treatment of shale gas produced water in southern sichuan similarly the tds cod and cl of the treated water were 27 7 mg l 39 mg l and 16 1 mg l when the tds of the produced water was 2 104 mg l 45 compared with this report tds cod and cl of diluted water treated by ro in low pressure were lower than that in multi stage ro under a lower operation pressure therefore it could indicate that diluted water treated by ro in low pressure were obviously advanced purified the flux change of ro membrane for treating water untreated by ed and diluted water of ed in low pressure and membrane flux of ro was shown in fig 16 for the diluted water treated by ed the membrane flux hardly decreased significantly by the ro in low pressure operation however for the water without ed treatment the ro membrane flux decreased significantly in same pressure operation the average membrane flux decreased to about 30 of the diluted water after ed treatment the concentration efficiency of water sample after ed can reach 80 5 which means that only a small amount of concentrated water needs be treated by ro in high pressure operation for the conventional ro treatment a multi stage concentration process needs to be adopted and then large volume of water need be treated with high working pressure leading to high energy consumption furthermore the concentration of tds and cod of dilution water is low after ed treatment and the working pressure of ro was low for dilution water which could reduce energy consumption in addition the dilution water would not cause membrane blockage for ro improving operation stability it was revealed that the combined process of ed and ro can effectively improve the stability of treatment and reduce energy consumption 4 conclusions the ceramic membrane ed h l pressure ro process was constructed for the treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid with high cod tds and tss and then the treatment efficiency and the migration mechanism of organic matter and tds was investigated it was concluded that the inorganic particles tss in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid could be removed through coagulation inorganic ceramic membrane pretreatment effectively with the removal efficiency about 97 5 meanwhile removal efficiency for the colloidal organic matter was about 31 9 however the removal efficiency of tds was smaller only 12 7 the morphology and structure of pollutants on the surface of ceramic membranes were analyzed by ftir sem and eds showing that in addition to c and o the atoms with high content in the membrane fouling were iron sodium silicon chlorine and manganese calcium and barium and according to the nh detected in the pollutants on the surface of the ceramic membrane it was revealed that the pam which used in shale gas fracturing fluid as additive inorganic crystals such as calcium and barium work together to form an organic and inorganic composite system the removal of organic pollutants was positively correlated with operating voltage in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid which increased from 61 7 to 79 4 with the increasing of operating voltage from 5 v to 20 v after ed treatment for 120 min the removal efficiency of polar substances such as phenol was higher than non polar substances such as n butane showing weak electrolyte substances with hydroxyl functional groups would be migrated under the influence of the electric field for the removal of the ions in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid final removal efficiency of so4 2 and cl reached 99 3 and 96 4 respectively the higher activity in the ion exchange membrane had a faster ion exchange rate as a divalent ion for so4 2 as well as the removal efficiency ca2 mg2 na and k which reached 99 7 99 6 95 8 and 99 2 respectively after 60 min showing that ion valence state had a significant influence on ion removal in ed for the diluted water treated by the ro in low pressure operation the cod and tds were about 11 6 mg l and 4 0 mg l respectively and the membrane flux hardly decrease significantly with high stability and flux indicating that the fouling of ro membrane was reduced effectively after treated by ed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12586,the ceramic membrane ed h l pressure ro combined process was constructed for the treatment of fracturing flowback fluid and the mechanism and influencing factors were investigated the removal efficiency of tds and cod reached 97 5 and 31 9 respectively through coagulation ceramic membrane which was contaminated slightly by tss due to the cross flow operation however according to the analysis of ceramic membrane by ftir sem and eds it was indicated the decreasing of membrane flux would be caused by organic and inorganic composite made from pam calcium and barium crystals the removal of organic pollutants was positively correlated with operating voltage in ed the removal efficiency of and cod reached 79 3 on 20 v operating voltage based on the analysis of organic matter composition by cg ms and 3d fluorescence spectroscopy it was showed the removal efficiency of polar substance such as phenol was higher than non polar substance such as n butane due to the electromigration for the removal of the ions the removal efficiency of ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 and cl reached 99 7 99 6 95 8 99 2 99 3 and 96 4 respectively indicating ion valence had a significant influence on ion removal by ed the concentrated water and diluted water produced by ed were treated by the ro in high and low pressure operation respectively in order to improve membrane flux the cod and tds were about 11 6 mg l and 4 0 mg l in diluted water treated by the ro in low pressure operation respectively showing membrane flux hardly decreased significantly with high stability and flux graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ceramic membrane electrodialysis reverse osmosis shale gas hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction shale gas as a typical unconventional energy source was an important component of the adjustment of the world energy structure hydraulic fracturing was widely used to improve shale gas production 1 fractures were created in shale gas reservoirs by injecting large quantities of liquids mixed with inert solid materials proppants and chemical additives known as fracturing fluids into shale gas reservoirs increasing their permeability and gas recovery 2 3 thus the hydraulic fracturing process was the most water intensive operation in shale gas exploiting 4 requiring volumes of 7 to 19 106 l about 2 to 5 million gallons per well typically 5 7 and then the mixture of injected fracturing fluid and formation connate water known as flowback fluid returns to the surface within a few weeks fracturing flowback fluid has the characteristics of high cod chemical oxygen demand high tds total dissolved solids and high tss total suspended solids there were lots of organic pollutants including oilfield chemicals additive and their oxidation products in the fracturing flowback fluid such as macromolecular hydrocarbons polyacrylamides as well as organic matter from the formation such as aliphatic aromatic hydrocarbons alkanes asphaltenes heterocyclic and halogenated hydrocarbons 8 10 the tds was composed of soluble salts in fracturing flowback fluid mainly including cation ions such as sodium potassium calcium magnesium and barium as well as anions such as cl and sulfate ions 11 it was reported that the tds in produced water from marcellus shale play can reach 300 000 mg l 12 in addition the tss in fracturing flowback fluid was composed of cuttings and clay which will seriously harm the ecological environment if not treated effectively unlike other countries shale gas development areas of china were mainly located in sichuan and chongqing where the population density was high and the water resources were scarce therefore it was necessary to apply advanced treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid and realize resource recycling at present membrane technology was used for seawater desalination for example ro reverse osmosis was used after ultrafiltration for desalination showing that the tds varied from 120 to 510 mg l 13 however the treatment efficiency of ro was reduced significantly for the irreversible pollution of organic membranes by organic components for shale gas fracturing flowback fluid in which the organic membrane had strong surface hydrophobicity and lipophilicity it was easy to adsorb small molecular organic matter in seawater forming an adsorption layer and a gel layer on the membrane surface which aggravates membrane fouling compared with ro ed electrodialysis was considered as higher resistance to organic pollution and desalination efficiency than ro reporting that tds was concentrated to 10 w w in the application of ed edr 14 thus the high efficiency desalination technology for shale gas fracturing flowback fluid with high tds high cod and high tss has received extensive attention the ceramic membrane ed h l pressure ro process was constructed for treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid in this research coagulation ceramic membrane was used for pretreatment which had better stability and anti pollution ability to remove suspended matter hardness and organic pollution in order to overcome the blocking and fouling problem of ro membrane and ed membrane according to the advantage of the characteristics of resist to pollution especially for dissolved organic matter ed was used to treat the shale gas fracturing flowback fluid pretreated by ceramic membranes in order to improve stability of ro through removing organic and inorganic ions especially cations in water 15 17 for the concentrated water and diluted water produced by the ed process high pressure ro and low pressure ro were respectively used to reduce the pollution and energy consumption 2 material and

gauge and flowmeter adopting cross flow operation mode the ed device fig 3 used in experiment includes a group of membrane stacks 20 pairs of membranes for operation the ed membrane was mainly made of polyethylene and the polymer material based on good hydrophobicity size electrochemical stability and mechanical properties of polyethylene in the electrochemical environment the ion exchange capacity of pe ranged from 0 9 mmol g to 1 1 mmol g the ro treatment device fig 4 used in the experiment include booster pump membrane tube membrane element material tank and control system the ro membrane was mainly made of polyvinylenedifluoride pvdf the pore size of pvdf membrane used in ro was 0 2 μm and it was as supporting layer of ro membrane which was used to support the active layer 2 3 experimental method 2 3 1 pretreatment for shale gas fracturing flowback fluid the ec electrical conductivity tds and tss in raw water was determined after coagulation pretreatment under the optimized conditions of pac dosage of 2400 mg l coagulant aid cpam1200 of 120 mg l stirring at 400 rpm for 1 min and finally stirring at 50 rpm for 5 min and then the treatment effect of ceramic membrane was investigated under the optimized conditions of the operating pressure of 0 16 mpa the indicators such as conductivity tds tss and membrane flux were measured in treating shale gas fracturing flowback fluid by ceramic membrane and then the membrane surface composition was analyzed using sem scanning electron microscope eds energy dispersive spectroscopy and ftir fourier transform infra red

flowback fluid the content of cod and the zeta potential of concentrated and diluted water were measured after running stably for 1 h when the voltages were controlled on 5 10 15 and 20 v and then migration mechanism of organic matter was analyzed by using gc ms gas chromatography mass spectroscopy and 3d fluorescence on different voltage the removal efficiency of typical inorganic ions k na

discussions 3 1 treatment performance of coagulation ceramic membrane 3 1 1 characteristics of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid shale gas fracturing flowback fluid sampled from field had the characteristics of high cod tss and tds water quality characteristics of fracturing flowback fluid were shown in table 1 the contents of cod and tss were different from other shale gas fracturing flowback fluid for example the tss content in the fracturing flowback fluid was about 300 3000 mg l from marcellus 18 as well as about 360 mg l from denver julesburg basin in colorado 19 these differences may be caused by the difference in geological conditions of shale areas 3 1 2 pretreatment through coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration the pollutants in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid can be effectively removed by coagulation and ceramic membrane pretreatment and the treatment effect was shown in table 2 the removal efficiency of tss was high in coagulation process with a value of approximately 82 3 the removal efficiency of cod was approximately 24 4 and the removal efficiency of tds was only approximately 4 1 after being filtered by the ceramic membrane the content of tss dropped to 4 6 mg l and the removal efficiency reached 97 5 the removal efficiency of tds was small which was 12 7 and the removal efficiency of cod was 31 9 it was shown that the removal efficiency was high for tss in coagulation ceramic membrane pretreatment and the removal efficiency was low for cod the tds was hardly removed in pretreatment in the process of coagulation ceramic membrane pretreatment suspended matter composed of colloidal particles in hydraulic fracturing backflow water was removed though physical and chemical processes such as coagulation adsorption and precipitation at the same time in coagulation 20 the remaining suspended solids was almost completely removed by ceramic membrane filtration for the organic matter it was revealed that the organic matter in the form of colloidal particles was removed significantly which was retained through bridging and adsorption with tss in the coagulation process and then removed by the ceramic membrane it was reported that the molecular weight of organic matter was mainly below 1 kda in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid and its main components include alkanes aromatic hydrocarbons halogenated hydrocarbons alcohols esters and ketones etc 21 the low removal efficiency of organics was caused by the low molecular weight and good solubility of organics in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid therefore it was revealed that low removal efficiency of organics was caused by low molecular weight and good solubility of organics in the backflow water 22 3 1 3 fluctuation of water flux treated by ceramic membrane the variation of relative membrane flux obtained according to eq 1 was shown in fig 5 during the operation of the ceramic membrane in ceramic membrane filtering process the relative flux decreased rapidly from 96 2 to 61 4 in 2 h and then the membrane flux remains stable at the beginning of filtration operation the membrane flux decreased rapidly because of the rapid accumulation of suspended solids salts and organic pollutants in hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas the ceramic membrane filtration was operated in cross flow operation mode in which the flow of the liquid phase would clean the pollutants attached to the membrane surface in the filtration the formation and peeling of the filter cake layer formed by pollutants on the membrane surface reached an equilibrium state maintaining a relatively stable membrane flux at 58 6 61 4 of the initial flux for a long time revealing that the ceramic membrane was contaminated slightly due to cross flow operation 3 1 4 characteristics of membrane fouling during filtration for the decrease of ceramic membrane flux caused by membrane fouling sem was used to characterize the morphology of solid fouling on the organic filter membrane the results were shown in fig 6 it was showed that the floccules as well as spherical quadrangular prism and hexagonal columnar crystals were adsorbed on inorganic membrane surface indicating that during the filtration process decrease of the flux of membrane might be caused by composite of organic and inorganic matter in the shale gas fracturing flowback fluid instead of tss combined with the morphological analysis of sem images of different magnifications eds element analysis and characteristics of fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas it was shown that al element did not exist but si element could be detected it was revealed that the spherical crystals on the membrane surface were clay silica particles which were derived from oilfield chemicals the quadrilateral and hexagonal columns were salt crystals the flocculent entrapment around the crystals might be organic macromolecules 23 according to the water quality characteristics of changning weiyuan shale gas hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid organic macromolecules mainly came from oilfield chemical additives in fracturing fluid of shale gas especially polyacrylamide pam and organic substances in shale gas reservoir therefore the flocculent were caused by pam which was an oilfield chemical agent in the fracturing fluid combined with eds element analysis fig 8 fig 9 the salt crystals were mainly formed by metal ion scaling in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid indicating that submicron particles in the flowback fluid cause severe fouling of the membrane 22 the composition of the fouling on the membrane surface was analyzed through ftir and eds shown in figs 7 9 as shown in ftir the complex morphology of organic and inorganic scaling on the surface of ceramic membrane was analyzed after the treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid in which the main absorption peaks at 3700 3200 cm 1 indicating oh and nh bond stretching peaks at 1690 1620 cm 1 and 1460 1380 cm 1 could indicate cc cn and ch bond stretching respectively peaks at 1300 1000 cm 1 reflected co bond stretching in addition the absorption peak at 870 700 cm 1 and 680 600 cm 1 could indicate the presence of co3 2 and so4 2 respectively these functional groups were consistent with the organic matter detected by gc ms qualitative analysis in the following as shown in figs 8 and 9 the carbon and oxygen account for a large proportion in scale indicating the existence of organic matters in scale deposits according to eds analysis as well as iron sodium silicon chlorine manganese calcium and barium were observed in membrane scale deposits for the pollution caused by inorganic salts to reverse osmosis membrane scaling the main reason was the deposition of metal oxides in scaling therefore based on the generation and characteristics of fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas it was revealed that iron silicon and manganese were mainly from the particles in fracturing flowback fluid while calcium and barium were mainly inorganic scale deposits according to nh in the scale detected by ftir and the gc ms to determine material composition analysis the nh functional group detected by ftir would the characteristic functional group of pam it was indicated that the macromolecular polymer pam and the calcium and barium scale forming ions reacted forming an organic and inorganic composite system during the ceramic membrane filtration process the interaction between organics and inorganics in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid had a significant impact on the fouling of ceramic membranes based on the characteristics of fracturing flowback fluid of shale gas it was revealed that in the presence of hpam the morphology of the calcium sulfate scale would change forming chelates through coordination bonds of polyacrylamide molecules and ca2 in the solution formed it was indicated that the macromolecular organic compounds would reduce the formation of calcium sulfate crystals 24 therefore the content was relatively low although calcium and barium scale forming ions existed in scale forming substances 3 2 treatment performance of ed 3 2 1 removal of organic matter by ed the fluctuation of zeta potential and cod in concentrated and diluted water were determined as shown in table 3 and fig 10 the stability of organic matter in concentrated water and diluted water were analyzed by zeta potential the organic matter content in the concentrated water after ed treatment was the highest at about 236 18 mg l and the zeta potential was about 1 89 mv when the operating voltage was 20 v relatively the organic matter content was the lowest at about 39 45 mg l and the zeta potential was about 26 35 mv the zeta potential value reflects the stability of the colloid in the liquid the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential of the water sample the stronger the stability of the colloid in the liquid system compared with the treatment effect of ed on the operating voltage of 20 v and 5 v the results showed that on 20 v of the operating voltage the organic matter content in the diluted water was low with the higher water quality stability indicating that the colloidal particles would be difficult to aggregate which was beneficial to the subsequent ro treatment however the content was high in concentrated water with a state of condensation for the organic matter colloid which could be quickly removed through the coagulation and sedimentation process before further processing the separation efficiency of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid was affected by operating voltage determines in ed showing that the removal of organic pollutants was positively correlated with operating voltage in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid relative concentration and removal efficiency could be obtained according to eq 1 and eq 3 when the operating voltage was increased from 5 v to 20 v the removal efficiency of cod increased from 61 7 to 79 4 after ed treatment for 120 min compared with the removal efficiency of cod at different stages in the treatment process the results showed that the removal rate of cod increased significantly in the initial stage 0 40 min and the removal efficiency on 5 v 10 v 15 v and 20 v were 42 8 48 4 52 4 and 68 7 respectively in the later stage 40 120 min the removal efficiency of cod increased by 18 9 19 3 21 4 and 10 7 respectively on the voltages of 5 v 10 v 15 v and 20 v indicating that the removal efficiency of cod in ed process was mainly in the initial stage of the reaction in the ed treatment the organic matter was transported in the electric field and then separated by the ed membrane after separation the concentrated water contained a large amount of unstable colloidal organic matter and the diluted water contained a small amount of organic matter the organic composition and organic compounds with different functional groups of the hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid after ed treatment was investigated by gc ms and 3d fluorescence as shown in figs 11 and 12 the phenol dibutyl phthalate and n butane were detected in raw water according to the nist library the substances corresponding to the peaks with retention time of 12 758 min and 15 427 min were phenol and butane respectively and the substance corresponding to the peaks with retention time of 26 317 min and 30 57 min was dbp the functional groups oh ch co and cc were detected through ft ir and these functional groups corresponded to the characteristic functional groups of phenol dibutyl phthalate and n butane detected by gc ms therefore combining gc ms and ft ir it was further confirmed that most organic compounds in raw water are indeed phenol dibutyl phthalate and n butane after treatment the phenol dibutyl phthalate were hardly detected in diluted water while n butane was still detected it was revealed that in the process of ed treatment on the one hand the migration effect in the electric field was the way to concentrate organic matter by ed so polar substances such as phenol had higher migration efficiency and non polar substances such as n butane had a slightly weaker migration ability on the other hand during the ed treatment process the hydroxyl radicals generated by the electric field had a certain oxidation effect on the organic matter 25 26 therefore the removal of organic matter was the coupling synergy between migration in electric field and hydroxyl radical generated by electric field in the ed treatment process of the shale gas fracturing flowback fluid treatment organic compounds with different functional groups have different removal efficiency in ed process in the 3d fluorescence diagram of diluted water on different voltages the fluorescence region was mainly concentrated in the region where λ ex 200 500 nm λ em 250 600 nm the result showed two clear fluorescence peaks at λ ex 200 300 nm λ em 250 400 nm however a clear fluorescence peak and a fuzzy peak were observed although the fluorescence intensity was weak in the region of λ ex 200 300 nm λ em 400 600 nm in general there were few fluorescence areas the related research showed that the λ ex λ em 230 305 nm may be related to the fluorescence of benzene compounds such as benzene and phenol near this peak while the λ ex λ em 220 320 230 440 nm region showed a close relationship with hydrocarbons but except the peak λ ex λ em 230 305 nm 27 therefore weak electrolyte substances such as phenols with hydroxyl functional groups can be removed by ed while hydrocarbon substances without functional groups cannot be removed by ed the removal efficiency of organic matter under different electric fields is different in ed for the removal of weak electrolyte organic matter the weak electrolyte substances such as phenol in the fracturing flowback fluid migrated to the concentrating chamber under the combined action of electric field force and concentration difference the fluorescence intensity was the smallest on ed operating voltages of 15 and 20 v based on the comparison of the 3d fluorescence diagram in different ed operating voltage it was revealed that the ion concentration and the relative removal rate of organic matter rapidly increased and the larger the concentration difference the faster the increase in the initial period of time when the concentrations on both sides of the ion exchange membrane were close to each other the positive effect of the concentration difference was no longer obvious mainly because of the migration of counter ions in the electric field under the electric field the counter ions penetrated the ion exchange membrane and the ionization rate increased with the increase of electric field intensity 27 therefore the migration rate of the weak electrolyte substances on 5 v was obviously lower than that on 15 and 20 v and the fluorescence intensity was the smallest on ed operating voltages of 15 and 20 v in addition the migration rate of organic matter on 15 v was similar to that on 20 v it was revealed that the current was relatively small and the electric field was weak which slightly influenced the weak electrolyte mainly because of the influence of concentration difference at the initial stage of the reaction when a concentration difference was present between the initial feed concentrations of the concentrated and dilute chamber the organic matter in the fracturing flowback fluid migrated to the concentrating chamber under the action of concentration difference therefore the migration rate of organic matter on 15 v was similar to that on 20 v for the removal of non electrolyte organic matter polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds were removed by concentration dialysis the fluorescence values of each component in the 3d fluorescence diagram were in direct proportion to the corresponding effluent cod and the fluorescence values of each component changed correspondingly with the value of the corresponding solution cod resulting in fewer fluorescence areas 28 29 it was revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds the main luminescent substances in shale gas fracturing effluent were non electrolytes which were only transported by concentration and dialysis resulting in a small organic content in diluted water after ed treatment 3 2 2 removal of inorganic ion by ed the variation of typical inorganic ions e g k na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 after ed treatment with treatment time was shown in fig 13 it showed that the removal effect of ed process on different forms of ions was quite different among the anions so4 2 reached the maximum removal rate within 5 min about 90 cl removal rate was about 54 within 5 min and the final removal rates of so4 2 and cl reached 99 3 and 96 4 respectively it was revealed that so4 2 had a higher activity in the ion exchange membrane and a faster ion exchange rate as a divalent ion meanwhile the high content of cl hardly affect the selective permeability of ions by ed in fracturing flowback fluid there were non significant different of removal efficiency between different cations in fracturing flowback fluid by ed and the removal efficiency ca2 mg2 na and k reached 99 7 99 6 95 8 and 99 2 respectively after 60 min as shown in fig 13 divalent cations was slightly faster than that of monovalent cations for their small ionic hydration radius and the slight difference between them resulting in high activities in addition ca2 and mg2 carry two charges which were faster than na and k in both the migration speed in the electric field and the ion exchange speed in the ion exchange membrane it was revealed that ion valence state had a great influence on ion removal in ed in the above ed process concentration dialysis made the small molecular organic matter and ionic substances in the concentrated chamber reversely diffused to the diluted chamber thus hindering the electromigration process 30 31 however the ionization balance shifted to the ionic state to produce more ionic organics reducing the concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane 32 which was beneficial to the electromigration process of ed therefore the energy consumption of concentrating the same amount of ions under the same concentration difference would be reduced 3 3 treatment performance of ro in high and low pressure operation after ed treatment the organic matter and tds migrate from the diluted water to the concentrated water accompanied by the electrochemical reaction process the volume proportion of concentrated water was low for shale gas fracturing flowback fluid after ed treatment and the organic matter and tds were enriched in concentrated water therefore high operating pressure was applied to ro for the treatment the proportion of diluted water was high with low organic matter and tds thus low operating pressure was applied the ed combined with high and low pressure operation for ro was constructed for the treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid 3 3 1 treatment performance of ro in high pressure operation concentrated water of ed at a concentration efficiency with 80 5 treated by the ro in high pressure operation was shown in table 4 the amount of concentrated water treated by ro in high pressure operation could be reduced significantly at a concentration efficiency with 60 after the treatment by ed meanwhile the tds ec and cl in the diluted water after treatment were removed through ro in high pressure operation it was shown that the tds cl and cod concentration of diluted water was 490 mg l 294 2 mg l and 61 6 mg l respectively which met discharge standard of water pollutants in sichuan province in which tds 1000 mg l cl 300 mg l cod 100 mg l the flux change of ro membrane by the ro in high pressure operation was shown in fig 14 in the stage the membrane flux decreased smaller and smaller with the extension of time in the first 30 min the decline efficiency was 17 8 and in the last 50 min the decline efficiency changed to 5 and finally stabilized in the range of 36 06 36 21 l m2 h revealing the slight membrane fouling for ro it was found that the membrane fouling rate of ro might be related to the interaction of dom with the ionic strength and concentration of divalent cations 33 37 cations interact with the negatively charged carboxyl functional groups within the humic fraction of dom by charge interaction and adsorptive behaviour 38 thus decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between humic macromolecules 39 42 the duction in dom repulsion increases dom deposition on the membrane surface and causes the formation of a compact dense and thick fouling layer accordingly fouling increases with increasing ionic strength 43 it was showed that ro membrane in high pressure had certain resistance to cations most removed by ed resulting in slight membrane fouling 44 3 3 2 treatment performance of ro in low pressure operation diluted water of ed at a concentration efficiency with 80 5 treated by ro in low pressure operation was shown in table 5 and fig 15 for the diluted water treated by ed the tds conductivity and cod was removed efficiently by ro in the low pressure operation showing that the tds ec cod and cl were reduced to about 2 7 5 4 mg l 5 8 11 7 μs cm 18 3 26 8 mg l and 0 7 1 7 mg l respectively in other report multi stage ro was used for treatment of shale gas produced water in southern sichuan similarly the tds cod and cl of the treated water were 27 7 mg l 39 mg l and 16 1 mg l when the tds of the produced water was 2 104 mg l 45 compared with this report tds cod and cl of diluted water treated by ro in low pressure were lower than that in multi stage ro under a lower operation pressure therefore it could indicate that diluted water treated by ro in low pressure were obviously advanced purified the flux change of ro membrane for treating water untreated by ed and diluted water of ed in low pressure and membrane flux of ro was shown in fig 16 for the diluted water treated by ed the membrane flux hardly decreased significantly by the ro in low pressure operation however for the water without ed treatment the ro membrane flux decreased significantly in same pressure operation the average membrane flux decreased to about 30 of the diluted water after ed treatment the concentration efficiency of water sample after ed can reach 80 5 which means that only a small amount of concentrated water needs be treated by ro in high pressure operation for the conventional ro treatment a multi stage concentration process needs to be adopted and then large volume of water need be treated with high working pressure leading to high energy consumption furthermore the concentration of tds and cod of dilution water is low after ed treatment and the working pressure of ro was low for dilution water which could reduce energy consumption in addition the dilution water would not cause membrane blockage for ro improving operation stability it was revealed that the combined process of ed and ro can effectively improve the stability of treatment and reduce energy consumption 4 conclusions the ceramic membrane ed h l pressure ro process was constructed for the treatment of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid with high cod tds and tss and then the treatment efficiency and the migration mechanism of organic matter and tds was investigated it was concluded that the inorganic particles tss in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid could be removed through coagulation inorganic ceramic membrane pretreatment effectively with the removal efficiency about 97 5 meanwhile removal efficiency for the colloidal organic matter was about 31 9 however the removal efficiency of tds was smaller only 12 7 the morphology and structure of pollutants on the surface of ceramic membranes were analyzed by ftir sem and eds showing that in addition to c and o the atoms with high content in the membrane fouling were iron sodium silicon chlorine and manganese calcium and barium and according to the nh detected in the pollutants on the surface of the ceramic membrane it was revealed that the pam which used in shale gas fracturing fluid as additive inorganic crystals such as calcium and barium work together to form an organic and inorganic composite system the removal of organic pollutants was positively correlated with operating voltage in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid which increased from 61 7 to 79 4 with the increasing of operating voltage from 5 v to 20 v after ed treatment for 120 min the removal efficiency of polar substances such as phenol was higher than non polar substances such as n butane showing weak electrolyte substances with hydroxyl functional groups would be migrated under the influence of the electric field for the removal of the ions in shale gas fracturing flowback fluid final removal efficiency of so4 2 and cl reached 99 3 and 96 4 respectively the higher activity in the ion exchange membrane had a faster ion exchange rate as a divalent ion for so4 2 as well as the removal efficiency ca2 mg2 na and k which reached 99 7 99 6 95 8 and 99 2 respectively after 60 min showing that ion valence state had a significant influence on ion removal in ed for the diluted water treated by the ro in low pressure operation the cod and tds were about 11 6 mg l and 4 0 mg l respectively and the membrane flux hardly decrease significantly with high stability and flux indicating that the fouling of ro membrane was reduced effectively after treated by ed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12587,pollutants in water resources such as heavy metal ions and organic dyes are presently causing critical issues for human health and the environment among such pollutants organic dyes represent a significant class of contaminants they are generally discharged into water from dyeing textiles and or other industrial strategies removing these pollutants from wastewater is an important and vital task owing to the toxic impacts of organic dyes on animals plants and human health in this paper we outline and highlight recent reports on synthetic organic dyes and approaches for removing them including photocatalytic degradation we discuss the kinetics of the photodegradation of organic dye pollutants from wastewater using metal oxide metal organic framework metal sulphide halide polymer carbon nitride carbon based oxynitride and layered double hydroxide based ldh photocatalysts the applications considered the most significant for degrading organic dyes such as catalysis are attributed to different mechanisms notably the aromatic structures of organic dyes cause several difficulties in the process of water treatment and affect human health for example the azo dye colour is dependent on azo bonds and their associated auxochromes and chromophores molecular components responsible for the absorption or reflection of the falling light these components are harmful to the respiratory system cause skin irritation and in the case of direct contact with the eyes may cause permanent damage in addition to physical hazards of such effluent materials they may also cause mutagenic effects in microorganisms and rats including dna damage ultimately we summarise the challenges and prospects for managing pollutants such as those from organic dyes in wastewater graphical

water photodegradation hazard data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the water environment represents the surroundings in which humans plants animals and micro organisms live or function in the water 1 the contamination of water resources is a significant and negative consequence of human agricultural and industrial development activities 2 3 this contamination often occurs owing to discharges of sewage untreated low treated improperly treated water into various lakes rivers and oceans 4 6 in the recent decades water contamination has become an urgent potentially disastrous and unaffordable issue for the global society 1 7 10 the pollution density varies from area to area according to the degrees of industrial and urbanisation as well as their effects on the effluents discharge quantities 11 12 the categorisations of pollutant types are intensive for example they may be classified as organic or inorganic 13 14 dyes 15 paints 16 fertilisers 17 18 pesticides 19 21 personal care products 22 23 petrochemicals 24 cosmetics 25 pharmaceuticals 26 steel 27 metal plating 28 fuel production products 28 29 and flame retardants 30 31 this review discusses the effects of dyes and pesticides as water contaminants and the role of photocatalysts as a promising effective technique for their removal dyes are widely used in various industrial fields with the reported annual production from the different dyes reaching up to 8 105 tons 32 they are widely applied in several fields such as food 33 34 paper 35 paints 36 pharmaceuticals 37 textiles 38 and leather 38 39 the release of untreated poorly treated water containing dye residues is disastrous to the ecosystem 40 because the discharge process reduces the oxygen content of the aquatic environment leading to detrimental effects on the flora and fauna 41 moreover these pollutants ultimately reach human bodies as they bioaccumulate inside the marine creatures consumed by humans causing harmful effects to human health for example methylene blue damages human nervous system and eyes as well as other negative symptoms such as breathing difficulties vomiting diarrhoea gastritis infections and nausea 38 these are the effects of only one dye presently approximately 90 000 different types of synthetic dyes are in use 42 for example pesticides fungicides herbicides insecticides and fertilisers are used to enhance the productivity of crops to meet the large demands for food 43 44 owing to the uncontrolled use of these products excessive amounts of these pollutants often penetrate the soil profile and reach underground water or leak into nearby running water owing to surface run off 45 these chemicals accumulate in water owing to their low solubility and non biodegradability 46 48 they enter the trophic chain through bioaccumulation in fishes plants and organisms and then successively reach the human body as marine food while causing noticeable deleterious effects to the ecosystem 49 these toxins in water cause cancers reproductive disorders blood disorders immune system suppression gastrointestinal disturbances hormonal imbalances and heart and kidney issues thus pollutants are an urgent issue that must be addressed to ensure the safety of the system several techniques are employed for water purification including membrane filtration adsorption ozonation flocculation thermal combustion biological degradation solvent extraction hydrolysis and reverse osmosis 50 51 however these techniques suffer from several drawbacks limiting their application such as costs and the generation of secondary products 52 in this review we discuss photocatalysis as a promising and effective technique for managing different pollutants with solar energy as the driving force for the degradation process photocatalysts produce electron hole e h pairs owing to solar light absorption these subsequently catalyse the degradation process 53 54 the photo generated e h pairs react and produce free radicals these react with the water contaminants and dissociate them into simpler and smaller non toxic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide based on using photocatalyst and degradation as search keywords for documents the number of published papers considering this approach successively increased in 2021 and 2022 55 60 the development of semi conductors as an effective photocatalyst remains an endless challenge several semiconductors such as metal oxides metal sulphides metal free polymers and metal organic frameworks mofs for the catalytic degradation of various pollutants in conjunction with the development of strategies for defect engineering heterojunction systems and so on other challenges relate to the cost amount of utilised solar energy and rate of recombination of the e h pairs limiting the real life application of this technique in this context the use of photocatalysts continues to suffer from an incomplete understanding of its kinetics and mechanisms accordingly this paper provides a comprehensive and detailed review of different species of prepared dyes as toxic pollutants along with their history importance and uses it also considers photocatalysis as an effective remediation technique and discusses its types results and reaction mechanisms 2 organic dyes organic dyes are compounds used to change the colours of various substrates such as water and paper by binding themselves to internal and external subject surfaces nevertheless they are considered as a double edged sword in particular they are widely used in various industrial activities however as they are non biodegradable and toxic they cause harmful effects on the human body and environment 55 there are a wide variety of classifications of organic dyes including whether they are natural or synthetic 56 57 natural dyes are classified based on their origin solubility whether they are substantive and the colours formed 58 59 whereas synthetic dyes are classified based on their constitution ionic nature and application in addition to their dissolution properties in aqueous media cationic anionic and non ionic cationic dyes include basic dyes only anionic dyes include reactive direct and acid dyes and non ionic dyes include disperse dyes these dyes can be further classified based on their chemical structures into azo dyes and non azo dyes azo dyes represent the largest group of dyes approximately 50 of industrial dyes and colourants and include a wide variety of classes and groups the presence of carboxyl hydroxyl sulphoxyl or amino acids lead to amphoteric properties in azo dyes the importance of azo dyes lies in their wide applicability including in fields such as the textile industry and in applications such as papers and printing however they have non desirable and hazardous effects on aquatic life and subsequently on humans allergies health disturbances and other illnesses accordingly these dyes must ultimately be removed or converted into safe or useful products in this context the complex aromatic structures of these dyes can also cause several difficulties in the path of water treatment and affect microorganisms and human health 2 1 natural dyes earth includes natural sources for dyes such as roots fig 1 other natural sources such as insects animals and plants have also shown potential for use in dyes 60 62 because natural dyes are biodegradable their impacts on the environment are low relative to those from synthetic dyes and they have renewable sources 63 64 however natural dyes suffer from several issues including no standard methods for extraction or applications high costs poor colourfastness and metallic mordants that cause pollution 65 67 mordants are auxiliary additives mostly metal salts for increasing the uptake and improving the colourfastness properties of produced dyed textiles 64 the energy consumption level is high in the extraction and exhaust dyeing processes and the affinity for the fibres is low leading to lower dye exhaustion on the surface of the target fibre in addition it is nearly impossible to reproduce shades moreover a large quantity of dye is generally desired for small textile colouring as the colour component content is a very small percentage of overall solid this excess consumption represents a strong threat to the corresponding natural animal or plant resources 68 69 2 2 synthetic dyes according to their chemical structures there are several classifications of dyes the following discussion concerns classifications based on the chemical structures constitution fig 2 2 2 1 azo dyes occupying the no 1 position among dyes as the most widely used and versatile dyes azo dyes represent approximately 60 of all dyes being used 70 the functional group in azo dyes is represented by two nitrogen atoms with a double bond azo group with each nitrogen atom bonded with a or b groups a n n b provided that one of them or both are aromatic groups 71 the geometrical structure is more common with transposition and is characterised by sp2 hybridisation and a bond angle of 120 for the nitrogen atom azo dyes are classified based on the number of azo linkages in the molecule into disazo monoazo polyazo trisazo and azoic 72 73 azo dyes are commonly synthesised in two steps diazotisation of the primary aromatic amine and coupling of the produced diazonium salt with the appropriate electron rich nucleophile 74 other less common methods for the synthesis of azo dyes include the oxidation of primary amines using strong oxidising agents such as potassium permanganate reduction of nitrous compounds quinones and hydrazine condensation monoazo dyes are the most popular commercial azo dyes and use a and b groups as the hydroxyl and amino groups respectively with the first being the electron accepting group and the second the electron donating group 75 76 in general monoazo dyes have a relatively simple synthesis process and can provide a very large number of substituents accordingly they are considered as the most important group among the synthetic dyes and are widely applied in various fields including the pharmaceutical plastic textile paper printing and leather industries 76 77 they are generally synthesised in two steps as noted above the first is the diazotisation of the aromatic amine and the second is the coupling of the produced diazonium salt with a proper electron rich nucleophile 74 despite their importance and wide application they have harmful effects for example benzidine an azo dye component is common in human bladder cancer 78 79 a higher percentage of bladder cancer has been found among azo dye workers 80 81 in addition to being carcinogenic they are mutagenic and genotoxic and have lethal effects on both flora and fauna including humans and animals 82 83 notably the azo dye colour is dependent on the azo bonds and their associated auxochromes a group of atoms mixed with suitable chromophores to enhance the colour and chromophores molecular components that are responsible for the absorption or reflection of the falling light 84 86 2 2 2 indigo dyes indigo dyes are based on intense blue powder crystals with an organic structure chemical formula of c16h10n2o2 and molecular weight of 262 2 they are insoluble in water based non polar and aqueous acid and base solvents but are soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide nitrobenzene and dimethylformamide the maximum light absorption wavelength is approximately 613 nm 35 87 thioindigo c16h8o2s2 4 7 4 7 tetrachloro thioindigo and 6 6 di bromoindigo are all derivatives of indigo resulting from modification of the aromatic ring 88 89 indigo dyes can be produced from synthetic azo dye substances naturally indigo can be extracted from indigofera tinctoria leaves 90 adolf von baeyer discovered the chemical structure of indigo and its distinctive blue colour in 1880 91 92 indigo dyes are used in several applications including papers plastic corrective creations food photochemical and medications 93 94 previously studies on their use in dyeing blue jeans have indicated that each pair of jeans requires 3 12 g of dye 91 in 2001 the global need for indigo dye was 22 000 tons per year this increased to approximately 50 000 tons per year by 2011 95 96 there is no clear estimation or calculations regarding the recent annual production but it surely has exceeded the annual production in 2011 owing to the wide application of these dyes as the controlling factor in production is the demand despite their importance and wide and variable application they have harmful effects on the qualities of rivers plants and soils the degree of these effects is a function of their composition specifically their industrial manufacturing results in the discharge of metals as cr cu and cd in the effluents with poisonous effects on aquatic life and if covering the water surface negative effects on the photosynthesis process more generally they represent a strong threat to the aquatic ecology insofar as effects on humans they are harmful to the respiratory system cause skin irritation and in the case of direct contact with the eyes can cause permanent damage 88 97 98 2 2 3 anthraquinone dyes the base skeleton of an anthraquinone dye is 9 10 anthraquinone representing a backbone of the natural quinoids naturally occurring in glycosidic forms it is extracted from natural sources including plant roots such as those in the rubiaceae plant family madder indian mulberry chay root or from scale insects such as kermes cochineals and lacs 99 102 owing to its remarkable spectroscopic properties anthraquinone dye is widely used in sensing applications 103 in 1868 chemists charles graebe and charles libermann demonstrated the first synthetic anthraquinone production that of alizarin ph indicator 104 105 various colours can be extracted according to the variation of the metallic salt mordant being used from red to orange or to a certain degree in between such as in brown and purple colours 106 107 they are extensively applied in paper cowhide beautifier food material and drug enterprises owing to their integration capabilities and accessibility for various shades 50 108 certain quinones such as anthraquinones benzoquinones and naphthoquinones show excitation in the range of 350 500 nm and emission in the range of 500 600 nm thereby demonstrating good fluorophorescence behaviours in general most of their species emissions are in the range 450 850 nm and basically depend on the pattern of substitution in the anthraquinone core 109 111 despite their wide application they have significant disadvantages they can cause cancer in addition owing to the discharge of water containing their residuals they can reduce the penetration of light into water thereby affecting the photosynthesis process and o2 disintegration levels in the water in addition to the hazardous aspects of the effluent materials these materials may also have mutagenic effects for example dna damage to microorganisms and rats 112 115 2 2 4 phthalocyanine dyes macrocyclic compounds represent a large and remarkable class with high technological importance 116 and are distinguished by their pi electron conjugation system and near infrared intense absorption 117 phthalocyanine dyes comprise macrocyclic compounds and are known for their stability variable coordination properties improved characteristic properties and architectural properties these remarkable unique properties have led to significant interest in their use in various technological and scientific areas 118 their coordination complexes require a suitable transition metal ion such as ru ii 119 120 pd ii or pt ii 121 and ir iii 122 zn ii cu ii ni ii 123 or re i 124 as it plays an important role in tuning the properties of the excited state and creating intense colours 119 125 their preparations always occur at high temperatures approximately 200 c with or without solvents using the cyclotetramerisation processes of a phthalic anhydride or phthalonitrile provided the presence of a suitable metal ion source and time for the reaction up to 24 h 126 this process uses low cost precursors thus the time and temperature are the main drawbacks using ammonium molybdate as a catalyst will accelerate the reaction but also contaminates the product 127 phthalocyanine colours are restricted to blue and green colours because they are only slightly affected by the substituents in addition to owing to their previously mentioned characteristics they are distinguished by their special optoelectronic properties and are widely applicable to optical devices chemical sensors electronic devices solar cells printing inks paints liquid crystals fibres and non linear optics 128 131 2 2 5 sulphur dyes in 1966 the estimated annual production of sulphur dyes was 110 000 120 000 tons 132 133 they are low cost dyes widely applicable for dyeing cellulosic fibres blends representing approximately 50 of the dyes used in cellulosic fibres and for use in limited quantities in dyeing silks leather and paper 134 136 in 1861 cachou de laval et al commercially produced a sulphur dye by heating bran and sawdust in the presence of sodium polysulphide at 300 c 137 the process of sulphur dyeing requires a reducing agent such as sodium sulphide in recent decades several other materials have been applied as reducing agents including thiourea dioxide 138 sulphur dyes are known for their special dull colour range this distinguishes them from the other dye classes in addition to being inexpensive they are easily applicable have good lightfastness and excellent washing performance however during the manufacturing process approximately 10 40 of sulphur dyes are released as effluents reportedly containing harmful concentrations of both sulphides and inorganic salts like sodium thiosulphate 133 139 these represent sulphur sources in various shapes such as gases or oxidising agents in water and can even change ph of the medium with corresponding negative effects on the environment 140 2 2 6 nitro and nitroso dyes nitro and nitroso dyes relatively rarely used types of dyes comprising small molecular structures 141 in the past they were used for dyeing natural animal fibres such as silk and wool they have a natural dyeing property in addition to the ability to form metal complexes to create pigments or acid dyes 74 142 to be classified as a nitro or nitroso dye the corresponding compound should include at least one nitro or nitroso group conjugated through the aromatic system with the electron donating group 35 nitro dyes are used in drugs pesticides engineered materials and shadings 143 one of the most familiar types of nitro compounds are mono nitrophenols such as the p nitrophenol compound used in explosives pesticide applications wood additive substances and cowhide concealment 144 nevertheless mutagenic effects and diseases result from using these compounds 145 nitroso compounds are derivatives of the o nitrosophenols or naphthols and are also cancer causing materials for example n nitroso can be used to develop carcinogenic compounds 146 147 and n nitrosamines and n nitroamides can cause cancer in the tissues of the respiratory and gastro intestinal systems including the throat kidney and liver 148 152 these dyes are detected in the water and their carcinogenic effects on human are hazardous in addition they are difficult to remove 153 some of the chromophoric groups in organic dyes are shown in table 1 2 3 synthetic dyes according to their chemical structure synthetic dyes can be classified into six types according to their solubility in the aqueous environment and application as shown in fig 3 and table 2 2 3 1 reactive dyes reactive dyes are characterised by their high water fastness water solubility cationic nature and non biodegradability they are classified as salt controllable alkali controllable and temperature controllable they show significant capabilities for reacting with fibre groups forming covalent bonds and reacting with cellulose they are often used in cellulosic fibres in addition to relatively minor use in silk and wool fibres because they contain at least one active group in their base structure 154 157 2 3 2 direct dyes direct dyes are common class of dyes and are easily and widely applicable in colouring paper products and cellulose fibres they include water soluble and anionic dyes 158 160 congo red was discovered an 1884 as the first direct dye 161 they show good dyeing properties and adding salt enhances the dyeing process mordant use is indispensable 74 162 compared to reactive dyes they are characterised by a higher molecular mass lower electrolyte level and higher exhaustion rate which means a better reproducibility of colours 162 dyes such as azo phthalocyanine stibene and oxazine dyes have direct dye structures 163 164 2 3 3 disperse dyes a disperse dye is characterised by its persistence biodegradability water solubility and non ionic properties making it applicable to hydrophobic fibres such as cellulose nylon acrylic and polyester fibres from aqueous dispersions 165 166 disperse dyes include the nitro anthraquinone and azo groups with the azo group representing over 50 of disperse dyes in use 74 based on the sublimation temperature a is the lowest sublimation temperature and has a smaller molecular size than d the highest sublimation temperature certain class members play important roles in thermal transfer printing and electronic photography 167 2 3 4 vat dyes water insoluble dyes outperform other dyes insofar as their colour reproducibility colour fastness colour value and ease of the dyeing process 168 previous reports have referred to their solubility in hot water and alkaline media such as na2co3 169 they are commonly used to colour cottons the annual consumption in 1992 was 33 000 tons and has increased to be approximately 120 000 tons 170 172 indigoid represents the main branch of this dye its water insolubility leads to outstanding wash stability the application process requires a reduction process to make the dye soluble after their uptake to the targeted substrate they are reoxidised to be water insoluble forming hydrogen and or van der waals bonding the latter in the case of a cellulosic substrate 171 173 their application cost is lower than reactive dyes however they are used relatively less potentially owing to insufficient knowledge regarding such dyes and their complex application in their reduced form they show good affinity to cellulose fibres accordingly they represent 24 of cellulose dyes 174 vat black and vat yellow are most widely applied colours in industry 74 175 2 3 5 acid dyes water soluble organic and anionic sulphonated dyes with an acidic nature such as congo red arise from the presence of one so3h and cooh ion in each molecule 176 177 these are available in markets as sodium salts most of these dyes are applied in an acidic nature with ph values in the range of 4 4 5 to provide good stability 178 they are extensively applied in polyamides silks leather nylon wool cotton pharmaceuticals printing textiles and paper 179 180 they are known for their brightness and colour fastness they include they nitro nitroso azo anthrauinone and triphenylmethane groups the classifications of acid dyes vary widely and may depend on the application properties and changeability of their strength 136 177 2 3 6 basic dyes basic dyes are available in markets as soluble chloride salts they are water soluble cationic dyes with low colour fastness they are electrostatically attracted to negatively charged substrates and are applied with retarders 181 the cationic property arises from the ammonium cation and their application requires the observation of several factors as they are not applied as direct or acid dyes to avoid possible precipitation the retarders are used owing to poor migration and require care to avoid blocking anionic sites and achieve the optimum uptake and required degree of shade darkness 176 182 they can be treated with antimony potassium tartrate or tannins as a good solution to insolubility 136 they are applied to modify nylons polyester paper wool silks and acrylics 183 they are also applied as stabilising agents for ionic liquids used as electrolytes in batteries fuel cells and solar cells 184 185 they may classified into two main branches based on the charge i e as localised or delocalised to the ammonium group 176 3 photocatalytic degradation of dyes 3 1 fundamentals of environmental photocatalysis various environments worldwide are contaminated with various pollutants and several techniques have been introduced to remove these pollutants correspondingly researchers are developing more efficient and low cost catalysts while also seeking new materials to work as catalysts 211 215 new materials are continuously being developed for effective use in various applications 217 241 for example photocatalysis is based on photocatalytic reaction and employs solar energy as a driving force to cause reactions to degrade a myriad of pollutants such as dyes pharmaceuticals and heavy metals 243 273 approximately 45 of the solar energy reaching the earth is visible light fig 4 by controlling the band gap width researchers can develop create new photocatalysts one challenge in producing new photocatalyst materials is that it is difficult to classify them into definite groups based on collected data we identified over 10 main branches of photocatalysts based on the photocatalyst compositions and types collected over trials and covering the full field of oxides sulphides halides nitrides ii vi iii v carbon based materials doped materials elemental metal nanoparticles nps molecular organic frameworks and oxynitrides in addition to hybrid structures used as core shells 275 286 each group may be further classified into several branches e g metal sulphides may be single metallic bi metallic or mof based these may be even further classified into series such as material of institute lavoisier mil university of oslo uio zeolitic imidazolate framework zif isoreticular mofs irmofs and porous coordination networks pcns irmof is an advanced version of mof 5 with a modified structure it has a mesoporous material structure unlike the other mofs microporous structures uio are zirconium based mofs zifs are sieves of silica alumina structures a pore cage channel and cubic octahedral nanopores can be detected in a pcn the mil type materials were discovered and fabricated in 2002 by ferey et al the structure was reported to be a rigid cage with large cage pores 3 2 major mechanisms photocatalysis has received great attention as it allows for the maximum utilisation of sustainable solar energy that is for use in disassociating pollutants into simpler smaller and non toxic components 287 semiconductors in several shapes as mentioned above are the most widely used materials for this process the photocatalytic process includes the degradation of pollutants based on light illumination oxidising agents such as o2 and suitable semiconductors more than one process can occur on the surface of a semiconductor including both oxidation and reduction reactions photocatalysis is a multi step process and includes the formation of various intermediates for a better understanding of the photocatalysis process it is generally divided into several steps 288 290 the first step is the adsorption of the organic pollutant onto the catalyst surface the second is the absorption of a suitable photon with an energy value equal or greater than the band gap energy this absorbed quanta of energy will excite the electron to move from the valence band vb into the conduction band cb leaving a positive hole in the vb third the generated e h pairs migrate to the surface of the catalyst to degrade the pollutant through redox reactions fourth oxidation and reduction reactions occur in both the h2o and o2 molecules on the surface of the catalyst producing hydroxyl oh and superoxide hoo radicals from the vb holes and cb electrons respectively the free radicals degrade the pollutant molecules into simpler and smaller molecules such as co2 and h2o and allow for the desorption of the smaller degraded molecules fig 5 the incident photons can only excite the vb electrons if the incident photon energy is equal to or greater than the energy of the band gap otherwise the energy dissipates in the form of heat 291 the holes can directly participate in the degradation and indirectly oxidise the organic pollutants by reacting with water to produce free radicals oh to oxidise the pollutants the cb electrons reduce the surface catalyst adsorbed oxygen the electron accumulation in the cb is not a desired effect as it increases the recombination of the generated e h pairs 287 292 the below equations describe the general stages of the reaction and formation of radicals until reaching the degraded smaller simpler molecules 289 293 295 specifically eq 1 describes the formation of e h pairs as incident photons with a suitable energy comparable to the band gap energy the semi conductor electrons are excited from the vb into the cb and leave h behind them resulting in the formation of the e h pairs oxidising radicals hydroxyl radicals e h and superoxide radicals are formed as a result of the charge transfer process eqs 2 5 describe the superoxide o2 formation as a result of the integration reaction between the oxygen molecules on the semiconductor surface and electrons the water molecules dissociate into h and oh ions that contribute to the photocatalytic process when the protons react with superoxides o2 forming hydroperoxyl radicals hoo distinguished by their scavenging properties these then react with oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 eqs 6 and 7 describe the formation of oh radicals as occurring through two paths first when the oh from the h2o dissociation reacts with h and second from the dissociation of h2o2 into oh the hydroxyl radicals of the oh oxidise the organic contaminants into co2 h2o and other potentially toxic compounds for further confirmation the intermediate and final compounds of the degraded contamination must be followed through pathways for instance azo dyes are literated and toxic intermediate compounds such as 1 4 benzoquinoneor and 1 2 naphtoquinone are detected as degraded with time into short chain carboxylic acids 296 acid orange 7 benzene derivatives and naphthalene compounds are detected as intermediate compounds and aliphatic acids from the ring cleavage and then are decomposed into co2 to complete the mineralisation process 297 307 1 catalyst hv e cb h vb 2 e o 2 o 2 oxidized product co 2 h 2 o 3 e

oxides as photocatalysts metal oxides have made significant contributions to the fields of chemistry physics and material science owing to their response to changes occurring in both composition and structure and their excellent chemical physical optical and magnetic properties they have received great research interest with the aims of reaching a better understanding and achieving their optimum functionalisation 309 310 they are easily formed and exhibit excellent photoactivity in response to light exposure transition metal oxides are widely applicable in various industries such as in batteries and alloys table 3 311 in particular d block elements are used as catalysts sensors superconducting materials photosensitisers and ceramics 309 312 the photocatalytic properties of metal oxides mainly depend on the light absorption and generation of the e h pairs responsible for the catalytic properties some reports have referred to other generated species with good tendencies in their biological macromolecules such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxides among the studied photocatalysts titanium and zinc oxides have received the most attention owing to their excellent properties 313 photocatalytic enhancement strategies include doping morphology control and defect engineering 282 several metal oxides are used as photocatalysts including copper iron cobalt molybdenum vanadium and tungsten they may be used individually in composites or in heterojunction structures 314 3 4 metal organic frameworks mofs the concept of mofs was first proposed in the 1990s after the synthesis of mof 5 by yaghi et al 329 339 the mof structure is formed by a combination of metal and organic ligands table 4 340 mofs are crystalline and may be 1d 2d or 3d they comprise porous materials owing to their structural flexibility they are capable of loading a wide variety of functional groups or nanoparticles this is the major factor responsible for the presence of the myriad of mof structures and the reason for their use in various applications such as adsorption catalytic reactions and energy generation with the continuous developments in material engineering in science and specifically those in regards to mofs mofs with semiconductor properties can help in creating shorter transport distances for carriers 341 in addition mofs are characterised by the easy separation of the e h pairs owing to the high porosity in addition to the organic linker the metal centre and oxidation state also affect the properties of the final mofs the catalytic advantages of mofs can be optimised by using the most suitable fabrication methods for composites 342 various composite fabrication strategies have been developed such as hydrothermal solvothermal microwave sonication oil bath solution precipitation and template methods in the last few years researchers have attempted to make the best use of mofs as photocatalysts by functionalising them for the degradation of various pollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and dyes 343 the family of mofs can be classified into several series such as as mentioned above mil uio zif irmof and pcn table 4 the details of these classes are provided above in section 3 1 344 345 3 5 metal sulphides metal sulphides are compounds resulting from the combination of an anion sulphide and cation metal they represent the simplest inorganic form of sulphur and are divided into two main branches single metal sulphides zns bi2s3 and mos2 and bi metallic sulphides cuco2s4 and cdins table 5 in general metal sulphides have unique absorption ranges and are excellent photocatalysts for environmental applications these applications rely on the ability of sulphur to reduce the energy gap width the fabrication of metal sulphides is based on the combination of a sulphur source with a reduced metal semi metal source band gap width owing to the sulphur most metal sulphides show high symmetry stunning physical and chemical properties and simple structures with low hardness and high specific gravity a good understanding of their photocatalytic properties has directed researchers towards heterostructures and morphology manipulations 361 373 bi2s3 nps with low toxicity and high electron counts are among the most promising compounds in this regard furthermore bi2s3 nanostructures have attracted attention owing to their unique morphologies tubular topologies excellent physical properties and high charging capacities however the narrow eg of bi2s3 also accelerates the generation of e h pairs via the recombination of photons resulting in a low separation efficiency for the e h pairs ghoreishian et al 216 synthesised bi2s3 cds s scheme heterostructured photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of cr vi the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly ascribed to the formation of an s scheme heterostructure the electron spin resonance and reactive radical scavenging results implied that o2 was primarily responsible for the removal of the cr vi nevertheless the redox abilities of metal sulphides are often lower than those of the corresponding metal oxides in addition the low stability of metal sulphides during photocatalysis limits their further application 388 396 3 6 halide in 1839 the russian mineralogist lev perovski discovered the first perovskite material 397 398 perovskite materials have received great attention owing to their excellent properties including simple structures and preparations good flexibility high carrier mobility long carrier diffusion lengths strong light absorption and controllable emission wavelengths these have made them widely applicable in solar cells photodetectors light emitting diodes and photocatalysis procedures perovskite material studies have demonstrated their limited magnetic properties electronic transport and structural phase transitions 399 401 in 2009 a japanese team prepared a new metal halide perovskite mhp material for use in photovoltaic cells as mapbbr3 and mapbi3 402 mhps are recognised as semiconductor photocatalysts table 6 they can be used in pollutant degradation co2 reduction photocatalytic hydrogen generation and chemical reactions 398 however the large sizes of mhps often result in a small specific area reduced number of active sites and a long diffusion path for the photogenerated carriers to reach the photocatalyst surface as such several techniques have been introduced for enhancing the efficiency of mhps including the formation of heterostructures component engineering and morphology optimisations 398 the general structure formula of an mhp is abx 3 where a and b are cations a is a monovalent cation which may be inorganic as cs ions or organic as methylamine or formamidine and b represents a divalent metal cation such as ge or pb x is a halide anion such as i cl or br 400 3 7 polymers conjugated porous polymers are promising photocatalysts with porous structures stunning light capture abilities p conjugated skeletons good catalytic performance and reusability table 7 410 411 among these attractive materials covalent organic framework materials are characterised by their crystallinity high porosities high surface areas excellent chemical and thermal stabilities good charge separation factors extensive range of visible light absorption abilities π conjugated structures and π π stacking layers 412 these properties allow them to be used in several applications such as dye degradation co2 reduction photocatalytic h2o splitting and organic transformation 413 the modification of these materials to form new photocatalysts is another promising approach using these materials with graphene boron nitride and sulphur provides an approach to achieving efficient photocatalysis 414 3 8 carbon nitride polymeric materials are strong photocatalysts synthesised from low cost precursors they are widely used for hydrogen evolution water treatments and co2 conversion 424 429 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is known as melon in which imide groups work as bridges to the heptazine units forming chains that bond with other chains to form a 2d structure these can then be stacked to form a 3d structure 430 431 they are characterised by their oxidative and reductive powers water oxidation high chemical stability and visible light activation 431 3 9 carbon based photocatalysts the base skeleton of carbon based photocatalyst materials is carbon there are various sources of carbon 446 455 carbonaceous materials offer several excellent properties such as good stability a high surface area and enhanced charge carrier propagation 456 biomasses are a rich source of carbon activated carbon carbon nanotubes graphene graphene oxide and graphene quantum dots represent carbonaceous materials of various shapes carbonaceous materials are fertile soils for scientific research and can be used as adsorbent materials or to support excellent surface areas for photocatalysts carbon quantum dots and graphene quantum dots can also be used as fluorescence based quantum dots 457 3 10 oxynitrides in the last few decades research on oxynitride materials has increased because of their excellent properties facilitating their applications as photocatalysts phosphors pigments dielectrics and magnetic materials table 8 471 476 oxynitrides result from the combination of oxide and ammonia gases at 1000 c 139 the resulting structure combines the advantages of both oxides and nitrides and shows several excellent properties such as electrical conductivity corrosion resistivity stability higher than that of individual nitrides and good electronic and optical properties 477 3 11 layered double hydroxide ldh based photocatalysts layered double hydroxide ldh based photocatalysts are widely applicable for the treatment of pollutants the general formula is m1 x 2 m x 3 oh 2 a n x n x mh2o where m2 is a divalent cation such as cu2 zn2 co2 or ni2 and m3 are trivalent cations such as fe3 al3 or ga3 a n is an interlayer charge balancing anion such as cl co3 2 or so4 2 ldhs consisting of two or more divalent or trivalent cations with a positive charge density can be calcinated from the molar ratio of m2 m3 and neutralised with the interlayered anion 308 485 486 the calcination of the ldh at 400 500 converts it into a mixed metal oxide with a high surface area and good dispersion of cations 487 the preparation of different ldhs using various cation combinations results in new materials with new architectural and electronic properties table 9 ldhs have good stability owing to the charge neutrality resulting from the interlayered anion backbones of the ldhs they are considered as doped semiconductors and exhibit good adsorption capacities in addition to demonstrating photocatalytic properties which enhance their use in the degradation of pollutants 308 488 previous reports have indicated that their enhanced photoinduced degradation may be attributed to the pore volume distribution surface area and crystallite size doping and calcination are effective strategies for enhancing the efficiency of ldh samples for instance one study found that 489 the results for ldh doped and calcined samples in regards to the degradation of dyes were better than those for normal samples for example a ce doped zn al ce multi metal oxide showed higher efficiency than undoped samples and calcined samples resulted in higher efficiency than un calcined samples 490 517 4 conclusions this review outlines recent advances in the synthesis of organic dyes several different strategies have been adopted to overcome major process challenges and provide practicable applications regarding photocatalytic materials such as metal oxides mofs metal sulphides halides polymers carbon nitride carbon based photocatalysts oxynitrides and ldh based photocatalysts studies have shown the challenges of using the entire catalyst to degrade organic dyes these compounds cause different challenges in water treatment affecting both amines and humans azo compounds are dependent on their associated auxochromes and chromophores and the azo bond in the entire organic structure thus we attempted to understand the hazardous roles of effluent materials potentially causing mutagenic effects in wastewater treatment and summarised the challenges and prospects for addressing the pollutants such as organic dyes in wastewater in general the high surface to volume ratio of catalysts results from the complex catalytic bed geometry and makes it difficult to irradiate evenly for this purpose novel light sources such as organic catalysts have been successfully tested offering a more flexible and customisable irradiation profile all of the above photocatalysts have been reported as good alternatives for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency as the hybrid photocatalytic ozonation process presents a synergistic effect for the removal of volatile

12587,pollutants in water resources such as heavy metal ions and organic dyes are presently causing critical issues for human health and the environment among such pollutants organic dyes represent a significant class of contaminants they are generally discharged into water from dyeing textiles and or other industrial strategies removing these pollutants from wastewater is an important and vital task owing to the toxic impacts of organic dyes on animals plants and human health in this paper we outline and highlight recent reports on synthetic organic dyes and approaches for removing them including photocatalytic degradation we discuss the kinetics of the photodegradation of organic dye pollutants from wastewater using metal oxide metal organic framework metal sulphide halide polymer carbon nitride carbon based oxynitride and layered double hydroxide based ldh photocatalysts the applications considered the most significant for degrading organic dyes such as catalysis are attributed to different mechanisms notably the aromatic structures of organic dyes cause several difficulties in the process of water treatment and affect human health for example the azo dye colour is dependent on azo bonds and their associated auxochromes and chromophores molecular components responsible for the absorption or reflection of the falling light these components are harmful to the respiratory system cause skin irritation and in the case of direct contact with the eyes may cause permanent damage in addition to physical hazards of such effluent materials they may also cause mutagenic effects in microorganisms and rats including dna damage ultimately we summarise the challenges and prospects for managing pollutants such as those from organic dyes in wastewater graphical

water photodegradation hazard data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the water environment represents the surroundings in which humans plants animals and micro organisms live or function in the water 1 the contamination of water resources is a significant and negative consequence of human agricultural and industrial development activities 2 3 this contamination often occurs owing to discharges of sewage untreated low treated improperly treated water into various lakes rivers and oceans 4 6 in the recent decades water contamination has become an urgent potentially disastrous and unaffordable issue for the global society 1 7 10 the pollution density varies from area to area according to the degrees of industrial and urbanisation as well as their effects on the effluents discharge quantities 11 12 the categorisations of pollutant types are intensive for example they may be classified as organic or inorganic 13 14 dyes 15 paints 16 fertilisers 17 18 pesticides 19 21 personal care products 22 23 petrochemicals 24 cosmetics 25 pharmaceuticals 26 steel 27 metal plating 28 fuel production products 28 29 and flame retardants 30 31 this review discusses the effects of dyes and pesticides as water contaminants and the role of photocatalysts as a promising effective technique for their removal dyes are widely used in various industrial fields with the reported annual production from the different dyes reaching up to 8 105 tons 32 they are widely applied in several fields such as food 33 34 paper 35 paints 36 pharmaceuticals 37 textiles 38 and leather 38 39 the release of untreated poorly treated water containing dye residues is disastrous to the ecosystem 40 because the discharge process reduces the oxygen content of the aquatic environment leading to detrimental effects on the flora and fauna 41 moreover these pollutants ultimately reach human bodies as they bioaccumulate inside the marine creatures consumed by humans causing harmful effects to human health for example methylene blue damages human nervous system and eyes as well as other negative symptoms such as breathing difficulties vomiting diarrhoea gastritis infections and nausea 38 these are the effects of only one dye presently approximately 90 000 different types of synthetic dyes are in use 42 for example pesticides fungicides herbicides insecticides and fertilisers are used to enhance the productivity of crops to meet the large demands for food 43 44 owing to the uncontrolled use of these products excessive amounts of these pollutants often penetrate the soil profile and reach underground water or leak into nearby running water owing to surface run off 45 these chemicals accumulate in water owing to their low solubility and non biodegradability 46 48 they enter the trophic chain through bioaccumulation in fishes plants and organisms and then successively reach the human body as marine food while causing noticeable deleterious effects to the ecosystem 49 these toxins in water cause cancers reproductive disorders blood disorders immune system suppression gastrointestinal disturbances hormonal imbalances and heart and kidney issues thus pollutants are an urgent issue that must be addressed to ensure the safety of the system several techniques are employed for water purification including membrane filtration adsorption ozonation flocculation thermal combustion biological degradation solvent extraction hydrolysis and reverse osmosis 50 51 however these techniques suffer from several drawbacks limiting their application such as costs and the generation of secondary products 52 in this review we discuss photocatalysis as a promising and effective technique for managing different pollutants with solar energy as the driving force for the degradation process photocatalysts produce electron hole e h pairs owing to solar light absorption these subsequently catalyse the degradation process 53 54 the photo generated e h pairs react and produce free radicals these react with the water contaminants and dissociate them into simpler and smaller non toxic molecules such as water and carbon dioxide based on using photocatalyst and degradation as search keywords for documents the number of published papers considering this approach successively increased in 2021 and 2022 55 60 the development of semi conductors as an effective photocatalyst remains an endless challenge several semiconductors such as metal oxides metal sulphides metal free polymers and metal organic frameworks mofs for the catalytic degradation of various pollutants in conjunction with the development of strategies for defect engineering heterojunction systems and so on other challenges relate to the cost amount of utilised solar energy and rate of recombination of the e h pairs limiting the real life application of this technique in this context the use of photocatalysts continues to suffer from an incomplete understanding of its kinetics and mechanisms accordingly this paper provides a comprehensive and detailed review of different species of prepared dyes as toxic pollutants along with their history importance and uses it also considers photocatalysis as an effective remediation technique and discusses its types results and reaction mechanisms 2 organic dyes organic dyes are compounds used to change the colours of various substrates such as water and paper by binding themselves to internal and external subject surfaces nevertheless they are considered as a double edged sword in particular they are widely used in various industrial activities however as they are non biodegradable and toxic they cause harmful effects on the human body and environment 55 there are a wide variety of classifications of organic dyes including whether they are natural or synthetic 56 57 natural dyes are classified based on their origin solubility whether they are substantive and the colours formed 58 59 whereas synthetic dyes are classified based on their constitution ionic nature and application in addition to their dissolution properties in aqueous media cationic anionic and non ionic cationic dyes include basic dyes only anionic dyes include reactive direct and acid dyes and non ionic dyes include disperse dyes these dyes can be further classified based on their chemical structures into azo dyes and non azo dyes azo dyes represent the largest group of dyes approximately 50 of industrial dyes and colourants and include a wide variety of classes and groups the presence of carboxyl hydroxyl sulphoxyl or amino acids lead to amphoteric properties in azo dyes the importance of azo dyes lies in their wide applicability including in fields such as the textile industry and in applications such as papers and printing however they have non desirable and hazardous effects on aquatic life and subsequently on humans allergies health disturbances and other illnesses accordingly these dyes must ultimately be removed or converted into safe or useful products in this context the complex aromatic structures of these dyes can also cause several difficulties in the path of water treatment and affect microorganisms and human health 2 1 natural dyes earth includes natural sources for dyes such as roots fig 1 other natural sources such as insects animals and plants have also shown potential for use in dyes 60 62 because natural dyes are biodegradable their impacts on the environment are low relative to those from synthetic dyes and they have renewable sources 63 64 however natural dyes suffer from several issues including no standard methods for extraction or applications high costs poor colourfastness and metallic mordants that cause pollution 65 67 mordants are auxiliary additives mostly metal salts for increasing the uptake and improving the colourfastness properties of produced dyed textiles 64 the energy consumption level is high in the extraction and exhaust dyeing processes and the affinity for the fibres is low leading to lower dye exhaustion on the surface of the target fibre in addition it is nearly impossible to reproduce shades moreover a large quantity of dye is generally desired for small textile colouring as the colour component content is a very small percentage of overall solid this excess consumption represents a strong threat to the corresponding natural animal or plant resources 68 69 2 2 synthetic dyes according to their chemical structures there are several classifications of dyes the following discussion concerns classifications based on the chemical structures constitution fig 2 2 2 1 azo dyes occupying the no 1 position among dyes as the most widely used and versatile dyes azo dyes represent approximately 60 of all dyes being used 70 the functional group in azo dyes is represented by two nitrogen atoms with a double bond azo group with each nitrogen atom bonded with a or b groups a n n b provided that one of them or both are aromatic groups 71 the geometrical structure is more common with transposition and is characterised by sp2 hybridisation and a bond angle of 120 for the nitrogen atom azo dyes are classified based on the number of azo linkages in the molecule into disazo monoazo polyazo trisazo and azoic 72 73 azo dyes are commonly synthesised in two steps diazotisation of the primary aromatic amine and coupling of the produced diazonium salt with the appropriate electron rich nucleophile 74 other less common methods for the synthesis of azo dyes include the oxidation of primary amines using strong oxidising agents such as potassium permanganate reduction of nitrous compounds quinones and hydrazine condensation monoazo dyes are the most popular commercial azo dyes and use a and b groups as the hydroxyl and amino groups respectively with the first being the electron accepting group and the second the electron donating group 75 76 in general monoazo dyes have a relatively simple synthesis process and can provide a very large number of substituents accordingly they are considered as the most important group among the synthetic dyes and are widely applied in various fields including the pharmaceutical plastic textile paper printing and leather industries 76 77 they are generally synthesised in two steps as noted above the first is the diazotisation of the aromatic amine and the second is the coupling of the produced diazonium salt with a proper electron rich nucleophile 74 despite their importance and wide application they have harmful effects for example benzidine an azo dye component is common in human bladder cancer 78 79 a higher percentage of bladder cancer has been found among azo dye workers 80 81 in addition to being carcinogenic they are mutagenic and genotoxic and have lethal effects on both flora and fauna including humans and animals 82 83 notably the azo dye colour is dependent on the azo bonds and their associated auxochromes a group of atoms mixed with suitable chromophores to enhance the colour and chromophores molecular components that are responsible for the absorption or reflection of the falling light 84 86 2 2 2 indigo dyes indigo dyes are based on intense blue powder crystals with an organic structure chemical formula of c16h10n2o2 and molecular weight of 262 2 they are insoluble in water based non polar and aqueous acid and base solvents but are soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide nitrobenzene and dimethylformamide the maximum light absorption wavelength is approximately 613 nm 35 87 thioindigo c16h8o2s2 4 7 4 7 tetrachloro thioindigo and 6 6 di bromoindigo are all derivatives of indigo resulting from modification of the aromatic ring 88 89 indigo dyes can be produced from synthetic azo dye substances naturally indigo can be extracted from indigofera tinctoria leaves 90 adolf von baeyer discovered the chemical structure of indigo and its distinctive blue colour in 1880 91 92 indigo dyes are used in several applications including papers plastic corrective creations food photochemical and medications 93 94 previously studies on their use in dyeing blue jeans have indicated that each pair of jeans requires 3 12 g of dye 91 in 2001 the global need for indigo dye was 22 000 tons per year this increased to approximately 50 000 tons per year by 2011 95 96 there is no clear estimation or calculations regarding the recent annual production but it surely has exceeded the annual production in 2011 owing to the wide application of these dyes as the controlling factor in production is the demand despite their importance and wide and variable application they have harmful effects on the qualities of rivers plants and soils the degree of these effects is a function of their composition specifically their industrial manufacturing results in the discharge of metals as cr cu and cd in the effluents with poisonous effects on aquatic life and if covering the water surface negative effects on the photosynthesis process more generally they represent a strong threat to the aquatic ecology insofar as effects on humans they are harmful to the respiratory system cause skin irritation and in the case of direct contact with the eyes can cause permanent damage 88 97 98 2 2 3 anthraquinone dyes the base skeleton of an anthraquinone dye is 9 10 anthraquinone representing a backbone of the natural quinoids naturally occurring in glycosidic forms it is extracted from natural sources including plant roots such as those in the rubiaceae plant family madder indian mulberry chay root or from scale insects such as kermes cochineals and lacs 99 102 owing to its remarkable spectroscopic properties anthraquinone dye is widely used in sensing applications 103 in 1868 chemists charles graebe and charles libermann demonstrated the first synthetic anthraquinone production that of alizarin ph indicator 104 105 various colours can be extracted according to the variation of the metallic salt mordant being used from red to orange or to a certain degree in between such as in brown and purple colours 106 107 they are extensively applied in paper cowhide beautifier food material and drug enterprises owing to their integration capabilities and accessibility for various shades 50 108 certain quinones such as anthraquinones benzoquinones and naphthoquinones show excitation in the range of 350 500 nm and emission in the range of 500 600 nm thereby demonstrating good fluorophorescence behaviours in general most of their species emissions are in the range 450 850 nm and basically depend on the pattern of substitution in the anthraquinone core 109 111 despite their wide application they have significant disadvantages they can cause cancer in addition owing to the discharge of water containing their residuals they can reduce the penetration of light into water thereby affecting the photosynthesis process and o2 disintegration levels in the water in addition to the hazardous aspects of the effluent materials these materials may also have mutagenic effects for example dna damage to microorganisms and rats 112 115 2 2 4 phthalocyanine dyes macrocyclic compounds represent a large and remarkable class with high technological importance 116 and are distinguished by their pi electron conjugation system and near infrared intense absorption 117 phthalocyanine dyes comprise macrocyclic compounds and are known for their stability variable coordination properties improved characteristic properties and architectural properties these remarkable unique properties have led to significant interest in their use in various technological and scientific areas 118 their coordination complexes require a suitable transition metal ion such as ru ii 119 120 pd ii or pt ii 121 and ir iii 122 zn ii cu ii ni ii 123 or re i 124 as it plays an important role in tuning the properties of the excited state and creating intense colours 119 125 their preparations always occur at high temperatures approximately 200 c with or without solvents using the cyclotetramerisation processes of a phthalic anhydride or phthalonitrile provided the presence of a suitable metal ion source and time for the reaction up to 24 h 126 this process uses low cost precursors thus the time and temperature are the main drawbacks using ammonium molybdate as a catalyst will accelerate the reaction but also contaminates the product 127 phthalocyanine colours are restricted to blue and green colours because they are only slightly affected by the substituents in addition to owing to their previously mentioned characteristics they are distinguished by their special optoelectronic properties and are widely applicable to optical devices chemical sensors electronic devices solar cells printing inks paints liquid crystals fibres and non linear optics 128 131 2 2 5 sulphur dyes in 1966 the estimated annual production of sulphur dyes was 110 000 120 000 tons 132 133 they are low cost dyes widely applicable for dyeing cellulosic fibres blends representing approximately 50 of the dyes used in cellulosic fibres and for use in limited quantities in dyeing silks leather and paper 134 136 in 1861 cachou de laval et al commercially produced a sulphur dye by heating bran and sawdust in the presence of sodium polysulphide at 300 c 137 the process of sulphur dyeing requires a reducing agent such as sodium sulphide in recent decades several other materials have been applied as reducing agents including thiourea dioxide 138 sulphur dyes are known for their special dull colour range this distinguishes them from the other dye classes in addition to being inexpensive they are easily applicable have good lightfastness and excellent washing performance however during the manufacturing process approximately 10 40 of sulphur dyes are released as effluents reportedly containing harmful concentrations of both sulphides and inorganic salts like sodium thiosulphate 133 139 these represent sulphur sources in various shapes such as gases or oxidising agents in water and can even change ph of the medium with corresponding negative effects on the environment 140 2 2 6 nitro and nitroso dyes nitro and nitroso dyes relatively rarely used types of dyes comprising small molecular structures 141 in the past they were used for dyeing natural animal fibres such as silk and wool they have a natural dyeing property in addition to the ability to form metal complexes to create pigments or acid dyes 74 142 to be classified as a nitro or nitroso dye the corresponding compound should include at least one nitro or nitroso group conjugated through the aromatic system with the electron donating group 35 nitro dyes are used in drugs pesticides engineered materials and shadings 143 one of the most familiar types of nitro compounds are mono nitrophenols such as the p nitrophenol compound used in explosives pesticide applications wood additive substances and cowhide concealment 144 nevertheless mutagenic effects and diseases result from using these compounds 145 nitroso compounds are derivatives of the o nitrosophenols or naphthols and are also cancer causing materials for example n nitroso can be used to develop carcinogenic compounds 146 147 and n nitrosamines and n nitroamides can cause cancer in the tissues of the respiratory and gastro intestinal systems including the throat kidney and liver 148 152 these dyes are detected in the water and their carcinogenic effects on human are hazardous in addition they are difficult to remove 153 some of the chromophoric groups in organic dyes are shown in table 1 2 3 synthetic dyes according to their chemical structure synthetic dyes can be classified into six types according to their solubility in the aqueous environment and application as shown in fig 3 and table 2 2 3 1 reactive dyes reactive dyes are characterised by their high water fastness water solubility cationic nature and non biodegradability they are classified as salt controllable alkali controllable and temperature controllable they show significant capabilities for reacting with fibre groups forming covalent bonds and reacting with cellulose they are often used in cellulosic fibres in addition to relatively minor use in silk and wool fibres because they contain at least one active group in their base structure 154 157 2 3 2 direct dyes direct dyes are common class of dyes and are easily and widely applicable in colouring paper products and cellulose fibres they include water soluble and anionic dyes 158 160 congo red was discovered an 1884 as the first direct dye 161 they show good dyeing properties and adding salt enhances the dyeing process mordant use is indispensable 74 162 compared to reactive dyes they are characterised by a higher molecular mass lower electrolyte level and higher exhaustion rate which means a better reproducibility of colours 162 dyes such as azo phthalocyanine stibene and oxazine dyes have direct dye structures 163 164 2 3 3 disperse dyes a disperse dye is characterised by its persistence biodegradability water solubility and non ionic properties making it applicable to hydrophobic fibres such as cellulose nylon acrylic and polyester fibres from aqueous dispersions 165 166 disperse dyes include the nitro anthraquinone and azo groups with the azo group representing over 50 of disperse dyes in use 74 based on the sublimation temperature a is the lowest sublimation temperature and has a smaller molecular size than d the highest sublimation temperature certain class members play important roles in thermal transfer printing and electronic photography 167 2 3 4 vat dyes water insoluble dyes outperform other dyes insofar as their colour reproducibility colour fastness colour value and ease of the dyeing process 168 previous reports have referred to their solubility in hot water and alkaline media such as na2co3 169 they are commonly used to colour cottons the annual consumption in 1992 was 33 000 tons and has increased to be approximately 120 000 tons 170 172 indigoid represents the main branch of this dye its water insolubility leads to outstanding wash stability the application process requires a reduction process to make the dye soluble after their uptake to the targeted substrate they are reoxidised to be water insoluble forming hydrogen and or van der waals bonding the latter in the case of a cellulosic substrate 171 173 their application cost is lower than reactive dyes however they are used relatively less potentially owing to insufficient knowledge regarding such dyes and their complex application in their reduced form they show good affinity to cellulose fibres accordingly they represent 24 of cellulose dyes 174 vat black and vat yellow are most widely applied colours in industry 74 175 2 3 5 acid dyes water soluble organic and anionic sulphonated dyes with an acidic nature such as congo red arise from the presence of one so3h and cooh ion in each molecule 176 177 these are available in markets as sodium salts most of these dyes are applied in an acidic nature with ph values in the range of 4 4 5 to provide good stability 178 they are extensively applied in polyamides silks leather nylon wool cotton pharmaceuticals printing textiles and paper 179 180 they are known for their brightness and colour fastness they include they nitro nitroso azo anthrauinone and triphenylmethane groups the classifications of acid dyes vary widely and may depend on the application properties and changeability of their strength 136 177 2 3 6 basic dyes basic dyes are available in markets as soluble chloride salts they are water soluble cationic dyes with low colour fastness they are electrostatically attracted to negatively charged substrates and are applied with retarders 181 the cationic property arises from the ammonium cation and their application requires the observation of several factors as they are not applied as direct or acid dyes to avoid possible precipitation the retarders are used owing to poor migration and require care to avoid blocking anionic sites and achieve the optimum uptake and required degree of shade darkness 176 182 they can be treated with antimony potassium tartrate or tannins as a good solution to insolubility 136 they are applied to modify nylons polyester paper wool silks and acrylics 183 they are also applied as stabilising agents for ionic liquids used as electrolytes in batteries fuel cells and solar cells 184 185 they may classified into two main branches based on the charge i e as localised or delocalised to the ammonium group 176 3 photocatalytic degradation of dyes 3 1 fundamentals of environmental photocatalysis various environments worldwide are contaminated with various pollutants and several techniques have been introduced to remove these pollutants correspondingly researchers are developing more efficient and low cost catalysts while also seeking new materials to work as catalysts 211 215 new materials are continuously being developed for effective use in various applications 217 241 for example photocatalysis is based on photocatalytic reaction and employs solar energy as a driving force to cause reactions to degrade a myriad of pollutants such as dyes pharmaceuticals and heavy metals 243 273 approximately 45 of the solar energy reaching the earth is visible light fig 4 by controlling the band gap width researchers can develop create new photocatalysts one challenge in producing new photocatalyst materials is that it is difficult to classify them into definite groups based on collected data we identified over 10 main branches of photocatalysts based on the photocatalyst compositions and types collected over trials and covering the full field of oxides sulphides halides nitrides ii vi iii v carbon based materials doped materials elemental metal nanoparticles nps molecular organic frameworks and oxynitrides in addition to hybrid structures used as core shells 275 286 each group may be further classified into several branches e g metal sulphides may be single metallic bi metallic or mof based these may be even further classified into series such as material of institute lavoisier mil university of oslo uio zeolitic imidazolate framework zif isoreticular mofs irmofs and porous coordination networks pcns irmof is an advanced version of mof 5 with a modified structure it has a mesoporous material structure unlike the other mofs microporous structures uio are zirconium based mofs zifs are sieves of silica alumina structures a pore cage channel and cubic octahedral nanopores can be detected in a pcn the mil type materials were discovered and fabricated in 2002 by ferey et al the structure was reported to be a rigid cage with large cage pores 3 2 major mechanisms photocatalysis has received great attention as it allows for the maximum utilisation of sustainable solar energy that is for use in disassociating pollutants into simpler smaller and non toxic components 287 semiconductors in several shapes as mentioned above are the most widely used materials for this process the photocatalytic process includes the degradation of pollutants based on light illumination oxidising agents such as o2 and suitable semiconductors more than one process can occur on the surface of a semiconductor including both oxidation and reduction reactions photocatalysis is a multi step process and includes the formation of various intermediates for a better understanding of the photocatalysis process it is generally divided into several steps 288 290 the first step is the adsorption of the organic pollutant onto the catalyst surface the second is the absorption of a suitable photon with an energy value equal or greater than the band gap energy this absorbed quanta of energy will excite the electron to move from the valence band vb into the conduction band cb leaving a positive hole in the vb third the generated e h pairs migrate to the surface of the catalyst to degrade the pollutant through redox reactions fourth oxidation and reduction reactions occur in both the h2o and o2 molecules on the surface of the catalyst producing hydroxyl oh and superoxide hoo radicals from the vb holes and cb electrons respectively the free radicals degrade the pollutant molecules into simpler and smaller molecules such as co2 and h2o and allow for the desorption of the smaller degraded molecules fig 5 the incident photons can only excite the vb electrons if the incident photon energy is equal to or greater than the energy of the band gap otherwise the energy dissipates in the form of heat 291 the holes can directly participate in the degradation and indirectly oxidise the organic pollutants by reacting with water to produce free radicals oh to oxidise the pollutants the cb electrons reduce the surface catalyst adsorbed oxygen the electron accumulation in the cb is not a desired effect as it increases the recombination of the generated e h pairs 287 292 the below equations describe the general stages of the reaction and formation of radicals until reaching the degraded smaller simpler molecules 289 293 295 specifically eq 1 describes the formation of e h pairs as incident photons with a suitable energy comparable to the band gap energy the semi conductor electrons are excited from the vb into the cb and leave h behind them resulting in the formation of the e h pairs oxidising radicals hydroxyl radicals e h and superoxide radicals are formed as a result of the charge transfer process eqs 2 5 describe the superoxide o2 formation as a result of the integration reaction between the oxygen molecules on the semiconductor surface and electrons the water molecules dissociate into h and oh ions that contribute to the photocatalytic process when the protons react with superoxides o2 forming hydroperoxyl radicals hoo distinguished by their scavenging properties these then react with oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 eqs 6 and 7 describe the formation of oh radicals as occurring through two paths first when the oh from the h2o dissociation reacts with h and second from the dissociation of h2o2 into oh the hydroxyl radicals of the oh oxidise the organic contaminants into co2 h2o and other potentially toxic compounds for further confirmation the intermediate and final compounds of the degraded contamination must be followed through pathways for instance azo dyes are literated and toxic intermediate compounds such as 1 4 benzoquinoneor and 1 2 naphtoquinone are detected as degraded with time into short chain carboxylic acids 296 acid orange 7 benzene derivatives and naphthalene compounds are detected as intermediate compounds and aliphatic acids from the ring cleavage and then are decomposed into co2 to complete the mineralisation process 297 307 1 catalyst hv e cb h vb 2 e o 2 o 2 oxidized product co 2 h 2 o 3 e

oxides as photocatalysts metal oxides have made significant contributions to the fields of chemistry physics and material science owing to their response to changes occurring in both composition and structure and their excellent chemical physical optical and magnetic properties they have received great research interest with the aims of reaching a better understanding and achieving their optimum functionalisation 309 310 they are easily formed and exhibit excellent photoactivity in response to light exposure transition metal oxides are widely applicable in various industries such as in batteries and alloys table 3 311 in particular d block elements are used as catalysts sensors superconducting materials photosensitisers and ceramics 309 312 the photocatalytic properties of metal oxides mainly depend on the light absorption and generation of the e h pairs responsible for the catalytic properties some reports have referred to other generated species with good tendencies in their biological macromolecules such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxides among the studied photocatalysts titanium and zinc oxides have received the most attention owing to their excellent properties 313 photocatalytic enhancement strategies include doping morphology control and defect engineering 282 several metal oxides are used as photocatalysts including copper iron cobalt molybdenum vanadium and tungsten they may be used individually in composites or in heterojunction structures 314 3 4 metal organic frameworks mofs the concept of mofs was first proposed in the 1990s after the synthesis of mof 5 by yaghi et al 329 339 the mof structure is formed by a combination of metal and organic ligands table 4 340 mofs are crystalline and may be 1d 2d or 3d they comprise porous materials owing to their structural flexibility they are capable of loading a wide variety of functional groups or nanoparticles this is the major factor responsible for the presence of the myriad of mof structures and the reason for their use in various applications such as adsorption catalytic reactions and energy generation with the continuous developments in material engineering in science and specifically those in regards to mofs mofs with semiconductor properties can help in creating shorter transport distances for carriers 341 in addition mofs are characterised by the easy separation of the e h pairs owing to the high porosity in addition to the organic linker the metal centre and oxidation state also affect the properties of the final mofs the catalytic advantages of mofs can be optimised by using the most suitable fabrication methods for composites 342 various composite fabrication strategies have been developed such as hydrothermal solvothermal microwave sonication oil bath solution precipitation and template methods in the last few years researchers have attempted to make the best use of mofs as photocatalysts by functionalising them for the degradation of various pollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides and dyes 343 the family of mofs can be classified into several series such as as mentioned above mil uio zif irmof and pcn table 4 the details of these classes are provided above in section 3 1 344 345 3 5 metal sulphides metal sulphides are compounds resulting from the combination of an anion sulphide and cation metal they represent the simplest inorganic form of sulphur and are divided into two main branches single metal sulphides zns bi2s3 and mos2 and bi metallic sulphides cuco2s4 and cdins table 5 in general metal sulphides have unique absorption ranges and are excellent photocatalysts for environmental applications these applications rely on the ability of sulphur to reduce the energy gap width the fabrication of metal sulphides is based on the combination of a sulphur source with a reduced metal semi metal source band gap width owing to the sulphur most metal sulphides show high symmetry stunning physical and chemical properties and simple structures with low hardness and high specific gravity a good understanding of their photocatalytic properties has directed researchers towards heterostructures and morphology manipulations 361 373 bi2s3 nps with low toxicity and high electron counts are among the most promising compounds in this regard furthermore bi2s3 nanostructures have attracted attention owing to their unique morphologies tubular topologies excellent physical properties and high charging capacities however the narrow eg of bi2s3 also accelerates the generation of e h pairs via the recombination of photons resulting in a low separation efficiency for the e h pairs ghoreishian et al 216 synthesised bi2s3 cds s scheme heterostructured photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of cr vi the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly ascribed to the formation of an s scheme heterostructure the electron spin resonance and reactive radical scavenging results implied that o2 was primarily responsible for the removal of the cr vi nevertheless the redox abilities of metal sulphides are often lower than those of the corresponding metal oxides in addition the low stability of metal sulphides during photocatalysis limits their further application 388 396 3 6 halide in 1839 the russian mineralogist lev perovski discovered the first perovskite material 397 398 perovskite materials have received great attention owing to their excellent properties including simple structures and preparations good flexibility high carrier mobility long carrier diffusion lengths strong light absorption and controllable emission wavelengths these have made them widely applicable in solar cells photodetectors light emitting diodes and photocatalysis procedures perovskite material studies have demonstrated their limited magnetic properties electronic transport and structural phase transitions 399 401 in 2009 a japanese team prepared a new metal halide perovskite mhp material for use in photovoltaic cells as mapbbr3 and mapbi3 402 mhps are recognised as semiconductor photocatalysts table 6 they can be used in pollutant degradation co2 reduction photocatalytic hydrogen generation and chemical reactions 398 however the large sizes of mhps often result in a small specific area reduced number of active sites and a long diffusion path for the photogenerated carriers to reach the photocatalyst surface as such several techniques have been introduced for enhancing the efficiency of mhps including the formation of heterostructures component engineering and morphology optimisations 398 the general structure formula of an mhp is abx 3 where a and b are cations a is a monovalent cation which may be inorganic as cs ions or organic as methylamine or formamidine and b represents a divalent metal cation such as ge or pb x is a halide anion such as i cl or br 400 3 7 polymers conjugated porous polymers are promising photocatalysts with porous structures stunning light capture abilities p conjugated skeletons good catalytic performance and reusability table 7 410 411 among these attractive materials covalent organic framework materials are characterised by their crystallinity high porosities high surface areas excellent chemical and thermal stabilities good charge separation factors extensive range of visible light absorption abilities π conjugated structures and π π stacking layers 412 these properties allow them to be used in several applications such as dye degradation co2 reduction photocatalytic h2o splitting and organic transformation 413 the modification of these materials to form new photocatalysts is another promising approach using these materials with graphene boron nitride and sulphur provides an approach to achieving efficient photocatalysis 414 3 8 carbon nitride polymeric materials are strong photocatalysts synthesised from low cost precursors they are widely used for hydrogen evolution water treatments and co2 conversion 424 429 graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is known as melon in which imide groups work as bridges to the heptazine units forming chains that bond with other chains to form a 2d structure these can then be stacked to form a 3d structure 430 431 they are characterised by their oxidative and reductive powers water oxidation high chemical stability and visible light activation 431 3 9 carbon based photocatalysts the base skeleton of carbon based photocatalyst materials is carbon there are various sources of carbon 446 455 carbonaceous materials offer several excellent properties such as good stability a high surface area and enhanced charge carrier propagation 456 biomasses are a rich source of carbon activated carbon carbon nanotubes graphene graphene oxide and graphene quantum dots represent carbonaceous materials of various shapes carbonaceous materials are fertile soils for scientific research and can be used as adsorbent materials or to support excellent surface areas for photocatalysts carbon quantum dots and graphene quantum dots can also be used as fluorescence based quantum dots 457 3 10 oxynitrides in the last few decades research on oxynitride materials has increased because of their excellent properties facilitating their applications as photocatalysts phosphors pigments dielectrics and magnetic materials table 8 471 476 oxynitrides result from the combination of oxide and ammonia gases at 1000 c 139 the resulting structure combines the advantages of both oxides and nitrides and shows several excellent properties such as electrical conductivity corrosion resistivity stability higher than that of individual nitrides and good electronic and optical properties 477 3 11 layered double hydroxide ldh based photocatalysts layered double hydroxide ldh based photocatalysts are widely applicable for the treatment of pollutants the general formula is m1 x 2 m x 3 oh 2 a n x n x mh2o where m2 is a divalent cation such as cu2 zn2 co2 or ni2 and m3 are trivalent cations such as fe3 al3 or ga3 a n is an interlayer charge balancing anion such as cl co3 2 or so4 2 ldhs consisting of two or more divalent or trivalent cations with a positive charge density can be calcinated from the molar ratio of m2 m3 and neutralised with the interlayered anion 308 485 486 the calcination of the ldh at 400 500 converts it into a mixed metal oxide with a high surface area and good dispersion of cations 487 the preparation of different ldhs using various cation combinations results in new materials with new architectural and electronic properties table 9 ldhs have good stability owing to the charge neutrality resulting from the interlayered anion backbones of the ldhs they are considered as doped semiconductors and exhibit good adsorption capacities in addition to demonstrating photocatalytic properties which enhance their use in the degradation of pollutants 308 488 previous reports have indicated that their enhanced photoinduced degradation may be attributed to the pore volume distribution surface area and crystallite size doping and calcination are effective strategies for enhancing the efficiency of ldh samples for instance one study found that 489 the results for ldh doped and calcined samples in regards to the degradation of dyes were better than those for normal samples for example a ce doped zn al ce multi metal oxide showed higher efficiency than undoped samples and calcined samples resulted in higher efficiency than un calcined samples 490 517 4 conclusions this review outlines recent advances in the synthesis of organic dyes several different strategies have been adopted to overcome major process challenges and provide practicable applications regarding photocatalytic materials such as metal oxides mofs metal sulphides halides polymers carbon nitride carbon based photocatalysts oxynitrides and ldh based photocatalysts studies have shown the challenges of using the entire catalyst to degrade organic dyes these compounds cause different challenges in water treatment affecting both amines and humans azo compounds are dependent on their associated auxochromes and chromophores and the azo bond in the entire organic structure thus we attempted to understand the hazardous roles of effluent materials potentially causing mutagenic effects in wastewater treatment and summarised the challenges and prospects for addressing the pollutants such as organic dyes in wastewater in general the high surface to volume ratio of catalysts results from the complex catalytic bed geometry and makes it difficult to irradiate evenly for this purpose novel light sources such as organic catalysts have been successfully tested offering a more flexible and customisable irradiation profile all of the above photocatalysts have been reported as good alternatives for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency as the hybrid photocatalytic ozonation process presents a synergistic effect for the removal of volatile

consumption and high carbon emissions 1 3 due to the existing problems traditional wwtps were re examined 4 5 and the current wwtps have a new development trend of multi functional integration including substrates removal biogas electrogenesis 6 phosphorus resource recovery and water resource regeneration 7 to make municipal wastewater continuously provide organic matter for methanogens carbon capture processes such as micro aerated moving bed biofilm reactors 8 high rate activated sludge processes 9 and anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactors 10 were studied in front of the biological treatment unit and constituted different a b processes however there were challenges in applying bioreactors as the a stage to capture organics such as long term stability and excessive carbon capture consumption 10 coagulation sedimentation is a common method in water treatment which can remove suspended organics and inorganics dissolved phosphate and some heavy metals from wastewater 11 pafc al2 oh ncl6 n m fe2 oh ncl6 n m as an inorganic polymeric coagulant has been widely concerned for its simple operation high efficiency and low cost 12 since pafc is synthesized based on poly ferric and poly aluminum pafc has the advantages of a vigoroso bridging ability and a broad coagulation ph range 13 however few studies reported that pafc flocculated municipal wastewater as an a stage to capture carbon mabr has attracted much attention because of its simple operation 14 high removal efficiency 15 and low operating cost 16 17 the mabr biofilm is a type of counter diffusional biofilm 18 19 it was distinctly different from co diffusion processes such as aerobic granular sludge 20 and conventional biofilm systems 21 compared with co diffusion counter diffusion can remove substrates more efficiently with little membrane clogging 22 in mabr the dissolved oxygen do concentration decreased from the substratum biofilms to the outermost biofilms 15 23 forming aerobic anoxic and aerobic microenvironments 24 which is beneficial for the coexistence of different microorganisms such as aob nob db and anammox bacteria 25 26 in addition mabr with bubble free aeration can achieve higher oxygen utilization rates the aeration energy consumption in mabr can be only 15 0 16 3 of that in traditional wwtps which greatly reduced the aeration cost 17 27 as a cost effective nitrogen removal process the nitritation denitritation process can simplify the traditional biological nitrogen removal process reduce treatment energy consumption and improve nitrogen removal efficiency 28 however because of poor aeration and low strength nh4 n it was not easy for traditional wwtps to achieve no2 n accumulation in the mainstream resulting in the nitritation denitritation process being rarely used 29 in recent studies wang et al achieved partial nitrification in mabr with no2 n accumulation efficiency exceeding 80 using artificial wastewater 30 however the nitritation of actual sewage still needs further study mehrabi et al achieved mainstream no2 n accumulation and reduced the loss of functional microorganisms based on mabr precise aeration and membrane carrier role 31 although the nitritation process could be achieved at a c n ratio of 2 5 in their study the excess organics were not trapped and separated to reduce carbon emission 31 gu et al achieved actual municipal wastewater nitrogen removal in an a b process 32 however attention needed to be paid to the use of a mainstream anaerobic fluidized bed afb reactor as the a stage which can lead to excessive carbon capture 32 xu et al studied an innovative a b process micro aerated moving bed biofilm reactors as a stage and step feed sequencing batch reactors as b stage 8 and 88 of total nitrogen removal can achieve 8 however the relationship between the population and nitrogen metabolism of these microorganisms needs further study this study used a novel a b process to treat actual wastewater which not only effectively reduced carbon emissions but also provided profound insights into nitrogen removal in the study an up flow mabr was constructed to analyze the performance of the nitritation denitritation mabr treating real municipal wastewater after coagulation and separation the shifts in the microbial community were analyzed by 16s rrna sequencing technique the fish technique was also used to analyze the anammox bacteria in the reactor and the microbial nitrogen metabolism process in the mabr was further analyzed based on kegg 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operational strategy a hollow fiber membrane module 150 polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filaments with a length of 1 5 m and a wall thickness of 197 μm and an outer diameter of 770 μm was suspended in an open cylindrical plexiglass container 1000 mm in height 100 mm in diameter 7 0 l effective volume the air compressor pressure gauges mabr module and regulating valves were connected in series fig 1 the raw wastewater in this study was taken from the influent water of the reclaimed water station at nankai university and pafc was added to the raw water 0 3 g pafc l raw water for flocculation after mechanical stirring for 10 min and standing for 45 min the mud and water were separated fig 1 the main parameters of raw water and pretreated wastewater were shown in table 1 the pretreated domestic sewage entered the mabr from the water inlet below and flowed away from the upper overflow fig 1 the influent flow of the reactor was 0 16 l h a magnetic drive pump was used to circulate wastewater to improve mass transfer efficiency the recirculating ratio was about 150 the mabr was fed with simulated wastewater for three weeks and the nutrients were referred to the literature 33 then the mabr further treated the actual wastewater after flocculation in continuous flow mode the mabr was at room temperature the influent ph of the mabr was the ph of the pretreated wastewater table 1 and the effluent ph was 6 90 8 25 in the mabr during the entire operation no sludge was discharged and no organics were added including flocculated sediment the lumen pressure in the mabr membrane filaments was 1 5 kpa the average do 0 26 mg l 0 74 mg l was 0 48 mg l regularly detected indicators included nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn and cod according to the detection methods 34 the ph and do in bulk liquid were also monitored by hach portable equipment 2 2 microbial population structure analyses during the operation biofilms in the mabr were obtained by cutting membrane filaments with sterile scissors on day 44 day 70 day 115 and day 130 the microbial population structures were analyzed based on the 16s rrna sequencing technique the experimental process was performed according to the standard protocol provided by illumina the sample diversity sequencing process included sample preparation rna reverse transcription dna extraction and detection pcr amplification product purification library preparation and detection and miseq computer sequencing the biofilms were selected and amplified using primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 35 36 fish identification was also studied microscope nikon eclipse ci camera nikon ds riscish digital microscopic image analysis system image pro plus the probe was designed using primer 5 software according to kindaichi et al 37 the probe sequence and related information were consistent with the references amx820 5 fam aaaacccctctacttagtgccc 3 for anammox bacteria 38 eub338 5 cy3 ttaccgcggctgctggcac 3 for most other bacteria 37 2 3 calculation methods the nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio ntr was used to verify partial denitrification in the mabr 39 42 the microbial sample with suspended solid ss 1280 mg l was transferred to a brown bottle 250 ml after three washes only sodium nitrate 60 mg no3 n l and sodium acetate 200 mg cod l were added to the brown bottle without aeration nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were continuously detected termly 1 ntr i 1 no 2 n i 1 no 2 n i no 3 n i 1 no 3 n i where no2 ni 1 and no2 ni are no2 n concentrations at test i 1 and test i respectively mg l no3 ni 1 and no3 ni are no3 n concentrations at test i 1 and test i respectively mg l ntr i 1 is the no2 n accumulation rate of the i 1 th detection and i is the number of detections 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the a stage in this study flocculation pretreatment with pafc acted as the a stage and mabr as the b stage further removing nitrogen and carbon in the a stage the nh4 n cod and total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies were shown in table 1 the removal efficiency of nh4 n was 1 67 6 64 cod was 27 37 49 69 and tp was 65 04 100 it s worth noting that there was no excessive consumption of organics in the a stage conversely mainstream bioreactors at an a stage could lead to a severe scarcity of organics unstable operation and low nitrogen removal efficiency for example the mainstream anaerobic fluidized bed acted as the a stage resulting in excess carbon being captured consumed and lower nitrogen removal efficiency 32 in the study when the flocculant was 0 2 g pafc l raw wastewater after flocculation the nh4 n and cod decreased from 60 41 mg l to 55 75 mg l and from 348 mg l to 190 mg l respectively when the flocculant was 0 3 mg pafc l raw wastewater the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the supernatant increased to 8 12 and the removal efficiency of cod increased from 45 40 to 49 71 and the tp removal efficiency exceeded 95 in both cases these indicated that pafc had a significant flocculation effect on organics and tp with nh4 n removal being insignificant pafc was an inorganic polymeric of iron and aluminum after the flocculant was dissolved in the wastewater al3 reacted with po4 3 to form alpo4 and fe3 on the one hand generated insoluble salts with po4 3 on the other hand adsorbed phosphorus through hydrolysis and various polymerization reactions 12 pafc overcomes the shortcomings of slow floc generation light floc and slow settling of aluminum salt and at the same time overcomes the shortcomings of turbidity and high chromaticity of the effluent of iron salt for phosphorus removal 13 during the pretreatment the sludge was flocculated and precipitated and cod was also reduced probably due to the precipitation total dissolved solids tds salinity and conductivity increased table 1 which may be due to some iron and aluminum salts still remaining in the wastewater moreover the maximum removal efficiency of tp could reach 100 in the a stage which greatly reduced the tp load in the b stage flocculation dosage can be appropriately adjusted according to the influent tp concentration so that a small amount of phosphorus source could enter the b stage to satisfy microbial growth needs 13 14 mehrabi et al found that low c n was conducive to the inhibition of nob and the no2 n accumulation 31 the use of pafc as a flocculant in the a stage may also reduce the inhibition of autotrophic bacteria including anammox bacteria by organics in mainstream wastewater 26 so flocculation as a stage can optimize c n reduce carbon emission in the wastewater treatment process and promote the domestication and enrichment of functional microorganisms 3 2 performance of the b stage the wastewater was pretreated by flocculation and then treated by the mabr without any extra organics the nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn and cod concentrations in the mabr b stage were shown in fig 2 when the mabr treated the actual wastewater in continuous flow mode class a dotted line is the most demanding indicator in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants gb18918 2002 in china nh4 n 5 mg l tn 15 mg l cod 50 mg l from day 1 to day 18 the do was 0 44 0 74 mg l and the influent nh4 n concentration fluctuated between 25 70 mg l and 33 70 mg l meanwhile the nh4 n concentration decreased continuously and the cod concentration also had a decreasing trend in the effluent fig 2 it was also found that the effluent cod reached the class a standard on the 6th day after the mabr treatment fig 2 there were two main reasons why the effluent cod reached the standard so quickly one was that the wastewater treated by the mabr was the supernatant of raw water after coagulation and precipitation with pafc and 27 37 49 69 cod had been removed in the a stage table 1 another reason was that biofilms grew and reproduced on the mabr membrane filaments using the organics 25 this also indicated that flocculation as stage a can effectively capture part organics and then the residual organics can meet the needs of the mabr biochemical process it also effectively avoided excessive carbon capture or consumption in stage a compared to a biochemical reactor as stage a 8 10 the influent nh4 n concentration fluctuated between 20 mg l and 31 mg l from day 20 to day 60 the average concentration of nh4 n and cod in the influent was 24 88 mg l and 68 8 mg l respectively the c n was as low as 2 sometimes the concentration of nh4 n tn and cod in the effluent can still reach the class a standard gb 18918 2002 during the stage fig 2 although studies have shown that nitrogen removal is more difficult when the c n ratio is below 3 28 this may be related to the process used in this study to reduce carbon emissions some works also treated the actual wastewater and achieved the class a standard but they did not save carbon sources 6 41 instead some external organics were added to their reactor 39 in this study the raw water was pretreated by coagulation and 52 mg cod l 117 mg cod l organics can be transferred to the flocculated sludge table 1 the supernatant was then treated in the nitritation denitritation mabr without adding any extra organic carbon including the coagulated sediment to further analyze the utilization of organic carbon in different nitrogen transforming pathways eqs 2 7 in this study sodium acetate was regarded as the organic carbon source nitritation nh4 no2 nitratation no2 no3 denitratation no3 no2 denitritation no2 n2 and anammox nh4 no2 n2 can occur according to the microbial population structure see section 3 3 in the mabr 29 43 44 eq 5 can be calculated from eq 3 and eq 4 2 nh 4 1 238 o 2 0 04 hco 3 0 161 co 2 0 96 no 2 0 04 c

concentration of nh4 n in the influent was 50 50 mg l and cod was 147 30 mg l the nh4 n tn and cod in the effluent were stable and met class a standards there may be four main reasons why the study was able to meet the national discharge standard with a c n ratio of 3 without any additional organic matter first the microbial secretions and dead microorganisms on the mabr filaments may be used as carbon sources by other active microorganisms thereby achieving sludge reduction 57 next nitritation and denitritation eq 2 and eq 6 may have more contributions in the reactor because the relative abundances of aob and db in the reactor were higher than that of nob and anammox bacteria showed in section 3 3 42 so the no2 n produced from partial nitrification can be removed by denitritation with fewer carbon sources compared with denitrification eq 7 furthermore anammox bacteria were also detected table 2 which were often in the outer layer anaerobic layer of mabr biofilms utilizing the no2 n and the nh4 n without organics 26 in addition denitratation eq 4 can also occur because there were no3 n and denitrifiers in the reactor which can produce no2 n and promote the survival of anammox bacteria 39 achieving no2 n accumulation was a critical step for building the nitritation denitritation mabr in this study nearly half of the organics in the mainstream were separated by flocculation which reduced the c n ratio 2 2 3 5 average 3 0 studies had shown that low c n could reduce the relative abundance of nob and promote the accumulation of nitrite 31 on the basis of reducing the c n ratio controlling the do of the reactor by optimizing the lumen aeration pressure was also the inducement to achieve nitrite accumulation 16 45 different pressures led to do in substratum biofilms being different where occurred partial nitrification 46 studies had shown that low do was beneficial to nob inhibition 47 augusto et al achieved nitrite accumulation with the do in wastewater 0 42 mg l 0 53 mg l 33 in the study the lumen pressure was 1 5 kpa and the average do was 0 48 mg l the no2 n can be produced with a maximum concentration of 22 mg l in the mabr when the influent nh4 n was 42 4 mg l for low intensity wastewater the mabr was not suitable for high pressure because when the pressure was increased the thickness of the biofilms would increase which was not beneficial to mass transfer and total nitrogen removal 22 in this study a small number of flocs appeared in the middle and late stages of reactor operation but the flocs did not seriously affect the reactor performance fig 2 this may be because some of the flocs overflow with the water flow and the some may attach to mabr biofilm again under the action of the circulating pump in the study the novel a b process not only reached the class a standard but also showed good stress resistance in the face of sudden nitrogen load increase for instance from the 100th day to the 133rd day the effluent nh4 n tn and cod concentrations reached class a standard stably in the 34 days except for the 116th and 118th days fig 2a on the 114 118th day the influent nh4 n concentration suddenly increased from 47 90 mg l to 64 40 mg l but the effluent concentration of nh4 n 4 8 mg l tn 10 28 mg l and cod 11 mg l barely reached the standard of class a on the 114th day when the c n ratio was 3 the effluent nh4 n concentration and tn concentration can also return to class a standard after the load shock fig 2 and in the mabr the removal efficiency of nh4 n tn and cod can reach 100 84 04 and 98 54 respectively when the c n ratio was 3 yuan also studied the nitrogen removal performance in a nitritation denitritation process at a c n ratio of 3 and found that nh4 n and tn could reach 96 3 and 81 4 respectively 40 which was slightly less than the removal effect in this study this may be related to the different application scenarios of the nitritation denitritation process yuan treated actual wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor sbr and this study was applied in an mabr counter diffusion and stratified multifunctional biofilms may also enhance the high efficiency nitrogen removal from wastewater in the mabr 41 3 3 partial denitrification in the mabr in this study the accumulation of no2 n was crucial to nitritation denitritation mabr the no2 n may come from partial nitrification and or partial denitrification 20 21 because the relative abundance of aob was greater than that of nob partial nitrification existed in this study table 2 to prove whether partial denitrification also occurred in the mabr a batch experiment was carried out see section 2 3 for operating conditions no2 ni 1 no2 ni and no3 ni 1 no3 ni are abbreviated as nox n the ratio of no2 n to no3 n as the ntr can reflect partial denitrification 42 in the experiment fig 3 the initial concentrations of no3 n and cod were 63 8 mg l and 223 mg l respectively the increase of no2 n was not obvious in the first 2 h but at 2 0 3 5 h no2 n increased rapidly from 0 64 mg l to 3 14 mg l at this time no3 n was reduced to 59 70 mg l from 62 50 mg l that was to say 2 80 mg l no3 n can be converted into 2 50 mg l no2 n and the ntr was 89 32 the highest ntr was 90 54 at 3 5 4 5 h the net increase of no2 n was 3 35 mg l from 3 70 mg l no3 n fig 3 these data showed that partial denitrification can be achieved in the mabr which was beneficial to diminish the competition of nob and anammox bacteria for no2 n 25 33 after 17 5 h the concentration of no2 n no3 n and cod in the brown bottle was 15 30 mg l 33 90 mg l and 123 mg l respectively the nitrogen loss was 14 6 mg l during this test and nh4 n was not detected in the effluent which meant that the nitrogen loss was not due to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia 48 xie also achieved partial denitrification in batch tests when the c n ratio was 3 4 the maximum no2 n accumulation concentration was 34 70 mg l within 30 min 49 in this study no2 n accumulation was slower which may be related to the test sample concentration 1280 mg ss l vss of activated sludge in xie s study was 1800 mg l 3 4 microbial diversity analysis the biofilms in the mabr can be composed of abundant microorganisms to analyze the population structure and variation samples were taken from the mabr for 16s rrna sequencing on the 44th 70th 115th and 130th days respectively corresponding to a1 a4 the dominant microorganisms in the reactor were ferruginibacter 14 09 16 22 olb17 7 81 8 90 and phos he36 5 17 7 76 fig 4 ferruginibacter belongs to family chitinophagaceae fig 5 and was also found in an enhancing anoxic denitrification process at a low c n ratio 50 olb17 was often detected in complex wastewater 51 in the mabr five functional microorganisms table 2 related to nitrogen removal were detected aob nitrosomonas nob nitrospira db thauera denitratesoma and anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia it was found that the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and thauera was in the top 10 and both of them were higher than that of nitrospira and candidatus kuenenia table 2 which indicated that the operation mode of the reactor was conducive to inhibiting nob under low do conditions the activity of nob can be susceptible to inhibition and nitrosomonas can play an important role in nitrite accumulation in mabr 52 denitratisoma and thauera as denitrifiers can contribute to partial denitrification 25 53 denitratisoma is a typical anaerobic denitrifier and thauera is a facultative anaerobic denitrifier 54 thauera can survive in both anaerobic and aerobic environments which may be why thauera had a higher relative abundance than denitratesoma in the mabr it also showed that thauera had better adaptability to the mabr treating the real wastewater with a low c n ratio after 130 days of operation it was found that candidatus kuenenia 0 04 still existed in the mabr even though the wastewater was real wastewater with low intensity nh4 n in the study the low organics concentration and high nitrite accumulation rate may facilitate the survival of anammox bacteria 25 moreover 4 6 diamino 2 phenylindole c16h15n5 2c3h6o3 as a fluorescent dye can penetrate cell membranes bind to dna label cells and appear blue under fluorescence microscopy fig 6 functional gene nucleic acid sequence in samples could be hybridized with a specific nucleic acid probe according to the principle of base complementary pairing to determine the species of microorganism 37 to determine the presence and niche of anammox bacteria in this reactor microbial samples on day 130 were examined using the amx820 gene probe by fish 38 the anammox bacteria were shown in green fig 6 and closely bound to other microorganisms their ecological niches may be closely related to the nitritation and denitratation in the mabr 38 43 3 5 kegg analysis microbial metabolic pathway information can be analyzed from the molecular level according to kegg which is conducive to deeper understandings and applications of microbial metabolic systems 55 there are seven primary classifications in kegg namely metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing cellular processes biological systems human diseases and drug development 56 the metabolic processes relevant to the study were the first four through level 1 metabolic pathway analysis it was found that metabolism genetic information processing and environmental information processing were dominant in the microorganisms in this study the relative abundance 51 1 09 to 51 42 of metabolism was much higher than that of other metabolic processes this may be because the microbes need indispensable energy through metabolism 56 the kegg level 1 metabolic pathway is subdivided into level 2 metabolic pathways such as metabolism level 1 metabolic pathway with 12 level 2 metabolic processes one of the level 2 metabolic processes in metabolism is energy metabolism which is subdivided into oxidative phosphorylation oxidative phosphorylation photosynthesis antenna proteins photosynthesis antenna proteins carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes photosynthesis antenna proteins carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen metabolism in this study energy metabolism mainly included carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes nitrogen metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation their relative abundances were shown in table 3 the relative abundance of nitrogen metabolism was 0 79 to 0 80 based on the level 3 metabolic pathway analysis further since the relative abundances of aob and db were greater than that of nob the main nitrogen removal process of the mabr was nitritation denitritation it also indicated that the nh4 n was converted mainly to hydroxylamine and then to no2 n under the action of hao 57 the no2 n was converted to no by nirk nirs to n2o by norb norc and finally to n2 by nosz 58 small amounts of no2 n and residual nh4 n were directly converted to n2 because of the presence of anammox bacteria in this study 4 conclusions the study investigated for the first time the use of nitritation denitritation mabr to treat the municipal wastewater after pre treatment with pafc in the pretreatment process the cod can be removed by 27 37 49 69 after coagulation with pafc in the nitritation denitritation mabr the removal efficiency of nh4 n tn and cod can reach 100 84 04 and 98 54 respectively and meet the class a standard gb18918 2002 without extra organics by adjusting the c n ratio to 3 in the pretreatment process it may be beneficial to maximize both carbon capture and nitrogen removal in the a b process the control of lumen aeration pressure is the key to building nitritation denitritation mabr which also has a serious effect the total nitrogen removal the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and thauera can be higher than that of nitrospira by controlling the lumen pressure 2 5 kpa in the mabr the nitrite produced from partial nitrification and partial denitrification may facilitate the culture of anammox bacteria credit authorship contribution statement ming li investigation writing original

12588,to reduce the carbon emission of sewage treatment a novel adsorption biodegradation a b process flocculation pretreatment as a stage and nitritation denitritation mabr as b stage was proposed in the study it was found that 27 37 49 69 of organics can be removed from actual wastewater by flocculation with polyaluminium ferric chloride pafc the pretreated wastewater could be further treated by nitritation denitritation mabr with low aeration pressure 2 5 kpa without any extra organics the nh4 n total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency can reach 100 84 04 and 98 54 respectively it was also found that the relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 3 81 4 76 and denitrifying bacteria db 4 30 5 59 were higher than that of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 2 08 2 39 in the mabr even after 130 days of operation according to the microorganism identification by 16s rrna sequencing technology this implied that low oxygen aeration in mabr can prevent nob from becoming dominant bacteria furthermore it was found that there were indeed traces of anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bacteria 0 04 0 08 and were closely surrounded by other microorganisms in the mabr based on fluorescence in situ hybridization fish technology in addition the microbial nitrogen metabolism process in the mabr was further analyzed according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and

be made available on request 1 introduction the traditional activated sludge process such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o is widely applied in wwtps however it has the problems of high energy consumption and high carbon emissions 1 3 due to the existing problems traditional wwtps were re examined 4 5 and the current wwtps have a new development trend of multi functional integration including substrates removal biogas electrogenesis 6 phosphorus resource recovery and water resource regeneration 7 to make municipal wastewater continuously provide organic matter for methanogens carbon capture processes such as micro aerated moving bed biofilm reactors 8 high rate activated sludge processes 9 and anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactors 10 were studied in front of the biological treatment unit and constituted different a b processes however there were challenges in applying bioreactors as the a stage to capture organics such as long term stability and excessive carbon capture consumption 10 coagulation sedimentation is a common method in water treatment which can remove suspended organics and inorganics dissolved phosphate and some heavy metals from wastewater 11 pafc al2 oh ncl6 n m fe2 oh ncl6 n m as an inorganic polymeric coagulant has been widely concerned for its simple operation high efficiency and low cost 12 since pafc is synthesized based on poly ferric and poly aluminum pafc has the advantages of a vigoroso bridging ability and a broad coagulation ph range 13 however few studies reported that pafc flocculated municipal wastewater as an a stage to capture carbon mabr has attracted much attention because of its simple operation 14 high removal efficiency 15 and low operating cost 16 17 the mabr biofilm is a type of counter diffusional biofilm 18 19 it was distinctly different from co diffusion processes such as aerobic granular sludge 20 and conventional biofilm systems 21 compared with co diffusion counter diffusion can remove substrates more efficiently with little membrane clogging 22 in mabr the dissolved oxygen do concentration decreased from the substratum biofilms to the outermost biofilms 15 23 forming aerobic anoxic and aerobic microenvironments 24 which is beneficial for the coexistence of different microorganisms such as aob nob db and anammox bacteria 25 26 in addition mabr with bubble free aeration can achieve higher oxygen utilization rates the aeration energy consumption in mabr can be only 15 0 16 3 of that in traditional wwtps which greatly reduced the aeration cost 17 27 as a cost effective nitrogen removal process the nitritation denitritation process can simplify the traditional biological nitrogen removal process reduce treatment energy consumption and improve nitrogen removal efficiency 28 however because of poor aeration and low strength nh4 n it was not easy for traditional wwtps to achieve no2 n accumulation in the mainstream resulting in the nitritation denitritation process being rarely used 29 in recent studies wang et al achieved partial nitrification in mabr with no2 n accumulation efficiency exceeding 80 using artificial wastewater 30 however the nitritation of actual sewage still needs further study mehrabi et al achieved mainstream no2 n accumulation and reduced the loss of functional microorganisms based on mabr precise aeration and membrane carrier role 31 although the nitritation process could be achieved at a c n ratio of 2 5 in their study the excess organics were not trapped and separated to reduce carbon emission 31 gu et al achieved actual municipal wastewater nitrogen removal in an a b process 32 however attention needed to be paid to the use of a mainstream anaerobic fluidized bed afb reactor as the a stage which can lead to excessive carbon capture 32 xu et al studied an innovative a b process micro aerated moving bed biofilm reactors as a stage and step feed sequencing batch reactors as b stage 8 and 88 of total nitrogen removal can achieve 8 however the relationship between the population and nitrogen metabolism of these microorganisms needs further study this study used a novel a b process to treat actual wastewater which not only effectively reduced carbon emissions but also provided profound insights into nitrogen removal in the study an up flow mabr was constructed to analyze the performance of the nitritation denitritation mabr treating real municipal wastewater after coagulation and separation the shifts in the microbial community were analyzed by 16s rrna sequencing technique the fish technique was also used to analyze the anammox bacteria in the reactor and the microbial nitrogen metabolism process in the mabr was further analyzed based on kegg 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operational strategy a hollow fiber membrane module 150 polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filaments with a length of 1 5 m and a wall thickness of 197 μm and an outer diameter of 770 μm was suspended in an open cylindrical plexiglass container 1000 mm in height 100 mm in diameter 7 0 l effective volume the air compressor pressure gauges mabr module and regulating valves were connected in series fig 1 the raw wastewater in this study was taken from the influent water of the reclaimed water station at nankai university and pafc was added to the raw water 0 3 g pafc l raw water for flocculation after mechanical stirring for 10 min and standing for 45 min the mud and water were separated fig 1 the main parameters of raw water and pretreated wastewater were shown in table 1 the pretreated domestic sewage entered the mabr from the water inlet below and flowed away from the upper overflow fig 1 the influent flow of the reactor was 0 16 l h a magnetic drive pump was used to circulate wastewater to improve mass transfer efficiency the recirculating ratio was about 150 the mabr was fed with simulated wastewater for three weeks and the nutrients were referred to the literature 33 then the mabr further treated the actual wastewater after flocculation in continuous flow mode the mabr was at room temperature the influent ph of the mabr was the ph of the pretreated wastewater table 1 and the effluent ph was 6 90 8 25 in the mabr during the entire operation no sludge was discharged and no organics were added including flocculated sediment the lumen pressure in the mabr membrane filaments was 1 5 kpa the average do 0 26 mg l 0 74 mg l was 0 48 mg l regularly detected indicators included nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn and cod according to the detection methods 34 the ph and do in bulk liquid were also monitored by hach portable equipment 2 2 microbial population structure analyses during the operation biofilms in the mabr were obtained by cutting membrane filaments with sterile scissors on day 44 day 70 day 115 and day 130 the microbial population structures were analyzed based on the 16s rrna sequencing technique the experimental process was performed according to the standard protocol provided by illumina the sample diversity sequencing process included sample preparation rna reverse transcription dna extraction and detection pcr amplification product purification library preparation and detection and miseq computer sequencing the biofilms were selected and amplified using primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 35 36 fish identification was also studied microscope nikon eclipse ci camera nikon ds riscish digital microscopic image analysis system image pro plus the probe was designed using primer 5 software according to kindaichi et al 37 the probe sequence and related information were consistent with the references amx820 5 fam aaaacccctctacttagtgccc 3 for anammox bacteria 38 eub338 5 cy3 ttaccgcggctgctggcac 3 for most other bacteria 37 2 3 calculation methods the nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio ntr was used to verify partial denitrification in the mabr 39 42 the microbial sample with suspended solid ss 1280 mg l was transferred to a brown bottle 250 ml after three washes only sodium nitrate 60 mg no3 n l and sodium acetate 200 mg cod l were added to the brown bottle without aeration nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were continuously detected termly 1 ntr i 1 no 2 n i 1 no 2 n i no 3 n i 1 no 3 n i where no2 ni 1 and no2 ni are no2 n concentrations at test i 1 and test i respectively mg l no3 ni 1 and no3 ni are no3 n concentrations at test i 1 and test i respectively mg l ntr i 1 is the no2 n accumulation rate of the i 1 th detection and i is the number of detections 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the a stage in this study flocculation pretreatment with pafc acted as the a stage and mabr as the b stage further removing nitrogen and carbon in the a stage the nh4 n cod and total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies were shown in table 1 the removal efficiency of nh4 n was 1 67 6 64 cod was 27 37 49 69 and tp was 65 04 100 it s worth noting that there was no excessive consumption of organics in the a stage conversely mainstream bioreactors at an a stage could lead to a severe scarcity of organics unstable operation and low nitrogen removal efficiency for example the mainstream anaerobic fluidized bed acted as the a stage resulting in excess carbon being captured consumed and lower nitrogen removal efficiency 32 in the study when the flocculant was 0 2 g pafc l raw wastewater after flocculation the nh4 n and cod decreased from 60 41 mg l to 55 75 mg l and from 348 mg l to 190 mg l respectively when the flocculant was 0 3 mg pafc l raw wastewater the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the supernatant increased to 8 12 and the removal efficiency of cod increased from 45 40 to 49 71 and the tp removal efficiency exceeded 95 in both cases these indicated that pafc had a significant flocculation effect on organics and tp with nh4 n removal being insignificant pafc was an inorganic polymeric of iron and aluminum after the flocculant was dissolved in the wastewater al3 reacted with po4 3 to form alpo4 and fe3 on the one hand generated insoluble salts with po4 3 on the other hand adsorbed phosphorus through hydrolysis and various polymerization reactions 12 pafc overcomes the shortcomings of slow floc generation light floc and slow settling of aluminum salt and at the same time overcomes the shortcomings of turbidity and high chromaticity of the effluent of iron salt for phosphorus removal 13 during the pretreatment the sludge was flocculated and precipitated and cod was also reduced probably due to the precipitation total dissolved solids tds salinity and conductivity increased table 1 which may be due to some iron and aluminum salts still remaining in the wastewater moreover the maximum removal efficiency of tp could reach 100 in the a stage which greatly reduced the tp load in the b stage flocculation dosage can be appropriately adjusted according to the influent tp concentration so that a small amount of phosphorus source could enter the b stage to satisfy microbial growth needs 13 14 mehrabi et al found that low c n was conducive to the inhibition of nob and the no2 n accumulation 31 the use of pafc as a flocculant in the a stage may also reduce the inhibition of autotrophic bacteria including anammox bacteria by organics in mainstream wastewater 26 so flocculation as a stage can optimize c n reduce carbon emission in the wastewater treatment process and promote the domestication and enrichment of functional microorganisms 3 2 performance of the b stage the wastewater was pretreated by flocculation and then treated by the mabr without any extra organics the nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn and cod concentrations in the mabr b stage were shown in fig 2 when the mabr treated the actual wastewater in continuous flow mode class a dotted line is the most demanding indicator in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants gb18918 2002 in china nh4 n 5 mg l tn 15 mg l cod 50 mg l from day 1 to day 18 the do was 0 44 0 74 mg l and the influent nh4 n concentration fluctuated between 25 70 mg l and 33 70 mg l meanwhile the nh4 n concentration decreased continuously and the cod concentration also had a decreasing trend in the effluent fig 2 it was also found that the effluent cod reached the class a standard on the 6th day after the mabr treatment fig 2 there were two main reasons why the effluent cod reached the standard so quickly one was that the wastewater treated by the mabr was the supernatant of raw water after coagulation and precipitation with pafc and 27 37 49 69 cod had been removed in the a stage table 1 another reason was that biofilms grew and reproduced on the mabr membrane filaments using the organics 25 this also indicated that flocculation as stage a can effectively capture part organics and then the residual organics can meet the needs of the mabr biochemical process it also effectively avoided excessive carbon capture or consumption in stage a compared to a biochemical reactor as stage a 8 10 the influent nh4 n concentration fluctuated between 20 mg l and 31 mg l from day 20 to day 60 the average concentration of nh4 n and cod in the influent was 24 88 mg l and 68 8 mg l respectively the c n was as low as 2 sometimes the concentration of nh4 n tn and cod in the effluent can still reach the class a standard gb 18918 2002 during the stage fig 2 although studies have shown that nitrogen removal is more difficult when the c n ratio is below 3 28 this may be related to the process used in this study to reduce carbon emissions some works also treated the actual wastewater and achieved the class a standard but they did not save carbon sources 6 41 instead some external organics were added to their reactor 39 in this study the raw water was pretreated by coagulation and 52 mg cod l 117 mg cod l organics can be transferred to the flocculated sludge table 1 the supernatant was then treated in the nitritation denitritation mabr without adding any extra organic carbon including the coagulated sediment to further analyze the utilization of organic carbon in different nitrogen transforming pathways eqs 2 7 in this study sodium acetate was regarded as the organic carbon source nitritation nh4 no2 nitratation no2 no3 denitratation no3 no2 denitritation no2 n2 and anammox nh4 no2 n2 can occur according to the microbial population structure see section 3 3 in the mabr 29 43 44 eq 5 can be calculated from eq 3 and eq 4 2 nh 4 1 238 o 2 0 04 hco 3 0 161 co 2 0 96 no 2 0 04 c

concentration of nh4 n in the influent was 50 50 mg l and cod was 147 30 mg l the nh4 n tn and cod in the effluent were stable and met class a standards there may be four main reasons why the study was able to meet the national discharge standard with a c n ratio of 3 without any additional organic matter first the microbial secretions and dead microorganisms on the mabr filaments may be used as carbon sources by other active microorganisms thereby achieving sludge reduction 57 next nitritation and denitritation eq 2 and eq 6 may have more contributions in the reactor because the relative abundances of aob and db in the reactor were higher than that of nob and anammox bacteria showed in section 3 3 42 so the no2 n produced from partial nitrification can be removed by denitritation with fewer carbon sources compared with denitrification eq 7 furthermore anammox bacteria were also detected table 2 which were often in the outer layer anaerobic layer of mabr biofilms utilizing the no2 n and the nh4 n without organics 26 in addition denitratation eq 4 can also occur because there were no3 n and denitrifiers in the reactor which can produce no2 n and promote the survival of anammox bacteria 39 achieving no2 n accumulation was a critical step for building the nitritation denitritation mabr in this study nearly half of the organics in the mainstream were separated by flocculation which reduced the c n ratio 2 2 3 5 average 3 0 studies had shown that low c n could reduce the relative abundance of nob and promote the accumulation of nitrite 31 on the basis of reducing the c n ratio controlling the do of the reactor by optimizing the lumen aeration pressure was also the inducement to achieve nitrite accumulation 16 45 different pressures led to do in substratum biofilms being different where occurred partial nitrification 46 studies had shown that low do was beneficial to nob inhibition 47 augusto et al achieved nitrite accumulation with the do in wastewater 0 42 mg l 0 53 mg l 33 in the study the lumen pressure was 1 5 kpa and the average do was 0 48 mg l the no2 n can be produced with a maximum concentration of 22 mg l in the mabr when the influent nh4 n was 42 4 mg l for low intensity wastewater the mabr was not suitable for high pressure because when the pressure was increased the thickness of the biofilms would increase which was not beneficial to mass transfer and total nitrogen removal 22 in this study a small number of flocs appeared in the middle and late stages of reactor operation but the flocs did not seriously affect the reactor performance fig 2 this may be because some of the flocs overflow with the water flow and the some may attach to mabr biofilm again under the action of the circulating pump in the study the novel a b process not only reached the class a standard but also showed good stress resistance in the face of sudden nitrogen load increase for instance from the 100th day to the 133rd day the effluent nh4 n tn and cod concentrations reached class a standard stably in the 34 days except for the 116th and 118th days fig 2a on the 114 118th day the influent nh4 n concentration suddenly increased from 47 90 mg l to 64 40 mg l but the effluent concentration of nh4 n 4 8 mg l tn 10 28 mg l and cod 11 mg l barely reached the standard of class a on the 114th day when the c n ratio was 3 the effluent nh4 n concentration and tn concentration can also return to class a standard after the load shock fig 2 and in the mabr the removal efficiency of nh4 n tn and cod can reach 100 84 04 and 98 54 respectively when the c n ratio was 3 yuan also studied the nitrogen removal performance in a nitritation denitritation process at a c n ratio of 3 and found that nh4 n and tn could reach 96 3 and 81 4 respectively 40 which was slightly less than the removal effect in this study this may be related to the different application scenarios of the nitritation denitritation process yuan treated actual wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor sbr and this study was applied in an mabr counter diffusion and stratified multifunctional biofilms may also enhance the high efficiency nitrogen removal from wastewater in the mabr 41 3 3 partial denitrification in the mabr in this study the accumulation of no2 n was crucial to nitritation denitritation mabr the no2 n may come from partial nitrification and or partial denitrification 20 21 because the relative abundance of aob was greater than that of nob partial nitrification existed in this study table 2 to prove whether partial denitrification also occurred in the mabr a batch experiment was carried out see section 2 3 for operating conditions no2 ni 1 no2 ni and no3 ni 1 no3 ni are abbreviated as nox n the ratio of no2 n to no3 n as the ntr can reflect partial denitrification 42 in the experiment fig 3 the initial concentrations of no3 n and cod were 63 8 mg l and 223 mg l respectively the increase of no2 n was not obvious in the first 2 h but at 2 0 3 5 h no2 n increased rapidly from 0 64 mg l to 3 14 mg l at this time no3 n was reduced to 59 70 mg l from 62 50 mg l that was to say 2 80 mg l no3 n can be converted into 2 50 mg l no2 n and the ntr was 89 32 the highest ntr was 90 54 at 3 5 4 5 h the net increase of no2 n was 3 35 mg l from 3 70 mg l no3 n fig 3 these data showed that partial denitrification can be achieved in the mabr which was beneficial to diminish the competition of nob and anammox bacteria for no2 n 25 33 after 17 5 h the concentration of no2 n no3 n and cod in the brown bottle was 15 30 mg l 33 90 mg l and 123 mg l respectively the nitrogen loss was 14 6 mg l during this test and nh4 n was not detected in the effluent which meant that the nitrogen loss was not due to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia 48 xie also achieved partial denitrification in batch tests when the c n ratio was 3 4 the maximum no2 n accumulation concentration was 34 70 mg l within 30 min 49 in this study no2 n accumulation was slower which may be related to the test sample concentration 1280 mg ss l vss of activated sludge in xie s study was 1800 mg l 3 4 microbial diversity analysis the biofilms in the mabr can be composed of abundant microorganisms to analyze the population structure and variation samples were taken from the mabr for 16s rrna sequencing on the 44th 70th 115th and 130th days respectively corresponding to a1 a4 the dominant microorganisms in the reactor were ferruginibacter 14 09 16 22 olb17 7 81 8 90 and phos he36 5 17 7 76 fig 4 ferruginibacter belongs to family chitinophagaceae fig 5 and was also found in an enhancing anoxic denitrification process at a low c n ratio 50 olb17 was often detected in complex wastewater 51 in the mabr five functional microorganisms table 2 related to nitrogen removal were detected aob nitrosomonas nob nitrospira db thauera denitratesoma and anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia it was found that the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and thauera was in the top 10 and both of them were higher than that of nitrospira and candidatus kuenenia table 2 which indicated that the operation mode of the reactor was conducive to inhibiting nob under low do conditions the activity of nob can be susceptible to inhibition and nitrosomonas can play an important role in nitrite accumulation in mabr 52 denitratisoma and thauera as denitrifiers can contribute to partial denitrification 25 53 denitratisoma is a typical anaerobic denitrifier and thauera is a facultative anaerobic denitrifier 54 thauera can survive in both anaerobic and aerobic environments which may be why thauera had a higher relative abundance than denitratesoma in the mabr it also showed that thauera had better adaptability to the mabr treating the real wastewater with a low c n ratio after 130 days of operation it was found that candidatus kuenenia 0 04 still existed in the mabr even though the wastewater was real wastewater with low intensity nh4 n in the study the low organics concentration and high nitrite accumulation rate may facilitate the survival of anammox bacteria 25 moreover 4 6 diamino 2 phenylindole c16h15n5 2c3h6o3 as a fluorescent dye can penetrate cell membranes bind to dna label cells and appear blue under fluorescence microscopy fig 6 functional gene nucleic acid sequence in samples could be hybridized with a specific nucleic acid probe according to the principle of base complementary pairing to determine the species of microorganism 37 to determine the presence and niche of anammox bacteria in this reactor microbial samples on day 130 were examined using the amx820 gene probe by fish 38 the anammox bacteria were shown in green fig 6 and closely bound to other microorganisms their ecological niches may be closely related to the nitritation and denitratation in the mabr 38 43 3 5 kegg analysis microbial metabolic pathway information can be analyzed from the molecular level according to kegg which is conducive to deeper understandings and applications of microbial metabolic systems 55 there are seven primary classifications in kegg namely metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing cellular processes biological systems human diseases and drug development 56 the metabolic processes relevant to the study were the first four through level 1 metabolic pathway analysis it was found that metabolism genetic information processing and environmental information processing were dominant in the microorganisms in this study the relative abundance 51 1 09 to 51 42 of metabolism was much higher than that of other metabolic processes this may be because the microbes need indispensable energy through metabolism 56 the kegg level 1 metabolic pathway is subdivided into level 2 metabolic pathways such as metabolism level 1 metabolic pathway with 12 level 2 metabolic processes one of the level 2 metabolic processes in metabolism is energy metabolism which is subdivided into oxidative phosphorylation oxidative phosphorylation photosynthesis antenna proteins photosynthesis antenna proteins carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes photosynthesis antenna proteins carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen metabolism in this study energy metabolism mainly included carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes nitrogen metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation their relative abundances were shown in table 3 the relative abundance of nitrogen metabolism was 0 79 to 0 80 based on the level 3 metabolic pathway analysis further since the relative abundances of aob and db were greater than that of nob the main nitrogen removal process of the mabr was nitritation denitritation it also indicated that the nh4 n was converted mainly to hydroxylamine and then to no2 n under the action of hao 57 the no2 n was converted to no by nirk nirs to n2o by norb norc and finally to n2 by nosz 58 small amounts of no2 n and residual nh4 n were directly converted to n2 because of the presence of anammox bacteria in this study 4 conclusions the study investigated for the first time the use of nitritation denitritation mabr to treat the municipal wastewater after pre treatment with pafc in the pretreatment process the cod can be removed by 27 37 49 69 after coagulation with pafc in the nitritation denitritation mabr the removal efficiency of nh4 n tn and cod can reach 100 84 04 and 98 54 respectively and meet the class a standard gb18918 2002 without extra organics by adjusting the c n ratio to 3 in the pretreatment process it may be beneficial to maximize both carbon capture and nitrogen removal in the a b process the control of lumen aeration pressure is the key to building nitritation denitritation mabr which also has a serious effect the total nitrogen removal the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and thauera can be higher than that of nitrospira by controlling the lumen pressure 2 5 kpa in the mabr the nitrite produced from partial nitrification and partial denitrification may facilitate the culture of anammox bacteria credit authorship contribution statement ming li investigation writing original

12589,a one year long study was conducted in the cold northern chinese region to investigate the seasonal temperature variation on the pollutant removal performance and the changes in microbial communities and functional gene abundance of a pilot scale plug flow high concentration activated sludge system the results showed that the system had a stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal capacity in cold regions with an annual average influent temperature of 11 c the cod and tp removal capacity of the system was basically stable throughout the year with an annual average removal rate of 93 49 and 95 respectively the nh4 n and tn removal capacity varied with seasons and the average effluent water concentrations of nh4 n and tn in summer 0 44 and 7 13 mg l were significantly lower than those in winter 2 87 and 12 42 mg l the high throughput sequencing results indicated that winter could cause a simultaneous decrease in microbial abundance and diversity specifically a decrease in the abundance of such nitrifying bacteria as ferribacterium probably led to some fluctuations in nitrification performance during winter which started to somewhat improve in spring the nitrogen removing microorganisms in the system were distributed in a diversified way the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal was reinforced in winter due to dpaos such as thermomonas the results of the functional gene prediction showed that winter could cause a decrease in the relative abundance of the nitrification process amob amoc and hao genes and denitrification process nirk gene while it less affected the remaining functional genes related to nitrogen and phosphorus removal keywords low temperature sewage activated sludge method nitrogen and phosphorus removal microbial community structure functional gene data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction many sewage treatment plants were experiencing seasonal changes they in winter might be subject to a decrease in microbial activity poor sludge settleability etc 1 2 due to the seasonal temperature changes the sewage treatment efficiency could also have some seasonal characteristics researches show that in summer the cod tn nh4 n and ss removal of sewage treatment plants improved to varying degrees compared to winter while the tp removal was less affected by seasonal changes 3 4 such difference was particularly evident in colder regions the sewage treatment plants in cold regions often had longer cold days and lower influent temperatures and low temperature days totaled up to more than 100 in winter and the sewage temperatures were mostly between 8 and 10 c there 5 low temperature could have a non negligible impact on the performance of sewage treatment plants and the characteristics of microorganisms 2 6 to further improve the low temperature sewage treatment efficiency in cold regions many methods were used including heat preservation 7 reduction of sludge load 8 an increase of hydraulic retention time 9 domestication and enrichment of psychrophilic bacteria 10 however these methods often required higher operating costs and more stringent regulation techniques or were limited to laboratory scale without conditions for engineering applications developing the stable sewage treatment technologies applicable to cold regions such as northeast china would undoubtedly bring significant ecological and economic benefits the high concentration activated sludge method attracted the attention of scholars because of its huge microbial population strong resistance to shock loads and excellent low temperature nitrogen removal the existing activated sludge method at home and abroad involved an mlss of generally around 3 g l while the high concentration activated sludge system involved an mlss of generally above 4 g l 11 12 wang huang et al applied the high concentration activated sludge method to a pilot scale base in a cold region and the results showed that the system could still have a good nitrogen removal effect at lower than 10 c 13 14 zhou et al combined the high concentration activated sludge method with the dissolved oxygen control technology to make mlss above 6 g l and the aerobic front end do below 1 mg l strengthening the simultaneous nitrification denitrification effect of the system and achieving the deep nitrogen removal of municipal sewage under the conditions of insufficient carbon sources and short hydraulic retention time 12 15 niu et al used a pre denitrification sequencing batch bioreactor sbr high concentration activated sludge method mlss of 7 9 g l to treat some simulated municipal sewage with a c n of 4 and finally achieved a tn removal efficiency of 70 16 analysis suggests that the high concentration activated sludge system had a strong capacity for low temperature nitrogen removal and pollutant degradation however most of the current tasks only focused on the change in the efficiency of removing some pollutants and most of the results were obtained by laboratory scale steady state temperature regulation 4 there are few reports about the long time treatment efficacy and changes in microbial abundance and functions of the pilot scale high concentration activated sludge system at seasonally varying temperatures in cold regions 4 17 18 researches show that few people had studied or long tracked and analyzed whether or not the potential microbial metabolic function in operating sewage treatment plants would change with the seasons adaptably besides it is very helpful and significant for sewage treatment plants to operate in cold regions to reveal the impact of seasonal changes especially low temperature on the high concentration activated sludge concentration system ensure a stable sewage treatment effect and explore the changes in the abundance of key functional genes of low temperature microorganisms based on the above mentioned practical problems and research background for this study a pilot scale plug flow high concentration activated sludge device was established in a municipal sewage treatment plant in changchun a year long study was conducted on the system to investigate the influence of seasonal changes on the pollutant removal further with high throughput sequencing technique we revealed the influence of seasonal changes on microbial structure and functional gene abundance this study aimed to help in the operation of sewage treatment plants in cold regions and to provide these plants with an alternative stable low temperature sewage treatment technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale study on the plug flow device the pilot scale test device is shown in fig 1 the device covered a total floor area of 36 m2 and consisted of an intake tank a plug flow corridor reactor and a sedimentation tank all the structures were made of welded q235 steel plates the pool walls of the structure and bottom were 6 mm and 10 mm thick respectively the sizes of the primary structure size were as follows the intake tank had a length of 1500 mm a width of 500 mm a height of 1500 mm and an effective height of 1200 mm the inside of the plug flow reactor was divided equally into six corridors with a total length of 6000 mm a total width of 4000 mm an effective water depth of 4000 mm and an effective volume of 96m3 the sedimentation tank had a length of 3850 mm a width of 2500 mm a height of 5200 mm and an effective height of 4200 mm specifically the bottom cone was 900 mm high the influent water of the device was from the aerated grit chamber the municipal sewage at the bottom of the chamber entered the intake tank under the action of the submersible sewage pump cs3045ht3 252 and then entered the first corridor as gravity flow the sewage flowed into the reactor in the shape of s under the action of the air blower baishide hc 509 and ran through six corridors as plug flow into the sedimentation tank the reflux sludge was lifted to the intake tank through the sludge reflux pump sulzer ip900w to mix up with the influent and then entered the first corridor the seeding sludge in the pilot scale test device was from the aerobic sectional sludge in the aeration tank of the sewage treatment plant after two continuous weeks of closed cycle culture the activated sludge was yellowish brown and the sludge water separation interface was clear the effluent remained stable within 30 days so the culture was regarded as successful the operating parameters of the plant during the test were as follows the starting mlss hrt and influent flow rate were set as 5000 mg l 8 h and 10 m3 h respectively the sludge return ratio was set as 100 and the return sludge flow rate was 10m3 h for the aeration rate the gas water ratio was designed as 3 and the aeration rate was controlled at 30m3 h the ph of the influent ranged from 6 7 to 7 6 or was 7 1 on average the aeration rate was controlled by an intelligent vortex street flowmeter carmen lugb 20 35 p2 an electromagnetic flowmeter delta phase dm7 fi 80 ac 5 was used to control the influent and sludge flows the pilot scale device was inspected and maintained

metrohm 2 dna extraction and pcr amplification method the sludge test samples were taken on the 30th day in winter the 120th day in spring the 210th day in summer and the 300th day in autumn with an influent temperature of 8 c 10 c 14 c and 12 c respectively and relatively stable effluent water quality equal amounts of activated sludge were taken in the first third and sixth corridors of the device then were mixed up well and were finally frozen at 80 c for later testing in this experiment the illumina platform was used for paired end sequencing of community dna fragments according to the

the second round of pcr amplification 20 moreover picrust2 was used to predict the nitrogen and phosphorus metabolization pathways of the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in do and temperature the changes in the influent temperature of the pilot scale device were continuously tested from december 1 2020 to december 1 2021 the results are shown in fig 2 the device was located in the high tech zone of changchun city jilin province china the temperature was generally low in autumn and winter and the influent temperature was between 7 c and 16 c the pilot scale base was outdoors all year round and no additional heat preservation measures were added water went into the plant through rain sewage pipelines the long urban drainage pipelines exacerbated the loss of water temperatures in the pipeline therefore the influent temperature was low throughout the year with an annual average water temperature of only 11 c the average influent temperatures in spring summer autumn and winter were 10 c 14 c 12 c and 8 c respectively because of the long freezing period in the region the influent temperatures at the beginning of march were also less than 10 c a widespread cold wave with strong rain and snow climate in november led to a rapid drop in water temperature from 11 8 c to 7 9 c at day 300 the follow up results and discussion were divided into four seasons winter spring summer and autumn and the corresponding operating periods were 0 90 d 91 181 d 182 272 d and 273 363 d respectively the measured do concentrations in the first third and sixth corridors are showed in fig 3 the do in the first and third corridors was relatively stable while that in the sixth corridor fluctuated dramatically the average do concentrations in the different corridors during the operation were respectively 0 28 3 16 and 4 25 mg l the results showed that the device passed through a relatively stable anoxic and aerobic area under the plug flow of the blast aeration device creating a suitable do gradient for biochemical reactions such as nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 2 change in sludge characteristics the changes in mlss and mlvss throughout the year are showed in fig 4a mlss fluctuated between 4600 and 14 500 mg l or was 8100 mg l on average and the average mlss in winter spring summer and autumn were 6730 6630 10 800 and 8500 mg l respectively mlvss varied from 2000 to 4950 mg l the average mlvss concentrations in different seasons were 3400 3000 3250 and 3400 mg l respectively and the annual average mlvss was 3230 mg l approximately on the 180th day it was summer mlss increased sharply from 7000 mg l to 11 000 mg l and mlvss mlss decreased from 0 50 to 0 30 analysis showed that rainstorms happened frequently in this stage and no ground surface leveling had been carried out in the industrial park so a huge amount of sediments were washed into the device resulting in more inorganic substances in the system and then a decrease in the overall activity of the sludge when it was autumn mlvss mlss gradually recovered from 0 28 to 0 42 and tended to rise continually and the activated sludge in the system resumed its activity the higher activated sludge concentration kept the system under low load for a long time promoting the reproduction of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria therein and that of the denitrifying bacteria therein whose electron donors were phas and enhancing the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal capacity of the system 21 besides we collected and analyzed the effluent water samples to further verify the pollutant removal effect of the reactor under high mlss 3 3 pollutant removal effect the cod removal of the pilot scale plug flow corridor test device is shown in the fig 5 the influent cod varied from 80 to 1950 mg l and the average influent cod concentrations were 533 73 431 13 816 37 and 191 89 mg l in winter spring summer and autumn respectively the higher average influent cod concentration in summer was probably due to the high rainfall and the pollutants accumulated in the pipelines and the inorganic impurities on the site being carried into the reactor by flushing the effluent cod was always between 7 53 mg l and 49 79 mg l with an annual average removal rate of 93 49 meeting the a level chinese urban sewage discharge standard the cod removal rate was basically stable in four seasons with an average cod removal rate of 94 72 92 94 95 33 and 89 02 in winter spring summer and autumn respectively the results indicated that sewage treatment plants in cold regions might fluctuate in treatment efficiency due to seasonal influences such as snow and ice melting in spring and cold waves in autumn the method of removing cod in the high concentration activated sludge system mainly consisted of two main parts sludge adsorption and biodegradation the six corridors of this system were in a uniform aeration state which enabled the sludge in suspension to be in more full contact with the sewage and accelerate the mass transfer and reaction rates of the matrix in the sewage at the same time the sludge in the device was under low load with the high concentration activated sludge method so a large number of starving microbial communities in the endogenous respiration period could achieve efficient adsorption and degradation of cod in water therefore although seasonal changes could bring some impact on water quality and quantity the high concentration activated sludge system had a strong resistance to shock load and could achieve stable cod removal the tp removal effect in the device is showed in fig 6 the tp influent concentration fluctuated between 1 00 and 19 12 mg l the average influent tp concentrations in winter spring summer and autumn were 2 64 4 57 11 97 and 2 94 mg l respectively in summer the influent tp fluctuated greatly while the highest influent tp concentration reached 19 12 mg l the increase of influent tp might be related to the increase of inorganic matters in the reactor during the storm period during the whole test period the device always had a strong removal tp ability the average tp removal rate stayed above 95 throughout the year the average effluent tp concentrations in the four seasons were 0 12 0 20 0 09 and 0 12 mg l respectively in summer the system had the best tp removal capacity the tp removal might be a combined action of paos and dpaos the do concentration increased gradually in different corridors the resulting anoxic and aerobic environments made paos achieve anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus absorption at the same time the excellent nitrogen removal in the aeration zone of the device resulted in that there were less no3 n and no2 n in the return sludge facilitating the release of phosphorus from the anaerobic zone providing the dpaos with the raw material for denitrification and phosphorus removal and somewhat contributing to phosphorus removal from the system therefore although there was a certain impact of influent tp in the summer it did not affect the tp removal of the system moreover seasonal changes had a small influence on the tp removal of the system and the system had a stable tp removal ability the nh4 n removal effect in the device is showed in fig 7 the nh4 n influent concentration of the system ranged from 15 33 to 31 88 mg l with an annual average nh4 n influent concentration of 21 41 mg l the average influent nh4 n concentrations in winter spring summer and autumn were 24 43 22 59 18 27 and 18 40 mg l respectively and the average effluent nh4 n concentrations were 2 87 0 66 0 44 and 0 63 mg l respectively with an annual average nh4 n removal rate of 94 54 as the temperature increased the effluent nh4 n concentration decreased somewhat the effluent nh4 n concentration was high and fluctuated to some extent at the beginning of winter the effluent do concentration of the device was maintained between 3 and 6 mg l and the do was sufficient therefore the low temperature was considered as the main reason for the incomplete nitrification reaction in the early stage related studies also show that the nh4 n removal efficiency of the activated sludge system would decrease rapidly at temperatures less than 10 c 22 on the 60th day the water temperature began to gradually recover from 8 7 c and the nh4 n concentration in the winter effluent gradually decreased to about 1 5 mg l the nh4 n removal rate in the remaining seasons was also stable at about 95 analysis indicate that the system was always in a high sludge concentration state with less external organic matter under low sludge load inhibiting the reproduction of heterotrophic bacteria and creating better survival conditions for autotrophic nitrifying bacteria weakening the impact of low temperature on nitrification to a certain extent and gradually improving the nh4 n treatment effect of the system the tn changes in the system throughout the year is shown in fig 8 the variation of no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the influent and effluent water in winter and summer are shown in table 1 the influent tn ranged from 19 87 to 47 2 mg l throughout the year the influent tn concentration was high with an average influent tn concentration of 37 58 mg l in winter and 31 18 mg l in spring the average influent tn concentration was low in summer and autumn at about 25 mg l the average influent no2 n and no3 n concentrations in winter were 0 5 and 0 46 mg l respectively in summer the influent no3 n ranged from 0 35 to 1 63 mg l and no2 n was not detected in the first 30 days of the operation the average effluent nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations at this stage reached 5 48 7 71 and 0 35 mg l respectively due to a combination of low temperature in winter and system inadaptability and the results indicated that the system had not yet formed a stable nitrification and denitrification capacity on the 100th day of spring when the water temperature was about 10 c the overall nitrogen removal capacity of the system gradually recovered to stability and the tn effluent concentration of the system could be maintained below 10 mg l for a long time this was consistent with the findings of other scholars the treatment efficiency of the reactor could be gradually improved and restored in spring 4 23 the average effluent tn concentration in summer decreased by 5 29 mg l compared to winter to reach 7 13 mg l in addition the extreme cold weather on the 300th day of autumn caused the water temperature to drop from 11 8 c to 7 9 c rapidly but the nitrogen removal capacity of the system was not affected significantly and the average effluent tn concentration of the system could still be maintained below 10 2 mg l the system maintained an average tn removal rate of about 70 throughout the year the results indicated that the high concentration activated sludge system had a strong ability to adapt to low temperatures and could play a stable and excellent low temperature nitrogen removal 3 4 impact of seasonal changes on microbial diversity and structure 3 4 1 analysis on microbial diversity the changes in microbial community abundance and diversity under seasonal changes are shown in table 2 with a coverage rate of 97 to 98 the numbers of otus were 3189 4261 3125 and 2523 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively the results showed that the number of microorganisms in the system decreased significantly as the temperature decreased the results of the ace and chao1 indices showed the same conclusion the microbial abundance was the highest in summer samples with an ace of 9207 and a chao1 of 7129 respectively and it was the lowest in winter with an ace of 5271 and a chao1 of 4237 respectively the results were similar in spring and autumn the shannon and simpson indices reflected the diversity of microbial communities and a high shannon index and a low simpson index represented high sample diversity microbial diversity was the highest in summer with a shannon index of 6 36 and a simpson index of 0 0049 respectively and in winter those two indices were 6 05 and 0 0069 respectively this indicated that temperature change would screen microorganisms to some extent so some microorganisms unable to adapt to the low temperature environment would be eliminated the results showed that low temperatures in winter had caused a simultaneous decrease in the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the system resulting in some fluctuations in the winter nitrogen removal performance of the system meeting the emission standards in spring with the recovery of water temperature the diversity and abundance of microorganisms rose again so the sewage treatment efficiency of the system gradually improved 3 4 2 analysis on microorganisms at the phylum level the abundance of typical microbial phyla in different seasons is showed in fig 9 the microorganisms in the system were distributed in a diversified way while more than 10 microorganisms had a relative abundance remaining at more than 1 proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and planctomycetes were the main phyla in the system and the total percentage of the four microorganisms accounted for more than 80 of the total quantity of microorganisms proteobacteria was the main microbial phylum in the urban sewage treatment system 24 in this system the proportions of proteobacteria in spring summer autumn and winter were 52 44 59 and 56 respectively data show that proteobacteria had a strong adaptability to seasonal and climate changes guaranteeing the nitrogen and phosphorus removal of the system 25 bacteroidetes as the microorganism accounting for the second largest proportion in the system mainly performed denitrification nitrogen removal and decomposition of macromolecular organic matter 26 and accounted for 17 16 11 and 17 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively this indicated that bacteroidetes played an essential role in low temperature sewage treatment which was consistent with li et al s research results who believed that there were psychrophilic bacteria in bacteroidetes which could exist in a low temperature and anoxic environment improving the nitrogen removal ability of the system 27 the presence of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes ensured the pollutant removal efficiency of the device in winter there were also some common bacteria in the system such as chloroflexi and actinobacteria chloroflexi one of the gram negative bacteria was mainly involved in nitrogen metabolism conducive to removing macromolecular organic matter by the system 28 actinobacteria as a kind of heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria could achieve the effect of denitrification and phosphorus removal under aerobic conditions 29 due to the enrichment of various denitrification bacteria the high activated sludge system had a strong nitrogen removal capacity 3 4 3 analysis on microorganisms at the genus level the changes in the relative abundance of the main nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal microorganisms at the genus level in the pilot test system under different seasons are shown in fig 10 as shown in the figure there were more than twenty microorganisms associated with nitrogen removal in the system thermomonas rhodobacter terrimonas saccharibacteria and dechloromonas were the main denitrifying microorganisms in the system and their relative abundance could be maintained between 1 83 and 6 17 throughout the year among them thermomonas rhodobacter and terrimonas played the main role of denitrification in winter and the relative abundance of the three did not decrease due to low temperature and they reached 5 33 5 18 and 3 78 respectively which might be related to their special microbial properties scholars research shows that thermomonas a bacterium capable of both no3 n and no2 n reduction could secrete antifreeze intracellular polymers eps at low temperatures to maintain its normal reproductive metabolism 30 rhodobacter and terrimonas both had a certain cold adapted ability and could play a stable role in nitrogen removal 31 32 the system also contained denitrifying microorganisms such as gemmobacter phaeodactylibacter thauera steroidobacter and dokdonella which had a relative abundance remaining at more than 1 throughout the year the diverse and stable composition of denitrifying microorganisms guaranteed the stable nitrogen removal capacity of the system and proved that the system had a good tn removal performance ferribacterium and phaeodactylibacter were the main nitrifying microorganisms detected in the system 33 34 the relative abundances of ferribacterium and phaeodactylibacter were 2 75 3 96 2 75 2 19 and 1 48 2 25 1 68 and 1 76 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively it showed that temperature changes significantly affected the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria and the relative abundance of ferribacterium and phaeodactylibacter reduced by 1 77 and 0 49 respectively in winter and summer this probably was the main reason for the short term fluctuation of ammonia and nitrogen concentrations in the effluent during winter the main phosphorus removing bacteria in the system were thermomonas rhodobacter povalibacter and dechloromonas among them thermomonas rhodobacter and dechloromonas were typical types of dpaos they could perform in situ respiration to excessively absorb phosphorus from the environment by use of no3 n and no2 n and were also highly adapted to the environment 35 37 the relative abundance of thermomonas rhodobacter and dechloromonas could still reach 5 33 5 18 and 3 31 respectively in winter and they played the main role in phosphorus removal in the system povalibacter as one of the paos 38 had a relative abundance of 1 70 2 12 3 35 and 1 40 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively and the relative abundance of povalibacter decreased significantly with the decreasing temperature the results indicated that a phosphorus removal pathway dominated by denitrifying phosphorus removal and supplemented by traditional phosphorus removal might have been formed in the system the stabilization of dpaos in winter promoted the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal capabilities of the system making the system able to have a stable pollutant removal effect 3 5 influence of seasonal influence on the abundance of nitrogen metabolism related functional genes based on 16srrna high throughput sequencing data and with the picrust database the metabolic potential of the microbial communities were predicted we compared the results with the kegg database the influence of seasonal changes on the species and abundance of biological genes were explored to more intuitively show the changes made by microorganisms to adapt to water temperature changes fig 11 is the composition of nitrogen cycling related genes in the system with nh4 n as the starting point of the cycle nh4 n transformed into nh2oh under the action of amo and then participated in the nitrification reaction dominated by nar and the denitrification dominated by nap and nar no2 n was the transformation medium for the nitrogen valence state nas and nir therein played the roles of assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium anra and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra making no2 reduce to nh4 n both anra and dnra could reduce no3 n to nh4 n but the types of enzymes were different in the process anra occurred in an aerobic environment assimilating nh4 n into amino acids by energy dnra mainly occurred under anoxic or anaerobic conditions in the case of a sufficient carbon source and a low nh4 n concentration dnra was the primary way to remove no3 n in an anoxic environment 39 dnra did not require nad p h as an electron donor there was no organic nitrogen intermediate 40 the produced directly could not only provide a nitrogen source for the growth of dissimilatory nitrate reducing bacteria but also could be released to outside cells to provide a nitrogen source for the growth of nitrogen fixing denitrifying and other bacteria 41 some energy could also be used to oxidize organic compounds 39 next the abundance of functional genes obtained by sequencing was further compared to explore the influence of the changes in the abundance of functional genes on the pollutant removal effect fig 12 is the gene abundances of enzymes involved in n transformation in different seasons amo hao and nxr mainly acted in the nitrification reaction studies show that the ammonia activation of all known aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea was associated with amo 42 autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria consumed atp and reducing power to reduce co2 and its residual cellular material accounted for only 1 4 of heterotrophic bacteria 43 and coupled with its slow division and reproduction ability 44 it only accounted for a small proportion in the system but amo had a vigorous activity and as a result the ammonia oxidation ability was less affected by gene abundance 45 the amo operon was composed of three structural genes amoa amob and amoc 46 the genes involved in ammonia monooxygenase coding in this system consisted of amob and amoc and no amoa was detected amob and amoc accounted for 0 14 0 44 10 3 and 0 29 0 91 10 3 of the total abundance of gene expression respectively amoc was about twice as abundant as amob in winter when the water temperature was 8 c the abundance of both genes decreased to 0 14 10 3 and 0 29 10 3 respectively analysis suggested that the decrease in temperature might led to a decrease in the abundance of amob and amoc resulting in a reduction in nitrification capacity which was consistent with the previous analysis of fluctuations in ammonia nitrogen effluent in winter hydroxylamine generated by ammonia oxidation was an energization reaction most aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria saved energy in this way 47 the gene abundance of hao significantly correlated with seasons with the decrease in water temperature its abundance gradually decreased from 3 97 10 3 to 3 31 10 3 weakening the nitrification ability of the system in winter the no2 n oxidation participated by nxr was the last step of nitrification as the nxr between plasma membranes was highly similar to the gene corresponding to the nitrate reductase nar and both of them were homologous genes 39 so the sequencing results were presented together during the transition from summer to winter the abundance of nxr and nar increased somewhat when the winter water temperature was 8 c the abundances of nxr and nar reached the highest and the utilization of no3 n and no2 n by microorganisms increased in summary the oxidation process of ammonia and hydroxylamine mainly limited the nitrification ability in winter transforming liquid nitrogen into gaseous nitrogen by denitrification was the core of nitrogen element removal in sewage treatment denitrification mainly involves four types of nitrogen compound reductions including no3 n reduction participated by nar and nap no2 n reduction by nir no reduction by nor and n2o reduction by nos the composition of nitrate reductase was mainly divided into two categories one was the periplasmic nitrate reductase encoded by nap and located between the cytoplasm and cytomembrane which was less affected by oxygen concentration and could well play a role of aerobic denitrification the other was the membrane bound nitrate reductase encoded by nar and on the cell membrane which was sensitive to the concentration of oxygen molecules and preferentially expressed in hypoxia 48 different from other nitrogen reductase genes nitrate reductase genes were more diverse in species the total gene abundance in different seasons also reached 60 92 10 3 80 42 10 3 this was consistent with the microbial structure analysis whose results were that the denitrifying bacteria accounted for a higher proportion in the total number of microorganisms in the system nitrate reductase consisted of two subunits in the cytoplasm nargh a membrane bound subunits nari and nardj narg was considered as the functional marker gene for nar 49 the above mentioned nar genes had a higher abundance in winter than in summer with a growth as high as 1 48 10 3 3 09 10 3 unlike nar nap did not require energy for transporting the raw material no3 n and the product no2 n across the cell membrane 50 nap comprises napa and napb genes and the abundance of napa genes in the system was up to 5 25 10 3 through the coding effect of napa denitrifying bacteria could perform denitrification functions under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the characteristics of its preferential expression under aerobic conditions indicated that the system had the possibility of aerobic denitrification these anoxic and aerobic denitrification metabolic pathways reduced the nitric nitrogen concentration and strengthened the denitrification ability of the system therefore the winter nitrogen removal could be guaranteed and the nitrogen removal effect of the system was stabilized nitrite reductase mainly included the free cytochrome cd1 around cells and the free copper containing type in cells encoded by nirs and nirk respectively the nirs gene in the system wasn t detected in the system the nirk abundance decreased to 1 69 10 3 in winter indicating that the conversion of no2 n to no was affected somewhat nor was an extremely unstable membrane bound no reductase but it had a strong affinity for no making low no concentrations still catalytically reduced the norb gene encoded nor enzyme complexes and was a marker gene for nor enzyme 51 the nosz gene encoded the cuz catalytic group in n2o reductase and nosz was the current primary research gene nos was believed to be more sensitive to oxygen ph and sulfide than other nitrogen oxide reductase based on this noticeable sensitivity n2o environmental emission was completely attributed to the inhibition of nos in microorganisms 47 these two types of genes had specific adaptability to the changes in water temperature and the abundances of norb and nosz could increase by 6 77 10 3 and 2 79 10 3 respectively during the transformation from summer to winter therefore in the actual seasonal variation the reduction of no2 n might be the rate limiting step of the whole denitrification in addition the system also had some dnra and anra functions reducing no3 n to nh4 n the average abundance of representative nasa and narc genes in anra reached 21 82 10 3 and 41 82 10 3 respectively and that of representative nrb and nird genes in dnra reached 26 90 10 3 and 27 22 10 3 respectively all of them were high abundance levels in the system there were two possible reasons for the high abundance of anra genes one was that the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria in the reactor led to the diversification of nitrogen removal pathways the other was that there were both high dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations at the end of the aeration tank creating reaction conditions in summary by analyzing the changes in the abundance of vital functional genes in the nitrogen removal it can be seen that the overall gene abundance in nitrification was much lower than that in denitrification and it decreased significantly with the decrease in water temperature in addition considering that nitrification was the first step of the nitrogen removal so it was considered that the decline in the abundance of nitrification genes in winter might be the main reason for any decrease in the nitrogen removal the interaction between no2 n and no3 n was less affected by seasonal changes and the transformation methods were diversified aerobic and anoxic denitrification coexisted in the system reducing no2 n might be the rate limiting step in the whole denitrification in other nitrogen cycle pathways seasonal changes had no significant effect on n2o reduction no reduction dnra and anra the diverse nitrogen conversion pathways throughout the operation allowed the system to resist low temperatures and had a stable sewage treatment effect 3 6 influence of seasonal changes on the abundance of phosphorus transformation related genes the abundance of the variation in the abundance of functional enzymes involved in phosphorus transformation in different seasons is shown in the table 3 the abundance of the enzymes involved in phosphorus transformation changed relatively gently and the proportions in seasons were average biological phosphorus removal mechanism suggests that the phb decomposition and synthesis was a critical factor in characterizing the phosphorus removal capacity of microorganisms under anaerobic conditions polyphosphate and glycogen broke down to synthesize phb while releasing phosphorus under aerobic conditions paos broke down phb to release energy and take in phosphate specifically the enzymes corresponding to the synthesis and breakdown of phb were ec 3 1 1 75 and ec 2 3 1 respectively 52 the relative abundance of ec 3 1 1 75 in the system could reach 22 62 10 3 to 30 33 10 3 and that of ec 2 3 1 could reach 304 19 10 3 to 325 64 10 3 the stability of gene species and abundance of phosphorus removal enzymes in different seasons corresponded to the stability of the tp effluent of the system and the results indicated that the system had a strong phosphorus removal capacity 4 conclusions in the one year continuous operation the pilot scale high concentration activated sludge system was proven to be able to achieve stable and excellent nitrogen and phosphorus removal of low temperature municipal sewage in the cold region with an average annual influent temperature of 11 c the system could still achieve an annual average cod tp nh4 n and tn removal rate of 93 49 95 94 54 and 70 respectively the system could achieve the best nh4 n a and tn removal results in summer with an effluent concentration of 0 44 and 7 13 mg l respectively in winter it resulted in a simultaneous decrease in microbial abundance and diversity and the abundance of nitrifying bacteria such as ferribacterium decreased which improved in spring the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms and dpaos in the high concentration activated sludge system throughout the year ensured the low temperature denitrification and phosphorus removal capability of the system gene function prediction showed that the system had diverse nitrogen cycling genes and stable phosphorus related genes throughout the year while only the relative abundance of amob amoc hao and nirk genes decreased in winter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interestsor personal relationships that could have

12589,a one year long study was conducted in the cold northern chinese region to investigate the seasonal temperature variation on the pollutant removal performance and the changes in microbial communities and functional gene abundance of a pilot scale plug flow high concentration activated sludge system the results showed that the system had a stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal capacity in cold regions with an annual average influent temperature of 11 c the cod and tp removal capacity of the system was basically stable throughout the year with an annual average removal rate of 93 49 and 95 respectively the nh4 n and tn removal capacity varied with seasons and the average effluent water concentrations of nh4 n and tn in summer 0 44 and 7 13 mg l were significantly lower than those in winter 2 87 and 12 42 mg l the high throughput sequencing results indicated that winter could cause a simultaneous decrease in microbial abundance and diversity specifically a decrease in the abundance of such nitrifying bacteria as ferribacterium probably led to some fluctuations in nitrification performance during winter which started to somewhat improve in spring the nitrogen removing microorganisms in the system were distributed in a diversified way the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal was reinforced in winter due to dpaos such as thermomonas the results of the functional gene prediction showed that winter could cause a decrease in the relative abundance of the nitrification process amob amoc and hao genes and denitrification process nirk gene while it less affected the remaining functional genes related to nitrogen and phosphorus removal keywords low temperature sewage activated sludge method nitrogen and phosphorus removal microbial community structure functional gene data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction many sewage treatment plants were experiencing seasonal changes they in winter might be subject to a decrease in microbial activity poor sludge settleability etc 1 2 due to the seasonal temperature changes the sewage treatment efficiency could also have some seasonal characteristics researches show that in summer the cod tn nh4 n and ss removal of sewage treatment plants improved to varying degrees compared to winter while the tp removal was less affected by seasonal changes 3 4 such difference was particularly evident in colder regions the sewage treatment plants in cold regions often had longer cold days and lower influent temperatures and low temperature days totaled up to more than 100 in winter and the sewage temperatures were mostly between 8 and 10 c there 5 low temperature could have a non negligible impact on the performance of sewage treatment plants and the characteristics of microorganisms 2 6 to further improve the low temperature sewage treatment efficiency in cold regions many methods were used including heat preservation 7 reduction of sludge load 8 an increase of hydraulic retention time 9 domestication and enrichment of psychrophilic bacteria 10 however these methods often required higher operating costs and more stringent regulation techniques or were limited to laboratory scale without conditions for engineering applications developing the stable sewage treatment technologies applicable to cold regions such as northeast china would undoubtedly bring significant ecological and economic benefits the high concentration activated sludge method attracted the attention of scholars because of its huge microbial population strong resistance to shock loads and excellent low temperature nitrogen removal the existing activated sludge method at home and abroad involved an mlss of generally around 3 g l while the high concentration activated sludge system involved an mlss of generally above 4 g l 11 12 wang huang et al applied the high concentration activated sludge method to a pilot scale base in a cold region and the results showed that the system could still have a good nitrogen removal effect at lower than 10 c 13 14 zhou et al combined the high concentration activated sludge method with the dissolved oxygen control technology to make mlss above 6 g l and the aerobic front end do below 1 mg l strengthening the simultaneous nitrification denitrification effect of the system and achieving the deep nitrogen removal of municipal sewage under the conditions of insufficient carbon sources and short hydraulic retention time 12 15 niu et al used a pre denitrification sequencing batch bioreactor sbr high concentration activated sludge method mlss of 7 9 g l to treat some simulated municipal sewage with a c n of 4 and finally achieved a tn removal efficiency of 70 16 analysis suggests that the high concentration activated sludge system had a strong capacity for low temperature nitrogen removal and pollutant degradation however most of the current tasks only focused on the change in the efficiency of removing some pollutants and most of the results were obtained by laboratory scale steady state temperature regulation 4 there are few reports about the long time treatment efficacy and changes in microbial abundance and functions of the pilot scale high concentration activated sludge system at seasonally varying temperatures in cold regions 4 17 18 researches show that few people had studied or long tracked and analyzed whether or not the potential microbial metabolic function in operating sewage treatment plants would change with the seasons adaptably besides it is very helpful and significant for sewage treatment plants to operate in cold regions to reveal the impact of seasonal changes especially low temperature on the high concentration activated sludge concentration system ensure a stable sewage treatment effect and explore the changes in the abundance of key functional genes of low temperature microorganisms based on the above mentioned practical problems and research background for this study a pilot scale plug flow high concentration activated sludge device was established in a municipal sewage treatment plant in changchun a year long study was conducted on the system to investigate the influence of seasonal changes on the pollutant removal further with high throughput sequencing technique we revealed the influence of seasonal changes on microbial structure and functional gene abundance this study aimed to help in the operation of sewage treatment plants in cold regions and to provide these plants with an alternative stable low temperature sewage treatment technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale study on the plug flow device the pilot scale test device is shown in fig 1 the device covered a total floor area of 36 m2 and consisted of an intake tank a plug flow corridor reactor and a sedimentation tank all the structures were made of welded q235 steel plates the pool walls of the structure and bottom were 6 mm and 10 mm thick respectively the sizes of the primary structure size were as follows the intake tank had a length of 1500 mm a width of 500 mm a height of 1500 mm and an effective height of 1200 mm the inside of the plug flow reactor was divided equally into six corridors with a total length of 6000 mm a total width of 4000 mm an effective water depth of 4000 mm and an effective volume of 96m3 the sedimentation tank had a length of 3850 mm a width of 2500 mm a height of 5200 mm and an effective height of 4200 mm specifically the bottom cone was 900 mm high the influent water of the device was from the aerated grit chamber the municipal sewage at the bottom of the chamber entered the intake tank under the action of the submersible sewage pump cs3045ht3 252 and then entered the first corridor as gravity flow the sewage flowed into the reactor in the shape of s under the action of the air blower baishide hc 509 and ran through six corridors as plug flow into the sedimentation tank the reflux sludge was lifted to the intake tank through the sludge reflux pump sulzer ip900w to mix up with the influent and then entered the first corridor the seeding sludge in the pilot scale test device was from the aerobic sectional sludge in the aeration tank of the sewage treatment plant after two continuous weeks of closed cycle culture the activated sludge was yellowish brown and the sludge water separation interface was clear the effluent remained stable within 30 days so the culture was regarded as successful the operating parameters of the plant during the test were as follows the starting mlss hrt and influent flow rate were set as 5000 mg l 8 h and 10 m3 h respectively the sludge return ratio was set as 100 and the return sludge flow rate was 10m3 h for the aeration rate the gas water ratio was designed as 3 and the aeration rate was controlled at 30m3 h the ph of the influent ranged from 6 7 to 7 6 or was 7 1 on average the aeration rate was controlled by an intelligent vortex street flowmeter carmen lugb 20 35 p2 an electromagnetic flowmeter delta phase dm7 fi 80 ac 5 was used to control the influent and sludge flows the pilot scale device was inspected and maintained daily to ensure the stability of the test operating parameters 2 2 test indicator inspection method 1 inspection of conventional indicators during the test the influent and effluent water quality indicators of the test device were tested every two days do ph and temperature were monitored with a handheld multi parameter analyzer multi 340i wtw company germany cod was measured with a cod quick analyzer 5b 1 lian hua technology co ltd china ss tn nh4 n tp and mlss were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2007 19 no3 n and no2 n were tested by ion chromatography 881compact ic pro metrohm 2 dna extraction and pcr amplification method the sludge test samples were taken on the 30th day in winter the 120th day in spring the 210th day in summer and the 300th day in autumn with an influent temperature of 8 c 10 c 14 c and 12 c respectively and relatively stable effluent water quality equal amounts of activated sludge were taken in the first third and sixth corridors of the device then were mixed up well and were finally frozen at 80 c for later testing in this experiment the illumina platform was used for paired end sequencing of community dna fragments according to the manufacturer s instructions e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega was used for total genomic dna extraction the integrity of dna was analyzed through the agarose gel method gel imaging system from upv america qubit3 0 dna testing kits q10212 life were used in the first round of pcr amplification to determine if the pcr reaction should join the dna universal primers 341f ccctacacgacgctcttccgatctg bar code cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactggagttccttggcacccgagaattccagactachvgggta tctaatcc were utilized to amplify v3 v4 miseq sequencing platform pcr primers compatible illumina were introduced for the second round of pcr amplification 20 moreover picrust2 was used to predict the nitrogen and phosphorus metabolization pathways of the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in do and temperature the changes in the influent temperature of the pilot scale device were continuously tested from december 1 2020 to december 1 2021 the results are shown in fig 2 the device was located in the high tech zone of changchun city jilin province china the temperature was generally low in autumn and winter and the influent temperature was between 7 c and 16 c the pilot scale base was outdoors all year round and no additional heat preservation measures were added water went into the plant through rain sewage pipelines the long urban drainage pipelines exacerbated the loss of water temperatures in the pipeline therefore the influent temperature was low throughout the year with an annual average water temperature of only 11 c the average influent temperatures in spring summer autumn and winter were 10 c 14 c 12 c and 8 c respectively because of the long freezing period in the region the influent temperatures at the beginning of march were also less than 10 c a widespread cold wave with strong rain and snow climate in november led to a rapid drop in water temperature from 11 8 c to 7 9 c at day 300 the follow up results and discussion were divided into four seasons winter spring summer and autumn and the corresponding operating periods were 0 90 d 91 181 d 182 272 d and 273 363 d respectively the measured do concentrations in the first third and sixth corridors are showed in fig 3 the do in the first and third corridors was relatively stable while that in the sixth corridor fluctuated dramatically the average do concentrations in the different corridors during the operation were respectively 0 28 3 16 and 4 25 mg l the results showed that the device passed through a relatively stable anoxic and aerobic area under the plug flow of the blast aeration device creating a suitable do gradient for biochemical reactions such as nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 2 change in sludge characteristics the changes in mlss and mlvss throughout the year are showed in fig 4a mlss fluctuated between 4600 and 14 500 mg l or was 8100 mg l on average and the average mlss in winter spring summer and autumn were 6730 6630 10 800 and 8500 mg l respectively mlvss varied from 2000 to 4950 mg l the average mlvss concentrations in different seasons were 3400 3000 3250 and 3400 mg l respectively and the annual average mlvss was 3230 mg l approximately on the 180th day it was summer mlss increased sharply from 7000 mg l to 11 000 mg l and mlvss mlss decreased from 0 50 to 0 30 analysis showed that rainstorms happened frequently in this stage and no ground surface leveling had been carried out in the industrial park so a huge amount of sediments were washed into the device resulting in more inorganic substances in the system and then a decrease in the overall activity of the sludge when it was autumn mlvss mlss gradually recovered from 0 28 to 0 42 and tended to rise continually and the activated sludge in the system resumed its activity the higher activated sludge concentration kept the system under low load for a long time promoting the reproduction of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria therein and that of the denitrifying bacteria therein whose electron donors were phas and enhancing the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal capacity of the system 21 besides we collected and analyzed the effluent water samples to further verify the pollutant removal effect of the reactor under high mlss 3 3 pollutant removal effect the cod removal of the pilot scale plug flow corridor test device is shown in the fig 5 the influent cod varied from 80 to 1950 mg l and the average influent cod concentrations were 533 73 431 13 816 37 and 191 89 mg l in winter spring summer and autumn respectively the higher average influent cod concentration in summer was probably due to the high rainfall and the pollutants accumulated in the pipelines and the inorganic impurities on the site being carried into the reactor by flushing the effluent cod was always between 7 53 mg l and 49 79 mg l with an annual average removal rate of 93 49 meeting the a level chinese urban sewage discharge standard the cod removal rate was basically stable in four seasons with an average cod removal rate of 94 72 92 94 95 33 and 89 02 in winter spring summer and autumn respectively the results indicated that sewage treatment plants in cold regions might fluctuate in treatment efficiency due to seasonal influences such as snow and ice melting in spring and cold waves in autumn the method of removing cod in the high concentration activated sludge system mainly consisted of two main parts sludge adsorption and biodegradation the six corridors of this system were in a uniform aeration state which enabled the sludge in suspension to be in more full contact with the sewage and accelerate the mass transfer and reaction rates of the matrix in the sewage at the same time the sludge in the device was under low load with the high concentration activated sludge method so a large number of starving microbial communities in the endogenous respiration period could achieve efficient adsorption and degradation of cod in water therefore although seasonal changes could bring some impact on water quality and quantity the high concentration activated sludge system had a strong resistance to shock load and could achieve stable cod removal the tp removal effect in the device is showed in fig 6 the tp influent concentration fluctuated between 1 00 and 19 12 mg l the average influent tp concentrations in winter spring summer and autumn were 2 64 4 57 11 97 and 2 94 mg l respectively in summer the influent tp fluctuated greatly while the highest influent tp concentration reached 19 12 mg l the increase of influent tp might be related to the increase of inorganic matters in the reactor during the storm period during the whole test period the device always had a strong removal tp ability the average tp removal rate stayed above 95 throughout the year the average effluent tp concentrations in the four seasons were 0 12 0 20 0 09 and 0 12 mg l respectively in summer the system had the best tp removal capacity the tp removal might be a combined action of paos and dpaos the do concentration increased gradually in different corridors the resulting anoxic and aerobic environments made paos achieve anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus absorption at the same time the excellent nitrogen removal in the aeration zone of the device resulted in that there were less no3 n and no2 n in the return sludge facilitating the release of phosphorus from the anaerobic zone providing the dpaos with the raw material for denitrification and phosphorus removal and somewhat contributing to phosphorus removal from the system therefore although there was a certain impact of influent tp in the summer it did not affect the tp removal of the system moreover seasonal changes had a small influence on the tp removal of the system and the system had a stable tp removal ability the nh4 n removal effect in the device is showed in fig 7 the nh4 n influent concentration of the system ranged from 15 33 to 31 88 mg l with an annual average nh4 n influent concentration of 21 41 mg l the average influent nh4 n concentrations in winter spring summer and autumn were 24 43 22 59 18 27 and 18 40 mg l respectively and the average effluent nh4 n concentrations were 2 87 0 66 0 44 and 0 63 mg l respectively with an annual average nh4 n removal rate of 94 54 as the temperature increased the effluent nh4 n concentration decreased somewhat the effluent nh4 n concentration was high and fluctuated to some extent at the beginning of winter the effluent do concentration of the device was maintained between 3 and 6 mg l and the do was sufficient therefore the low temperature was considered as the main reason for the incomplete nitrification reaction in the early stage related studies also show that the nh4 n removal efficiency of the activated sludge system would decrease rapidly at temperatures less than 10 c 22 on the 60th day the water temperature began to gradually recover from 8 7 c and the nh4 n concentration in the winter effluent gradually decreased to about 1 5 mg l the nh4 n removal rate in the remaining seasons was also stable at about 95 analysis indicate that the system was always in a high sludge concentration state with less external organic matter under low sludge load inhibiting the reproduction of heterotrophic bacteria and creating better survival conditions for autotrophic nitrifying bacteria weakening the impact of low temperature on nitrification to a certain extent and gradually improving the nh4 n treatment effect of the system the tn changes in the system throughout the year is shown in fig 8 the variation of no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the influent and effluent water in winter and summer are shown in table 1 the influent tn ranged from 19 87 to 47 2 mg l throughout the year the influent tn concentration was high with an average influent tn concentration of 37 58 mg l in winter and 31 18 mg l in spring the average influent tn concentration was low in summer and autumn at about 25 mg l the average influent no2 n and no3 n concentrations in winter were 0 5 and 0 46 mg l respectively in summer the influent no3 n ranged from 0 35 to 1 63 mg l and no2 n was not detected in the first 30 days of the operation the average effluent nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations at this stage reached 5 48 7 71 and 0 35 mg l respectively due to a combination of low temperature in winter and system inadaptability and the results indicated that the system had not yet formed a stable nitrification and denitrification capacity on the 100th day of spring when the water temperature was about 10 c the overall nitrogen removal capacity of the system gradually recovered to stability and the tn effluent concentration of the system could be maintained below 10 mg l for a long time this was consistent with the findings of other scholars the treatment efficiency of the reactor could be gradually improved and restored in spring 4 23 the average effluent tn concentration in summer decreased by 5 29 mg l compared to winter to reach 7 13 mg l in addition the extreme cold weather on the 300th day of autumn caused the water temperature to drop from 11 8 c to 7 9 c rapidly but the nitrogen removal capacity of the system was not affected significantly and the average effluent tn concentration of the system could still be maintained below 10 2 mg l the system maintained an average tn removal rate of about 70 throughout the year the results indicated that the high concentration activated sludge system had a strong ability to adapt to low temperatures and could play a stable and excellent low temperature nitrogen removal 3 4 impact of seasonal changes on microbial diversity and structure 3 4 1 analysis on microbial diversity the changes in microbial community abundance and diversity under seasonal changes are shown in table 2 with a coverage rate of 97 to 98 the numbers of otus were 3189 4261 3125 and 2523 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively the results showed that the number of microorganisms in the system decreased significantly as the temperature decreased the results of the ace and chao1 indices showed the same conclusion the microbial abundance was the highest in summer samples with an ace of 9207 and a chao1 of 7129 respectively and it was the lowest in winter with an ace of 5271 and a chao1 of 4237 respectively the results were similar in spring and autumn the shannon and simpson indices reflected the diversity of microbial communities and a high shannon index and a low simpson index represented high sample diversity microbial diversity was the highest in summer with a shannon index of 6 36 and a simpson index of 0 0049 respectively and in winter those two indices were 6 05 and 0 0069 respectively this indicated that temperature change would screen microorganisms to some extent so some microorganisms unable to adapt to the low temperature environment would be eliminated the results showed that low temperatures in winter had caused a simultaneous decrease in the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in the system resulting in some fluctuations in the winter nitrogen removal performance of the system meeting the emission standards in spring with the recovery of water temperature the diversity and abundance of microorganisms rose again so the sewage treatment efficiency of the system gradually improved 3 4 2 analysis on microorganisms at the phylum level the abundance of typical microbial phyla in different seasons is showed in fig 9 the microorganisms in the system were distributed in a diversified way while more than 10 microorganisms had a relative abundance remaining at more than 1 proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and planctomycetes were the main phyla in the system and the total percentage of the four microorganisms accounted for more than 80 of the total quantity of microorganisms proteobacteria was the main microbial phylum in the urban sewage treatment system 24 in this system the proportions of proteobacteria in spring summer autumn and winter were 52 44 59 and 56 respectively data show that proteobacteria had a strong adaptability to seasonal and climate changes guaranteeing the nitrogen and phosphorus removal of the system 25 bacteroidetes as the microorganism accounting for the second largest proportion in the system mainly performed denitrification nitrogen removal and decomposition of macromolecular organic matter 26 and accounted for 17 16 11 and 17 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively this indicated that bacteroidetes played an essential role in low temperature sewage treatment which was consistent with li et al s research results who believed that there were psychrophilic bacteria in bacteroidetes which could exist in a low temperature and anoxic environment improving the nitrogen removal ability of the system 27 the presence of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes ensured the pollutant removal efficiency of the device in winter there were also some common bacteria in the system such as chloroflexi and actinobacteria chloroflexi one of the gram negative bacteria was mainly involved in nitrogen metabolism conducive to removing macromolecular organic matter by the system 28 actinobacteria as a kind of heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria could achieve the effect of denitrification and phosphorus removal under aerobic conditions 29 due to the enrichment of various denitrification bacteria the high activated sludge system had a strong nitrogen removal capacity 3 4 3 analysis on microorganisms at the genus level the changes in the relative abundance of the main nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal microorganisms at the genus level in the pilot test system under different seasons are shown in fig 10 as shown in the figure there were more than twenty microorganisms associated with nitrogen removal in the system thermomonas rhodobacter terrimonas saccharibacteria and dechloromonas were the main denitrifying microorganisms in the system and their relative abundance could be maintained between 1 83 and 6 17 throughout the year among them thermomonas rhodobacter and terrimonas played the main role of denitrification in winter and the relative abundance of the three did not decrease due to low temperature and they reached 5 33 5 18 and 3 78 respectively which might be related to their special microbial properties scholars research shows that thermomonas a bacterium capable of both no3 n and no2 n reduction could secrete antifreeze intracellular polymers eps at low temperatures to maintain its normal reproductive metabolism 30 rhodobacter and terrimonas both had a certain cold adapted ability and could play a stable role in nitrogen removal 31 32 the system also contained denitrifying microorganisms such as gemmobacter phaeodactylibacter thauera steroidobacter and dokdonella which had a relative abundance remaining at more than 1 throughout the year the diverse and stable composition of denitrifying microorganisms guaranteed the stable nitrogen removal capacity of the system and proved that the system had a good tn removal performance ferribacterium and phaeodactylibacter were the main nitrifying microorganisms detected in the system 33 34 the relative abundances of ferribacterium and phaeodactylibacter were 2 75 3 96 2 75 2 19 and 1 48 2 25 1 68 and 1 76 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively it showed that temperature changes significantly affected the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria and the relative abundance of ferribacterium and phaeodactylibacter reduced by 1 77 and 0 49 respectively in winter and summer this probably was the main reason for the short term fluctuation of ammonia and nitrogen concentrations in the effluent during winter the main phosphorus removing bacteria in the system were thermomonas rhodobacter povalibacter and dechloromonas among them thermomonas rhodobacter and dechloromonas were typical types of dpaos they could perform in situ respiration to excessively absorb phosphorus from the environment by use of no3 n and no2 n and were also highly adapted to the environment 35 37 the relative abundance of thermomonas rhodobacter and dechloromonas could still reach 5 33 5 18 and 3 31 respectively in winter and they played the main role in phosphorus removal in the system povalibacter as one of the paos 38 had a relative abundance of 1 70 2 12 3 35 and 1 40 in spring summer autumn and winter respectively and the relative abundance of povalibacter decreased significantly with the decreasing temperature the results indicated that a phosphorus removal pathway dominated by denitrifying phosphorus removal and supplemented by traditional phosphorus removal might have been formed in the system the stabilization of dpaos in winter promoted the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal capabilities of the system making the system able to have a stable pollutant removal effect 3 5 influence of seasonal influence on the abundance of nitrogen metabolism related functional genes based on 16srrna high throughput sequencing data and with the picrust database the metabolic potential of the microbial communities were predicted we compared the results with the kegg database the influence of seasonal changes on the species and abundance of biological genes were explored to more intuitively show the changes made by microorganisms to adapt to water temperature changes fig 11 is the composition of nitrogen cycling related genes in the system with nh4 n as the starting point of the cycle nh4 n transformed into nh2oh under the action of amo and then participated in the nitrification reaction dominated by nar and the denitrification dominated by nap and nar no2 n was the transformation medium for the nitrogen valence state nas and nir therein played the roles of assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium anra and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra making no2 reduce to nh4 n both anra and dnra could reduce no3 n to nh4 n but the types of enzymes were different in the process anra occurred in an aerobic environment assimilating nh4 n into amino acids by energy dnra mainly occurred under anoxic or anaerobic conditions in the case of a sufficient carbon source and a low nh4 n concentration dnra was the primary way to remove no3 n in an anoxic environment 39 dnra did not require nad p h as an electron donor there was no organic nitrogen intermediate 40 the produced directly could not only provide a nitrogen source for the growth of dissimilatory nitrate reducing bacteria but also could be released to outside cells to provide a nitrogen source for the growth of nitrogen fixing denitrifying and other bacteria 41 some energy could also be used to oxidize organic compounds 39 next the abundance of functional genes obtained by sequencing was further compared to explore the influence of the changes in the abundance of functional genes on the pollutant removal effect fig 12 is the gene abundances of enzymes involved in n transformation in different seasons amo hao and nxr mainly acted in the nitrification reaction studies show that the ammonia activation of all known aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea was associated with amo 42 autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria consumed atp and reducing power to reduce co2 and its residual cellular material accounted for only 1 4 of heterotrophic bacteria 43 and coupled with its slow division and reproduction ability 44 it only accounted for a small proportion in the system but amo had a vigorous activity and as a result the ammonia oxidation ability was less affected by gene abundance 45 the amo operon was composed of three structural genes amoa amob and amoc 46 the genes involved in ammonia monooxygenase coding in this system consisted of amob and amoc and no amoa was detected amob and amoc accounted for 0 14 0 44 10 3 and 0 29 0 91 10 3 of the total abundance of gene expression respectively amoc was about twice as abundant as amob in winter when the water temperature was 8 c the abundance of both genes decreased to 0 14 10 3 and 0 29 10 3 respectively analysis suggested that the decrease in temperature might led to a decrease in the abundance of amob and amoc resulting in a reduction in nitrification capacity which was consistent with the previous analysis of fluctuations in ammonia nitrogen effluent in winter hydroxylamine generated by ammonia oxidation was an energization reaction most aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria saved energy in this way 47 the gene abundance of hao significantly correlated with seasons with the decrease in water temperature its abundance gradually decreased from 3 97 10 3 to 3 31 10 3 weakening the nitrification ability of the system in winter the no2 n oxidation participated by nxr was the last step of nitrification as the nxr between plasma membranes was highly similar to the gene corresponding to the nitrate reductase nar and both of them were homologous genes 39 so the sequencing results were presented together during the transition from summer to winter the abundance of nxr and nar increased somewhat when the winter water temperature was 8 c the abundances of nxr and nar reached the highest and the utilization of no3 n and no2 n by microorganisms increased in summary the oxidation process of ammonia and hydroxylamine mainly limited the nitrification ability in winter transforming liquid nitrogen into gaseous nitrogen by denitrification was the core of nitrogen element removal in sewage treatment denitrification mainly involves four types of nitrogen compound reductions including no3 n reduction participated by nar and nap no2 n reduction by nir no reduction by nor and n2o reduction by nos the composition of nitrate reductase was mainly divided into two categories one was the periplasmic nitrate reductase encoded by nap and located between the cytoplasm and cytomembrane which was less affected by oxygen concentration and could well play a role of aerobic denitrification the other was the membrane bound nitrate reductase encoded by nar and on the cell membrane which was sensitive to the concentration of oxygen molecules and preferentially expressed in hypoxia 48 different from other nitrogen reductase genes nitrate reductase genes were more diverse in species the total gene abundance in different seasons also reached 60 92 10 3 80 42 10 3 this was consistent with the microbial structure analysis whose results were that the denitrifying bacteria accounted for a higher proportion in the total number of microorganisms in the system nitrate reductase consisted of two subunits in the cytoplasm nargh a membrane bound subunits nari and nardj narg was considered as the functional marker gene for nar 49 the above mentioned nar genes had a higher abundance in winter than in summer with a growth as high as 1 48 10 3 3 09 10 3 unlike nar nap did not require energy for transporting the raw material no3 n and the product no2 n across the cell membrane 50 nap comprises napa and napb genes and the abundance of napa genes in the system was up to 5 25 10 3 through the coding effect of napa denitrifying bacteria could perform denitrification functions under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the characteristics of its preferential expression under aerobic conditions indicated that the system had the possibility of aerobic denitrification these anoxic and aerobic denitrification metabolic pathways reduced the nitric nitrogen concentration and strengthened the denitrification ability of the system therefore the winter nitrogen removal could be guaranteed and the nitrogen removal effect of the system was stabilized nitrite reductase mainly included the free cytochrome cd1 around cells and the free copper containing type in cells encoded by nirs and nirk respectively the nirs gene in the system wasn t detected in the system the nirk abundance decreased to 1 69 10 3 in winter indicating that the conversion of no2 n to no was affected somewhat nor was an extremely unstable membrane bound no reductase but it had a strong affinity for no making low no concentrations still catalytically reduced the norb gene encoded nor enzyme complexes and was a marker gene for nor enzyme 51 the nosz gene encoded the cuz catalytic group in n2o reductase and nosz was the current primary research gene nos was believed to be more sensitive to oxygen ph and sulfide than other nitrogen oxide reductase based on this noticeable sensitivity n2o environmental emission was completely attributed to the inhibition of nos in microorganisms 47 these two types of genes had specific adaptability to the changes in water temperature and the abundances of norb and nosz could increase by 6 77 10 3 and 2 79 10 3 respectively during the transformation from summer to winter therefore in the actual seasonal variation the reduction of no2 n might be the rate limiting step of the whole denitrification in addition the system also had some dnra and anra functions reducing no3 n to nh4 n the average abundance of representative nasa and narc genes in anra reached 21 82 10 3 and 41 82 10 3 respectively and that of representative nrb and nird genes in dnra reached 26 90 10 3 and 27 22 10 3 respectively all of them were high abundance levels in the system there were two possible reasons for the high abundance of anra genes one was that the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria in the reactor led to the diversification of nitrogen removal pathways the other was that there were both high dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations at the end of the aeration tank creating reaction conditions in summary by analyzing the changes in the abundance of vital functional genes in the nitrogen removal it can be seen that the overall gene abundance in nitrification was much lower than that in denitrification and it decreased significantly with the decrease in water temperature in addition considering that nitrification was the first step of the nitrogen removal so it was considered that the decline in the abundance of nitrification genes in winter might be the main reason for any decrease in the nitrogen removal the interaction between no2 n and no3 n was less affected by seasonal changes and the transformation methods were diversified aerobic and anoxic denitrification coexisted in the system reducing no2 n might be the rate limiting step in the whole denitrification in other nitrogen cycle pathways seasonal changes had no significant effect on n2o reduction no reduction dnra and anra the diverse nitrogen conversion pathways throughout the operation allowed the system to resist low temperatures and had a stable sewage treatment effect 3 6 influence of seasonal changes on the abundance of phosphorus transformation related genes the abundance of the variation in the abundance of functional enzymes involved in phosphorus transformation in different seasons is shown in the table 3 the abundance of the enzymes involved in phosphorus transformation changed relatively gently and the proportions in seasons were average biological phosphorus removal mechanism suggests that the phb decomposition and synthesis was a critical factor in characterizing the phosphorus removal capacity of microorganisms under anaerobic conditions polyphosphate and glycogen broke down to synthesize phb while releasing phosphorus under aerobic conditions paos broke down phb to release energy and take in phosphate specifically the enzymes corresponding to the synthesis and breakdown of phb were ec 3 1 1 75 and ec 2 3 1 respectively 52 the relative abundance of ec 3 1 1 75 in the system could reach 22 62 10 3 to 30 33 10 3 and that of ec 2 3 1 could reach 304 19 10 3 to 325 64 10 3 the stability of gene species and abundance of phosphorus removal enzymes in different seasons corresponded to the stability of the tp effluent of the system and the results indicated that the system had a strong phosphorus removal capacity 4 conclusions in the one year continuous operation the pilot scale high concentration activated sludge system was proven to be able to achieve stable and excellent nitrogen and phosphorus removal of low temperature municipal sewage in the cold region with an average annual influent temperature of 11 c the system could still achieve an annual average cod tp nh4 n and tn removal rate of 93 49 95 94 54 and 70 respectively the system could achieve the best nh4 n a and tn removal results in summer with an effluent concentration of 0 44 and 7 13 mg l respectively in winter it resulted in a simultaneous decrease in microbial abundance and diversity and the abundance of nitrifying bacteria such as ferribacterium decreased which improved in spring the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms and dpaos in the high concentration activated sludge system throughout the year ensured the low temperature denitrification and phosphorus removal capability of the system gene function prediction showed that the system had diverse nitrogen cycling genes and stable phosphorus related genes throughout the year while only the relative abundance of amob amoc hao and nirk genes decreased in winter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interestsor personal relationships that could have
