high purity helium gas 99 999 was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 10 ml min the spilt ratio was 5 1 the gc inlet temperature was 150 c whereas the oven temperature was initially held at 40 c for 2 min and then raised to 220 c at a rate of 10 c min a pure trap atomax teledyne tekmar usa was installed in front of the gc ms to extract voc compounds from a liquid sample these procedures of voc determination were analogous to the studies proposed by boczkaj researches 36 37 the sample volume was 15 ml and helium gas 99 999 was used as a carrier gas the purge time and flow rate were 7 min and 40 ml min respectively a mixture of six chemicals methanol ethanol acetaldehyde ipa acetone and mek was prepared as the stock solution for the calibration to allow the simultaneous measurement of six chemicals in solution the photodegradation of lmw organic compounds in aqueous solution by 185 nm uv irradiation was studied using a continuously operated column reactor two analytical methods were applied to determine the removal efficiency of a target organic compound and the degradation byproducts gc ms was used to quantitatively analyze the concentration of a target materials and intermediate byproducts the other method utilized a toc analyzer as shown in our previous report 33 toc analysis of the effluent stream of a uv irradiation reactor with a following ix column provides useful information on the concentration of the final degradation product co2 charged organic compounds cocs and noncharged organic compounds ncocs calculated using the following equations 2 c o 2 conc toc conc in feed water toc conc after uv reactor or ic conc after uv ic conc in feed water 3 coc toc conc an uv reactor toc conc after ix column 4 ncoc toc conc after ix column cocs are degradation byproducts of lmw organic compounds by 185 nm uv and have a negative charge at neutral ph due to a carboxyl group in their structure based on their charge cocs are removed easily by ix resin especially anion exchange resin in this study such compounds as formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid were assumed to be included in the cocs the formation of carboxyl acid was also reported as byproducts of organic degradation during treatment by aops 39 40 in the author s previous study of methanol and ipa degradation by 185 nm uv it was reported that the acetic acid and formic acid that were produced by uv irradiation were not detected in the sample from the effluent of ix resin 37 this result supports the hypothesis that organic compounds with carboxyl functional groups are completely removed by ix resin ncocs in this study refer to the chemicals that have no charge at neutral ph and are not removed by ix resin organic compounds containing hydroxyl aldehyde or ketone functional groups are considered as ncocs 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of methanol by uv irradiation fig 2 shows the degradation of methanol by uv irradiation methanol is known to be sequentially oxidized to formaldehyde and formic acid and finally to co2 24 the degradation experiments were performed at initial concentrations of 35 50 and 100 μg l as c the results of the gc ms and toc analyses are shown in fig 2a and b respectively approximately 60 68 of methanol was removed by 185 nm uv irradiation in the gc ms analysis see fig 2a whereas in the toc analysis 10 60 of the methanol was transformed to the final oxidation product co2 see fig 2b indicating that much of the methanol that was removed remained as intermediate byproducts such as formaldehyde and formic acid after uv irradiation although these chemicals were not analyzed specifically in this study the amount of formic acid can be assumed to be equivalent to the concentration of coc in fig 2b based on the hypothesis above however it was not possible to estimate the formaldehyde concentration using only the ncoc values that were calculated from the toc measurements because the ncocs contained the remained methanol and the produced formaldehyde in the methanol degradation experiment thus toc and gc ms analyses were performed to calculate the formaldehyde concentration in the effluent of the uv reactor 0 0 and 20 μg l as c at initial methanol concentrations of 35 50 and 100 μg l as c the ratio of co2 to byproducts was 20 7 9 8 μg l at the initial toc concentration of 30 μg l whereas it decreased with higher initial concentrations reaching 14 2 43 2 μg l at 100 μg l toc ie the production of co2 declined with increasing initial concentrations thus the uv dosage and retention time in the photodegradation of methanol are insufficient to achieve the complete degradation of methanol three compounds ethanol acetaldehyde and acetone were detected in the gc ms analysis as intermediate products of methanol degradation despite their concentrations being less than 1 5 μg l as c fig 2a this observation was unexpected because methanol is transformed by uv irradiation to more oxidized chemicals such as formaldehyde and formic acid rather than chemicals that contain 2 or 3 carbons in their chemical structure 24 unfortunately the formation mechanisms of these compounds were unable to be examined in this study further it was unknown whether all 3 chemicals were produced directly during the decomposition of methanol or whether the methanol was initially transformed into ethanol or ipa and then oxidized to acetaldehyde and acetone however there were studies reporting that ethylene glycol has been generated by recombining hydroxymethyl radicals in the photodegradation of methanol by 172 nm uv in an oxygen free solution 32 38 specifically heit et al 38 stated that the recombination of c centered radicals is favorable when organic materials are photodegraded by vuv in the absence of dissolved oxygen although the chemicals that were formed in their studies were not the same as those in this study the mechanism that has been proposed by heit et al 24 and robl et al 32 indirectly supports the formation of ethanol acetaldehyde and acetone that we observed 3 2 degradation of ethanol and acetaldehyde by uv irradiation figs 3 and 4 show the results of the photodegradation of ethanol and acetaldehyde by 185 nm uv fig 3 shows the results of the gc ms a and toc analysis b ethanol that was exposed to 185 nm uv is generally oxidized to acetaldehyde followed by acetic acid and co2 39 40 indicating that acetaldehyde is more oxidized form compared with ethanol thus the concentration of intermediate byproducts or the final product co2 during acetaldehyde degradation fig 4 might be high versus in the ethanol degradation experiment fig 3 with the same uv exposure this hypothesis was supported by the results that the percentage of co2 that was produced in ethanol degradation was 1 18 lower than the 8 25 during acetaldehyde degradation in addition coc production was 13 15 higher in aldehyde degradation compared to ethanol degradation comparing ethanol and acetaldehyde degradation at an initial concentration of 50 μg l as c the concentration of the ethanol and acetaldehyde that remained after 185 nm uv treatment was 9 8 μg l as c and 0 6 μg l as c respectively figs 3a and 4 a indicating that the photodegradation rate of acetaldehyde by 185 nm uv was faster than that of ethanol similar to what was reported by bianchi et al 39 additionally in the comparison of between ethanol and methanol degradation by gc ms analysis figs 2a and 3 a the removal rate of ethanol was much faster than methanol 35 μg l as c of ethanol was completely removed from the feed solution through the continuously operated uv column reactor whereas 30 of the methanol remained in the effluent of the uv reactor kim et al also reported that acetone had the highest degradation rate by 185 nm uv lightning in a batch test using without dissolve oxygen followed by ethanol and methanol 31 in the gc ms analysis acetaldehyde acetone and mek were also observed as byproducts in the degradation of ethanol the production of acetaldehyde was expected because ethanol initially transformed into acetaldehyde whereas acetone and mek were unanticipated in the pathway of ethanol degradation presented by bianchi et al 39 also in the degradation of acetaldehyde acetone and mek were also detected ranging in concentration from 0 to 1 3 μg l as c the formation of these unexpected intermediate byproducts such as acetone and mek implies that various unidentified reactions are involved in the degradation of lmw organic compounds by 185 nm uv irradiation 3 3 degradation of ipa and acetone by uv irradiation the results of the ipa and acetone degradation experiments are presented in figs 5 and 6 in the degradation of ipa fig 5a over 90 of the ipa in the influent of the uv reactor was transformed to byproducts and co2 in the gc analysis acetone was observed as a byproduct ranging in concentration from 10 to 61 μg l as c which was proportional to the 34 63 of ipa that was injected this result indicates that the oxidation rate of ipa to acetone was much faster than that of acetone to pyruvic aldehyde pyruvic acid or oxalic acid which are reported byproducts of acetone degradation 6 the relatively fast degradation of ipa compared to that of acetone can also be confirmed by directly comparing acetone degradation as well as ipa degradation figs 5 and 6 at an initial concentration of 100 μg l as c the removed ipa concentration and acetone concentration after uv irradiation was 90 and 47 μg l as c respectively which means the degradation rate of ipa was twice faster than that of acetone wu et al 7 reported similar results on the rapid decline in ipa and the accumulation of acetone at the early stage in the degradation of ipa using an ozone based aop during the oxidation of acetone the concentration of ncocs based on the toc analysis ranged from 12 to 56 μg l as c fig 6a which was almost same as the concentration of acetone in the gc ms analysis fig 6b it means that uncharged byproducts of acetone oxidation such as pyruvic aldehyde did not exist after the uv treatment since ncocs is the sum of the remained acetone and the produced uncharged byproduct in other word it can be presumed that the degradation rate of acetone was relatively slower than that of pyruvic aldehyde in the acetone degradation acetone reacted with hydroxyl radical was initially transformed to acetonyl radical by hydrogen abstraction and pyruvic acid oxalic acid acetic acid and formic acid was also observed as byproducts of acetone oxidation 6 they have a carboxyl functional group in their chemical structure resulting in a negative charge at neutral ph although these charged chemicals were not measured individually they were quantified in this study as cocs which was calculated to be 11 18 and 34 μg l at initial acetone concentrations of 30 50 and 100 μg l respectively fig 6b during acetone degradation more co2 was produced than during ipa degradation because the degradation steps from acetone to co2 was shorter than that from ipa to co2 3 4 degradation of mek by uv irradiation mek degradation by 185 nm uv was examined the results are presented in fig 7 in the gc ms analysis fig 7a 75 95 of the mek was degraded and acetone was detected as a byproduct despite the concentration of acetone being less than 3 μg l as c the noc centration was 5 5 43 μg l higher than the sum of the remained mek and the produced acetone indicating that other intermediate byproducts except acetone were present in the effluent of the uv reactor the coc concentration increased with increasing initial concentrations of mek 3 5 comparison of degradation characteristics the degradation efficiency and distribution of byproducts between chemicals were compared at an initial concentration of 100 μg l the chemical showing the highest rate of conversion to the final product of oxidation co2 was methanol followed by acetaldehyde and acetone it was expected because methanol contains one carbon atom and requires the fewest hydroxyl radials to convert to co2 further the amount of co2 that was generated from acetaldehyde and acetone was higher than with ethanol and ipa because acetaldehyde and acetone are more oxidized forms compared with ethanol and ipa however the fastest conversion was observed in the ipa degradation by 185 nm uv irradiation wherein 97 of the ipa was oxidized to acetone whereas acetone had the slowest oxidation rate of the six chemicals in the comparison of alcohol compounds methanol ethanol and ipa the efficiency of the conversion to co2 increased with decreasing the number of carbons whereas the degradation rate of alcohol to byproducts that contained an aldehyde or ketone group increased in the following order ipa ethanol and methanol overall in the comparison of intermediate byproducts the amount of cocs was higher than that of ncoc byproducts due to the slow conversion of chemicals that contained carboxyl groups to co2 on exposure to 185 nm uv the highest proportion of cocs was detected in the degradation of acetaldehyde followed by mek and ethanol as seen in table 1 the amount of cocs exceeded that of co2 supporting the installation of ix resin after toc reduction uv process in upw production system in general the concentration of tocs is significantly lower after toc reduction uv with ix resin than after toc reduction uv alone 4 conclusions the photodegradation of lmw organic compounds by 185 nm uv irradiation was examined using continuous flow column reactor six organic compounds methanol ethanol acetaldehyde ipa acetone and mek were selected as target compounds because they are frequently detected in the permeate of ro in upw production and have a molecular weight of 100 or less methanol had the highest conversion efficiency to the final oxidation product co2 compared with the other compounds because its degradation step by uv irradiation was short and simple the compounds with the fastest and slowest degradation rates were ipa and acetone respectively based on the gc ms analysis in a system composed of toc uv and ix resin the removal efficiency of toc was higher for chemicals with an aldehyde or ketone group than in those with alcohol also continuous flow experiments were conducted in different initial concentrations to provide useful engineering data for estimating removal efficiencies of lmw organic compounds in the design of toc reduction uv unit declaration of competing interest the author declare no conflict of interest

useful information on the concentration of the final degradation product co2 charged organic compounds cocs and noncharged organic compounds ncocs calculated using the following equations 2 c o 2 conc toc conc in feed water toc conc after uv reactor or ic conc after uv ic conc in feed water 3 coc toc conc an uv reactor toc conc after ix column 4 ncoc toc conc after ix column cocs are degradation byproducts of lmw organic compounds by 185 nm uv and have a negative charge at neutral ph due to a carboxyl group in their structure based on their charge cocs are removed easily by ix resin especially anion exchange resin in this study such compounds as formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid were assumed to be included in the cocs the formation of carboxyl acid was also reported as byproducts of organic degradation during treatment by aops 39 40 in the author s previous study of methanol and ipa degradation by 185 nm uv it was reported that the acetic acid and formic acid that were produced by uv irradiation were not detected in the sample from the effluent of ix resin 37 this result supports the hypothesis that organic compounds with carboxyl functional groups are completely removed by ix resin ncocs in this study refer to the chemicals that have no charge at neutral ph and are not removed by ix resin organic compounds containing hydroxyl aldehyde or ketone functional groups are considered as ncocs 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of methanol by uv irradiation fig 2 shows the degradation of methanol by uv irradiation methanol is known to be sequentially oxidized to formaldehyde and formic acid and finally to co2 24 the degradation experiments were performed at initial concentrations of 35 50 and 100 μg l as c the results of the gc ms and toc analyses are shown in fig 2a and b respectively approximately 60 68 of methanol was removed by 185 nm uv irradiation in the gc ms analysis see fig 2a whereas in the toc analysis 10 60 of the methanol was transformed to the final oxidation product co2 see fig 2b indicating that much of the methanol that was removed remained as intermediate byproducts such as formaldehyde and formic acid after uv irradiation although these chemicals were not analyzed specifically in this study the amount of formic acid can be assumed to be equivalent to the concentration of coc in fig 2b based on the hypothesis above however it was not possible to estimate the formaldehyde concentration using only the ncoc values that were calculated from the toc measurements because the ncocs contained the remained methanol and the produced formaldehyde in the methanol degradation experiment thus toc and gc ms analyses were performed to calculate the formaldehyde concentration in the effluent of the uv reactor 0 0 and 20 μg l as c at initial methanol concentrations of 35 50 and 100 μg l as c the ratio of co2 to byproducts was 20 7 9 8 μg l at the initial toc concentration of 30 μg l whereas it decreased with higher initial concentrations reaching 14 2 43 2 μg l at 100 μg l toc ie the production of co2 declined with increasing initial concentrations thus the uv dosage and retention time in the photodegradation of methanol are insufficient to achieve the complete degradation of methanol three compounds ethanol acetaldehyde and acetone were detected in the gc ms analysis as intermediate products of methanol degradation despite their concentrations being less than 1 5 μg l as c fig 2a this observation was unexpected because methanol is transformed by uv irradiation to more oxidized chemicals such as formaldehyde and formic acid rather than chemicals that contain 2 or 3 carbons in their chemical structure 24 unfortunately the formation mechanisms of these compounds were unable to be examined in this study further it was unknown whether all 3 chemicals were produced directly during the decomposition of methanol or whether the methanol was initially transformed into ethanol or ipa and then oxidized to acetaldehyde and acetone however there were studies reporting that ethylene glycol has been generated by recombining hydroxymethyl radicals in the photodegradation of methanol by 172 nm uv in an oxygen free solution 32 38 specifically heit et al 38 stated that the recombination of c centered radicals is favorable when organic materials are photodegraded by vuv in the absence of dissolved oxygen although the chemicals that were formed in their studies were not the same as those in this study the mechanism that has been proposed by heit et al 24 and robl et al 32 indirectly supports the formation of ethanol acetaldehyde and acetone that we observed 3 2 degradation of ethanol and acetaldehyde by uv irradiation figs 3 and 4 show the results of the photodegradation of ethanol and acetaldehyde by 185 nm uv fig 3 shows the results of the gc ms a and toc analysis b ethanol that was exposed to 185 nm uv is generally oxidized to acetaldehyde followed by acetic acid and co2 39 40 indicating that acetaldehyde is more oxidized form compared with ethanol thus the concentration of intermediate byproducts or the final product co2 during acetaldehyde degradation fig 4 might be high versus in the ethanol degradation experiment fig 3 with the same uv exposure this hypothesis was supported by the results that the percentage of co2 that was produced in ethanol degradation was 1 18 lower than the 8 25 during acetaldehyde degradation in addition coc production was 13 15 higher in aldehyde degradation compared to ethanol degradation comparing ethanol and acetaldehyde degradation at an initial concentration of 50 μg l as c the concentration of the ethanol and acetaldehyde that remained after 185 nm uv treatment was 9 8 μg l as c and 0 6 μg l as c respectively figs 3a and 4 a indicating that the photodegradation rate of acetaldehyde by 185 nm uv was faster than that of ethanol similar to what was reported by bianchi et al 39 additionally in the comparison of between ethanol and methanol degradation by gc ms analysis figs 2a and 3 a the removal rate of ethanol was much faster than methanol 35 μg l as c of ethanol was completely removed from the feed solution through the continuously operated uv column reactor whereas 30 of the methanol remained in the effluent of the uv reactor kim et al also reported that acetone had the highest degradation rate by 185 nm uv lightning in a batch test using without dissolve oxygen followed by ethanol and methanol 31 in the gc ms analysis acetaldehyde acetone and mek were also observed as byproducts in the degradation of ethanol the production of acetaldehyde was expected because ethanol initially transformed into acetaldehyde whereas acetone and mek were unanticipated in the pathway of ethanol degradation presented by bianchi et al 39 also in the degradation of acetaldehyde acetone and mek were also detected ranging in concentration from 0 to 1 3 μg l as c the formation of these unexpected intermediate byproducts such as acetone and mek implies that various unidentified reactions are involved in the degradation of lmw organic compounds by 185 nm uv irradiation 3 3 degradation of ipa and acetone by uv irradiation the results of the ipa and acetone degradation experiments are presented in figs 5 and 6 in the degradation of ipa fig 5a over 90 of the ipa in the influent of the uv reactor was transformed to byproducts and co2 in the gc analysis acetone was observed as a byproduct ranging in concentration from 10 to 61 μg l as c which was proportional to the 34 63 of ipa that was injected this result indicates that the oxidation rate of ipa to acetone was much faster than that of acetone to pyruvic aldehyde pyruvic acid or oxalic acid which are reported byproducts of acetone degradation 6 the relatively fast degradation of ipa compared to that of acetone can also be confirmed by directly comparing acetone degradation as well as ipa degradation figs 5 and 6 at an initial concentration of 100 μg l as c the removed ipa concentration and acetone concentration after uv irradiation was 90 and 47 μg l as c respectively which means the degradation rate of ipa was twice faster than that of acetone wu et al 7 reported similar results on the rapid decline in ipa and the accumulation of acetone at the early stage in the degradation of ipa using an ozone based aop during the oxidation of acetone the concentration of ncocs based on the toc analysis ranged from 12 to 56 μg l as c fig 6a which was almost same as the concentration of acetone in the gc ms analysis fig 6b it means that uncharged byproducts of acetone oxidation such as pyruvic aldehyde did not exist after the uv treatment since ncocs is the sum of the remained acetone and the produced uncharged byproduct in other word it can be presumed that the degradation rate of acetone was relatively slower than that of pyruvic aldehyde in the acetone degradation acetone reacted with hydroxyl radical was initially transformed to acetonyl radical by hydrogen abstraction and pyruvic acid oxalic acid acetic acid and formic acid was also observed as byproducts of acetone oxidation 6 they have a carboxyl functional group in their chemical structure resulting in a negative charge at neutral ph although these charged chemicals were not measured individually they were quantified in this study as cocs which was calculated to be 11 18 and 34 μg l at initial acetone concentrations of 30 50 and 100 μg l respectively fig 6b during acetone degradation more co2 was produced than during ipa degradation because the degradation steps from acetone to co2 was shorter than that from ipa to co2 3 4 degradation of mek by uv irradiation mek degradation by 185 nm uv was examined the results are presented in fig 7 in the gc ms analysis fig 7a 75 95 of the mek was degraded and acetone was detected as a byproduct despite the concentration of acetone being less than 3 μg l as c the noc centration was 5 5 43 μg l higher than the sum of the remained mek and the produced acetone indicating that other intermediate byproducts except acetone were present in the effluent of the uv reactor the coc concentration increased with increasing initial concentrations of mek 3 5 comparison of degradation characteristics the degradation efficiency and distribution of byproducts between chemicals were compared at an initial concentration of 100 μg l the chemical showing the highest rate of conversion to the final product of oxidation co2 was methanol followed by acetaldehyde and acetone it was expected because methanol contains one carbon atom and requires the fewest hydroxyl radials to convert to co2 further the amount of co2 that was generated from acetaldehyde and acetone was higher than with ethanol and ipa because acetaldehyde and acetone are more oxidized forms compared with ethanol and ipa however the fastest conversion was observed in the ipa degradation by 185 nm uv irradiation wherein 97 of the ipa was oxidized to acetone whereas acetone had the slowest oxidation rate of the six chemicals in the comparison of alcohol compounds methanol ethanol and ipa the efficiency of the conversion to co2 increased with decreasing the number of carbons whereas the degradation rate of alcohol to byproducts that contained an aldehyde or ketone group increased in the following order ipa ethanol and methanol overall in the comparison of intermediate byproducts the amount of cocs was higher than that of ncoc byproducts due to the slow conversion of chemicals that contained carboxyl groups to co2 on exposure to 185 nm uv the highest proportion of cocs was detected in the degradation of acetaldehyde followed by mek and ethanol as seen in table 1 the amount of cocs exceeded that of co2 supporting the installation of ix resin after toc reduction uv process in upw production system in general the concentration of tocs is significantly lower after toc reduction uv with ix resin than after toc reduction uv alone 4 conclusions the photodegradation of lmw organic compounds by 185 nm uv irradiation was examined using continuous flow column reactor six organic compounds methanol ethanol acetaldehyde ipa acetone and mek were selected as target compounds because they are frequently detected in the permeate of ro in upw production and have a molecular weight of 100 or less methanol had the highest conversion efficiency to the final oxidation product co2 compared with the other compounds because its degradation step by uv irradiation was short and simple the compounds with the fastest and slowest degradation rates were ipa and acetone respectively based on the gc ms analysis in a system composed of toc uv and ix resin the removal efficiency of toc was higher for chemicals with an aldehyde or ketone group than in those with alcohol also continuous flow experiments were conducted in different initial concentrations to provide useful engineering data for estimating removal efficiencies of lmw organic compounds in the design of toc reduction uv unit declaration of competing interest the author declare no conflict of interest 
13891,electrochemical oxidation eo process was investigated for decomposing ammonia in wastewater from semiconductor industry this wastewater typically contains high concentration of hydrogen peroxide as well as ammonia in nature as results of lab test the presence of hydrogen peroxide exhibited a significant negative effect on ammonia removal efficiency which was described by an oxidant scavenging reaction pathway with recurrence relationship hydrogen peroxide removal by activated carbon was proposed as a pretreatment of eo process not only for the enhancement of reaction rate but also for the stability of effluent quality as results of pilot test ammonia removal rates were enhanced 2 3 5 times after pretreatment in addition economic analysis results indicated that operating expense with pretreatment was about 60 of that without pretreatment which was about 30 less than that in conventional chlorination without addition of hazardous chemicals the suggested process has great potential for alternative to conventional chlorination in treatment of high strength ammonia wastewater from semiconductor industry keywords ammonia wastewater electro chemical oxidation hydrogen peroxide removal semiconductor wastewater 1 introduction wastewater from semiconductor industry generally contains high concentrations of ammonium fluoride phosphate because many organic and inorganic chemicals such as acids and bases photo resists and strippers are used for semiconductor manufacturing process in addition many rinsing and cleaning steps in manufacturing generate large amount of wastewater with high concentration of mixed chemicals especially ammonia nitrogen is harmful to aquatic ecosystems by facilitating oxygen depletion eutrophication and red tidal phenomena thus its concentration should be lowered to 10 20 mg l before discharge 1 2 the conventional treatment technology for treatment of ammonia wastewater includes biological nitrification denitrification air stripping breakpoint chlorination and ion exchange however these methods have many limitations due to large footprint high cost or use of toxic chemicals 3 the most common approach is breakpoint chlorination due to simplicity of design and operation but it has great deals of potential risks i e chemical leak to operators in exposure to hazardous sodium hypochlorite solution during storage and handling furthermore the use of this chemical is a burden in operating expense due to its huge consumption and expensiveness thus there are strong needs for alternative technologies without using hazardous chemicals the electrochemical oxidation eo technology has received growing attention and been successfully developed for its alternative use for wastewater treatment in several fields including drinking water disinfection municipal wastewater treatment and various industrial wastewater treatment 4 9 this process offers many advantages such as versatility automation environmental compatibility safety and potential cost effectiveness in contrast to the conventional breakpoint chlorination process the eo process generates oxidant for ammonia in situ from chloride salts and electricity without storage and handling of hazardous chemicals the major factors affecting ammonia removal rate in eo process include materials of electrodes salt concentrations and current density 10 11 generally salt concentrations and current density are recognized the major ones with positively effects on removal rates in eo process because increase in these factors promotes more production of oxidants until they reaches certain limit thus most of researches were focused on effects of factors with artificial wastewater because of complexity of unknown matrix in real wastewater 10 15 high strength ammonia wastewater in semiconductor industry is produced during cleaning of wafer with a standard cleaning solution aqueous solution of nh4oh and h2o2 as a post cmp chemical mechanical polishing process 17 18 thus this wastewater mainly composed of high concentration of ammonia up to several hundred parts per millions and hydrogen peroxide the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in ammonia wastewater up to several thousand parts per millions in this study is rarely reported in literatures because effect of hydrogen peroxide one of the characteristics in semiconductor wastewater matrix on performance of eo process has not been explored so far if hydrogen peroxide is presented in wastewater one can design eo process in two different ways depending on its concentration 1 if concentration of hydrogen peroxide and its effect on ammonia removal rate are negligible removal of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide simultaneously during eo process would be reasonable 2 if they are significant design of pretreatment process for removal of hydrogen peroxide would desirable by the activity of catalyst hydrogen peroxide could be reduced to water and oxygen gas as follows 1 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 the commercially available methods include use of various catalysts for removal such as hydrogen peroxide removing catalase manganese oxides and activated carbon 16 18 20 in this study authors investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide in wastewater on ammonia removal rate and its reaction pathway in eo process for the treatment of semiconductor wastewater furthermore a pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide removal was suggested and benefits of this combined process were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of wastewater ammonia wastewater was obtained from a local semiconductor manufacturer korea characteristics of the wastewater are enlisted in table 1 wastewater from electronics industry typically contains significant amount of ammonia nitrogen 700 800 mg l with high alkalinity ph 10 the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in ammonia wastewater was up to 6000 mg l in fig 2 a the ion compositions of wastewater are suitable for electrochemical oxidation without much scaling according to calcium and magnesium ions and negative effects on electrode lifetime according to fluoride ion according to electrode manufacturer s guideline the electrical conductivity and chloride concentration was very low which requires addition of sodium chloride as electrolyte and source of oxidant 2 2 lab test mesh type electrodes 95 mm x 140 mm were supplied by ecotech engineering korea titanium coated with iro2 was chosen as anode and titanium as a cathode as a result of preliminary screening test for ammonia removal electrodes were sonicated for 10 min to remove any deposits and then washed several times with mili q water prior to use sodium chloride 99 daejung was used as electrolyte to promote electrical conductivity of solution hydrogen peroxide 35 sigma aldrich was used for increasing initial concentrations in wastewater effects of hydrogen peroxide concentration salt concentration and current density were investigated in an 8 l batch reactor with a module composed of 3 anodes and 5 cathodes the gap between the electrodes was set to 1 cm electrolysis of wastewater was performed with current of 2 5 4 0 a dm2 and 0 5 2 0 wt of sodium chloride 2 3 assessment of electrode lifetime electrode lifetime was assessed with small coupons 20 50 mm of anode and cathode one mol of sulfuric acid was used as electrolyte stored in 5 l of reactor the coupons were dipped in the solution and connected to the power supply 10 a of electric current was fed to the electrodes from a power supply connected to data acquisition system won a tech korea which records voltage changes with time interval the reactor was stored in the water bath to maintain temperature of 25 the estimated electrode lifetime was used for calculation of electrode replacement cost the operating expense was calculated based on power cost salt cost and electrode replacement cost 2 4 pilot test continuous electrolysis of the semiconductor wastewater was performed in an eo reactor under galvano static conditions as described in fig 1 the eo reactor holds 330 l of wastewater and it has 3 baffles to accommodate plug flow in 4 cells 12 anodes and 13 cathodes were installed in each cell with sets of spacers to maintain uniform gap between electrodes 1 cm a 10 l of tower packed with activated carbon row 0 8 cat norit was installed as a pretreatment for removal of hydrogen peroxide with a bypass to deliver wastewater with or without hydrogen peroxide wastewater from a feed tank 1000 l was fed to the eo reactor by a tube pump to adjust 50 160 l hr electric currents were supplied by a power supply dc 1000 a x 10 v the voltages were recorded for the calculation of electrical power usage 2 5 sampling and analysis samples were periodically taken from the reactor for analysis the changes in voltages were monitored for the calculation of electrical power usage at each sampling event concentration of ammonia was quantified with a spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach according to the standard methods 19 21 concentration of hydrogen peroxide was determined by chemets kit k 5510 chemetrics inc usa and spectrometer the ph temperature and conductivity were monitored using a ph meter model 215 model d 53 horiba japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydrogen peroxide in wastewater the effects of hydrogen peroxide on ammonia removal during electrolysis of wastewater were investigated with different amount of hydrogen peroxide addition 0 2000 4000 and 6000 mg l test results in fig 2b indicated that ammonia removal rates were lagged as concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased especially ammonia removal rate during 60 min were significantly reduced at high concentrations 4000 and 6000 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the relation between concentration of hydrogen peroxide 6000 mg l and ammonia were described in fig 2c at the beginning concentration of ammonia decreased very slowly with time while that of hydrogen peroxide did rapidly after hydrogen peroxide removed almost completely ammonia concentration decreased significantly with time with these investigations reaction mechanism in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide was proposed at the anode chloride ion cl became ocl through reaction the following reactions 2 2 c l c l 2 2 e 3 c l 2 h 2 o h o c l h c l 4 h o c l h o c l in the absence of hydrogen peroxide ammonia is mainly oxidized by ocl to form nitrogen gas as follows 5 2 n h 3 2 o c l n 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 c l in the literature it was reported that there are several chemicals for dechlorination such as ascorbic acid oxalic acid hydrogen peroxide nitrite and sodium thiosulfate 20 22 the oxidant ocl for ammonia can be reduced to chloride ion by hydrogen peroxide if it existed in wastewater with the following reaction 6 o c l h 2 o 2 c l o 2 h 2 o the stoichiometric ratio of cl to h2o2 and ocl to h2o2 are about 1 0 and 1 5 w w respectively if concentration of hydrogen peroxide is 6000 mg l significant amount of oxidant 6 000 7 000 mg l assuming conversion efficiency of 70 80 produced from 1 nacl solution about 6000 mg l of cl would be reduced to chloride ions this explains the deviation from zero order reaction in 4000 and 6000 mg l h2o2 in fig 2b the reduced chloride ions by hydrogen peroxide became ocl ion again by reactions 2 4 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide the reaction pathway goes toward reaction 6 rather than go to reaction 5 because of the faster rate in reaction 6 as observed in fig 2c in literatures it was reported that the kinetics of reaction 5 followed the zero order 10 rate constant of 4 0 mg l min in this study and reaction 6 followed the 1st order rate constant of 0 0434 min 1 in this study 21 23 when the hydrogen peroxide is almost completely removed the reaction goes toward 5 instead of reaction 6 this recurrence relationship is described in scheme 1 3 2 effects of salt concentrations and current densities effects of salt concentrations and current densities on ammonia removal rates were investigated to determine operation conditions in pilot test prior to the experiments hydrogen peroxide in wastewater was removed by passing through activated carbon column as concentration of hydrogen peroxide was an important factor for ammonia removal rate the changes of ammonia concentrations were described in fig 3 a 3f with time under different salt concentrations nacl 0 5 2 0 and current densities 2 5 4 0 a dm2 ammonia removal rates were estimated by zero order kinetics depicted in dotted line in figures as follows 8 k δ c δ t c 0 c t t t 0 where c0 and ct are ammonia concentrations mg l at t0 and t t0 and t are time zero minute and time at the lowest ammonia concentration higher than 1 mg l from sample the effects of initial ammonia concentration on removal rate were examined after spikes of ammonium hydroxide in fig 3e the slopes as ammonia removal rates were almost constant irrespective of initial ammonia concentration ranging from 600 to 1000 mg l therefore ammonia removal in wastewater containing less than 1000 mg l of ammonia can be described with zero order kinetics in figs 3a 3d higher current densities and salt concentrations tend to increase ammonia removal rate by electrolysis of ammonia wastewater except the case when current density was 4 a dm2 and salt concentration was 1 0 of nacl the possible reason is that salt concentration was not sufficient to accommodate high current density which leads to a reduced electrochemical oxidation efficiency ammonia removal rate is an important indicator to determine sizing of eo reactor ammonia removal rate had an increasing tendency as current density and salt concentrations 3 3 pilot test the benefits of enhanced eo process with pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide were investigated by pilot test the salt concentration nacl 1 0 and current density 3 a dm2 were determined to minimize operation condition in section 3 3 fig 4 a shows the effect of pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide under different hrts the trials without hydrogen peroxide removal showed significant concentrations of ammonia 264 157 mg l in effluent after 3 h in hrt of 4 h ammonia concentration in effluent became less 0 03 29 mg l but did not keep stable ammonia concentration when hydrogen peroxide was removed by pretreatment ammonia was completely removed within shorter hrt 2 5 h in complete removal of ammonia ammonia removal rate could be underestimated thus ammonia removal rate was calculated under a lower hrt 2 h ammonia removal rates k without pretreatment ranged from 1 49 to 2 35 mg l min while those with pretreatment did from 4 63 to 5 29 mg l min with calculated ammonia removal rate the required hrt τd for design condition influent ammonia concentration cd 800 mg l was calculated as follows 13 τ d c d k calculated hrts were from 2 5 to 2 9 h with pretreatment and from 5 7 9 0 h without pretreatment respectively in worst case eo reactor size without pretreatment would be about 3 times larger than that with pretreatment in worst case these results demonstrated the importance of pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide in eo process the required hrts for removal of 800 mg nh3 n l was less than 3 h thus continuous operations of eo process with pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide were performed under 3 h of hrt the concentration of ammonia in the feed were varied 500 600 mg l the ammonia concentrations in effluent were constantly less than 0 5 mg nh3 n l with 3 h of hrt during about 2 weeks during this operation concentration of ammonia in the feed was below the design condition 800 mg nh3 n l in the feed thus ammonia concentration was elevated with spike of ammonium hydroxide in the feed tank ammonia concentration in the feed was adjusted to about 800 1100 mg l pilot was operated for evaluation of the upper limit of influent ammonia concentration with 3 h of hrt the ammonia removed by eo process in 3 h of hrt was differences in ammonia concentration between influent and effluent ranged from 784 1014 mg l in fig 4b the required hrt τd depends on the required ammonia concentration in effluent hrt of 3 h can be determined if target ammonia concentration in effluent is about 5 mg l 3 4 economic evaluation 3 4 1 pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide removal to find an economical option for hydrogen peroxide removal the operating expense of catalase and activated carbon were calculated with sample case for capacity of 1000 m3 d in table 2 as a result of a column test with activated carbon data not shown 5 h 1 of specific velocity of was determined for removal of up to 6000 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the required volume of activated carbon was calculated by design capacity qd divided by space velocity v with a safety factor 120 7 v o l u m e o f a c i v a t e d c a r b o n q d v s a f e t y f a c t o r thus two including one standby 10 m3 of activated carbon towers were considered for calculation the assumption was made for replacement of activated carbon which will be fully replaced every 1 year the catalase dosing rate 2400 mg l was provided from supplier for removing 6000 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the required amount of catalase was calculated by multiplication of design capacity and dosing rate the unit price of catalase and activated carbon were 2 kg and 3 kg as quoted from supplier the operating expense of activated carbon was 60 000 year while that of catalase was 1 752 000 the activated carbon is an economical choice about one thirtieth compared with catalase for pretreatment of hydrogen peroxide in ammonia wastewater from electronic industry therefore this option was included in pilot test setup as described in fig 1 3 4 2 determination of operation conditions the reasonable choice of operating condition will be at minimizing operational cost operational costs of eo process in ammonia wastewater were calculated in order to determine current density and salt concentration several assumptions were made to calculate operation cost of electrochemical oxidation of ammonia wastewater the design capacity of eo process was assumed to be 1000 m3 d for the treatment of wastewater containing 800 mg l of ammonia cd the operational cost includes cost of salt addition electricity consumed and replacement of electrodes the cost of salt addition was calculated by multiplication of total amount of salt and unit price of salt as described in the following 9 c o s t o f s a l t c s q d u n i t c o s t o f s a l t where cs and qd are salt concentration and design capacity the required time tr to remove ammonia in wastewater is calculated using ammonia removal rate k described in fig 3f as follows 10 t r c d k the integral averaged voltage va was calculated by measured voltages vi in each measurement with time during lab batch experiment in the following equation 11 v a 0 t r v i d t t r electric power cost was estimated by the product of applied current i average voltage va measured during required time to meet target ammonia concentration 12 p o w e r c o s t i v a t r u n i t p o w e r c o s t the unit price of salt and electricity were 0 12 kg and 0 08 kwh respectively the electrode replacement costs depending on assumed lifetimes 2 5 years 5 years and 10 years were provided by electrode supplier the calculated operation costs relative to salt concentrations and current densities with different electrode lifetimes were described in table 3 as results the operating cost at current density of 3 a dm2 and salt concentration of 1 0 wt was the minimum irrespective of electrode lifetimes ranged from 2 5 10 years thus this current density and salt concentration was used as operation conditions in the pilot test 3 4 3 estimation of electrode lifetime and operation cost operation cost of the process was determined after consideration of electrode lifetime test results and averaged power consumption measured during pilot test electrode manufacturers and researchers have their own procedures and correlation equations for evaluation of electrode lifetime the lifetime of electrode was assessed in accelerated condition with a small coupon of electrode as following relationship 14 l i f e t i m e o f e l e c t r o d e t t j a j s s a f e t y f a c t o r where tt is the time required for replacement at specific voltage ja is the current density in accelerated conditions and js is the current density in normal operating condition the electrode manufacturer recommended replacement of anodes when applied voltage e increased to 1 5 times of initial voltage e0 the accelerated condition was 100 a dm2 and normal operation condition is 3 a dm2 as determined previously the multiplication ratio is 33 3 in this acceleration condition the changes in voltages and relative ratio e e0 during test under accelerated condition were depicted in fig 5 tt is obtained from the figure according to followings relationship 15 e tt e 0 1 5 the time tt to reach 1 5 times of initial voltage were 65 days in first trial and 74 days in second trial 33 3 times of these values give expected lifetime of 5 9 and 6 8 years considering 10 20 of safety factor electrode life time is determined to be 5 years with this electrode lifetime operating cost was estimated to be 4 23 m3 which is composed of 61 of power cost 28 of cost for electrolyte salt and 11 of electrode replacement cost this information would be useful for one who wants to optimize operation conditions of eo reactor the salt concentration and current density could be determined without electrode lifetime estimation unless extremely expensive electrodes were used if portion of electrode replacement cost is considerable electrode life time tests should be performed under different current densities power cost was re calculated using average voltage 4 v measured from pilot test instead of that in lab test 3 2 v after consideration of increase in power cost and pretreatment cost 0 16 m3 the operating expense became 5 03 m3 if pretreatment was not included in the process required hrt and power cost would be more than doubled at the best case in this case the operating expense of eo would be more than 8 08 m3 which is about 40 saving in operational cost 3 4 4 comparison with breakpoint chlorination bc effluent samples were taken from existing bc process in wastewater facility and from eo pilot plant with pretreatment respectively analysis results of the effluent samples were enlisted in table 1 ammonia concentration and ph in effluent of eo process were similar to bc process however electrical conductivity in eo process is about 45 less than that in bc process the electrical conductivity is mainly composed of chloride ion and sulfate ion the concentration of sulfate in effluent was significantly increased after bc process from 18 4 to 4588 mg l while almost no difference after eo process this increase was caused by the addition of sulfuric acid to maintain ph of 6 8 5 in bc process because addition of alkali sodium hypochlorite increased ph sulfuric acid was not used in eo process due to almost neutral ph of effluent from eo reactor in addition the concentration of chloride ion after eo process 5343 mg l was much lower than that after bc process 8470 mg l in bc process sodium hypochlorite solution was injected in excess of theoretical required value in eo process it was inferred that less oxidants produced in situ from salt than bc process were used to decompose ammonia this result implied that the suggested eo process with pretreatment can decompose ammonia more efficiently without addition of hazardous chemical such as sodium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid furthermore the suggested eo process is more economical than bc process the estimated operating expense in eo process 5 03 m3 from previous section was about 70 of that in bc process 7 01 m3 from semiconductor manufacturer 3 5 discussions more studies for the further improvement of the suggested process are expected with activated carbon based pretreatment implementation of automatic control for eo process would be easier because effluent quality is more stable without oxidant scavenger however it would be challenging tasks for the correlation of sensor with controlling logic the concept of this process could be extended to other applications in treatment of wastewater containing oxidant scavenger such as ascorbic acid oxalic acid nitrite and sodium thiosulfate in addition the conventional post treatment of eo process for removal of oxidant free chlorine is by the addition of sodium bisulfate it would be interesting the replacement of this chemical dosing system with chemical free system such as another activated carbon tower 4 conclusions in this study eo process with pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide removal was suggested for treatment of high strength ammonia wastewater in electronics industry the oxidant scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide typically existed in wastewater from electronics wastewater was found and reaction pathways with recurrence relationships were described a pretreatment process using activated carbon was proposed for not only enhancing ammonia removal rate but also stable effluent quality the benefits of this process were demonstrated in pilot operation the ammonia removal rates with pretreatment of hydrogen peroxide were 2 3 5 times of that without pretreatment being compared with conventional chlorination this process is economic 70 of breakpoint

13891,electrochemical oxidation eo process was investigated for decomposing ammonia in wastewater from semiconductor industry this wastewater typically contains high concentration of hydrogen peroxide as well as ammonia in nature as results of lab test the presence of hydrogen peroxide exhibited a significant negative effect on ammonia removal efficiency which was described by an oxidant scavenging reaction pathway with recurrence relationship hydrogen peroxide removal by activated carbon was proposed as a pretreatment of eo process not only for the enhancement of reaction rate but also for the stability of effluent quality as results of pilot test ammonia removal rates were enhanced 2 3 5 times after pretreatment in addition economic analysis results indicated that operating expense with pretreatment was about 60 of that without pretreatment which was about 30 less than that in conventional chlorination without addition of hazardous chemicals the suggested process has great potential for alternative to conventional chlorination in treatment of high strength ammonia wastewater from semiconductor industry keywords ammonia wastewater electro chemical oxidation hydrogen peroxide removal semiconductor wastewater 1 introduction wastewater from semiconductor industry generally contains high concentrations of ammonium fluoride phosphate because many organic and inorganic chemicals such as acids and bases photo resists and strippers are used for semiconductor manufacturing process in addition many rinsing and cleaning steps in manufacturing generate large amount of wastewater with high concentration of mixed chemicals especially ammonia nitrogen is harmful to aquatic ecosystems by facilitating oxygen depletion eutrophication and red tidal phenomena thus its concentration should be lowered to 10 20 mg l before discharge 1 2 the conventional treatment technology for treatment of ammonia wastewater includes biological nitrification denitrification air stripping breakpoint chlorination and ion exchange however these methods have many limitations due to large footprint high cost or use of toxic chemicals 3 the most common approach is breakpoint chlorination due to simplicity of design and operation but it has great deals of potential risks i e chemical leak to operators in exposure to hazardous sodium hypochlorite solution during storage and handling furthermore the use of this chemical is a burden in operating expense due to its huge consumption and expensiveness thus there are strong needs for alternative technologies without using hazardous chemicals the electrochemical oxidation eo technology has received growing attention and been successfully developed for its alternative use for wastewater treatment in several fields including drinking water disinfection municipal wastewater treatment and various industrial wastewater treatment 4 9 this process offers many advantages such as versatility automation environmental compatibility safety and potential cost effectiveness in contrast to the conventional breakpoint chlorination process the eo process generates oxidant for ammonia in situ from chloride salts and electricity without storage and handling of hazardous chemicals the major factors affecting ammonia removal rate in eo process include materials of electrodes salt concentrations and current density 10 11 generally salt concentrations and current density are recognized the major ones with positively effects on removal rates in eo process because increase in these factors promotes more production of oxidants until they reaches certain limit thus most of researches were focused on effects of factors with artificial wastewater because of complexity of unknown matrix in real wastewater 10 15 high strength ammonia wastewater in semiconductor industry is produced during cleaning of wafer with a standard cleaning solution aqueous solution of nh4oh and h2o2 as a post cmp chemical mechanical polishing process 17 18 thus this wastewater mainly composed of high concentration of ammonia up to several hundred parts per millions and hydrogen peroxide the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in ammonia wastewater up to several thousand parts per millions in this study is rarely reported in literatures because effect of hydrogen peroxide one of the characteristics in semiconductor wastewater matrix on performance of eo process has not been explored so far if hydrogen peroxide is presented in wastewater one can design eo process in two different ways depending on its concentration 1 if concentration of hydrogen peroxide and its effect on ammonia removal rate are negligible removal of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide simultaneously during eo process would be reasonable 2 if they are significant design of pretreatment process for removal of hydrogen peroxide would desirable by the activity of catalyst hydrogen peroxide could be reduced to water and oxygen gas as follows 1 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 the commercially available methods include use of various catalysts for removal such as hydrogen peroxide removing catalase manganese oxides and activated carbon 16 18 20 in this study authors investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide in wastewater on ammonia removal rate and its reaction pathway in eo process for the treatment of semiconductor wastewater furthermore a pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide removal was suggested and benefits of this combined process were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of wastewater ammonia wastewater was obtained from a local semiconductor manufacturer korea characteristics of the wastewater are enlisted in table 1 wastewater from electronics industry typically contains significant amount of ammonia nitrogen 700 800 mg l with high alkalinity ph 10 the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in ammonia wastewater was up to 6000 mg l in fig 2 a the ion compositions of wastewater are suitable for electrochemical oxidation without much scaling according to calcium and magnesium ions and negative effects on electrode lifetime according to fluoride ion according to electrode manufacturer s guideline the electrical conductivity and chloride concentration was very low which requires addition of sodium chloride as electrolyte and source of oxidant 2 2 lab test mesh type electrodes 95 mm x 140 mm were supplied by ecotech engineering korea titanium coated with iro2 was chosen as anode and titanium as a cathode as a result of preliminary screening test for ammonia removal electrodes were sonicated for 10 min to remove any deposits and then washed several times with mili q water prior to use sodium chloride 99 daejung was used as electrolyte to promote electrical conductivity of solution hydrogen peroxide 35 sigma aldrich was used for increasing initial concentrations in wastewater effects of hydrogen peroxide concentration salt concentration and current density were investigated in an 8 l batch reactor with a module composed of 3 anodes and 5 cathodes the gap between the electrodes was set to 1 cm electrolysis of wastewater was performed with current of 2 5 4 0 a dm2 and 0 5 2 0 wt of sodium chloride 2 3 assessment of electrode lifetime electrode lifetime was assessed with small coupons 20 50 mm of anode and cathode one mol of sulfuric acid was used as electrolyte stored in 5 l of reactor the coupons were dipped in the solution and connected to the power supply 10 a of electric current was fed to the electrodes from a power supply connected to data acquisition system won a tech korea which records voltage changes with time interval the reactor was stored in the water bath to maintain temperature of 25 the estimated electrode lifetime was used for calculation of electrode replacement cost the operating expense was calculated based on power cost salt cost and electrode replacement cost 2 4 pilot test continuous electrolysis of the semiconductor wastewater was performed in an eo reactor under galvano static conditions as described in fig 1 the eo reactor holds 330 l of wastewater and it has 3 baffles to accommodate plug flow in 4 cells 12 anodes and 13 cathodes were installed in each cell with sets of spacers to maintain uniform gap between electrodes 1 cm a 10 l of tower packed with activated carbon row 0 8 cat norit was installed as a pretreatment for removal of hydrogen peroxide with a bypass to deliver wastewater with or without hydrogen peroxide wastewater from a feed tank 1000 l was fed to the eo reactor by a tube pump to adjust 50 160 l hr electric currents were supplied by a power supply dc 1000 a x 10 v the voltages were recorded for the calculation of electrical power usage 2 5 sampling and analysis samples were periodically taken from the reactor for analysis the changes in voltages were monitored for the calculation of electrical power usage at each sampling event concentration of ammonia was quantified with a spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach according to the standard methods 19 21 concentration of hydrogen peroxide was determined by chemets kit k 5510 chemetrics inc usa and spectrometer the ph temperature and conductivity were monitored using a ph meter model 215 model d 53 horiba japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydrogen peroxide in wastewater the effects of hydrogen peroxide on ammonia removal during electrolysis of wastewater were investigated with different amount of hydrogen peroxide addition 0 2000 4000 and 6000 mg l test results in fig 2b indicated that ammonia removal rates were lagged as concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased especially ammonia removal rate during 60 min were significantly reduced at high concentrations 4000 and 6000 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the relation between concentration of hydrogen peroxide 6000 mg l and ammonia were described in fig 2c at the beginning concentration of ammonia decreased very slowly with time while that of hydrogen peroxide did rapidly after hydrogen peroxide removed almost completely ammonia concentration decreased significantly with time with these investigations reaction mechanism in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide was proposed at the anode chloride ion cl became ocl through reaction the following reactions 2 2 c l c l 2 2 e 3 c l 2 h 2 o h o c l h c l 4 h o c l h o c l in the absence of hydrogen peroxide ammonia is mainly oxidized by ocl to form nitrogen gas as follows 5 2 n h 3 2 o c l n 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 c l in the literature it was reported that there are several chemicals for dechlorination such as ascorbic acid oxalic acid hydrogen peroxide nitrite and sodium thiosulfate 20 22 the oxidant ocl for ammonia can be reduced to chloride ion by hydrogen peroxide if it existed in wastewater with the following reaction 6 o c l h 2 o 2 c l o 2 h 2 o the stoichiometric ratio of cl to h2o2 and ocl to h2o2 are about 1 0 and 1 5 w w respectively if concentration of hydrogen peroxide is 6000 mg l significant amount of oxidant 6 000 7 000 mg l assuming conversion efficiency of 70 80 produced from 1 nacl solution about 6000 mg l of cl would be reduced to chloride ions this explains the deviation from zero order reaction in 4000 and 6000 mg l h2o2 in fig 2b the reduced chloride ions by hydrogen peroxide became ocl ion again by reactions 2 4 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide the reaction pathway goes toward reaction 6 rather than go to reaction 5 because of the faster rate in reaction 6 as observed in fig 2c in literatures it was reported that the kinetics of reaction 5 followed the zero order 10 rate constant of 4 0 mg l min in this study and reaction 6 followed the 1st order rate constant of 0 0434 min 1 in this study 21 23 when the hydrogen peroxide is almost completely removed the reaction goes toward 5 instead of reaction 6 this recurrence relationship is described in scheme 1 3 2 effects of salt concentrations and current densities effects of salt concentrations and current densities on ammonia removal rates were investigated to determine operation conditions in pilot test prior to the experiments hydrogen peroxide in wastewater was removed by passing through activated carbon column as concentration of hydrogen peroxide was an important factor for ammonia removal rate the changes of ammonia concentrations were described in fig 3 a 3f with time under different salt concentrations nacl 0 5 2 0 and current densities 2 5 4 0 a dm2 ammonia removal rates were estimated by zero order kinetics depicted in dotted line in figures as follows 8 k δ c δ t c 0 c t t t 0 where c0 and ct are ammonia concentrations mg l at t0 and t t0 and t are time zero minute and time at the lowest ammonia concentration higher than 1 mg l from sample the effects of initial ammonia concentration on removal rate were examined after spikes of ammonium hydroxide in fig 3e the slopes as ammonia removal rates were almost constant irrespective of initial ammonia concentration ranging from 600 to 1000 mg l therefore ammonia removal in wastewater containing less than 1000 mg l of ammonia can be described with zero order kinetics in figs 3a 3d higher current densities and salt concentrations tend to increase ammonia removal rate by electrolysis of ammonia wastewater except the case when current density was 4 a dm2 and salt concentration was 1 0 of nacl the possible reason is that salt concentration was not sufficient to accommodate high current density which leads to a reduced electrochemical oxidation efficiency ammonia removal rate is an important indicator to determine sizing of eo reactor ammonia removal rate had an increasing tendency as current density and salt concentrations 3 3 pilot test the benefits of enhanced eo process with pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide were investigated by pilot test the salt concentration nacl 1 0 and current density 3 a dm2 were determined to minimize operation condition in section 3 3 fig 4 a shows the effect of pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide under different hrts the trials without hydrogen peroxide removal showed significant concentrations of ammonia 264 157 mg l in effluent after 3 h in hrt of 4 h ammonia concentration in effluent became less 0 03 29 mg l but did not keep stable ammonia concentration when hydrogen peroxide was removed by pretreatment ammonia was completely removed within shorter hrt 2 5 h in complete removal of ammonia ammonia removal rate could be underestimated thus ammonia removal rate was calculated under a lower hrt 2 h ammonia removal rates k without pretreatment ranged from 1 49 to 2 35 mg l min while those with pretreatment did from 4 63 to 5 29 mg l min with calculated ammonia removal rate the required hrt τd for design condition influent ammonia concentration cd 800 mg l was calculated as follows 13 τ d c d k calculated hrts were from 2 5 to 2 9 h with pretreatment and from 5 7 9 0 h without pretreatment respectively in worst case eo reactor size without pretreatment would be about 3 times larger than that with pretreatment in worst case these results demonstrated the importance of pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide in eo process the required hrts for removal of 800 mg nh3 n l was less than 3 h thus continuous operations of eo process with pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide were performed under 3 h of hrt the concentration of ammonia in the feed were varied 500 600 mg l the ammonia concentrations in effluent were constantly less than 0 5 mg nh3 n l with 3 h of hrt during about 2 weeks during this operation concentration of ammonia in the feed was below the design condition 800 mg nh3 n l in the feed thus ammonia concentration was elevated with spike of ammonium hydroxide in the feed tank ammonia concentration in the feed was adjusted to about 800 1100 mg l pilot was operated for evaluation of the upper limit of influent ammonia concentration with 3 h of hrt the ammonia removed by eo process in 3 h of hrt was differences in ammonia concentration between influent and effluent ranged from 784 1014 mg l in fig 4b the required hrt τd depends on the required ammonia concentration in effluent hrt of 3 h can be determined if target ammonia concentration in effluent is about 5 mg l 3 4 economic evaluation 3 4 1 pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide removal to find an economical option for hydrogen peroxide removal the operating expense of catalase and activated carbon were calculated with sample case for capacity of 1000 m3 d in table 2 as a result of a column test with activated carbon data not shown 5 h 1 of specific velocity of was determined for removal of up to 6000 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the required volume of activated carbon was calculated by design capacity qd divided by space velocity v with a safety factor 120 7 v o l u m e o f a c i v a t e d c a r b o n q d v s a f e t y f a c t o r thus two including one standby 10 m3 of activated carbon towers were considered for calculation the assumption was made for replacement of activated carbon which will be fully replaced every 1 year the catalase dosing rate 2400 mg l was provided from supplier for removing 6000 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the required amount of catalase was calculated by multiplication of design capacity and dosing rate the unit price of catalase and activated carbon were 2 kg and 3 kg as quoted from supplier the operating expense of activated carbon was 60 000 year while that of catalase was 1 752 000 the activated carbon is an economical choice about one thirtieth compared with catalase for pretreatment of hydrogen peroxide in ammonia wastewater from electronic industry therefore this option was included in pilot test setup as described in fig 1 3 4 2 determination of operation conditions the reasonable choice of operating condition will be at minimizing operational cost operational costs of eo process in ammonia wastewater were calculated in order to determine current density and salt concentration several assumptions were made to calculate operation cost of electrochemical oxidation of ammonia wastewater the design capacity of eo process was assumed to be 1000 m3 d for the treatment of wastewater containing 800 mg l of ammonia cd the operational cost includes cost of salt addition electricity consumed and replacement of electrodes the cost of salt addition was calculated by multiplication of total amount of salt and unit price of salt as described in the following 9 c o s t o f s a l t c s q d u n i t c o s t o f s a l t where cs and qd are salt concentration and design capacity the required time tr to remove ammonia in wastewater is calculated using ammonia removal rate k described in fig 3f as follows 10 t r c d k the integral averaged voltage va was calculated by measured voltages vi in each measurement with time during lab batch experiment in the following equation 11 v a 0 t r v i d t t r electric power cost was estimated by the product of applied current i average voltage va measured during required time to meet target ammonia concentration 12 p o w e r c o s t i v a t r u n i t p o w e r c o s t the unit price of salt and electricity were 0 12 kg and 0 08 kwh respectively the electrode replacement costs depending on assumed lifetimes 2 5 years 5 years and 10 years were provided by electrode supplier the calculated operation costs relative to salt concentrations and current densities with different electrode lifetimes were described in table 3 as results the operating cost at current density of 3 a dm2 and salt concentration of 1 0 wt was the minimum irrespective of electrode lifetimes ranged from 2 5 10 years thus this current density and salt concentration was used as operation conditions in the pilot test 3 4 3 estimation of electrode lifetime and operation cost operation cost of the process was determined after consideration of electrode lifetime test results and averaged power consumption measured during pilot test electrode manufacturers and researchers have their own procedures and correlation equations for evaluation of electrode lifetime the lifetime of electrode was assessed in accelerated condition with a small coupon of electrode as following relationship 14 l i f e t i m e o f e l e c t r o d e t t j a j s s a f e t y f a c t o r where tt is the time required for replacement at specific voltage ja is the current density in accelerated conditions and js is the current density in normal operating condition the electrode manufacturer recommended replacement of anodes when applied voltage e increased to 1 5 times of initial voltage e0 the accelerated condition was 100 a dm2 and normal operation condition is 3 a dm2 as determined previously the multiplication ratio is 33 3 in this acceleration condition the changes in voltages and relative ratio e e0 during test under accelerated condition were depicted in fig 5 tt is obtained from the figure according to followings relationship 15 e tt e 0 1 5 the time tt to reach 1 5 times of initial voltage were 65 days in first trial and 74 days in second trial 33 3 times of these values give expected lifetime of 5 9 and 6 8 years considering 10 20 of safety factor electrode life time is determined to be 5 years with this electrode lifetime operating cost was estimated to be 4 23 m3 which is composed of 61 of power cost 28 of cost for electrolyte salt and 11 of electrode replacement cost this information would be useful for one who wants to optimize operation conditions of eo reactor the salt concentration and current density could be determined without electrode lifetime estimation unless extremely expensive electrodes were used if portion of electrode replacement cost is considerable electrode life time tests should be performed under different current densities power cost was re calculated using average voltage 4 v measured from pilot test instead of that in lab test 3 2 v after consideration of increase in power cost and pretreatment cost 0 16 m3 the operating expense became 5 03 m3 if pretreatment was not included in the process required hrt and power cost would be more than doubled at the best case in this case the operating expense of eo would be more than 8 08 m3 which is about 40 saving in operational cost 3 4 4 comparison with breakpoint chlorination bc effluent samples were taken from existing bc process in wastewater facility and from eo pilot plant with pretreatment respectively analysis results of the effluent samples were enlisted in table 1 ammonia concentration and ph in effluent of eo process were similar to bc process however electrical conductivity in eo process is about 45 less than that in bc process the electrical conductivity is mainly composed of chloride ion and sulfate ion the concentration of sulfate in effluent was significantly increased after bc process from 18 4 to 4588 mg l while almost no difference after eo process this increase was caused by the addition of sulfuric acid to maintain ph of 6 8 5 in bc process because addition of alkali sodium hypochlorite increased ph sulfuric acid was not used in eo process due to almost neutral ph of effluent from eo reactor in addition the concentration of chloride ion after eo process 5343 mg l was much lower than that after bc process 8470 mg l in bc process sodium hypochlorite solution was injected in excess of theoretical required value in eo process it was inferred that less oxidants produced in situ from salt than bc process were used to decompose ammonia this result implied that the suggested eo process with pretreatment can decompose ammonia more efficiently without addition of hazardous chemical such as sodium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid furthermore the suggested eo process is more economical than bc process the estimated operating expense in eo process 5 03 m3 from previous section was about 70 of that in bc process 7 01 m3 from semiconductor manufacturer 3 5 discussions more studies for the further improvement of the suggested process are expected with activated carbon based pretreatment implementation of automatic control for eo process would be easier because effluent quality is more stable without oxidant scavenger however it would be challenging tasks for the correlation of sensor with controlling logic the concept of this process could be extended to other applications in treatment of wastewater containing oxidant scavenger such as ascorbic acid oxalic acid nitrite and sodium thiosulfate in addition the conventional post treatment of eo process for removal of oxidant free chlorine is by the addition of sodium bisulfate it would be interesting the replacement of this chemical dosing system with chemical free system such as another activated carbon tower 4 conclusions in this study eo process with pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide removal was suggested for treatment of high strength ammonia wastewater in electronics industry the oxidant scavenging effect of hydrogen peroxide typically existed in wastewater from electronics wastewater was found and reaction pathways with recurrence relationships were described a pretreatment process using activated carbon was proposed for not only enhancing ammonia removal rate but also stable effluent quality the benefits of this process were demonstrated in pilot operation the ammonia removal rates with pretreatment of hydrogen peroxide were 2 3 5 times of that without pretreatment being compared with conventional chlorination this process is economic 70 of breakpoint chlorination in operating expense and environmental friendly salt and electricity used instead of hazardous hypochlorite and sulfuric acid therefore the eo process with pretreatment for hydrogen peroxide is a strong alternative to conventional chlorination for removal of high strength ammonia wastewater in electronics wastewater declaration of competing interest authors have a responsibility

13892,in this study a real textile effluent rte was treated by the electro fenton method in a parallel plate reactor a carbon fiber cathode and a stainless steel mesh anode were used as electrodes the effluent was characterized and dilute solutions were prepared with initial chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of 50 100 200 250 and 300 ppm the prepared effluents were degraded for 180 min at an applied voltage of 1 8 v and a current density of 0 45 macm 2 reductions of more than 85 of the initial color and 55 of the cod were achieved the energy consumption was 7 kw h kgcod 1 removed the rte degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics and its rate constants ranged from 0 01 to 0 02 min 1 it was observed that the degradation rate decreased as the initial effluent concentration increased based on the kinetic results a methodology was developed to predict the effluent degradation for each kinetic equation the empirical constant a and the rate constant k were determined mathematical models were formulated for a and k relative to their respective codi concentrations with a correlation coefficient greater than 0 95 in both cases the theoretical values of at and kt for the working concentrations were calculated using the formulated mathematical models the theoretical parameters were substituted into the first order kinetic equation allowing the simulation of the rte degradation the degradation behavior was simulated for each of the five concentrations studied and the results compared with the experimental results the theoretical and experimental values showed a high degree of adjustment demonstrating that the proposed methodology was successful in predicting the degradation of the textile effluent keywords real textile effluent electro fenton cod degradation kinetic modeling 1 introduction one of the most serious afflictions of the environment is the contamination of water bodies by highly toxic industrial waters the textile industry is considered one of the high water consuming industries the spent water is discarded under the conditions of high ph temperature color intensity and salt concentration these effluents cause serious esthetic problems to aquatic life and even human beings 1 numerous authors have published articles related to the treatment of synthetic and real textile effluents stes and rtes respectively 2 4 in this sense biological physicochemical and electrochemical treatments have been extensively studied biological treatments are highlighted for their simplicity versatility low cost environmental friendliness 5 however the mineralization of contaminants is difficult to achieve and the treatment durations are longer than those of the available processes for degrading organic molecules 6 physico chemical methods have proven effective for the removal of pollutants dye adsorption is one of the most studied physical methods due to its easy implementation 7 9 among adsorbent materials activated carbon stands out however new studies are focused on finding relatively inexpensive materials with a similar adsorption performance 10 11 one of the process limitations is the high cost of regenerating adsorbents particularly for activated carbon to decrease costs several attempts have been made to develop disposable adsorbents however the removal of organic matter was not effective and only a phase change from liquid to solid occurred 12 coagulation flocculation techniques have been extensively investigated for application in textile wastewater treatment 13 using these methods 12 high dye removal efficiencies between 70 and 97 were achieved 14 16 some of the drawbacks of these treatment methods are the high amount of reagents required the loss of the anodic material and sludge formation the disadvantages of the above processes have incentivized the search for new effluent treatment techniques in recent decades advanced oxidation processes aops have been demonstrated as highly effective technologies for the removal of toxic pollutants 17 aops are based on the generation of highly reactive chemical species hydroxyl radicals o h capable of degrading organic matter these radicals oxidize organic compounds and degrade them into simpler compounds up to their total mineralization in carbon dioxide co2 and water 18 photocatalytic and electrochemical processes and methods based on fenton s reaction and ozonation 19 are among aops the electro fenton ef technology stands out among aops an alternative to the ef is the electrochemical generation of h2o2 oxygen reduction can generate h2o2 and water h2o depending on the involved electrons in the reaction eqs 1 and 2 respectively once h2o2 is generated in the electrochemical reaction it is activated by externally introduced fe2 ions the fenton reaction occurs in situ eq 3 and hydroxyl radicals are generated this technology is attractive because of its low cost versatility and environmental friendliness 20 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 o 2 4 h 4 e h 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 f e 3 o h o h the ef process has proven effective for the elimination of contaminants from stes and rtes 21 23 many studies have been conducted on the degradation of dye as model pollutants 24 28 these studies have enabled the understanding of the reaction mechanisms of the mineralization process however this mechanism is not fully practical for real effluents because of their high salt content and the significant number of side reactions in this sense there is a lack of available literature on the treatment of real textile wastewater by ef recent reviews have shown the lack of studies on the application of ef treatments to industrial textile wastewater compared to those on other techniques paździor et al 19 reported only three research papers centered on ef while for methods such as electrochemical oxidation eo and ozonation o3 eight and nine papers were reportedly available respectively noteworthily ef presents competitive results compared to other treatment techniques in terms of the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency electrical energy consumption and operational costs conversely nidheesh et al 29 published an extensive paper which demonstrated the effectiveness of the ef method for synthetic dye degradation however for industrial wastewaters only a few studies were cited most of the available publications on the treatment of industrial textile effluents using the ef technology report studies conducted at the laboratory scale in which the working volumes varied from 250 to 1500 ml the cod and color abatement are the main variables studied furthermore the influence of various operating parameters such as the applied voltage current density reaction time and ph on these variables has been studied 30 32 nevertheless no evidence of the degradation kinetic behavior and no rate constant values have been reported wastewater treatment modeling has become a useful tool for predicting the degradation kinetic behavior the response surface metodology rsm and the artificial neural networks ann tools have been useful in predicting the degradation of synthetic dyes 33 36 the ef process has also been modeled using these mathematical tools kaur et al 37 used rsm to optimize the operational parameters in the degradation of a textile industrial effluent they designed 30 experimental runs to determine the influence of the retention time current and concentration of iron on the color and cod removal efficiencies as well as the energy consumption the tests enabled the formulation of a mathematical model for the prediction of the response variables davarnejad and hosseinitabar 38 carried out studies to optimize the reaction time current density and ph using rsm in this case 46 experiments were required for the optimization and modeling of the independent variables for the prediction of the cod and color removal efficiencies the errors of the cod and color removal models were 3 4 and 2 2 respectively in both publications numerous experiments were performed to obtain a predictive model consequently the expenses were high and significant amounts of time energy and reagents were expended process modeling as an alternative saves time and costs in the production processes therefore the search for new alternatives that allow the efficient modeling of processes with the least number of experimental tests and therefore the lowest cost constitutes an attractive research area the present investigation is focused on formulating a semi empirical methodology for predicting the degradation of an rte by the ef method studies were performed to obtain the degradation kinetics and rate constant values of the rte at various initial concentrations based on the experimental kinetic parameters a methodology was proposed that allowed the modeling and estimation of the effluent degradation behavior with very few experimental tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the rte was obtained from the washing unit of a company dedicated to the treatment and discoloration of denim garments located in the state of morelos méxico the company did not provide further details about the effluent samples were obtained directly from the plant wastewater discharges the rte was stored in dark bottles in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent any degradation the physicochemical parameters of the effluent were determined using experimental assays as a pretreatment process all the samples were filtered and diluted until the desired concentration was achieved in addition each sample was acidified with h2so4 all the reagents used for the experiments were of quality reactive grade supplied by sigma aldrich and j t baker the experimental trials were carried out at room temperature the working volume was 1 5 l for both the catholyte and anolyte and they were prepared using tap water the catholyte consisted of 0 05 m na2so4 and 1 mm feso4 with the ph adjusted to 2 and the rte was added in particular concentrations according to each experiment the catholyte was saturated with o2 throughout the experiment the anolyte consisted of 0 8 m h2so4 2 2 analysis for the analytical procedures the samples were collected during the treatment the concentration of accumulated h2o2 was determined by the potassium permanganate method 39 the absorbance of the rte was determined in a thermo scientific genesys 10 uv vis spectrophotometer the cod and the total organic carbon were measured according to the standard methods provided by the hach company 2 3 electrochemical reactor the electrochemical cell used for the experiments was a divided parallel plate reactor the reactor comprised four acrylic plates assembled with screws and rubber gaskets to avoid electrolyte leakage the cathode and anode chambers were separated by a nafion 117 proton exchange membrane the cathode which was made of two pieces of unidirectional carbon fiber cfu with a total area of 240 cm2 was placed inside the flow channel each piece was connected directly to the power source the anode comprised 304 stainless steel mesh with a surface area of 55 cm2 and it was connected directly to the power source the electrochemical cell was assembled in an electrical and hydraulic circuit fig 1 2 4 modeling real textile wastewater oxidation industrial wastewater degradation is more complex than synthetic effluent degradation the wastewater from the textile factory is characterized mainly by its high levels of color ph and salts it is impossible to determine the real concentration of a single pollutant in the overall wastewater matrix therefore determining the stoichiometry of mineralization for each organic compound is almost impossible however the kinetics of the degradation can be determined experimentally researchers suggest that in most cases the degradation of synthetic dyes follows a first order kinetics 40 41 eq 4 4 c t c 0 e k t where ct is the concentration of dye at any time c 0 is the initial concentration of dye k is the rate constant reaction and t is the time a good approach to assessing the degradation of a real effluent is to assume the entire wastewater matrix as a single dye the absorbance cod and toc values consider all the organic matter contained in the effluent and not only a dye considering this it is possible to determine the reaction kinetics of an rte based on the absorbance transforming eq 4 based on absorbance the first order kinetic equation is given as 5 a b s o r b a n c e t a e k t where absorbance t is the absorbance of rte at any time a ppm is the empirical constant k min 1 is the rate constant and t min is the time a represents the initial concentration of the dye in a first order kinetic equation the values of the a and k constants can be obtained from the experiments for any initial cod codi of the rte if several tests are performed at different codi values at specific concentration intervals the corresponding kinetic constants will be obtained for each codi a data set of codi a and k is obtained for each treated effluent it is possible to find two mathematical correlations between the initial cod and its kinetic parameter a vs codi and k vs codi the theoretical values of the kinetic constants at and kt can be calculated from any codi within the study interval a theoretical kinetic equation is obtained by substituting at and kt in eq 5 to simulate the rte degradation different times are utilized from zero to to tf where the calculated absorbance is zero this methodology allows the determination of the approximate degradation time and the energy required for the treatment process of an industrial effluent with a known codi 3 results and discussions 3 1 real textile wastewater characterization the real textile wastewater sample was obtained directly from the water discharges of a textile company subsequently the wastewater sample was subjected to physicochemical characterization the liquid sample had a dark red appearance very close black with a large amount of suspended solids the suspended matter was eliminated by a simple filtration process all the solids were retained and the sample color remained unchanged the ph of the sample was 12 and it showed a high basic character which was considered in the ef treatment the initial cod of the effluent was 6600 mg l 1 the initial spectrum of the sample was recorded to determine the wavelength of the absorbance peaks the spectrum was determined to be between 150 and 1150 nm fig 2 it was found that the absorbance reached the maximum in the ultraviolet uv 350 nm and visible vis 465 nm regions the peak in the uv region indicated the presence of a high concentration of organic compounds in the sample the signal in the visible range indicated the presence of dye molecules as expected based on the type of wastewater 3 2 real textile effluent degradation by electro fenton method the ef process includes the in situ electrogeneration of h2o2 and its activation with fe2 ions first the production and activation of h2o2 in the electrochemical cell were investigated in the absence of the effluent electrolysis was conducted for 180 min at an applied voltage of 1 8 v and a current of 240 ma during the electrolysis without feso4 7 5 mm of h2o2 was accumulated in contrast when feso4 was added only 0 2 mm of h2o2 was detected during the electrolysis this result evidenced that 97 of the h2o2 produced was activated in all the experiments the current efficiency for h2o2 production was 96 experimentally determined using faraday s law this value is higher than that reported by chmayssem et al 42 where the current efficiency for producing h2o2 was 90 in an undivided cell due to the presence of iron ions in the treatment it is important to maintain the ph at low values to avoid iron precipitation previous research has shown that ph values between 2 and 3 are more suitable for obtaining the best efficiencies of the fenton reaction 43 the ph and initial concentration of the rte were adjusted before the ef treatment the ph was decreased from 12 to 2 by the addition of h2so4 and a dilute solution of rte was prepared to decrease the cod to 100 ppm this concentration was selected based on the previous result reported by our research group that using the same working cell it was possible to degrade 120 ppm of acid orange 7 44 the degradation of 100 ppm of rte was carried out electrolysis was performed for 180 min at an applied voltage of 1 8 v and a current density of 0 45 macm 2 these conditions are similar to those maintained for the production of h2o2 the degradation efficiency of the effluent was monitored through the decrease in the absorbance fig 3 the spectra demonstrated the degradation of 100 ppm of the rte the zero time spectrum dotted line shows the absorption peak at 465 nm after 15 min a 50 reduction in the initial absorbance was achieved the subsequent spectra indicated that the absorbance in the visible region decreased during the treatment time demonstrating the degradation of the initial contaminants evidently the chromophore groups responsible for the intense color of the rte were cleaved in the uv region 250 350 nm the behavior was different an increase in the absorbance was observed indicating the formation of aromatic compounds because with the initial breakdown of the molecules secondary compounds such as aldehyde alcohol and ketone are formed 45 however it is noteworthy that the treatment itself decreases the concentration of these compounds fig 4 shows the rte degradation process in the first 5 min the rte concentration was decreased by 33 while at the end of the electrolysis 98 abatement was achieved the degradation results were adjusted to the pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constant was 0 022 min 1 kaur et al 45 obtained similar results in the electrocatalytic oxidation of an rte by a first order kinetics with k 0 0168 min 1 at the end of the treatment a cod removal efficiency of 53 was achieved while for the toc a value of 66 was realized these results exceed those reported by wang et al 32 who were able to remove 56 1 of the initial color using an industrial textile effluent by applying a current density of 11 am 2 these results support previous results where it was shown that the color removal rate is higher than the cod and toc removal rates 46 it is important to note that due to the nature of textile wastewater a high salt content is present in the rte including carbonates bicarbonates and chlorides which can cause a decrease in the process efficiency 47 implementing an additional process to eliminate this type of specific contaminants would increase the treatment costs however the results achieved during the experiments show that the color cod and toc removal efficiencies are comparable to those previously reported ef treatment is suitable for treating the rte however it is critically noted that 100 ppm is a low concentration if considering that the rte has a concentration of 6600 mg l 1 3 3 effect of the initial concentration to study the influence of the initial concentration of rte on the cod removal experiments were carried out effluents with codi concentrations between 50 and 300 ppm were prepared the effluents were subjected to electrolysis at the selected concentrations for 180 min at 1 8 v and 0 45 macm 2 samples were collected at specific intervals to determine the decrease in absorbance fig 5 shows the degradation of the 50 100 200 250 and 300 ppm effluents the results obtained showed that increasing the initial concentration of the effluent decreased the removal efficiency similar results were reported by other researchers 48 in the experiments with codi concentrations of 50 and 200 ppm more than 95 of the pollutant was removed while for the effluents with codi concentrations of 250 and 300 ppm 90 and 86 were eliminated respectively in all cases the final cod was determined it was found that for the 200 ppm effluent 55 of the initial cod was eliminated a result very similar to that obtained for the 100 ppm effluent however for the other samples treated the performance of this variable was very low with values around 25 3 4 energy consumption power consumption is the main parameter affecting the operating cost 49 the consumed energy was calculated at the end of the electrochemical treatment the energy was approximately 7 kw h kgcod 1 removed this value is lower than that previously reported by kaur et al 50 who established 15 kw h kgcod 1 removed as the energy required to carry out the ef process on textile wastewater 3 5 kinetic modeling of the rte degradation process modeling is a recent research approach for predicting the performance of a process from its real behavior the proposed model is based on the experimental determination of the kinetic parameters of rte degradation the kinetic constants determined for a set of different concentrations of the same effluent can be mathematically related to their initial concentrations from the treatments performed a family of rte degradation curves was obtained in the range of 50 300 ppm fig 5 for each concentration the kinetics was determined and a mathematical model was obtained all the r2 values were higher than 0 97 in all cases pseudo first order kinetics was found the values of the rate constants k and the reaction constants a are summarized in table 1 constants a and k were related to their respective codi values and the mathematical model was adjusted in each case fig 6 for constant a a linear model was formulated eq 6 with a correlation coefficient close to 0 98 similarly for the rate constants a quadratic model was the better adjustment with an r2 value higher than 0 95 eq 7 in both cases ci represents the initial cod of the rte in ppm 6 a 0 0018 c i 0 0479 r 2 0 979 7 k 2 10 7 c i 2 4 10 5 c i 0 0177 r 2 0 953 the r2 coefficients higher than 0 90 indicate the high degree of adjustment between the mathematical model and the experimental phenomenon which is consistent with the results of muhamad et al 51 they specified that the values of r2 should be higher than 0 8 for the model to be considered as a good quality theoretical model in addition these regression coefficients indicate that only 0 021 and 0047 of the total variation cannot be explained by the proposed model reducing the error percentages of the estimated variables from eqs 6 7 it is possible to obtain the theoretical kinetic parameters at and kt for any initial concentration within the studied interval the theoretical values are substituted in eq 5 and the decay of the absorbance could be estimated from to to tf to validate the proposed model the concentration studies in the laboratory tests were simulated and the results compared with the experimental results furthermore a concentration of 75 ppm dashed line was initially modeled and based on the results the experimental test was carried out fig 7 fig 7 shows that the proposed theoretical model can predict the degradation behavior for all concentrations it is important to note that there is a deviation between the simulated and experimentally obtained values at the beginning of the treatment this may be because the oxidation occurs in two stages first the reaction occurs rapidly followed by a relatively slow second stage 24 which are aspects that the theoretical model does not consider contrarily the initial points are not very relevant compared to the final points because the fundamental objective is the final oxidation time and costs required for the entire treatment in general the proposed methodology can predict the rte degradation with an acceptable error that increases with the initial effluent concentration at the end of the treatment the theoretical curve is closer to the experimental points indicating decreased error for all concentrations the simulated vs the experimental values are shown in fig 8 the average error associated with the proposed model was 12 which is an acceptable value compared with those obtained in similar investigations 52 for all concentrations the r2 adj abspredict vs absexp was higher than 0 98 demonstrating that the model obtained is adequate despite the calculated error the predictive model can provide useful information particularly after completion of the electrolysis it is important to note that the final part of the degradation has the greatest impact throughout the treatment the present work provides more information on textile effluent treatment the results afforded more information on the degradation kinetics and the mechanism of textile pollutant removal using the ef method this is all a step forward in the transition from laboratory to industrial scale treatments conversely real effluent degradation modeling provides a simple tool for predicting the degradation efficiency time energy consumption and treatment costs with a small number of experiments future studies should address the scale up of the treatment and the optimization of the operating parameters the sizing of the electrochemical reactor and the electrodes should be reviewed to maintain the efficiency of the process 4 conclusions in the present study the degradation of an rte was carried out by the ef process effluents with initial cod concentrations between 50 and 300 ppm were treated for 180 min at an applied voltage of 1 8 v and a current density of 0 45 macm 2 a color removal efficiency higher than 85 was achieved at the end of treatment for all cases for cod removal the best results were obtained for effluents with cod i concentrations of 100 and 200 ppm where 55 of the initial cod was eliminated the energy consumption of the ef treatment was 7 kw h kgcod 1 removed kinetic studies were performed and the results confirmed that the degradation follows pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constants were between 0 01 and 0 02 min 1 based on the experimental kinetic equations a mathematical model was developed to predict the degradation of rte in the range of working concentrations the proposed model was experimentally validated and associated with a 12 error proving that the proposed methodology is effective for predicting rte degradation this methodology can be applied to any recalcitrant pollutant

13892,in this study a real textile effluent rte was treated by the electro fenton method in a parallel plate reactor a carbon fiber cathode and a stainless steel mesh anode were used as electrodes the effluent was characterized and dilute solutions were prepared with initial chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of 50 100 200 250 and 300 ppm the prepared effluents were degraded for 180 min at an applied voltage of 1 8 v and a current density of 0 45 macm 2 reductions of more than 85 of the initial color and 55 of the cod were achieved the energy consumption was 7 kw h kgcod 1 removed the rte degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics and its rate constants ranged from 0 01 to 0 02 min 1 it was observed that the degradation rate decreased as the initial effluent concentration increased based on the kinetic results a methodology was developed to predict the effluent degradation for each kinetic equation the empirical constant a and the rate constant k were determined mathematical models were formulated for a and k relative to their respective codi concentrations with a correlation coefficient greater than 0 95 in both cases the theoretical values of at and kt for the working concentrations were calculated using the formulated mathematical models the theoretical parameters were substituted into the first order kinetic equation allowing the simulation of the rte degradation the degradation behavior was simulated for each of the five concentrations studied and the results compared with the experimental results the theoretical and experimental values showed a high degree of adjustment demonstrating that the proposed methodology was successful in predicting the degradation of the textile effluent keywords real textile effluent electro fenton cod degradation kinetic modeling 1 introduction one of the most serious afflictions of the environment is the contamination of water bodies by highly toxic industrial waters the textile industry is considered one of the high water consuming industries the spent water is discarded under the conditions of high ph temperature color intensity and salt concentration these effluents cause serious esthetic problems to aquatic life and even human beings 1 numerous authors have published articles related to the treatment of synthetic and real textile effluents stes and rtes respectively 2 4 in this sense biological physicochemical and electrochemical treatments have been extensively studied biological treatments are highlighted for their simplicity versatility low cost environmental friendliness 5 however the mineralization of contaminants is difficult to achieve and the treatment durations are longer than those of the available processes for degrading organic molecules 6 physico chemical methods have proven effective for the removal of pollutants dye adsorption is one of the most studied physical methods due to its easy implementation 7 9 among adsorbent materials activated carbon stands out however new studies are focused on finding relatively inexpensive materials with a similar adsorption performance 10 11 one of the process limitations is the high cost of regenerating adsorbents particularly for activated carbon to decrease costs several attempts have been made to develop disposable adsorbents however the removal of organic matter was not effective and only a phase change from liquid to solid occurred 12 coagulation flocculation techniques have been extensively investigated for application in textile wastewater treatment 13 using these methods 12 high dye removal efficiencies between 70 and 97 were achieved 14 16 some of the drawbacks of these treatment methods are the high amount of reagents required the loss of the anodic material and sludge formation the disadvantages of the above processes have incentivized the search for new effluent treatment techniques in recent decades advanced oxidation processes aops have been demonstrated as highly effective technologies for the removal of toxic pollutants 17 aops are based on the generation of highly reactive chemical species hydroxyl radicals o h capable of degrading organic matter these radicals oxidize organic compounds and degrade them into simpler compounds up to their total mineralization in carbon dioxide co2 and water 18 photocatalytic and electrochemical processes and methods based on fenton s reaction and ozonation 19 are among aops the electro fenton ef technology stands out among aops an alternative to the ef is the electrochemical generation of h2o2 oxygen reduction can generate h2o2 and water h2o depending on the involved electrons in the reaction eqs 1 and 2 respectively once h2o2 is generated in the electrochemical reaction it is activated by externally introduced fe2 ions the fenton reaction occurs in situ eq 3 and hydroxyl radicals are generated this technology is attractive because of its low cost versatility and environmental friendliness 20 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 o 2 4 h 4 e h 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 f e 3 o h o h the ef process has proven effective for the elimination of contaminants from stes and rtes 21 23 many studies have been conducted on the degradation of dye as model pollutants 24 28 these studies have enabled the understanding of the reaction mechanisms of the mineralization process however this mechanism is not fully practical for real effluents because of their high salt content and the significant number of side reactions in this sense there is a lack of available literature on the treatment of real textile wastewater by ef recent reviews have shown the lack of studies on the application of ef treatments to industrial textile wastewater compared to those on other techniques paździor et al 19 reported only three research papers centered on ef while for methods such as electrochemical oxidation eo and ozonation o3 eight and nine papers were reportedly available respectively noteworthily ef presents competitive results compared to other treatment techniques in terms of the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency electrical energy consumption and operational costs conversely nidheesh et al 29 published an extensive paper which demonstrated the effectiveness of the ef method for synthetic dye degradation however for industrial wastewaters only a few studies were cited most of the available publications on the treatment of industrial textile effluents using the ef technology report studies conducted at the laboratory scale in which the working volumes varied from 250 to 1500 ml the cod and color abatement are the main variables studied furthermore the influence of various operating parameters such as the applied voltage current density reaction time and ph on these variables has been studied 30 32 nevertheless no evidence of the degradation kinetic behavior and no rate constant values have been reported wastewater treatment modeling has become a useful tool for predicting the degradation kinetic behavior the response surface metodology rsm and the artificial neural networks ann tools have been useful in predicting the degradation of synthetic dyes 33 36 the ef process has also been modeled using these mathematical tools kaur et al 37 used rsm to optimize the operational parameters in the degradation of a textile industrial effluent they designed 30 experimental runs to determine the influence of the retention time current and concentration of iron on the color and cod removal efficiencies as well as the energy consumption the tests enabled the formulation of a mathematical model for the prediction of the response variables davarnejad and hosseinitabar 38 carried out studies to optimize the reaction time current density and ph using rsm in this case 46 experiments were required for the optimization and modeling of the independent variables for the prediction of the cod and color removal efficiencies the errors of the cod and color removal models were 3 4 and 2 2 respectively in both publications numerous experiments were performed to obtain a predictive model consequently the expenses were high and significant amounts of time energy and reagents were expended process modeling as an alternative saves time and costs in the production processes therefore the search for new alternatives that allow the efficient modeling of processes with the least number of experimental tests and therefore the lowest cost constitutes an attractive research area the present investigation is focused on formulating a semi empirical methodology for predicting the degradation of an rte by the ef method studies were performed to obtain the degradation kinetics and rate constant values of the rte at various initial concentrations based on the experimental kinetic parameters a methodology was proposed that allowed the modeling and estimation of the effluent degradation behavior with very few experimental tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the rte was obtained from the washing unit of a company dedicated to the treatment and discoloration of denim garments located in the state of morelos méxico the company did not provide further details about the effluent samples were obtained directly from the plant wastewater discharges the rte was stored in dark bottles in a refrigerator at 4 c to prevent any degradation the physicochemical parameters of the effluent were determined using experimental assays as a pretreatment process all the samples were filtered and diluted until the desired concentration was achieved in addition each sample was acidified with h2so4 all the reagents used for the experiments were of quality reactive grade supplied by sigma aldrich and j t baker the experimental trials were carried out at room temperature the working volume was 1 5 l for both the catholyte and anolyte and they were prepared using tap water the catholyte consisted of 0 05 m na2so4 and 1 mm feso4 with the ph adjusted to 2 and the rte was added in particular concentrations according to each experiment the catholyte was saturated with o2 throughout the experiment the anolyte consisted of 0 8 m h2so4 2 2 analysis for the analytical procedures the samples were collected during the treatment the concentration of accumulated h2o2 was determined by the potassium permanganate method 39 the absorbance of the rte was determined in a thermo scientific genesys 10 uv vis spectrophotometer the cod and the total organic carbon were measured according to the standard methods provided by the hach company 2 3 electrochemical reactor the electrochemical cell used for the experiments was a divided parallel plate reactor the reactor comprised four acrylic plates assembled with screws and rubber gaskets to avoid electrolyte leakage the cathode and anode chambers were separated by a nafion 117 proton exchange membrane the cathode which was made of two pieces of unidirectional carbon fiber cfu with a total area of 240 cm2 was placed inside the flow channel each piece was connected directly to the power source the anode comprised 304 stainless steel mesh with a surface area of 55 cm2 and it was connected directly to the power source the electrochemical cell was assembled in an electrical and hydraulic circuit fig 1 2 4 modeling real textile wastewater oxidation industrial wastewater degradation is more complex than synthetic effluent degradation the wastewater from the textile factory is characterized mainly by its high levels of color ph and salts it is impossible to determine the real concentration of a single pollutant in the overall wastewater matrix therefore determining the stoichiometry of mineralization for each organic compound is almost impossible however the kinetics of the degradation can be determined experimentally researchers suggest that in most cases the degradation of synthetic dyes follows a first order kinetics 40 41 eq 4 4 c t c 0 e k t where ct is the concentration of dye at any time c 0 is the initial concentration of dye k is the rate constant reaction and t is the time a good approach to assessing the degradation of a real effluent is to assume the entire wastewater matrix as a single dye the absorbance cod and toc values consider all the organic matter contained in the effluent and not only a dye considering this it is possible to determine the reaction kinetics of an rte based on the absorbance transforming eq 4 based on absorbance the first order kinetic equation is given as 5 a b s o r b a n c e t a e k t where absorbance t is the absorbance of rte at any time a ppm is the empirical constant k min 1 is the rate constant and t min is the time a represents the initial concentration of the dye in a first order kinetic equation the values of the a and k constants can be obtained from the experiments for any initial cod codi of the rte if several tests are performed at different codi values at specific concentration intervals the corresponding kinetic constants will be obtained for each codi a data set of codi a and k is obtained for each treated effluent it is possible to find two mathematical correlations between the initial cod and its kinetic parameter a vs codi and k vs codi the theoretical values of the kinetic constants at and kt can be calculated from any codi within the study interval a theoretical kinetic equation is obtained by substituting at and kt in eq 5 to simulate the rte degradation different times are utilized from zero to to tf where the calculated absorbance is zero this methodology allows the determination of the approximate degradation time and the energy required for the treatment process of an industrial effluent with a known codi 3 results and discussions 3 1 real textile wastewater characterization the real textile

13893,heavy metal contamination has been a serious threat to environment and human health carbon based materials from biochar activated carbon to modified materials i e carbon nanotubes based materials and graphene based materials have been widely studied as efficient adsorbents for the heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions this review discussed the recent achievements in adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetics and adsorption mechanism according to the existing forms of heavy metals in water the effect of process conditions such as temperature ph value and coexisting ions on adsorption performance are combed and the universal guidance law is obtained the physical adsorption electrostatic interaction ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation coprecipitation play important roles in heavy metals adsorption process in addition to the common activated carbon ac biochar bc and the emerging carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene gn adsorbent show good development potentials meanwhile though the modified carbonaceous materials can achieve high adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of heavy metals the modification operation is complex especially chemical modification acid and alkali solution are often used to regenerate spent materials in desorption however further studies of other desorption reagent are really needed this review highlights the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution using carbon based materials as adsorbents and discusses the existing deficiencies and suggestions on further study keywords heavy metal adsorption carbon based materials desorption 1 introduction the development of mining smelting chemical industry battery manufacturing and the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers caused a huge emission of heavy metals in surface water and ground water 1 2 pb cu cr cd hg zn ni as and other heavy metals could be refractory and accumulated in organisms 2 3 to trigger poisoning or chronic diseases in united states japan india and turkey it was reported that some rivers wetlands or bays suffered from heavy metal contamination 4 7 in recent years heavy metals pollution accidents occurred frequently in china taihu lake chaohu lake dongting lake poyang lake tributaries of songhua river pearl river jiulong river and other freshwater resources are polluted by heavy metals in different degrees 3 8 12 heavy metal pollution has become a great danger to human health and the safety of water drinking and water using today chemical precipitation electrochemical method ion exchange membrane filtration and adsorption are used to the removal of heavy metals in water and these technologies show their advantages and disadvantages in real situations please refer to table a1 considering the removal capacity energy consumption sensitivity of operation conditions and secondary pollution adsorption method is the best choice 1 common adsorbents include low cost materials carbonaceous materials and modified materials 13 and these adsorbents have so wide ranges of variety and sources that they can be selected according to local conditions by different countries and regions 14 16 importantly easy operation renewable adsorbent and low toxicity are main characteristics of adsorption 17 18 which bring a broad application prospects to adsorption in heavy metals remove in water carbon based materials are powdered or bulk non metallic solid materials with carbon as the main ingredient which includes activated carbon biochar ac bc carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene gn analogues etc they have the outstanding advantages of large specific surface area abundant pore structure good thermal stability high mechanical strength 19 high adsorption capacity and controllable morphology 20 in order to better meet the requirements of water quality a lot of development and improvement work has been done therefore various carbonaceous materials and their derivatives were developed many modification methods have been developed for the enhanced removal of heavy metal ions such as oxidization magnetization functional group graft and compositing with inorganic substances 21 some studies have reviewed modified ac bc cnts or gn analogues adsorbents respectively but the certain guidelines for modification and the inherent mechanisms are not clearly stated 22 23 in fact the modification methods or adsorption mechanisms involved in these studies are similar thus a summarization can be meaningful to examine carbon based adsorbents as a whole for heavy metal removal and the regeneration strategy also should be systematically considered this review aims to highlight the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution using carbon based adsorbents the adsorption behavior model fitting process factors as well as the adsorption mechanism are briefly introduced the universal modification methods and the regeneration process of several typical carbon materials e g ac bc cnts and gn adsorbent are classified and summarized this review provides clue for three typical carbonaceous materials to develop carbon based adsorbents in heavy metal removal and the perspectives of further research are presented 2 adsorption behavior of heavy metals in aqueous solution heavy metal has been regarded as extremely dangerous environmental pollution which are toxic to human beings even at low concentrations level and possible to trigger poisoning or chronic diseases 23 24 when the heavy metals enter the water they always exist in different forms such as cations anions and hydroxide complexes 25 26 depending on the conditions of dissolved oxygen ph and organic matter content the insoluble metal oxide or easily deposited heavy metal salt such as cuo pbo zns and pbso4 27 are not the key targets for adsorption relatively as shown in table 1 the adsorption behavior of soluble heavy metals such as pb ii cd ii cr vi cu ii zn ii ni ii hg ii and as v are most studied 28 2 1 common adsorption models of carbon based adsorbents with the adsorption process going on the adsorption and desorption rate will eventually reach the same state that is adsorption equilibrium in relative studies adsorption isotherm and kinetic model are often used to fit the adsorption process 29 30 2 1 1 adsorption isotherm under certain temperature conditions there are some certain relationships between adsorbate and unabsorbed adsorbate on the adsorbent surface in water these relationships can be described by isothermal model as shown below 15 31 34 1 l a n g m u i r a d s o r p t i o n i s

the polanyi potential r is ideal gas constant 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k among these formulas langmuir isotherm freundlich isotherm and extended langmuir isotherm models are often used in the study of adsorption of heavy metals on carbon materials 21 35 as shown in table 1 langmuir isotherm is more frequently used in heavy metal adsorption studies of carbon based materials which implies chemical monolayer adsorption and the adsorption performance of adsorbent surface is uniform 17 31 36 however some carbon based adsorbents do not meet that ideal uniform condition 16 and freundlich isotherm can be used as an empirical formula without hypothetical conditions for multilayer adsorption 34 for example xu et al found that freundlich simulated the pb ii adsorption data of oxidized multiwalled cnts better than langmuir 37 in addition real water body might be binary system or multi system hayati et al found that when used cnts modified by amination to adsorb cu ii and pb ii in their binary system the adsorption data was fitted better by extended langmuir isotherm than langmuir isotherm 32 although sherlala et al found that temkin isotherm provided an evidence for ion exchange by one kind of functionalized cnts and showed higher r2 than that of langmuir or freundlich isotherm in their study 38 there are few mentions of temkin isotherm in other studies for heavy metal adsorption and also d r model is rare in studies it is noteworthy that to determine which model the adsorption process conform to should not only rely on r2 of the fitting equation but also judged by its basic hypothesis however the basic hypothesis of some adsorbents is unclear and the data meets two isotherms well then the estimation of adsorption capacity requires other reports 39 40 2 1 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics are elucidated by studying the change of adsorptive capacity or adsorptive rate of adsorbent the commonly used kinetic models are shown in follow equations 31 41 42 7 the pseudo first order model log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 8 t h e p s e u d o s e c o n d o r d e r m o d e l t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 9 t h e w e b e r m o r r

materials is often described using the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic models while the latter is used more frequently 43 see table 1 wang et al found the adsorption data of using willow wood bc and cattle manure bc to adsorb ni cu and cd fitted well the pseudo first order model 44 in general the pseudo first order model assumes that there is reversible physical adsorption in the adsorption processes 45 however the pseudo second order model is most frequently used in the adsorption of heavy metals by carbon materials in this review which means that the adsorption of carbon materials is mostly chemical 46 49 elovich kinetic model describes adsorption in heterogeneous systems influenced by reaction rate and diffusion factor together 41 and there are few carbon based adsorbents studies about it for heavy metal removal the application of the weber morris equation is mainly to further determine whether the adsorption process is dominated by internal diffusion only 42 in these kinetic models contact time obviously is an important variable which relates to adsorption capacity 50 exactly due to the time to meet that equilibrium is different for various heavy metals the contact time should be considered especially when there is a binary system or multi system of heavy metals 51 2 2 effects of process factors on heavy metals removal ph temperature initial concentration and coexisting ions are main factors of adsorption for heavy metals which affect the performance of carbon based adsorbent material in heavy metals removal 2 2 1 effect of ph the ph value reflects the concentration level of h in water and ion exchange and electrostatic interaction are greatly influenced by h concentration different carbon based materials possess different phpzc values which refer to the ph value when the zeta potential of adsorbents reaches zero 35 as shown in table 2 the effect of ph is obvious for adsorption performance of carbon based adsorbents when the ph value is lower than phpzc value it is not only meaning that more h could exchange with heavy metal cations 21 but also the high concentration of h would protonate the surface functional groups e g nh2 oh of carbon based materials so that the number of surface positive charges obtains an increase 46 62 then due to the electrostatic repulsion the adsorption of heavy metal cations would meet a decrease in water meanwhile the adsorption effect of anions e g hcro4 becomes better 63 when ph value increases even higher than phpzc deprotonation brings back the negative charge for functional groups 46 thus showing the opposite effect of cations and anions therefore in heavy metal cation adsorption the phpzc of carbon based adsorbents should be more acidic for a wider operational range of ph on the contrary the phpzc should be more alkaline for anionic 35 in addition the ionic form of heavy metal ions also connects with h concentration 36 66 these different forms of ions have different affinity to functional groups 67 which ultimately affect the adsorption capacity 2 2 2 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on adsorption is generally related to the thermodynamic nature of the adsorption process and some parameters such as enthalpy change δh free energy change δg and entropy δs 68 which are evaluated from thermodynamic equations 64 11 l n k c δ h r t δ s r 12 δ g r t l n k c where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol and t k is the absolute temperature δg and δh can be auxiliary explanation of adsorption behavior by evaluating the isotherm data 59 in this review negative δg and positive δh in most adsorption of heavy metals by carbon materials indicating that the adsorption process are spontaneous and the adsorption capacity would increase with increasing temperature in certain range 69 for instance mohan et al confirmed the adsorption of pb ii by mgo loaded graphene oxide at 20 is lower than the state at 30 64 however hadavifar et al found that hg ii adsorption onto mwcnts sh was more efficient at lower temperatures with the negative δg and negative δh 70 therefore the adsorption process of one carbon based material also could be exothermic reaction 36 furthermore peng et al believed that temperature can cause changes in solubility and intermolecular interactions and it might be the reason of the temperature influencing the adsorption processes 69 however it is favorable that adsorption taking place at normal temperature for real situation see in table a2 so extra heating or cooling of solution should be avoided as far as possible 2 2 3 effect of initial concentration within a certain concentration range the adsorption capacity for heavy metals keeps increasing with an increase of initial concentration when carbon based adsorbent has not met a saturation one reason for this is that higher initial concentration contributes to an increases of the transfer power from solution to carbon based materials surface 32 but when the initial concentration is set at a higher level all adsorption sites would be occupied and or the adsorbent surface is covered by the firstly adsorbed heavy metal ions 64 then the interaction between those unabsorbed heavy metal ions and carbon based adsorbents would be hindered so an exorbitant initial concentration of target heavy metal ions will meet a decrease in the adsorption efficiency for later adsorption stage in addition the change of pollutant concentration will also affect the fitting degree of adsorption isotherm model in some cases increasing the initial concentration of pollutants will make the adsorption transition from single molecular layer to multi molecular layer which will lead to the change of the best fitted adsorption model 2 2 4 effect of coexisting ions in solution ionic strength can represent the background electrolyte concentration which affects the interface potential and thickness of the double layer 36 some coexisting cations or anions with different strength would play a role in heavy metal ions removal by carbon based adsorbents in three aspects firstly different heavy metal ions coexisting in a certain space compete with each other for adsorption sites the adsorption capacity or removal efficiency of adsorbent would perform a relative decrease when the system containing two or more kinds of cations or anions compared with single system park et al confirmed that the adsorption capacity of bc in a mixed system of cd2 pb2 was lower than that of cd2 or pb2 single metal system respectively 52 and the existence and difference of this competitive adsorption behaviors are decided by electric charges and hydrated radius of those cations which cause different affinity to adsorption sites on carbon based adsorbents in binary system or multi system 42 secondly high concentration of k na ca2 and mg2 in waters can also compete with heavy metal cations to bring a decrease of the heavy metal adsorption efficiency 53 71 72 thirdly anions would interact with heavy metal cations to form coordination ions or precipitation and compete with heavy metal anions for adsorption sites for instance the existence of so4 2 in the solution can enhance the precipitation and reduction of cr vi while the existence of hco3 could affect the valence transition of fe and inhibit the cr vi removal 67 however so4 2 can result a decline of cr vi removal efficiency duo to competition behavior and smaller negative charges of no3 and cl make them show weak effects in adsorption of cr vi 36 and more studies of coexisting anions need to be developed furtherly for example the possibility and effect of hg2cl2 precipitation formed by cl and hg in hg ii adsorption process have not been defined clearly 66 in aqueous solution duo to the most of heavy metal ions are cations the phpzc of carbon based adsorbents should be acidic for a wider operational range of ph but the differences of phpzc of carbon based materials require various ph in real situation and current researches should be further developed in effect of coexisting anions and a normal temperature for adsorption process should be considered 2 3 adsorption mechanisms there are five main types of adsorption for heavy metal on carbon based materials as shown in fig 1 1 physical adsorption a process about diffusion and deposition of heavy metal ions in the pore of the adsorbent material does not form chemical bonds which depends on the pore size distribution and surface area of the adsorbent itself exactly the increases of micropores and mesoporous can increase surface area and facilitate contaminant diffusion which can promote physical adsorption and accelerate adsorption kinetics 73 for instance fahmi et al studied the adsorption performance of grated empty fruit bunch bc and found that higher surface area and more exposed microporous can bring a promotion of pb ii adsorption capacity 74 2 electrostatic interaction when negative or positive charges are carried on the adsorbent surface the electrostatic attraction would play a role in adsorption process between adsorbent and opposite charged ions previous studies confirmed that electrostatic interaction is one of mechanisms for heavy metal adsorption by ac cnts and gn 21 the surfaces of most carbon based materials are variably charged and as mentioned in 2 2 1 solution ph and phpzc of adsorbents can influence the electrostatic interaction and the interaction between protonated or deprotonated functional groups and heavy metal ions can be available on carbon based adsorbents surface such as the electrostatic attraction between protonated nh3 with hcro4 cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 63 3 ion exchange ion exchange usually occurs between divalent metal cations m2 and the proton of oxygen containing functional groups cooh oh and cation exchange capacity cec is an indicator of this 21 lai et al found this removal mechanism contributes a lot to the adsorption of heavy metals by ac bc 75 however according the research of peng et al the metal mineral ions such as k na ca2 mg2 contained in graphene oxide also showed capability to exchange with heavy metal cations 69 4 surface complexation on the adsorbents surface functional groups such as oh cooh o and co nh react with heavy metal ions especially m2 or complexes such as cd oh pb oh for heavy metals enrichment from aqueous solution 66 and surface complexation forms multiatom structures in reaction processes 21 there are many reports have mentioned that cd2 cu2 and ni2 could complex with oh and cooh 76 78 for instance li et al found that surface complexation might was an important mechanism in cd pb and hg removal which contributed by oh or cooh on bc surface 66 and hadavifar et al found that sh can complex with hg2 on thiol derivatized cnts surface 70 5 precipitation coprecipitation heavy metal ions can form solid precipitates or coprecipitate with other ions and groups on adsorbent surface to dissociate from water liu et al found that the coprecipitation can be observed obviously in adsorption systems with high concentration of heavy metal ions 17 and it can occurs on carbon based adsorbents surface repeatedly 21 such as the precipitation or coprecipitation as cdco3 cd3 po4 2 and probably cd oh 2 on bc in cd removal 56 sometimes reduction plays a role in the heavy metal removal some high valent heavy metal ions are not directly adsorbed but reduced to low valent states firstly such as cr vi being reduced to cr iii hg2 being reduced to hg2cl2 due to the electronegativity of the carbon materials themselves and then removed by complexation and ion exchange 66 table 3 shows the contributions of those mechanisms in adsorption processes taking place on carbon based materials for these mechanisms they are universal for most of carbon based adsorbents however while precipitation coprecipitation may occur in adsorption processes it is not commonly regarded as the main mechanisms of heavy metals adsorption in fact the differences in physical or chemical properties of carbon based materials often make them perform different adsorption behavior and the properties of various carbon based materials are usually determined by their preparation process bc for example deng et al 78 and yu et al 80 found that the higher porosity larger specific surface area more obvious graphite crystal structure and higher ph value can be obtained at higher pyrolysis temperature meanwhile less oxygen containing functional groups affects physical or chemical adsorption efficiency in addition it can be notable that most studies concentrated on the heavy metal ions and the removal studies of hydroxide complexes or other heavy metal complexes ions are inadequate 81 3 application of carbon based adsorbents in adsorption of heavy metals carbonaceous materials have abundant pores and functional groups which can be used for heavy metal removal in water and roughly classified into three categories ac bc based materials cnts based materials and gn based materials namely the development of various modified materials based on ac bc cnts and gn are the three main lines for the development of carbon based adsorbent 3 1 ac bc based materials ac is produced by pyrolysis and activation of wood coal lignite and other carbon containing raw materials 82 83 and it is amorphous carbon solid with black powder granular massive and honeycomb shapes ac can be obtained by pyrolysis and activation of most carbon rich substances in principle so the sources of it are very wide bc a porous solid materials 80 with carbon as the main component were obtained by biomass pyrolysis 84 such as botanic materials and agricultural waste bc is similar to ac or there is no clear boundary between them in the studies and utilization of them in heavy metal adsorption 3 1 1 ac and bc 3 1 1 1 agricultural waste derived ac bc rice husk carbon khan et al 85 mixed dried rice husk and sulfuric acid and heated the mixture for a period of time then the rice husk carbon was obtained after the adsorption experiment of cr vi removal it was found that when the initial concentration of cr vi was 80 mg l and ph 2 cr vi would be completely adsorbed after 120 min deng et al 78 carried out the adsorption experiments of cd ii and ni ii with rice husk carbon the equilibrium adsorption capacity of cd ii and ni ii was 65 40 mg g and 54 60 mg g respectively but in the binary system of cd ii and ni ii the competition of these two heavy metals for the adsorption sites leaded to the decrease of adsorption capacity in addition ion exchange adsorption and precipitation were main adsorption mechanism corn straw porous carbon ma et al 46 used corn straw as raw material to prepare corn straw porous carbon and carried out related adsorption experiment of cr vi the results showed that maximum adsorption capacity of cr vi was 175 44 mg g and the removal efficiency was 70 65 after three adsorption desorption cycles several mechanisms were included in the adsorption process 1 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 were trapped in micropores 2 ion exchange and complexation took place between cr vi and oxygen containing functional groups e g cooh oh and c o c 3 cr vi was reduced to cr iii by ror or roh the removal efficiency of cr vi in real electroplating wastewater was 97 9 with an obvious selectivity compared with ni2 and cu2 in water discarded mushroom stick bc wang et al 53 pyrolyzed the discarded mushroom stick at 300 500 and 800 respectively to get bc marked dmb3 dmb5 and dmb8 the adsorption of the bc on pb ii cu ii cd ii and ni ii was studied dmb8 provided the maximum adsorption capacity of those heavy metals and it probably was that higher pyrolysis temperature help the dbm to form more aromatic structure and allowed larger number of initial mineral ions e g na ca2 and ma2 to exchange with heavy metal ions 3 1 1 2 other botanic material based bc some plants are not regarded as crops because of their low economic value but thanks to their large carbon rich biomass it is possible that considering those botanic materials as raw materials to prepare bc take water hyacinth as example zhang et al 56 used water hyacinth as raw material to pyrolysis it in n2 atmosphere to produce bc they studied the cd ii adsorption on the bc and found that when the initial concentration of cd2 was 50 mg l the removal efficiency of cd2 was close to 100 in a short time and the maximum adsorption capacity was 70 31 mg g ion exchange and surface complexation was dominant mechanisms in cd2 adsorption and the coprecipitation of cd2 or cd oh with bc and the electrostatic adsorption of cd2 by bc also played a role the results of the report made by ding et al 86 showed the adsorption capacity and activity of water hyacinth bc to pb are stronger than that of cd in the binary system and cation π interaction was also one of adsorption mechanisms 3 1 1 3 sludge based bc ho et al 54 pyrolyzed anaerobic digestion sludge to prepare anerobic digestion sludge biochar adsbc for the utilization to remove pb ii cd ii cu ii ni ii zn ii and cr vi from water the adsorption capacities were in the order of pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii ni ii cr vi ion exchange precipitation complexation and electrostatic interaction were main adsorption mechanisms whose contribution in the removal process of pb ii were 33 4 53 5 83 and 4 8 respectively ni et al 55 studied the competitive adsorption between pb ii and cd ii on adsbc the affinity of pb2 to adsorption sites was stronger than that of cd2 so some pb2 arrived at adsbc surface would replace adsorbed cd ii and occupied the sites to prevent the cd2 adsorption 3 1 2 modified ac bc the adsorption capacity of one carbonaceous material can be improved by changing its properties that is modification 84 the modification of ac bc can be achieved by grafting functional groups including amino functionalization sulfur functionalization and other group functionalization 19 or compounding supporting inorganic substances 3 1 2 1 functional groups grafted ac bc some chemical method can be used to increase the number or species of functional group on ac bc surface the amino functionalization e g nh3 and sulfur functionalization e g c s cs or so are grafting nitrogen containing groups and sulfur containing groups respectively on the carbonaceous materials surface other functionalization refers to transforming certain functional groups on carbonaceous materials surface into others or grafting side chain to introduce other functional groups 21 1 amino functionalization faheem et al 76 used chemical method impregnation method to graft amino group on the surface of corncob bc to increase the adsorption capacity of hg ii to about twice as much as the unmodified the corncob bc was slightly oxidized by h2o2 to transform some hydroxyl groups into carboxyl group and immersed and stirred in a mixture solution of ultrapure water urea and naoh then a specific amount of edta was added to obtained amino grafted modified bc according to the adsorption experiment the maximum removal efficiency of hg ii was 97 6 and it was confirmed that hg ii interacted with oh cooh nh2 nh respectively on modified corncob bc via electrostatic attraction surface complexation and ion exchange saleh et al 79 prepared polyethyleneimine functionalized ac to study the hg ii adsorption and found that the adsorption might be caused by the interaction between hg ii and co nh2 2 sulfur functionalization li et al 87 studied the adsorption of cu ii pb ii cd ii and ni ii on thiol functionalized ac the ac was prepared from coal blended sewage sludge and oxidized by nitric acid then the oxidized ac was mixed with dmf n n dimethylformamide after that nahso4 h2o and mercaptoacetic acid were added to react with the ac for a period of time under heating conditions finally the ac was treated with na2s 9h2o and 95 ethanol washed with deionized water and dried to obtain sh ac the adsorption capacity of this material was much higher than that of unmodified ac the maximum adsorption capacities of cu ii pb ii cd ii and ni ii were 238 1 mg g 96 2 mg g 87 7 mg g and 52 4 mg g respectively in addition to the reduction reaction of cu ii complex adsorption was main mechanism for other heavy metal ions modification by functional groups graft has obvious advance of adsorption capacity specific adsorption for certain ions e g sh to hg2 76 different processes with different chemical modifier significantly ratio influenced adsorption capacity and complex preparation process 3 1 2 2 ac bc inorganic substance composite 1 nzvi ac bc composite the specific surface area of nzvi is large which can be used as heavy metal remover by reduction and adsorption but nzvi is easy to agglomerate and form larger particles when it is used alone and the removal efficiency would be disturbed given this defect ac bc is used to support nzvi to overcome the agglomeration of nzvi and this composite has complex structure so the adsorption ability is enhanced 67 there are two common chemical methods to prepare zvi ac composite one is pyrolysis liquid phase reduction method the other is one step pyrolysis method the former is to use bc as support material and immerse it in ferrous salt e g feso4 7h2o solution and use some reducing agent to reduce iron ion to zero valent iron on bc surface the latter is let ferrous salt precipitate on biomass e g rice husk coconut husk by air drying and then pyrolyze the air dried biomass to get bc at the same time bc reduces fe ii to fe0 88 shang et al 67 prepared bc fe by liquid phase reduction method the herbal residue was pyrolyzed to obtain bc and the nzvi was reduced and supported on bc using nabh4 according the adsorption experiment of cr vi the maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 98 71 0 04 and the removal of cr vi was one combination of reduction process and precipitation process a part of cr vi was reduced to cr iii by nzvi and then cr iii and residual cr vi interacted with oxygen containing functional groups on bc fe surface however pyrolysis liquid phase reduction process is time consuming and requires additional reductant so it is not superior to one step pyrolysis in cost 88 wang et al 89 synthesized zvi ac composite by ball milling to avoid a complicated and costly chemical preparation process and the experiment confirmed that the cr vi removal efficiency was 94 01 within 120 min under acidic and anaerobic conditions 2 metal oxide ac bc composites nano single metal oxides and binary metal oxide consist of mno2 mgo and feox are also often used to get carbon based composite materials 66 90 yu et al 80 impregnated water hyacinth bc in zn no3 2 solution and after drying and calcination they obtained the bc zno composite the adsorption experiment of cr vi by the composite showed that the optimal content of zno in the composite was 30 wt and the removal rate of cr vi could be maintained above 95 at natural ph value reduction and precipitation were the main mechanisms zhou et al 90 dispersed bc in the mixture of kmno4 and fe no3 3 by ultrasound and pyrolyzed it to obtain bc loading fe mn binary oxide the results show that the maximum adsorption capacity of cu ii and cd ii were 64 9 mg g and 101 0 mg g respectively which much as three times of capacities of bc the complexation of divalent metal ion cu2 or cd2 with fe mnox cooh and oh was the main adsorption mechanism while cation π bounding also plays a role in adsorption process inorganic substances being supported on carbon base is one method for carbon based materials modification 67 but objectionable agglomeration of zero valent metal or other nonmagnetic metal compounds would not be completely evitable 65 which need further research 3 2 cnts based materials 3 2 1 cnts due to the revolution of nanotechnology cnts perform obvious operability for better heavy metal adsorption efficiency compared to ac bc and met an extensive utilization in environmental remediation 91 cnts are a kind of hollow cylinder formed by a net composed of large number of carbon atoms covalently combined each other with hexagonal structure according to the number of net layers cnts can be divided into single walled carbon nanotube swcnt and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt 92 cnts have hydrophobicity electrode abundant pore structure and functional groups and performs a broad spectrum adsorption for heavy metals such as pb cu cd and zn in water 93 however due to the strong hydrophobicity and low affinity cnts are often not directly applied in aqueous solution which limits the application of themselves 58 after modification the derivative materials obtained broaden the application range in other words cnts is often used as raw materials for the production of their derivatives 3 2 2 modified cnts 3 2 2 1 oxidized cnts the common modification of cnts includes oxidation functional group graft and magnetism oxidized cnts can be obtained by strong oxidants e g strong acid potassium permanganate ozone treating to enhance their hydrophilicity and solubility which is conducive to the heavy metal adsorption the common method is considering of acid oxidation and the mixed acid or single acid of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid is often used 92 94 the process of acid oxidation can increase the number of oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl group hydroxyl group on carbon based adsorbents surface to enhance the hydrophilicity for better performance of heavy metal adsorption 37 57 92 xu et al 37 prepared mwcnts by chemical vapor deposition and then oxidized them with nitric acid they used mwcnts to adsorb pb ii and found that the adsorption performance was largely influenced by ph value the removal efficiency was only 10 20 when ph 6 5 but 90 in the range of ph 7 10 the adsorption reached equilibrium very quickly and the surface complexation was main adsorption mechanism of oxidized mwcnts for pb ii removal wang et al 95 and sun et al 96 respectively confirmed that oxidized mwcnts can be used for the adsorption and removal of u or co in water and tofighy et al 97 found that the preference order of oxidized cnt sheets to adsorption heavy metal was pb ii cd ii co ii zn ii cu ii in a words oxidation means rich oxygen containing functional groups satisfactory hydrophily 98 and obvious advance of adsorption capacity furtherly what noteworthy is that oxidized cnts can be further modified to achieve more targeted optimization or modification by functional groups transforming in many cases the realization of amination and thiol functionalization requires acid oxidation treatment first 70 99 and oxidation is commonly regarded as the previous step for other modification methods 41 76 87 3 2 2 2 cnts grafting functional groups amino derivatized cnts hayati et al 32 used concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid to oxidize cnts and prepared poly amidoamine cnts by the reactions with 2 4 diisocyanate and ethylenediamine the experiment showed an excellent performance of this modified cnts at ph 7 the adsorption capacity of cu2 and pb2 can reach 3333 mg g and 4870 mg g respectively thiol derivatized cnts bandaru et al 57 treated swcnt using concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid to obtain carboxyl functionalized cnts powder then added the powder to the coupling agent of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopyl carbodiimide and n hydroxysuccinimide and heated the mixture in the ethanol solution of cystine hydrochloride to get thiol derivatized swnt sh according to the adsorption experiment of hg ii in aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of this material is about three times of that of unmodified carbon nanotubes and four times of that of ac furthermore the complexation between mercapto and hg2 ions took place in this chemical adsorption process and the maximum adsorption capacity predicted was 131 mg g other functionalized cnts bankole et al 41 dispersed the cnts purified by concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid in dimethylformamide dmf then added titanium chloride solution and heated the mixture after drying polyhydroxylbutyrate phb and dimethylformamide dmf were added for reheating to obtain phb functionalized cnts phb cnts the results of adsorption experiments show that the heavy metal removal efficiency of phb cnts are higher than that of the non functionalized cnts and the removal efficiency of cd pb cu cr and as were higher than 98 in addition low toxic phb functionalized cnts are easy to product to remove heavy metals in electroplating wastewater effectively 3 2 2 3 magnetic cnts in general cnts are suspended in water after adsorption which is difficult to collect and treat therefore the starting point of magnetization of carbonaceous materials is to facilitate the subsequent separation from the solution 100 and to realize rapid dosing separation cycle in an external magnetic field 101 common magnetization method is to use fecl3 101 fecl2 4h2o 38 feso4 7h2o 62 or other iron salts to generate magnetic fe3o4 91 on adsorbents sadegh et al 58 used nitric acid and microwave radiation to treat mwcnts firstly and then mwcnts and fe3o4 nanoparticles were immersed in ethanol solution to prepare magnetic mwcnts according to the adsorption research of hg ii the cooh group on mwcnts and fe3o4 nanoparticles form a large network structure and the maximum adsorption capacity of 238 78 mg g the hg ii adsorption on magnetic mwcnts was mainly caused by electrostatic adsorption and complexation in addition the network structure of this material provides a large number of binding sites for heavy metal adsorption magnetization makes carbon based materials convenient for efficient separation from treatment finished solution and accessible for mechanized operation so magnetic metal compounds are commonly chosen to be supported by cnts or other carbon based materials which has been widely applied in magnetization 101 3 3 gn based materials 3 3 1 gn analogues gn based materials are gn and its derivatives including gn graphene oxide go reduced graphene oxide rgo and their compounds with organic or inorganic substances respectively among them gn go and rgo are typical gn analogues 102 and most of the other derivatives are based on the modification of these three materials gn go and rgo are closely related and the main difference among them are their c o as shown in table 4 it is considered that the oxygen content of go is the highest and that of gn is very low while the oxygen content of rgo has a large span 102 go and rgo have more oxygen containing functional groups than gn therefore they have more obvious hydrophilicity and dispersion to combine with heavy metal ions through covalent bond and electrostatic action 64 3 3 1 1 gn gn is one of the latest carbon nano material in a narrow sense gn refers to a two dimensional single layer graphite hybridized by carbon atom sp2 with a specific surface area of nearly 2630 m2 g 64 but nowadays gn is a generalized concept and some three dimensional materials with multi layer carbon atomic layer structure are also called gn 102 or 3d gn 103 there are two ways to prepare gn one is the top down method including mechanical exfoliation of bulk pristine graphite or chemically treated graphite go reducing and microwave assisted method 104 the other is the bottom up method including pyrolysis method 105 chemical deposition 103 and epitaxial growth on sic 106 the so called top down approach is that the preparation process of gn is accompanied by the reduction of the dimension of raw materials e g graphite such as the conversion from 3d to 2d or 2d to 1d while the bottom up approach on the contrary is the process of the dimension increasing such as the conversion from carbon atom or carbon containing molecule to gn with 2d or 3d structure 107 in fact it is rare to use raw graphene as adsorbent to remove heavy metals in water the preparation process of gn is usually used as a reference for the production of graphene based materials by comparison the structure of 3d gn can be artificially controlled by the choice of substrate so 3d gn is prepared directly e g the preparation of foam graphene by chemical deposition for more wider utilization 103 3 3 1 2 go go is usually prepared by oxidation of graphite or gn with strong oxidant it has high oxygen content a large number of oxygen containing functional groups such as co coc oh and cooh on the surface and has stronger hydrophilicity than carbon nanotubes 98 go is superior to gn in heavy metal adsorption due to its rich oxygen containing functional groups typical oxidation methods include hummers method brodie method staudenmaier method and improved method based on these methods 69 traditional brodie method and staudenmaier method have longer reaction time and are more prone to explosion than hummers method relatively hummers method is safer and faster 108 however these three methods are able to produce harmful gases such as no2 n2o2 and clo2 more or less so the current oxidation methods are mostly based on the improvement of hummers method 109 in the improved hummers method the mixed acid of concentrated sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid 9 1 is used instead of concentrated sulfuric and compared with hummers method the modified hummers method brought higher oxidation degree more oxygen containing functional groups and larger layer spacing to go 108 raghubanshi et al 108 prepared go by hummers method and found that the adsorption capacity of go benefited from the interaction between pb ii and functional groups on go and the large specific surface area and lamellar structure of graphene oxide also played a crucial role tan et al 71 used modified hummers to prepare go powder for cu ii adsorption the experiment results showed that a higher oxidation degree brought a larger adsorption capacity to go the complexation and electrostatic attraction between cu2 and oxygen containing functional groups were main adsorption mechanism in that process in addition they found that na would influence the adsorption by competitive adsorption behavior jun et al 59 confirmed that cu ii cd ii zn ii and pb ii can be effectively removed in their single metal solution by go respectively and found the removal efficiency of pb ii was highest with a maximum adsorption capacity of 555 mg g go could effectively adsorb pb ii mainly due to its oxygen containing functional groups and the order of metal ions adsorption was pb2 cu2 cd2 zn2 3 3 1 3 rgo rgo as the name indicates is one more stable product of reducing and removing some oxygen containing functional groups from go yet some oxygen containing functional groups still are remained and there are two reduction methods one is heat treatment such as microwave heating or strong flash evaporation to decompose oxygen containing functional groups into co or co2 gas to escape from solid matter the other is chemical reduction which can reduce oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go by chemical reducing agent of hydrazine metal hydride and hydrohalic acid 98 or plant extract 60 due to the toxicity of hydrazine lin et al 60 thought that plant extracts should be considered as reducing agent of go which contains reducing substances such as phenols amino acids caffeine and vitamins and have no biological toxicity so green tea extract was used to prepare rgo for pb ii removal in water the experimental results show that whole adsorption process was exothermic and high temperature counted against adsorption the main mechanism of pb ii adsorption was cation π bonding in experiment at 30 c the adsorption removal efficiency of pb ii reached 96 6 when the solution ph 4 5 the dosage of rgo was 0 4 g l and the initial concentration of pb ii in the solution was 10 mg l 3 3 2 gn analogues grafting functional groups gn go and rgo can be compounded with organic compounds to introduce certain functional groups to prepare gn analogue based materials some organic compounds e g chitosan β cyclodextrin have strong adsorption capacity 34 so the composites can play the adsorption properties of both organic materials and gn analogue to improve the adsorption 3 3 2 1 chitosan go composite chitosan is the n deacetylation product of chitin which is a kind of natural polysaccharide its molecules are rich in amino and hydroxyl groups 34 so in recent years it often participates in the modification of graphene based materials as aminated materials 61 samuel et al 61 dispersed go in distilled water and added chitosan and nabh4 to obtain go chitosan composite the maximum adsorption capacity of cr vi was 104 16 mg g and the main mechanism was the complexation between cr vi and oh nh in addition go chitosan composite performed good regeneration ability because the adsorption efficiency of cr vi on go chitosan composite decreased from 96 to 82 after 10 adsorption desorption cycle sherlala et al 38 used magnetic chitosan go material to studied the as iii removal the adsorption experiment showed that the neutral water environment was conducive to the adsorption of as iii and the main adsorption mechanism was the complexation of as iii in the form of h3aso3 with nh2 oh and oh2 on the surface of magnetic chitosan go 3 3 2 2 β cyclodextrin go composite β cyclodextrin is a kind of cyclic oligosaccharide which is composed of seven glucose units it has a hydrophilic cavity with hydrophobic internal surface and hydrophilic external surface the hydrophobic cavity of β cyclodextrin can form host guest inclusion with many kinds of organics and metal ions 110 and the surface hydroxyl can also form complex with metal ions 48 63 111 which has been used to be modifier 112 to develop eco friendly adsorbents ma et al 62 used β cyclodextrin modified magnetic go to carried out adsorption experiments of pb ii and cu ii they found that the adsorption capacities of pb ii and cu ii could rapidly increase to a higher level in a short time and the removal efficiency of pb ii reached 82 67 in 15 min the estimated maximum adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 279 21 mg g and 93 97 mg g respectively and the complexation between go and heavy metal ions contribute a lot and huang et al 111 confirmed that the cooh on β cyclodextrin can provide adsorption sites for cu ii wang et al 63 prepared β cyclodextrin ethylenediamine magnetic go to carried out the adsorption experiment of cr vi surface diffusion and internal diffusion exist in the adsorption process and the adsorption of cr vi hcro4 in water by this material was attributed to three aspects the electrostatic interaction between hcro4 anion and composite material the host guest interaction with β cyclodextrin hydrophobic cavity and the combination with hydroxyl groups on go 3 3 3 gn analogues compounding supporting inorganic substance similar to bc ac zero valent metals and metal compounds are typical substance often supported by carbonaceous materials 3 3 3 1 d gn compounding polymetallic compound wang et al 113 studied the nife layered double hydroxide and inserted a mos4 2 into the lamellar structure to form a polymetallic compound the polymetallic compound was assembled on the surface of 3d gn foam to get a porous lamellar mixed block nife mos4 2 ldh cf for hg2 pb2 and cu2 removal it was found that the rougher surface provided a large number of adsorption sites so that the calculated maximum adsorption capacities of hg2 pb2 and cu2 were 462 299 and 128 mg g respectively and their adsorption efficiency could exceed 99 and the adsorption mechanism was mainly the complexation of mos4 2 to heavy metals due to the superior adsorption performance this porous lamellar mixed block could be applied in the drinking water purification 3 3 3 2 go metal oxide nanohybrid mohan et al 64 prepared go mgo nanohybrid by precipitation and the adsorption experiment indicated this composites could remove pb2 ions from drinking water without ph and temperature changes nearly with a high adsorption capacity of pb2 190 mg g and the ideal conditions concluded was low dosage 0 4 g l 30 and ph 6 5 the internal diffusion and external diffusion dominated the adsorption process and ion exchange and complexation took place on go mgo nanohybrid between pb2 and cooh or oh and mg2 ions in the materials also provided many sites for exchanging with pb2 3 3 3 3 zvi rgo composite wang et al 65 prepared the nzvi rgo composite in the adsorption experiment of as the maximum adsorption capacity of as3 and as5 are 35 83 mg g and 29 04 mg g respectively and the adsorption of as3 was mainly caused by surface complexation while the adsorption of as5 was realized by complexation and electrostatic interaction it was noteworthy that ph value of the solution had a great influence on the adsorption of as3 and as5 the forms of as vi could be h2aso4 hass4 2 and aso4 3 with the increase of ph adsorption efficiency of as iii would be variable due to the form of as iii which could be h3aso3 and or h2aso3 under different ph values 3 4 regeneration of carbon based materials the carbon based adsorbents could keep their adsorption capacity at a high level after several adsorption desorption cycles at present acid or alkali are generally applied to the desorption and regeneration of carbon based materials 3 4 1 regeneration in acid solution acid method regeneration means that the carbon based materials after adsorption are immersed in acid solution for desorption thoroughly washed and dried then became available for the next adsorption sulfuric acid nitric acid and hydrochloric acid solution can be used to desorb heavy metals from carbon based materials and general regeneration are as follows steps 1 carbon based adsorbents are immersed in acid solution with certain concentration or ph 32 and sonicated for several minutes 2 after filtration the adsorbents are washed with ethanol and deionized water 3 the adsorbents are dried at certain temperature for the next adsorption desorption cycle 57 3 4 1 1 regeneration in nitric acid or sulfuric acid solution after repeated adsorption desorption cycles though there are slightly decreases in adsorption efficiency of carbon based adsorbent the high values of adsorption capacity and removal efficiency still are accessible when the regeneration process under the most appropriate concentration of acid solution saleh et al 79 used 0 1 m 0 25 m and 0 5 m nitric acid solution to establish the regeneration performance of ac after adsorbing hg ii respectively and the recovery of adsorption capacity were 50 80 and 95 tahir et al found that after three adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiency of magnetic hydroxypropyl graphene for pb ii and cu ii was still above 80 with a small loss of adsorptive capacity and sulfuric acid was used desorption reagent 114 when the heavy metals exist in water as anions the sulfuric acid method is more worthy to be considered samuel et al found that so4 2 may decrease cr vi adsorption due to the opposition among anions which can be beneficial to cr vi desorption efficiency 61 in addition shang et al found that so4 2 improved the removal of cr vi by increasing the number of reactive sites and corrosion rate of zvi 67 for nitric acid method in comparison the opposition among anions no3 and heavy metal anions is weak therefore nitric acid solution is used more frequently in the adsorption of cation 3 4 1 2 regeneration in hydrochloric acid solution hydrochloric acid solution is the most frequently used desorption reagent in acid method regeneration because it has no oxidation property and cl has little influence on the adsorption of most heavy metal ions the regeneration of bc 86 cnts sh 57 and go 47 can be regenerated by hydrochloric acid with high desorption efficiency wang et al proved that hydrochloric acid solution can effectively desorb zn on gn and the desorption efficiency reached 91 6 47 jun et al 59 found that the adsorption efficiency of go for pb ii was nearly invariable during three adsorption desorption cycles to the regeneration in acid solution a selection of desorption agent is significant to regeneration of carbon based materials for example peng et al used 0 1 m hcl solution 0 1 m hno3 solution and deionization to desorb zn2 adsorbed on go and found the desorption efficiency were 91 6 73 4 and 53 2 respectively 69 3 4 2 regeneration in alkali solution the alkali method is similar to the acid method which regenerate carbon based materials by immersing ma et al 46 found that after the first regeneration of bc in 1 m naoh solution the adsorption efficiency of cr vi decreased from 97 9 to 91 57 and after three adsorption desorption cycles the adsorption rate of cr vi reached 70 65 samuel et al 61 used 1 m naoh as desorption reagent to regenerate go chitosan after 10 adsorption desorption cycles the adsorption capacity of cr vi decreased slightly and the removal efficiency decreased from 96 to 82 in addition to naoh yu et al successfully regenerated zno bc composite with dilute ammonia water and the adsorption efficiency of cr vi was 67 1 after 5 adsorption desorption cycles 80 actually naoh solution is used more frequently than dilute ammonia solution in alkali method regeneration and the regeneration research of other alkali solutions for carbon based is inadequate acid method and alkali method are main strategies to regenerate carbon based materials although edta 69 and na2edta 115 were also used to respectively regenerate gn and go there are few related studies in addition to solvent regeneration methods such as acid and alkali in situ regeneration technology such as catalysis can also be considered 119 the regeneration method with high desorption rate cheap desorption reagent simple regeneration process and suitable for industrial application needs to be developed 4 conclusion and outlook ac bc cnts and gn analogues are three typical carbonaceous materials which are used to develop carbon based adsorbents for carbon based adsorbents surface complexation ion exchange and electrostatic interaction are main mechanisms for heavy metal removal and ph play a key role in adsorption the langmuir or freundlich adsorption isotherms often have better fitness than other models in studies of carbon based adsorbents so they have been applied in more cases the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic model are also universal and the latter is more common for desorption acid method and alkali method still are main strategies to regenerate carbon based adsorbents though adsorption mechanism modification and regeneration have been studied in some literatures for removing heavy metal from aqueous solution there still are some issues 1 current researches on the adsorption and removal of various heavy metals in water mostly focus on the heavy metal cation but few specific adsorption studies of their hydroxy compound ions or other complex ions usually the adsorption of complex ions is mentioned as a small part in documents 2 on the one hand the modified carbonaceous materials can achieve high adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of heavy metals on the other hand the modification operation is complex especially chemical modification considering the cost yield and or operation complexity these preparation methods of modified materials are not conducive to industrial production and some new modifiers may also bring new pollutions 3 many carbon based materials are powders even after magnetization they may migrate and lose in the water with strong fluidity resulting in lower recovery rate and secondary pollution 4 current regeneration of acid or alkali used in carbon based materials will cause mass loss strength reduction and adsorption capacity reduction which need to be further optimized while other regeneration methods are lack of systematic research in addition waste desorption reagent treatment is also need to be studied given the above issues more attention should be paid to the following directions the selective adsorption and the competitive adsorption behavior among heavy metal ions are worth to further study the combination and simplification of modification operations can make the industrial large scale production of carbon based adsorbents come true which meet actual cases better but with lower cost in order to facilitate the collection and prevent secondary pollution 3d gn go sponge and other new carbon based materials with three dimensional structure are prospective heavy metal adsorbents as for regeneration the properties of carbon based materials operation conditions of regeneration process and the development of desorption solution are significant and practical in future research for making full use of carbon based adsorbents declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was financially

13893,heavy metal contamination has been a serious threat to environment and human health carbon based materials from biochar activated carbon to modified materials i e carbon nanotubes based materials and graphene based materials have been widely studied as efficient adsorbents for the heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions this review discussed the recent achievements in adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetics and adsorption mechanism according to the existing forms of heavy metals in water the effect of process conditions such as temperature ph value and coexisting ions on adsorption performance are combed and the universal guidance law is obtained the physical adsorption electrostatic interaction ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation coprecipitation play important roles in heavy metals adsorption process in addition to the common activated carbon ac biochar bc and the emerging carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene gn adsorbent show good development potentials meanwhile though the modified carbonaceous materials can achieve high adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of heavy metals the modification operation is complex especially chemical modification acid and alkali solution are often used to regenerate spent materials in desorption however further studies of other desorption reagent are really needed this review highlights the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution using carbon based materials as adsorbents and discusses the existing deficiencies and suggestions on further study keywords heavy metal adsorption carbon based materials desorption 1 introduction the development of mining smelting chemical industry battery manufacturing and the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers caused a huge emission of heavy metals in surface water and ground water 1 2 pb cu cr cd hg zn ni as and other heavy metals could be refractory and accumulated in organisms 2 3 to trigger poisoning or chronic diseases in united states japan india and turkey it was reported that some rivers wetlands or bays suffered from heavy metal contamination 4 7 in recent years heavy metals pollution accidents occurred frequently in china taihu lake chaohu lake dongting lake poyang lake tributaries of songhua river pearl river jiulong river and other freshwater resources are polluted by heavy metals in different degrees 3 8 12 heavy metal pollution has become a great danger to human health and the safety of water drinking and water using today chemical precipitation electrochemical method ion exchange membrane filtration and adsorption are used to the removal of heavy metals in water and these technologies show their advantages and disadvantages in real situations please refer to table a1 considering the removal capacity energy consumption sensitivity of operation conditions and secondary pollution adsorption method is the best choice 1 common adsorbents include low cost materials carbonaceous materials and modified materials 13 and these adsorbents have so wide ranges of variety and sources that they can be selected according to local conditions by different countries and regions 14 16 importantly easy operation renewable adsorbent and low toxicity are main characteristics of adsorption 17 18 which bring a broad application prospects to adsorption in heavy metals remove in water carbon based materials are powdered or bulk non metallic solid materials with carbon as the main ingredient which includes activated carbon biochar ac bc carbon nanotubes cnts and graphene gn analogues etc they have the outstanding advantages of large specific surface area abundant pore structure good thermal stability high mechanical strength 19 high adsorption capacity and controllable morphology 20 in order to better meet the requirements of water quality a lot of development and improvement work has been done therefore various carbonaceous materials and their derivatives were developed many modification methods have been developed for the enhanced removal of heavy metal ions such as oxidization magnetization functional group graft and compositing with inorganic substances 21 some studies have reviewed modified ac bc cnts or gn analogues adsorbents respectively but the certain guidelines for modification and the inherent mechanisms are not clearly stated 22 23 in fact the modification methods or adsorption mechanisms involved in these studies are similar thus a summarization can be meaningful to examine carbon based adsorbents as a whole for heavy metal removal and the regeneration strategy also should be systematically considered this review aims to highlight the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution using carbon based adsorbents the adsorption behavior model fitting process factors as well as the adsorption mechanism are briefly introduced the universal modification methods and the regeneration process of several typical carbon materials e g ac bc cnts and gn adsorbent are classified and summarized this review provides clue for three typical carbonaceous materials to develop carbon based adsorbents in heavy metal removal and the perspectives of further research are presented 2 adsorption behavior of heavy metals in aqueous solution heavy metal has been regarded as extremely dangerous environmental pollution which are toxic to human beings even at low concentrations level and possible to trigger poisoning or chronic diseases 23 24 when the heavy metals enter the water they always exist in different forms such as cations anions and hydroxide complexes 25 26 depending on the conditions of dissolved oxygen ph and organic matter content the insoluble metal oxide or easily deposited heavy metal salt such as cuo pbo zns and pbso4 27 are not the key targets for adsorption relatively as shown in table 1 the adsorption behavior of soluble heavy metals such as pb ii cd ii cr vi cu ii zn ii ni ii hg ii and as v are most studied 28 2 1 common adsorption models of carbon based adsorbents with the adsorption process going on the adsorption and desorption rate will eventually reach the same state that is adsorption equilibrium in relative studies adsorption isotherm and kinetic model are often used to fit the adsorption process 29 30 2 1 1 adsorption isotherm under certain temperature conditions there are some certain relationships between adsorbate and unabsorbed adsorbate on the adsorbent surface in water these relationships can be described by isothermal model as shown below 15 31 34 1 l a n g m u i r a d s o r p t i o n i s

the polanyi potential r is ideal gas constant 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k among these formulas langmuir isotherm freundlich isotherm and extended langmuir isotherm models are often used in the study of adsorption of heavy metals on carbon materials 21 35 as shown in table 1 langmuir isotherm is more frequently used in heavy metal adsorption studies of carbon based materials which implies chemical monolayer adsorption and the adsorption performance of adsorbent surface is uniform 17 31 36 however some carbon based adsorbents do not meet that ideal uniform condition 16 and freundlich isotherm can be used as an empirical formula without hypothetical conditions for multilayer adsorption 34 for example xu et al found that freundlich simulated the pb ii adsorption data of oxidized multiwalled cnts better than langmuir 37 in addition real water body might be binary system or multi system hayati et al found that when used cnts modified by amination to adsorb cu ii and pb ii in their binary system the adsorption data was fitted better by extended langmuir isotherm than langmuir isotherm 32 although sherlala et al found that temkin isotherm provided an evidence for ion exchange by one kind of functionalized cnts and showed higher r2 than that of langmuir or freundlich isotherm in their study 38 there are few mentions of temkin isotherm in other studies for heavy metal adsorption and also d r model is rare in studies it is noteworthy that to determine which model the adsorption process conform to should not only rely on r2 of the fitting equation but also judged by its basic hypothesis however the basic hypothesis of some adsorbents is unclear and the data meets two isotherms well then the estimation of adsorption capacity requires other reports 39 40 2 1 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics are elucidated by studying the change of adsorptive capacity or adsorptive rate of adsorbent the commonly used kinetic models are shown in follow equations 31 41 42 7 the pseudo first order model log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 8 t h e p s e u d o s e c o n d o r d e r m o d e l t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 9 t h e w e b e r m o r r

materials is often described using the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic models while the latter is used more frequently 43 see table 1 wang et al found the adsorption data of using willow wood bc and cattle manure bc to adsorb ni cu and cd fitted well the pseudo first order model 44 in general the pseudo first order model assumes that there is reversible physical adsorption in the adsorption processes 45 however the pseudo second order model is most frequently used in the adsorption of heavy metals by carbon materials in this review which means that the adsorption of carbon materials is mostly chemical 46 49 elovich kinetic model describes adsorption in heterogeneous systems influenced by reaction rate and diffusion factor together 41 and there are few carbon based adsorbents studies about it for heavy metal removal the application of the weber morris equation is mainly to further determine whether the adsorption process is dominated by internal diffusion only 42 in these kinetic models contact time obviously is an important variable which relates to adsorption capacity 50 exactly due to the time to meet that equilibrium is different for various heavy metals the contact time should be considered especially when there is a binary system or multi system of heavy metals 51 2 2 effects of process factors on heavy metals removal ph temperature initial concentration and coexisting ions are main factors of adsorption for heavy metals which affect the performance of carbon based adsorbent material in heavy metals removal 2 2 1 effect of ph the ph value reflects the concentration level of h in water and ion exchange and electrostatic interaction are greatly influenced by h concentration different carbon based materials possess different phpzc values which refer to the ph value when the zeta potential of adsorbents reaches zero 35 as shown in table 2 the effect of ph is obvious for adsorption performance of carbon based adsorbents when the ph value is lower than phpzc value it is not only meaning that more h could exchange with heavy metal cations 21 but also the high concentration of h would protonate the surface functional groups e g nh2 oh of carbon based materials so that the number of surface positive charges obtains an increase 46 62 then due to the electrostatic repulsion the adsorption of heavy metal cations would meet a decrease in water meanwhile the adsorption effect of anions e g hcro4 becomes better 63 when ph value increases even higher than phpzc deprotonation brings back the negative charge for functional groups 46 thus showing the opposite effect of cations and anions therefore in heavy metal cation adsorption the phpzc of carbon based adsorbents should be more acidic for a wider operational range of ph on the contrary the phpzc should be more alkaline for anionic 35 in addition the ionic form of heavy metal ions also connects with h concentration 36 66 these different forms of ions have different affinity to functional groups 67 which ultimately affect the adsorption capacity 2 2 2 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on adsorption is generally related to the thermodynamic nature of the adsorption process and some parameters such as enthalpy change δh free energy change δg and entropy δs 68 which are evaluated from thermodynamic equations 64 11 l n k c δ h r t δ s r 12 δ g r t l n k c where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol and t k is the absolute temperature δg and δh can be auxiliary explanation of adsorption behavior by evaluating the isotherm data 59 in this review negative δg and positive δh in most adsorption of heavy metals by carbon materials indicating that the adsorption process are spontaneous and the adsorption capacity would increase with increasing temperature in certain range 69 for instance mohan et al confirmed the adsorption of pb ii by mgo loaded graphene oxide at 20 is lower than the state at 30 64 however hadavifar et al found that hg ii adsorption onto mwcnts sh was more efficient at lower temperatures with the negative δg and negative δh 70 therefore the adsorption process of one carbon based material also could be exothermic reaction 36 furthermore peng et al believed that temperature can cause changes in solubility and intermolecular interactions and it might be the reason of the temperature influencing the adsorption processes 69 however it is favorable that adsorption taking place at normal temperature for real situation see in table a2 so extra heating or cooling of solution should be avoided as far as possible 2 2 3 effect of initial concentration within a certain concentration range the adsorption capacity for heavy metals keeps increasing with an increase of initial concentration when carbon based adsorbent has not met a saturation one reason for this is that higher initial concentration contributes to an increases of the transfer power from solution to carbon based materials surface 32 but when the initial concentration is set at a higher level all adsorption sites would be occupied and or the adsorbent surface is covered by the firstly adsorbed heavy metal ions 64 then the interaction between those unabsorbed heavy metal ions and carbon based adsorbents would be hindered so an exorbitant initial concentration of target heavy metal ions will meet a decrease in the adsorption efficiency for later adsorption stage in addition the change of pollutant concentration will also affect the fitting degree of adsorption isotherm model in some cases increasing the initial concentration of pollutants will make the adsorption transition from single molecular layer to multi molecular layer which will lead to the change of the best fitted adsorption model 2 2 4 effect of coexisting ions in solution ionic strength can represent the background electrolyte concentration which affects the interface potential and thickness of the double layer 36 some coexisting cations or anions with different strength would play a role in heavy metal ions removal by carbon based adsorbents in three aspects firstly different heavy metal ions coexisting in a certain space compete with each other for adsorption sites the adsorption capacity or removal efficiency of adsorbent would perform a relative decrease when the system containing two or more kinds of cations or anions compared with single system park et al confirmed that the adsorption capacity of bc in a mixed system of cd2 pb2 was lower than that of cd2 or pb2 single metal system respectively 52 and the existence and difference of this competitive adsorption behaviors are decided by electric charges and hydrated radius of those cations which cause different affinity to adsorption sites on carbon based adsorbents in binary system or multi system 42 secondly high concentration of k na ca2 and mg2 in waters can also compete with heavy metal cations to bring a decrease of the heavy metal adsorption efficiency 53 71 72 thirdly anions would interact with heavy metal cations to form coordination ions or precipitation and compete with heavy metal anions for adsorption sites for instance the existence of so4 2 in the solution can enhance the precipitation and reduction of cr vi while the existence of hco3 could affect the valence transition of fe and inhibit the cr vi removal 67 however so4 2 can result a decline of cr vi removal efficiency duo to competition behavior and smaller negative charges of no3 and cl make them show weak effects in adsorption of cr vi 36 and more studies of coexisting anions need to be developed furtherly for example the possibility and effect of hg2cl2 precipitation formed by cl and hg in hg ii adsorption process have not been defined clearly 66 in aqueous solution duo to the most of heavy metal ions are cations the phpzc of carbon based adsorbents should be acidic for a wider operational range of ph but the differences of phpzc of carbon based materials require various ph in real situation and current researches should be further developed in effect of coexisting anions and a normal temperature for adsorption process should be considered 2 3 adsorption mechanisms there are five main types of adsorption for heavy metal on carbon based materials as shown in fig 1 1 physical adsorption a process about diffusion and deposition of heavy metal ions in the pore of the adsorbent material does not form chemical bonds which depends on the pore size distribution and surface area of the adsorbent itself exactly the increases of micropores and mesoporous can increase surface area and facilitate contaminant diffusion which can promote physical adsorption and accelerate adsorption kinetics 73 for instance fahmi et al studied the adsorption performance of grated empty fruit bunch bc and found that higher surface area and more exposed microporous can bring a promotion of pb ii adsorption capacity 74 2 electrostatic interaction when negative or positive charges are carried on the adsorbent surface the electrostatic attraction would play a role in adsorption process between adsorbent and opposite charged ions previous studies confirmed that electrostatic interaction is one of mechanisms for heavy metal adsorption by ac cnts and gn 21 the surfaces of most carbon based materials are variably charged and as mentioned in 2 2 1 solution ph and phpzc of adsorbents can influence the electrostatic interaction and the interaction between protonated or deprotonated functional groups and heavy metal ions can be available on carbon based adsorbents surface such as the electrostatic attraction between protonated nh3 with hcro4 cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 63 3 ion exchange ion exchange usually occurs between divalent metal cations m2 and the proton of oxygen containing functional groups cooh oh and cation exchange capacity cec is an indicator of this 21 lai et al found this removal mechanism contributes a lot to the adsorption of heavy metals by ac bc 75 however according the research of peng et al the metal mineral ions such as k na ca2 mg2 contained in graphene oxide also showed capability to exchange with heavy metal cations 69 4 surface complexation on the adsorbents surface functional groups such as oh cooh o and co nh react with heavy metal ions especially m2 or complexes such as cd oh pb oh for heavy metals enrichment from aqueous solution 66 and surface complexation forms multiatom structures in reaction processes 21 there are many reports have mentioned that cd2 cu2 and ni2 could complex with oh and cooh 76 78 for instance li et al found that surface complexation might was an important mechanism in cd pb and hg removal which contributed by oh or cooh on bc surface 66 and hadavifar et al found that sh can complex with hg2 on thiol derivatized cnts surface 70 5 precipitation coprecipitation heavy metal ions can form solid precipitates or coprecipitate with other ions and groups on adsorbent surface to dissociate from water liu et al found that the coprecipitation can be observed obviously in adsorption systems with high concentration of heavy metal ions 17 and it can occurs on carbon based adsorbents surface repeatedly 21 such as the precipitation or coprecipitation as cdco3 cd3 po4 2 and probably cd oh 2 on bc in cd removal 56 sometimes reduction plays a role in the heavy metal removal some high valent heavy metal ions are not directly adsorbed but reduced to low valent states firstly such as cr vi being reduced to cr iii hg2 being reduced to hg2cl2 due to the electronegativity of the carbon materials themselves and then removed by complexation and ion exchange 66 table 3 shows the contributions of those mechanisms in adsorption processes taking place on carbon based materials for these mechanisms they are universal for most of carbon based adsorbents however while precipitation coprecipitation may occur in adsorption processes it is not commonly regarded as the main mechanisms of heavy metals adsorption in fact the differences in physical or chemical properties of carbon based materials often make them perform different adsorption behavior and the properties of various carbon based materials are usually determined by their preparation process bc for example deng et al 78 and yu et al 80 found that the higher porosity larger specific surface area more obvious graphite crystal structure and higher ph value can be obtained at higher pyrolysis temperature meanwhile less oxygen containing functional groups affects physical or chemical adsorption efficiency in addition it can be notable that most studies concentrated on the heavy metal ions and the removal studies of hydroxide complexes or other heavy metal complexes ions are inadequate 81 3 application of carbon based adsorbents in adsorption of heavy metals carbonaceous materials have abundant pores and functional groups which can be used for heavy metal removal in water and roughly classified into three categories ac bc based materials cnts based materials and gn based materials namely the development of various modified materials based on ac bc cnts and gn are the three main lines for the development of carbon based adsorbent 3 1 ac bc based materials ac is produced by pyrolysis and activation of wood coal lignite and other carbon containing raw materials 82 83 and it is amorphous carbon solid with black powder granular massive and honeycomb shapes ac can be obtained by pyrolysis and activation of most carbon rich substances in principle so the sources of it are very wide bc a porous solid materials 80 with carbon as the main component were obtained by biomass pyrolysis 84 such as botanic materials and agricultural waste bc is similar to ac or there is no clear boundary between them in the studies and utilization of them in heavy metal adsorption 3 1 1 ac and bc 3 1 1 1 agricultural waste derived ac bc rice husk carbon khan et al 85 mixed dried rice husk and sulfuric acid and heated the mixture for a period of time then the rice husk carbon was obtained after the adsorption experiment of cr vi removal it was found that when the initial concentration of cr vi was 80 mg l and ph 2 cr vi would be completely adsorbed after 120 min deng et al 78 carried out the adsorption experiments of cd ii and ni ii with rice husk carbon the equilibrium adsorption capacity of cd ii and ni ii was 65 40 mg g and 54 60 mg g respectively but in the binary system of cd ii and ni ii the competition of these two heavy metals for the adsorption sites leaded to the decrease of adsorption capacity in addition ion exchange adsorption and precipitation were main adsorption mechanism corn straw porous carbon ma et al 46 used corn straw as raw material to prepare corn straw porous carbon and carried out related adsorption experiment of cr vi the results showed that maximum adsorption capacity of cr vi was 175 44 mg g and the removal efficiency was 70 65 after three adsorption desorption cycles several mechanisms were included in the adsorption process 1 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 were trapped in micropores 2 ion exchange and complexation took place between cr vi and oxygen containing functional groups e g cooh oh and c o c 3 cr vi was reduced to cr iii by ror or roh the removal efficiency of cr vi in real electroplating wastewater was 97 9 with an obvious selectivity compared with ni2 and cu2 in water discarded mushroom stick bc wang et al 53 pyrolyzed the discarded mushroom stick at 300 500 and 800 respectively to get bc marked dmb3 dmb5 and dmb8 the adsorption of the bc on pb ii cu ii cd ii and ni ii was studied dmb8 provided the maximum adsorption capacity of those heavy metals and it probably was that higher pyrolysis temperature help the dbm to form more aromatic structure and allowed larger number of initial mineral ions e g na ca2 and ma2 to exchange with heavy metal ions 3 1 1 2 other botanic material based bc some plants are not regarded as crops because of their low economic value but thanks to their large carbon rich biomass it is possible that considering those botanic materials as raw materials to prepare bc take water hyacinth as example zhang et al 56 used water hyacinth as raw material to pyrolysis it in n2 atmosphere to produce bc they studied the cd ii adsorption on the bc and found that when the initial concentration of cd2 was 50 mg l the removal efficiency of cd2 was close to 100 in a short time and the maximum adsorption capacity was 70 31 mg g ion exchange and surface complexation was dominant mechanisms in cd2 adsorption and the coprecipitation of cd2 or cd oh with bc and the electrostatic adsorption of cd2 by bc also played a role the results of the report made by ding et al 86 showed the adsorption capacity and activity of water hyacinth bc to pb are stronger than that of cd in the binary system and cation π interaction was also one of adsorption mechanisms 3 1 1 3 sludge based bc ho et al 54 pyrolyzed anaerobic digestion sludge to prepare anerobic digestion sludge biochar adsbc for the utilization to remove pb ii cd ii cu ii ni ii zn ii and cr vi from water the adsorption capacities were in the order of pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii ni ii cr vi ion exchange precipitation complexation and electrostatic interaction were main adsorption mechanisms whose contribution in the removal process of pb ii were 33 4 53 5 83 and 4 8 respectively ni et al 55 studied the competitive adsorption between pb ii and cd ii on adsbc the affinity of pb2 to adsorption sites was stronger than that of cd2 so some pb2 arrived at adsbc surface would replace adsorbed cd ii and occupied the sites to prevent the cd2 adsorption 3 1 2 modified ac bc the adsorption capacity of one carbonaceous material can be improved by changing its properties that is modification 84 the modification of ac bc can be achieved by grafting functional groups including amino functionalization sulfur functionalization and other group functionalization 19 or compounding supporting inorganic substances 3 1 2 1 functional groups grafted ac bc some chemical method can be used to increase the number or species of functional group on ac bc surface the amino functionalization e g nh3 and sulfur functionalization e g c s cs or so are grafting nitrogen containing groups and sulfur containing groups respectively on the carbonaceous materials surface other functionalization refers to transforming certain functional groups on carbonaceous materials surface into others or grafting side chain to introduce other functional groups 21 1 amino functionalization faheem et al 76 used chemical method impregnation method to graft amino group on the surface of corncob bc to increase the adsorption capacity of hg ii to about twice as much as the unmodified the corncob bc was slightly oxidized by h2o2 to transform some hydroxyl groups into carboxyl group and immersed and stirred in a mixture solution of ultrapure water urea and naoh then a specific amount of edta was added to obtained amino grafted modified bc according to the adsorption experiment the maximum removal efficiency of hg ii was 97 6 and it was confirmed that hg ii interacted with oh cooh nh2 nh respectively on modified corncob bc via electrostatic attraction surface complexation and ion exchange saleh et al 79 prepared polyethyleneimine functionalized ac to study the hg ii adsorption and found that the adsorption might be caused by the interaction between hg ii and co nh2 2 sulfur functionalization li et al 87 studied the adsorption of cu ii pb ii cd ii and ni ii on thiol functionalized ac the ac was prepared from coal blended sewage sludge and oxidized by nitric acid then the oxidized ac was mixed with dmf n n dimethylformamide after that nahso4 h2o and mercaptoacetic acid were added to react with the ac for a period of time under heating conditions finally the ac was treated with na2s 9h2o and 95 ethanol washed with deionized water and dried to obtain sh ac the adsorption capacity of this material was much higher than that of unmodified ac the maximum adsorption capacities of cu ii pb ii cd ii and ni ii were 238 1 mg g 96 2 mg g 87 7 mg g and 52 4 mg g respectively in addition to the reduction reaction of cu ii complex adsorption was main mechanism for other heavy metal ions modification by functional groups graft has obvious advance of adsorption capacity specific adsorption for certain ions e g sh to hg2 76 different processes with different chemical modifier significantly ratio influenced adsorption capacity and complex preparation process 3 1 2 2 ac bc inorganic substance composite 1 nzvi ac bc composite the specific surface area of nzvi is large which can be used as heavy metal remover by reduction and adsorption but nzvi is easy to agglomerate and form larger particles when it is used alone and the removal efficiency would be disturbed given this defect ac bc is used to support nzvi to overcome the agglomeration of nzvi and this composite has complex structure so the adsorption ability is enhanced 67 there are two common chemical methods to prepare zvi ac composite one is pyrolysis liquid phase reduction method the other is one step pyrolysis method the former is to use bc as support material and immerse it in ferrous salt e g feso4 7h2o solution and use some reducing agent to reduce iron ion to zero valent iron on bc surface the latter is let ferrous salt precipitate on biomass e g rice husk coconut husk by air drying and then pyrolyze the air dried biomass to get bc at the same time bc reduces fe ii to fe0 88 shang et al 67 prepared bc fe by liquid phase reduction method the herbal residue was pyrolyzed to obtain bc and the nzvi was reduced and supported on bc using nabh4 according the adsorption experiment of cr vi the maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 98 71 0 04 and the removal of cr vi was one combination of reduction process and precipitation process a part of cr vi was reduced to cr iii by nzvi and then cr iii and residual cr vi interacted with oxygen containing functional groups on bc fe surface however pyrolysis liquid phase reduction process is time consuming and requires additional reductant so it is not superior to one step pyrolysis in cost 88 wang et al 89 synthesized zvi ac composite by ball milling to avoid a complicated and costly chemical preparation process and the experiment confirmed that the cr vi removal efficiency was 94 01 within 120 min under acidic and anaerobic conditions 2 metal oxide ac bc composites nano single metal oxides and binary metal oxide consist of mno2 mgo and feox are also often used to get carbon based composite materials 66 90 yu et al 80 impregnated water hyacinth bc in zn no3 2 solution and after drying and calcination they obtained the bc zno composite the adsorption experiment of cr vi by the composite showed that the optimal content of zno in the composite was 30 wt and the removal rate of cr vi could be maintained above 95 at natural ph value reduction and precipitation were the main mechanisms zhou et al 90 dispersed bc in the mixture of kmno4 and fe no3 3 by ultrasound and pyrolyzed it to obtain bc loading fe mn binary oxide the results show that the maximum adsorption capacity of cu ii and cd ii were 64 9 mg g and 101 0 mg g respectively which much as three times of capacities of bc the complexation of divalent metal ion cu2 or cd2 with fe mnox cooh and oh was the main adsorption mechanism while cation π bounding also plays a role in adsorption process inorganic substances being supported on carbon base is one method for carbon based materials modification 67 but objectionable agglomeration of zero valent metal or other nonmagnetic metal compounds would not be completely evitable 65 which need further research 3 2 cnts based materials 3 2 1 cnts due to the revolution of nanotechnology cnts perform obvious operability for better heavy metal adsorption efficiency compared to ac bc and met an extensive utilization in environmental remediation 91 cnts are a kind of hollow cylinder formed by a net composed of large number of carbon atoms covalently combined each other with hexagonal structure according to the number of net layers cnts can be divided into single walled carbon nanotube swcnt and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt 92 cnts have hydrophobicity electrode abundant pore structure and functional groups and performs a broad spectrum adsorption for heavy metals such as pb cu cd and zn in water 93 however due to the strong hydrophobicity and low affinity cnts are often not directly applied in aqueous solution which limits the application of themselves 58 after modification the derivative materials obtained broaden the application range in other words cnts is often used as raw materials for the production of their derivatives 3 2 2 modified cnts 3 2 2 1 oxidized cnts the common modification of cnts includes oxidation functional group graft and magnetism oxidized cnts can be obtained by strong oxidants e g strong acid potassium permanganate ozone treating to enhance their hydrophilicity and solubility which is conducive to the heavy metal adsorption the common method is considering of acid oxidation and the mixed acid or single acid of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid is often used 92 94 the process of acid oxidation can increase the number of oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl group hydroxyl group on carbon based adsorbents surface to enhance the hydrophilicity for better performance of heavy metal adsorption 37 57 92 xu et al 37 prepared mwcnts by chemical vapor deposition and then oxidized them with nitric acid they used mwcnts to adsorb pb ii and found that the adsorption performance was largely influenced by ph value the removal efficiency was only 10 20 when ph 6 5 but 90 in the range of ph 7 10 the adsorption reached equilibrium very quickly and the surface complexation was main adsorption mechanism of oxidized mwcnts for pb ii removal wang et al 95 and sun et al 96 respectively confirmed that oxidized mwcnts can be used for the adsorption and removal of u or co in water and tofighy et al 97 found that the preference order of oxidized cnt sheets to adsorption heavy metal was pb ii cd ii co ii zn ii cu ii in a words oxidation means rich oxygen containing functional groups satisfactory hydrophily 98 and obvious advance of adsorption capacity furtherly what noteworthy is that oxidized cnts can be further modified to achieve more targeted optimization or modification by functional groups transforming in many cases the realization of amination and thiol functionalization requires acid oxidation treatment first 70 99 and oxidation is commonly regarded as the previous step for other modification methods 41 76 87 3 2 2 2 cnts grafting functional groups amino derivatized cnts hayati et al 32 used concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid to oxidize cnts and prepared poly amidoamine cnts by the reactions with 2 4 diisocyanate and ethylenediamine the experiment showed an excellent performance of this modified cnts at ph 7 the adsorption capacity of cu2 and pb2 can reach 3333 mg g and 4870 mg g respectively thiol derivatized cnts bandaru et al 57 treated swcnt using concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid to obtain carboxyl functionalized cnts powder then added the powder to the coupling agent of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopyl carbodiimide and n hydroxysuccinimide and heated the mixture in the ethanol solution of cystine hydrochloride to get thiol derivatized swnt sh according to the adsorption experiment of hg ii in aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of this material is about three times of that of unmodified carbon nanotubes and four times of that of ac furthermore the complexation between mercapto and hg2 ions took place in this chemical adsorption process and the maximum adsorption capacity predicted was 131 mg g other functionalized cnts bankole et al 41 dispersed the cnts purified by concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid in dimethylformamide dmf then added titanium chloride solution and heated the mixture after drying polyhydroxylbutyrate phb and dimethylformamide dmf were added for reheating to obtain phb functionalized cnts phb cnts the results of adsorption experiments show that the heavy metal removal efficiency of phb cnts are higher than that of the non functionalized cnts and the removal efficiency of cd pb cu cr and as were higher than 98 in addition low toxic phb functionalized cnts are easy to product to remove heavy metals in electroplating wastewater effectively 3 2 2 3 magnetic cnts in general cnts are suspended in water after adsorption which is difficult to collect and treat therefore the starting point of magnetization of carbonaceous materials is to facilitate the subsequent separation from the solution 100 and to realize rapid dosing separation cycle in an external magnetic field 101 common magnetization method is to use fecl3 101 fecl2 4h2o 38 feso4 7h2o 62 or other iron salts to generate magnetic fe3o4 91 on adsorbents sadegh et al 58 used nitric acid and microwave radiation to treat mwcnts firstly and then mwcnts and fe3o4 nanoparticles were immersed in ethanol solution to prepare magnetic mwcnts according to the adsorption research of hg ii the cooh group on mwcnts and fe3o4 nanoparticles form a large network structure and the maximum adsorption capacity of 238 78 mg g the hg ii adsorption on magnetic mwcnts was mainly caused by electrostatic adsorption and complexation in addition the network structure of this material provides a large number of binding sites for heavy metal adsorption magnetization makes carbon based materials convenient for efficient separation from treatment finished solution and accessible for mechanized operation so magnetic metal compounds are commonly chosen to be supported by cnts or other carbon based materials which has been widely applied in magnetization 101 3 3 gn based materials 3 3 1 gn analogues gn based materials are gn and its derivatives including gn graphene oxide go reduced graphene oxide rgo and their compounds with organic or inorganic substances respectively among them gn go and rgo are typical gn analogues 102 and most of the other derivatives are based on the modification of these three materials gn go and rgo are closely related and the main difference among them are their c o as shown in table 4 it is considered that the oxygen content of go is the highest and that of gn is very low while the oxygen content of rgo has a large span 102 go and rgo have more oxygen containing functional groups than gn therefore they have more obvious hydrophilicity and dispersion to combine with heavy metal ions through covalent bond and electrostatic action 64 3 3 1 1 gn gn is one of the latest carbon nano material in a narrow sense gn refers to a two dimensional single layer graphite hybridized by carbon atom sp2 with a specific surface area of nearly 2630 m2 g 64 but nowadays gn is a generalized concept and some three dimensional materials with multi layer carbon atomic layer structure are also called gn 102 or 3d gn 103 there are two ways to prepare gn one is the top down method including mechanical exfoliation of bulk pristine graphite or chemically treated graphite go reducing and microwave assisted method 104 the other is the bottom up method including pyrolysis method 105 chemical deposition 103 and epitaxial growth on sic 106 the so called top down approach is that the preparation process of gn is accompanied by the reduction of the dimension of raw materials e g graphite such as the conversion from 3d to 2d or 2d to 1d while the bottom up approach on the contrary is the process of the dimension increasing such as the conversion from carbon atom or carbon containing molecule to gn with 2d or 3d structure 107 in fact it is rare to use raw graphene as adsorbent to remove heavy metals in water the preparation process of gn is usually used as a reference for the production of graphene based materials by comparison the structure of 3d gn can be artificially controlled by the choice of substrate so 3d gn is prepared directly e g the preparation of foam graphene by chemical deposition for more wider utilization 103 3 3 1 2 go go is usually prepared by oxidation of graphite or gn with strong oxidant it has high oxygen content a large number of oxygen containing functional groups such as co coc oh and cooh on the surface and has stronger hydrophilicity than carbon nanotubes 98 go is superior to gn in heavy metal adsorption due to its rich oxygen containing functional groups typical oxidation methods include hummers method brodie method staudenmaier method and improved method based on these methods 69 traditional brodie method and staudenmaier method have longer reaction time and are more prone to explosion than hummers method relatively hummers method is safer and faster 108 however these three methods are able to produce harmful gases such as no2 n2o2 and clo2 more or less so the current oxidation methods are mostly based on the improvement of hummers method 109 in the improved hummers method the mixed acid of concentrated sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid 9 1 is used instead of concentrated sulfuric and compared with hummers method the modified hummers method brought higher oxidation degree more oxygen containing functional groups and larger layer spacing to go 108 raghubanshi et al 108 prepared go by hummers method and found that the adsorption capacity of go benefited from the interaction between pb ii and functional groups on go and the large specific surface area and lamellar structure of graphene oxide also played a crucial role tan et al 71 used modified hummers to prepare go powder for cu ii adsorption the experiment results showed that a higher oxidation degree brought a larger adsorption capacity to go the complexation and electrostatic attraction between cu2 and oxygen containing functional groups were main adsorption mechanism in that process in addition they found that na would influence the adsorption by competitive adsorption behavior jun et al 59 confirmed that cu ii cd ii zn ii and pb ii can be effectively removed in their single metal solution by go respectively and found the removal efficiency of pb ii was highest with a maximum adsorption capacity of 555 mg g go could effectively adsorb pb ii mainly due to its oxygen containing functional groups and the order of metal ions adsorption was pb2 cu2 cd2 zn2 3 3 1 3 rgo rgo as the name indicates is one more stable product of reducing and removing some oxygen containing functional groups from go yet some oxygen containing functional groups still are remained and there are two reduction methods one is heat treatment such as microwave heating or strong flash evaporation to decompose oxygen containing functional groups into co or co2 gas to escape from solid matter the other is chemical reduction which can reduce oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go by chemical reducing agent of hydrazine metal hydride and hydrohalic acid 98 or plant extract 60 due to the toxicity of hydrazine lin et al 60 thought that plant extracts should be considered as reducing agent of go which contains reducing substances such as phenols amino acids caffeine and vitamins and have no biological toxicity so green tea extract was used to prepare rgo for pb ii removal in water the experimental results show that whole adsorption process was exothermic and high temperature counted against adsorption the main mechanism of pb ii adsorption was cation π bonding in experiment at 30 c the adsorption removal efficiency of pb ii reached 96 6 when the solution ph 4 5 the dosage of rgo was 0 4 g l and the initial concentration of pb ii in the solution was 10 mg l 3 3 2 gn analogues grafting functional groups gn go and rgo can be compounded with organic compounds to introduce certain functional groups to prepare gn analogue based materials some organic compounds e g chitosan β cyclodextrin have strong adsorption capacity 34 so the composites can play the adsorption properties of both organic materials and gn analogue to improve the adsorption 3 3 2 1 chitosan go composite chitosan is the n deacetylation product of chitin which is a kind of natural polysaccharide its molecules are rich in amino and hydroxyl groups 34 so in recent years it often participates in the modification of graphene based materials as aminated materials 61 samuel et al 61 dispersed go in distilled water and added chitosan and nabh4 to obtain go chitosan composite the maximum adsorption capacity of cr vi was 104 16 mg g and the main mechanism was the complexation between cr vi and oh nh in addition go chitosan composite performed good regeneration ability because the adsorption efficiency of cr vi on go chitosan composite decreased from 96 to 82 after 10 adsorption desorption cycle sherlala et al 38 used magnetic chitosan go material to studied the as iii removal the adsorption experiment showed that the neutral water environment was conducive to the adsorption of as iii and the main adsorption mechanism was the complexation of as iii in the form of h3aso3 with nh2 oh and oh2 on the surface of magnetic chitosan go 3 3 2 2 β cyclodextrin go composite β cyclodextrin is a kind of cyclic oligosaccharide which is composed of seven glucose units it has a hydrophilic cavity with hydrophobic internal surface and hydrophilic external surface the hydrophobic cavity of β cyclodextrin can form host guest inclusion with many kinds of organics and metal ions 110 and the surface hydroxyl can also form complex with metal ions 48 63 111 which has been used to be modifier 112 to develop eco friendly adsorbents ma et al 62 used β cyclodextrin modified magnetic go to carried out adsorption experiments of pb ii and cu ii they found that the adsorption capacities of pb ii and cu ii could rapidly increase to a higher level in a short time and the removal efficiency of pb ii reached 82 67 in 15 min the estimated maximum adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 279 21 mg g and 93 97 mg g respectively and the complexation between go and heavy metal ions contribute a lot and huang et al 111 confirmed that the cooh on β cyclodextrin can provide adsorption sites for cu ii wang et al 63 prepared β cyclodextrin ethylenediamine magnetic go to carried out the adsorption experiment of cr vi surface diffusion and internal diffusion exist in the adsorption process and the adsorption of cr vi hcro4 in water by this material was attributed to three aspects the electrostatic interaction between hcro4 anion and composite material the host guest interaction with β cyclodextrin hydrophobic cavity and the combination with hydroxyl groups on go 3 3 3 gn analogues compounding supporting inorganic substance similar to bc ac zero valent metals and metal compounds are typical substance often supported by carbonaceous materials 3 3 3 1 d gn compounding polymetallic compound wang et al 113 studied the nife layered double hydroxide and inserted a mos4 2 into the lamellar structure to form a polymetallic compound the polymetallic compound was assembled on the surface of 3d gn foam to get a porous lamellar mixed block nife mos4 2 ldh cf for hg2 pb2 and cu2 removal it was found that the rougher surface provided a large number of adsorption sites so that the calculated maximum adsorption capacities of hg2 pb2 and cu2 were 462 299 and 128 mg g respectively and their adsorption efficiency could exceed 99 and the adsorption mechanism was mainly the complexation of mos4 2 to heavy metals due to the superior adsorption performance this porous lamellar mixed block could be applied in the drinking water purification 3 3 3 2 go metal oxide nanohybrid mohan et al 64 prepared go mgo nanohybrid by precipitation and the adsorption experiment indicated this composites could remove pb2 ions from drinking water without ph and temperature changes nearly with a high adsorption capacity of pb2 190 mg g and the ideal conditions concluded was low dosage 0 4 g l 30 and ph 6 5 the internal diffusion and external diffusion dominated the adsorption process and ion exchange and complexation took place on go mgo nanohybrid between pb2 and cooh or oh and mg2 ions in the materials also provided many sites for exchanging with pb2 3 3 3 3 zvi rgo composite wang et al 65 prepared the nzvi rgo composite in the adsorption experiment of as the maximum adsorption capacity of as3 and as5 are 35 83 mg g and 29 04 mg g respectively and the adsorption of as3 was mainly caused by surface complexation while the adsorption of as5 was realized by complexation and electrostatic interaction it was noteworthy that ph value of the solution had a great influence on the adsorption of as3 and as5 the forms of as vi could be h2aso4 hass4 2 and aso4 3 with the increase of ph adsorption efficiency of as iii would be variable due to the form of as iii which could be h3aso3 and or h2aso3 under different ph values 3 4 regeneration of carbon based materials the carbon based adsorbents could keep their adsorption capacity at a high level after several adsorption desorption cycles at present acid or alkali are generally applied to the desorption and regeneration of carbon based materials 3 4 1 regeneration in acid solution acid method regeneration means that the carbon based materials after adsorption are immersed in acid solution for desorption thoroughly washed and dried then became available for the next adsorption sulfuric acid nitric acid and hydrochloric acid solution can be used to desorb heavy metals from carbon based materials and general regeneration are as follows steps 1 carbon based adsorbents are immersed in acid solution with certain concentration or ph 32 and sonicated for several minutes 2 after filtration the adsorbents are washed with ethanol and deionized water 3 the adsorbents are dried at certain temperature for the next adsorption desorption cycle 57 3 4 1 1 regeneration in nitric acid or sulfuric acid solution after repeated adsorption desorption cycles though there are slightly decreases in adsorption efficiency of carbon based adsorbent the high values of adsorption capacity and removal efficiency still are accessible when the regeneration process under the most appropriate concentration of acid solution saleh et al 79 used 0 1 m 0 25 m and 0 5 m nitric acid solution to establish the regeneration performance of ac after adsorbing hg ii respectively and the recovery of adsorption capacity were 50 80 and 95 tahir et al found that after three adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiency of magnetic hydroxypropyl graphene for pb ii and cu ii was still above 80 with a small loss of adsorptive capacity and sulfuric acid was used desorption reagent 114 when the heavy metals exist in water as anions the sulfuric acid method is more worthy to be considered samuel et al found that so4 2 may decrease cr vi adsorption due to the opposition among anions which can be beneficial to cr vi desorption efficiency 61 in addition shang et al found that so4 2 improved the removal of cr vi by increasing the number of reactive sites and corrosion rate of zvi 67 for nitric acid method in comparison the opposition among anions no3 and heavy metal anions is weak therefore nitric acid solution is used more frequently in the adsorption of cation 3 4 1 2 regeneration in hydrochloric acid solution hydrochloric acid solution is the most frequently used desorption reagent in acid method regeneration because it has no oxidation property and cl has little influence on the adsorption of most heavy metal ions the regeneration of bc 86 cnts sh 57 and go 47 can be regenerated by hydrochloric acid with high desorption efficiency wang et al proved that hydrochloric acid solution can effectively desorb zn on gn and the desorption efficiency reached 91 6 47 jun et al 59 found that the adsorption efficiency of go for pb ii was nearly invariable during three adsorption desorption cycles to the regeneration in acid solution a selection of desorption agent is significant to regeneration of carbon based materials for example peng et al used 0 1 m hcl solution 0 1 m hno3 solution and deionization to desorb zn2 adsorbed on go and found the desorption efficiency were 91 6 73 4 and 53 2 respectively 69 3 4 2 regeneration in alkali solution the alkali method is similar to the acid method which regenerate carbon based materials by immersing ma et al 46 found that after the first regeneration of bc in 1 m naoh solution the adsorption efficiency of cr vi decreased from 97 9 to 91 57 and after three adsorption desorption cycles the adsorption rate of cr vi reached 70 65 samuel et al 61 used 1 m naoh as desorption reagent to regenerate go chitosan after 10 adsorption desorption cycles the adsorption capacity of cr vi decreased slightly and the removal efficiency decreased from 96 to 82 in addition to naoh yu et al successfully regenerated zno bc composite with dilute ammonia water and the adsorption efficiency of cr vi was 67 1 after 5 adsorption desorption cycles 80 actually naoh solution is used more frequently than dilute ammonia solution in alkali method regeneration and the regeneration research of other alkali solutions for carbon based is inadequate acid method and alkali method are main strategies to regenerate carbon based materials although edta 69 and na2edta 115 were also used to respectively regenerate gn and go there are few related studies in addition to solvent regeneration methods such as acid and alkali in situ regeneration technology such as catalysis can also be considered 119 the regeneration method with high desorption rate cheap desorption reagent simple regeneration process and suitable for industrial application needs to be developed 4 conclusion and outlook ac bc cnts and gn analogues are three typical carbonaceous materials which are used to develop carbon based adsorbents for carbon based adsorbents surface complexation ion exchange and electrostatic interaction are main mechanisms for heavy metal removal and ph play a key role in adsorption the langmuir or freundlich adsorption isotherms often have better fitness than other models in studies of carbon based adsorbents so they have been applied in more cases the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic model are also universal and the latter is more common for desorption acid method and alkali method still are main strategies to regenerate carbon based adsorbents though adsorption mechanism modification and regeneration have been studied in some literatures for removing heavy metal from aqueous solution there still are some issues 1 current researches on the adsorption and removal of various heavy metals in water mostly focus on the heavy metal cation but few specific adsorption studies of their hydroxy compound ions or other complex ions usually the adsorption of complex ions is mentioned as a small part in documents 2 on the one hand the modified carbonaceous materials can achieve high adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of heavy metals on the other hand the modification operation is complex especially chemical modification considering the cost yield and or operation complexity these preparation methods of modified materials are not conducive to industrial production and some new modifiers may also bring new pollutions 3 many carbon based materials are powders even after magnetization they may migrate and lose in the water with strong fluidity resulting in lower recovery rate and secondary pollution 4 current regeneration of acid or alkali used in carbon based materials will cause mass loss strength reduction and adsorption capacity reduction which need to be further optimized while other regeneration methods are lack of systematic research in addition waste desorption reagent treatment is also need to be studied given the above issues more attention should be paid to the following directions the selective adsorption and the competitive adsorption behavior among heavy metal ions are worth to further study the combination and simplification of modification operations can make the industrial large scale production of carbon based adsorbents come true which meet actual cases better but with lower cost in order to facilitate the collection and prevent secondary pollution 3d gn go sponge and other new carbon based materials with three dimensional structure are prospective heavy metal adsorbents as for regeneration the properties of carbon based materials operation conditions of regeneration process and the development of desorption solution are significant and practical in future research for making full use of carbon based adsorbents declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was financially

review the applications of electrochemical water quality stabilization technology in practical recirculating cooling water system reported in china it is pointed out that future perspective of research and practice should be to highlight the technology performance improvement and the application cost reduction keywords recirculating cooling water electrochemical technology scale influence factor practical application 1 introduction it is of great significance for recirculating cooling water system a large consumer of water consumption in industrial system to be operated stably in order to guarantee the safe and steady production of enterprises 1 at present the predominant defects of recirculating cooling water system are scale deposition metal corrosion as well as bacteria and algae breeding 2 the harm of scale is mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 the pipeline would be blocked to reduce the water circulation cross sectional area and to increase the flow resistance so that the system transmission power cost goes up 3 2 the heat transfer resistance of tube wall of heat exchanger is greatly increased resulting in the rise of energy consumption 4 3 the sever corrosion would easily occur under scale and cause pipe perforation 5 besides the temperature ph and salinity of the recirculating water system are suitable for the growth of most microorganisms which will bring about more serious equipment damage if the microorganisms mix together with scale to generate biological slime stabilizing the water quality is consequently the key to ensure the safe and stable operation of recirculating cooling water system reduce energy consumption and conserve water resources aiming at the above problems various recirculating water quality control technologies were proposed by researchers and technicians of which the technical principles and characteristics are specified as table 1 in comparison with other techniques the electrochemical water softening technology is a typical active technology and the most attractive advantage lies in without additional chemical reagents the hardness ions can be removed in the form of solid precipitation from the recirculating cooling water substantially preventing the water fouling 4 6 9 therefore the surface of heat exchanger could be remained clean the concentration ratio of recirculating water could be improved the emissions of contaminated effluent could be reduced and the water resource could be effectively economized which conform with the national policy of current ecological and environmental protection industry hence possessing a market in the field of recirculating water treatment with promising prospect 2 principle of electrochemical water quality stabilization technology electrochemical water quality stabilization technology plays an important role in scale removal of recirculating cooling water also favorable to killing and inhibiting of bacteria and algae as well as removal of organic matter the relevant reactions occur in the cathode interface region the anode interface region and the solution respectively the schematic diagram of technical principle is illustrated as fig 1 2 1 cathode interface region in the process of cathode polarization oh is generated in two regions namely oxygen reduction eq 1 and hydrogen evolution eq 2 10 12 during the practical reaction process it can be deduced from a large number of bubbles generated on the cathode that the hydrogen evolution process shown in eq 2 inclines to be the dominant reaction of oh generation 13 14 under the effect of mass transfer hco3 in solution migrate to the cathode surface area converted to co3 2 in accordance with eq 3 12 15 furthermore after the migration to the cathode surface area under the combined effect of mass transfer and electric field calcium and magnesium ions in the recirculating water react with co3 2 and oh generated in the cathode area to form precipitation eqs 4 and 5 16 17 which deposit on the cathode surface as a scale layer so that the hardness of water is eventually reduced 1 o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 2 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 3 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 4 ca2 co3 2 caco3 5 mg2 oh mg oh 2 2 2 anode interface region the primary electrochemical reaction in anode interface region is the process with water participating and forms a high acidity area as eq 6 where if the strong oxidizing substance oh formed is not consumed in time mass oxygen will be generated by means of self compound of hydroxyl radicals eq 7 hco3 migrates to the anode surface area motivated by the effect of mass transfer and electric field and subsequently reacts in the high acidity area to release co2 eq 8 33 thus the alkalinity declines eqs 9 and 10 demonstrates that with existence of chlorine ions in recirculating water strong oxidizing ocl shall be formed giving rise to a reduction of the solution ph value organics bacteria and algae in recirculating cooling water tend to react with the strong oxidizing substance oh or ocl where the organic matter is oxidized to co2 and water eq 11 34 36 meanwhile the algae and bacteria die or become inactivated eq 12 37 40 it should be particularly noted that oh only react with organic matter or bacteria and algae in the polar water interface area of the anode surface due to the lack of stability 41 whereas with relatively stronger stability ocl can leave the polar water interface region and diffuse into the solution so that the treated recirculating water still has certain ability to inhibit bacteria and algae when out of the electrochemical treatment region 42 6 h2o oh h e 7 oh 1 2 o2 h e 8 hco3 h co2 h2o 9 2cl cl2 2e 10 cl2 h2o cl ocl h 11 r oh ocl ro co2 h2o 12 bacteria algae oh ocl death inactivation 3 electrochemical devices and systems 3 1 core components the core components of electrochemical water quality stabilization technology include anode cathode and power supply system 3 1 1 anode the effects of anode in electrochemical water quality stabilization technology are described as follows 1 a high acidity zone is formed to accomplish a partial removal of alkalinity 33 2 the formation of strong oxidizing substances could contribute to the oxidation of organic matter algae and bacteria 43 the common electrochemical water treatment anode is graphite electrode noble metal electrode titanium based metal oxide electrode including pbo2 electrode 35 44 46 sb sno2 electrode 47 48 ir ru electrode 49 50 and ti4o7 electrode 51 52 etc and boron doped diamond electrode among them the titanium based anode has been widely concerned and inquired by researchers because of its advantages such as convenient processing remarkable performance and moderate price although the pbo2 electrode and sb sno2 electrode have great merits in terms of price and electro catalytic performance they are not suitable for the high chlorine water quality conditions of recirculating cooling water considering the technical cost and electrode stability the most extensively employed anode for scale removal in current market is ruthenium iridium composite oxide electrode on titanium matrix the stability and catalytic capacity of that electrode are directly affected by the preparation conditions of the electrode and the thickness of the surface oxide coating 53 since anode cost accounts for a large proportion of the total equipment investment the balance between anode performance and price should be paid more attention in the practical procurement process 3 1 2 cathode the cathode plays a role in electrochemical water quality stabilization technology to create a region with high alkalinity so as to complete the hardness removal 54 56 since the cathode is the site where scale deposition takes place the material type surface state and area size of the cathode have a great influence on the deposition process and efficiency 57 59 theoretically various conductive materials can be adopted for cathode while from perspective of the availability processing and cost of materials the relatively more preferable cathode materials in the market are stainless steel cast iron and carbon steel 6 60 the scale precipitation rate and energy consumption of an electrochemical water softening system are significantly dependent on the nature of cathode that is material type and surface state jaouhari 58 et al declared that despite of the composition of treated water the golden substrate for cathode exhibited the most ideal performance on scale precipitation followed by bronze and then stainless steel which was partially because oxides layer on those kinds of electrode alleviated the scale deposition in varying extent gold and bronze however are of incompetence for engineering application due to their low resource availability and economic efficiency according to karoui 6 et al different from the gold and carbon steel stainless steel was capable of facilitating the mg oh 2 brucite deposition through rising the ph of the cathode solution interface via temperature increase and cathodic potential augment as for the inquiry to effect of different surface state of identical material type three kinds of stainless steel with varying roughness mirror frosted and normal were employed in experiment by chen s group 3 8 61 62 and the mirror stainless steel turned out to be with most favorable descaling performance of up to 25 5 34 3 g h m2 deposition rate owing to the relatively low probability of cathode deactivation by scale accumulation it can be deduced that a cathode fabricated from the suitable material with smooth surface is not only conducive to descaling promotion and energy consumption decline but the scale detachment is also able to be facilitated which is one of the most valuable research directions for future application of electrochemical water quality stabilization when conventional plate or mesh cathode is employed the cathode area expansion can increase the contact area between water and cathode and multiply the chance of ca2 mg2 contacting with cathode in solution which is conducive to the precipitation reaction of caco3 mg oh 2 54 in addition extending the cathode area can reduce the water connection resistance of the cathode so that the voltage of the equipment can be declined under the same current condition which is advantageous for the reduction of operation energy consumption therefore the electrochemical descaling equipment design can be promoted to fully optimize the internal structure of the electrochemical equipment and maximize the available cathode area xu 33 et al modeled and optimized the internal dimensions of the classical plate type electrochemical reactor and pointed out that the flattening of the electrochemical reactor size could effectively improve the available cathode area furthermore other researchers adopted various configuration of cathodes that are different from conventional flat or reticulated ones luan 54 et al used 304 stainless steel mesh of 20 12 8 and 50 meshes to synthesize a multi mesh composite cathode which effectively provided reaction sites for electrochemical reaction and scale deposition accomplishing a great improvement of the scale deposition rate up to 29 16 g h m2 and a significant decrease of the energy consumption down to 6 0 kw h kg caco3 thus proposing a system to moderate the struggle between the scale deposition and alkalinity formation is an essential strategy to promote electrochemical water softening process applying three dimensional stainless steel wool cathode ignacio 63 et al demonstrated a 20 higher scale deposition rate and a 65 lower energy consumption than the conventional two dimensional cathode with titanium plate during a short period 30 h operation 3d cathode is a promising choice to rise above the restriction of electrochemical water softening industrial application while the more feasible reactor design for cathode resuming and reliability enhancing is urgently required in following research a porous aerogel carbon electrode was adopted by rinat 59 et al to optimize the distribution of calcium carbonate deposition on the surface as well as within the pores of the cathode by means of more negative potential that insight has referential value for electrochemical softening of recirculating cooling water when adopting inexpensive material for cathode whereas cost effectiveness should be ensured by reactor design as the higher cathodic potential means the larger energy input besides although the descaling performance of those work is still far behind to that of scale removal system adopting ion exchange membrane reaching 1000 g h m2 54 relatively low maintenance and simple equipment with satisfactory effect are worth taking efforts to optimize the membrane free softening technologies last but not least it should be pointed out that the hydrogen generation on the cathode during the reaction is inevitable eq 2 however in practice it is observed that if the current parameters are not properly controlled the surface of the cathode plate will produce hydrogen in large quantity instead of developing scale resulting in hydrogen embrittlement of the cathode plate which endangers the operation safety of the equipment 3 1 3 power supply system the power supply system mainly takes on the responsibility of furnishing and guaranteeing electric power common power supply modes used in electrochemical process include direct current dc constant voltage power supply dc constant current power supply pulse constant voltage power supply and pulse constant current power supply 34 the present market is generally dominated by dc constant current power supply mode in consideration of the equipment investment and the power stability moreover another benefit of the dc constant current mode is that the voltage variation during the process can be used as a criterion for determining whether the scale layer needs to be cleaned during the reaction process the deposition of scale could thicken the scale layer on the cathode surface resulting in the increase of the electrolytic cell resistance and the rise of the voltage in the electrolytic cell in the constant current state when the voltage of the electrolytic cell grows to a certain level the scale deposition on the cathode surface is excessively thick 61 62 and inevitably requires cleaning to resume the state and function of the cathode which is conducive to the continuous scale deposition process the commonly used power supply in practice is designed as adjustable current or voltage thus the current parameters can be adjusted reasonably according to the actual water quality and operation condition of the engineering project nonetheless some small electrochemical devices on the market cancel the current voltage adjustable function due to cost considerations and the device can only be operated at specific current values of predetermined logic significantly impairing the flexibility of power supply devices according to yu 3 et al the method of alternating input of high and low current density was adopted to conduct the automatic detachment of the scale layer on the cathode surface illustrated as fig 2 a after parameter optimization the scale deposition rate reached 40 47 g h m2 the energy consumption value and the total hardness removal rate were promoted to 8 9 13 2 kwh kg caco3 and 17 8 22 8 respectively jin 62 et al investigated the use of the electrodes inversion method i e the polarity of anode and cathode was designated to be exchanged regularly exhibited as fig 2b to remove the scale produced on the cathode surface nevertheless that approach is significantly affected by the length of inverting time the size of inverting current and the materials of the cathodes it is therefore of necessity to select and optimize the aforementioned parameters on basis of the practical conditions 3 2 electrochemical devices at present manual and automatic devices predominantly occupy the mainstream market of electrochemical devices 3 2 1 manual devices there is no function of automatic scale detachment to manual equipment which require to take out or open the reactor manually and clean the scale after the operation of the reactor for a period of time generally the voltage value of the reactor system increases significantly when the current is constant so as to restore the clean state of the cathode surface and facilitate the subsequent operation a typical open manual electrochemical descaling device used in china is shown as fig 3 fig 3a and b represent an equipment with the rod like titanium matrix metal oxide anode as the center and stainless steel strip as the external cathode when the strip cathode is substituted with a mesh cathode as shown in fig 3c the surface pores of the cathode are evenly distributed so that the corresponding electric field structure is symmetrical and the scaling effect is substantially promoted this kind of equipment is characterized by no shell convenient processing flexible application and the number of equipment can be accordingly adjusted with the actual engineering situation fig 4 shows a typical closed manual electrochemical descaling device the space between the cathode plate and the anode plate is used to form a kind of channel with folded flow inside the device leading to a higher probability of the effective contact between water and the electrode 64 compared with the open equipment the closed equipment is more complicated in processing whereas a more favorable efficiency of scale removal can be attained on account of the folded flow 3 2 2 automatic devices automatic scaling mode refers to the device with an automatic scraping system for scale detachment when the system runs to a certain designated operating condition the scraping system can be started automatically to detach the scale and clean the inner part of the reactor so that the reactor could resume its original performance to continue operation a types of representative automatic electrochemical scale detachment device are illustrated as fig 5 the mechanism of automatic scale detachment is to use the motor reduction gear to drive the internal scraper system of the equipment to rotate mechanically clean the scale layer on the cathode surface and then cooperating with the cleaning process the device performance is effectively recovered on account of indispensability of numerous components or devices for automatic equipment to scrap and discharge scale on the cathode the device volume is supposed to be larger leading to the reduction of available cathode area therefore aiming at facilitating the precipitation of scale at the cathode to accordingly promote processing efficiency and capacity of the equipment the internal structure needs to be adequately optimized also the effective cathode area of electrochemical device requires enlargement as much as possible in addition to mechanical scale detachment and the aforementioned automatic descaling with special power supply system yu 61 et al also proposed an idea of adopting aeration in electrochemical equipment to clean the scale on the cathode surface in time as illustrated in fig 6 the results revealed that the scale on the cathode surface could be effectively removed when the air flow per unit cathode area was 6 m3 m2h and the treatment period was 5 min after 20 cycles of continuous operation the total hardness removal rate remained between 12 2 and 15 2 indicating that the electrochemical process still maintained satisfactorily effective scale removal performance after periodic aeration treatment moreover the average energy consumption was 17 6 22 3 kw h kgcaco3 with no distinct increase in the operating cycle which demonstrated that the aeration method can maintain the scale deposition rate on the cathode surface and ensure the efficient electrochemical descaling process compared with other traditional approaches that innovative method has superiority of efficient scale detachment without interrupting the removal process of scale ions in cathode however the condition of cathode such as surface type makes a difference for the effect of exfoliating scale layer thereby the parameters should be decided by actual condition if applied in practice also that the generation of aeration may burden energy requirement should be addressed properly and the effective collection for detached scaled need to be optimized in the future because the scale will intersperse among the water and may take a while to settle down 3 3 electrochemical system there are two prevalent installation modes of electrochemical reactors in recirculating water system the directly immersive type and outer tank operated type the directly immersive installation refers to placing the non shell electrolytic equipment such as the scale absorption cage shown in fig 2 directly in the recirculating pond and connecting it with the dc power supply outside the pond when the reaction proceeds to a certain extent the equipment is taken out for manual scale detachment and then placed into the pond again for subsequently repetitive process there are some non negligible drawbacks attached with directly immersive electrochemical reactor that the scale removal requires to be accomplished by means of manual scraping clubbing or high pressure water jet impact etc which is time wasting and energy consuming also easily causes the deformation and breakdown of the cathode greatly influencing the convenient usage of customer and the continuity of equipment performance as for outer tank operated mode the recirculating water is introduced into the shell electrolytic equipment outside the tank through pump extraction path 1 in fig 7 or artesian effect with pressure path 2 in fig 7 and is then discharged into the pond for successive recirculation after a period time of reaction compared with the directly immersive device the outer tank operated installation requires the addition of pumps pipes valves and containers etc which attaches a significant burden to the equipment investment consequently with regard to some small or micro recirculating cooling water systems the more favorable economic efficiency can be derived from directly immersive installation mode than that of outer tank operated type 4 influence factors 4 1 electrical parameters there are great significance and influence of electrical parameters attaching to electrochemical treatment performance in the process of scientific research and engineering application the current is more convenient to control than the voltage and other parameters thus the current i e current density is used to represent the electrical parameters prevailingly on the one hand xu 65 66 et al indicated that the current directly affects the theoretical processing capacity of the electrochemical equipment and both the hardness and alkalinity removal efficiency are verified to be improve with the increase of the current the reason is that the electrochemical alkali production process shown as eq 2 accelerates with the rise of the current input so that the scale deposition process presented as eqs 3 5 are expedited accordingly also according to the researches results of chen s group 8 61 the precipitation rate of hardness ions could be promoted with the augments of the current density at the beginning i e under 40 a m2 while an asymptotic limit would exist no matter how high the current density is applied i e over 260 a cm2 owing to the restricted mass transfer of ca2 and hco3 it is worth noting that as demonstrated by karoui 4 6 9 and zeppenfeld 16 17 et al higher cathodic potential was proved to be conducive to the formation brucite mg oh 2 deposition instead of aragonite caco3 and there is no specific boundary for the rate growth of brucite precipitation derived from the rise of current density because unlike caco3 the oh for brucite formation is not restricted by the mass transfer in the vicinity of cathode although the actual hardness removal usually conforms to the principle described above of caco3 because the calcium ions are dominant in recirculating cooling water that mechanisms about brucite provide us a novel thinking about the influence of current density on different wastewater anyhow on the other hand based on the investigation of chen s group 3 8 61 62 the increase of current density could distinctly burden the energy consumption since higher current density means more energy input 1 9 kw h kg caco3 of energy consumption at 20 a m3 of current density and 37 6 kw h kg caco3 at 300 a m3 so as to cause that current efficiency could be prominently reduced and reach a nearly constant value where 17 and 5 of current efficiency corresponded to 20 a m3 and 300 a m3 of current density respectively moreover xu 65 66 et al revealed that the current value however affects the stable state of the cathode surface area and the crystalline morphology of scale formed with improperly high current adopting the gas evolution phenomenon in the cathode surface area shall be severe resulting in the failure of water stability around the vicinity of cathode namely in the complete turbulence state which eventually affects the directional migration process of ca2 mg2 and further impairs the scale precipitation effect it is interesting that with the similar mechanism but different purpose yu 3 et al introduced an approach that increasing the current density significantly to address the issue of scale detachment as mentioned above to sum up the appropriate range of the current value i e current density is supposed to be determined through specific objective in experimental scale and in combination with the engineering situation in actual practice 4 2 hydraulic retention time hydraulic retention time can be defined as the time that water stays in the electrochemical reactor under the premise that the volume of the electrochemical device is determined flow rate which is inversely proportional to hydraulic retention time can substitute that index for description the higher value of the hydraulic retention time brings about the longer time of water participating in the processes in the reactor and the milder flow disturbance state which is conducive to the directional migration of ca2 mg2 to the cathode for better treatment effect as stated in the work of chen s group 3 8 61 62 that the removal efficiency reduced from 20 9 to 18 8 as the increase of flow rate from 10 l h to 15 l h indicated that higher flow rate could bring about the worse hardness removal performance due to insufficient diffusion rate and inadequate disposal conversely the augment of flow rate could promote the precipitation rate because more hardness ions were deposited due to more recirculating cooling water treated from higher flow rate in addition the specific energy consumption could be reduced and the current efficiency could be increased through rising the flow rate to remove more total hardness the energy consumption decreased from 24 5 kw h kg caco3 to 17 5 kw h kg caco3 and current efficiency grow up from 10 0 to 13 4 with the increase of the flow rate from 10 l h to 15 l h those aforementioned rules were also scientifically verified by other researchers such as chen 3 and hasson 10 12 et al in summary the higher flow rate could reduce the energy consumption per unit mass of scale as well as increase current efficiency but could lead to the unsatisfactory hardness removal effect nevertheless the lower flow rate i e the longer hydraulic retention time implies the expand of the processor volume demand or the reduction of the achievable processing flow at the expense of the economic benefits thus the choice of hydraulic retention time needs to be comprehensively considered with the actual situation of equipment and engineering project 4 3 water quality parameters since the calcium ions play the predominant role in actual recirculating water chen s group 3 8 61 62 pointed out that the hardness removal coincides with the variation trend of ca2 although chen 8 et al declared that the caco3 precipitation was more closely related to hco3 however if the hardness is extremely low the concentration of ca2 in the interface between cathode and water will be restrained by effects of diffusion and mass transfer 67 according to the experiment of hasson 10 12 et al the augment of ca2 from 160 to 610 mg l could bring about the improvement of scale deposition and decline of specific energy consumption from 8 7 to 2 2 kw h kg caco3 an apparent reason is that energy consumption could be reduced via the solution with higher conductivity while the more hardness ions are capable of increasing the conductivity of solution on the other hand the improperly high hardness can however give rise to the incompetence of the electrochemical equipment processing capacity causing that water treatment degree is degraded and inadequate to meet the requirements on the project site water quality parameters including water sample hardness value and hardness alkalinity mole ratio are uncontrollable conditions 68 so that it is unpractical to change the water quality determined by customer through available techniques moreover as demonstrated by tlili 10 12 et al there is considerable disparity of the hardness between the solution and the vicinity of the electrode thus it is supposed to practically verify the feasibility of electrochemical descaling performance under corresponding situation anyhow it is still not neglectable to attach close considerations to water quality parameters in particular hardness as they have important guiding significance for the selection of electrochemical reactor number for recirculating cooling water system 5 practical application the electrochemical water quality stabilization technology of recirculating water has been applied in the engineering practice in china to some extent also it has brought certain economic benefits on account of superiorities some relevant practical projects reported in chinese academic journals are reviewed herein to illustrate the application of this technology in china zhang 69 et al reported the pilot application details of the electrochemical device on a 1700 m3 h inter cooling open recirculating cooling water system in a steel and metallurgical enterprise the equipment was put into operation in april 2012 and after seven months of processing the water quality indexes were significantly optimized with the total hardness calcium hardness alkalinity chloride ion conductivity and total phosphorus dropping by 24 81 35 42 25 57 23 84 14 90 and 63 01 respectively the corrosion rates of the recovered 2 pieces of carbon steel were 0 0072 mm a and 0 0083 mm a respectively which were lower than the 0 075 mm a required by the corrosion index in the code for design of industrial recirculating cooling water treatment gb50050 2007 indicating a productive anti corrosion effect after accounting the whole process cost of electrochemical method including equipment fee construction fee electricity fee water fee reagent fee and management and maintenance fee was 687 400 yuan far less than those of the traditional method with chemicals up to 1 374 million yuan wang 70 et al stated the employment of electrochemical descaling device in the 4000 m3 h recirculating water system of cnooc dxpc china national offshore oil corporation daxie petrochemical phase ii which realized the operation of recirculating water concentration multiple greater than 6 0 reduced the water make up rate by 0 54 and saved 199 000 tons of clean water every year under assistance of the electrochemical treatment system the dosage of corrosion inhibitor scale inhibitor bactericide and ph regulator were reduced by 10 15 19 and 100 respectively with evidently preferable economic efficiency apart from the electricity cost of the electrochemical treatment system the direct economic benefit is about 1 4693 million yuan per year according to duan 71 et al electrochemical water softening device was adopted for the recirculating water system of 7700 m3 h in yida chemical industry co ltd coke group shanxi province and was operated for 3 months to reduce the total alkalinity total hardness chloride ion calcium ion as well as total phosphorus by 67 4 64 8 67 3 43 3 and 58 7 respectively which can decrease 36 000 tons of new water consumption every year and save more than 1 1 million yuan of all kinds of investment besides zhang 72 et al described the specific situation of applying the plate electrochemical descaling device in the 9000 m3 h recirculating water system of chutian oxygen co ltd then compared the treatment performance of electrochemical method with chemical reagent the experimental data from 56 day operation indicated that the total hardness conductivity and turbidity of treated water by chemical reagent method were 1 98 2 18 and 1 1 times respectively higher than that by electrochemical method during processing for 56 days the plate electrochemical water softening device reduced 1 171 tons of scale from raw water and decreased the total hardness of recirculating water effectively from 675 mg l to 198 mg l it can reasonably be demonstrated by the above data that electrochemical method has distinct superiorities in terms of recirculating water quality stabilization li 73 et al reported the application of electrochemical ultrasonic technology in the 2000 3000 m3 h recirculating water system for 6 mw waste heat power station of zibo chongzheng cement co ltd after installing the combined system the concentration rate of recirculating water increased from less than 3 times to 5 6 times and the percentage of sewage discharge in the total recirculating water decreased from 1 25 to 0 3 according to the calculation 702 400 yuan annual cost saving was successfully achieved those above cases demonstrate that the electrochemical water quality stabilization technique exerts prominent advantages in terms of retaining water quality of recirculating cooling water system decrease recharge of make up water cutting down emissions of pollutant and reducing chemical reagents usage etc which can bring direct objective economic benefit for enterprises however on account of limitation of current technology by the treatment capacity of cathode per unit area single electrochemical equipment usually cannot meet requirement of recirculating cooling water system with large scale inflow which is a main challenge for further industrialization consequently it has a promising market prospect in water treatment solution yet urgently demands more attention and further research 6 conclusion and prospect it is of great significance for enterprises to operate the recirculating cooling water system safely and stably with distinctive technical characteristics electrochemical water quality stabilization technology exerts favorable advantages in maintaining the stability of recirculating water quality saving water resource and reducing effluent emissions as well as cutting down the usage of chemical reagents the primary focus of this paper has been to highlight the promising prospect of electrochemical water quality stabilization

research and practice should be to highlight the technology performance improvement and the application cost reduction keywords recirculating cooling water electrochemical technology scale influence factor practical application 1 introduction it is of great significance for recirculating cooling water system a large consumer of water consumption in industrial system to be operated stably in order to guarantee the safe and steady production of enterprises 1 at present the predominant defects of recirculating cooling water system are scale deposition metal corrosion as well as bacteria and algae breeding 2 the harm of scale is mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 the pipeline would be blocked to reduce the water circulation cross sectional area and to increase the flow resistance so that the system transmission power cost goes up 3 2 the heat transfer resistance of tube wall of heat exchanger is greatly increased resulting in the rise of energy consumption 4 3 the sever corrosion would easily occur under scale and cause pipe perforation 5 besides the temperature ph and salinity of the recirculating water system are suitable for the growth of most microorganisms which will bring about more serious equipment damage if the microorganisms mix together with scale to generate biological slime stabilizing the water quality is consequently the key to ensure the safe and stable operation of recirculating cooling water system reduce energy consumption and conserve water resources aiming at the above problems various recirculating water quality control technologies were proposed by researchers and technicians of which the technical principles and characteristics are specified as table 1 in comparison with other techniques the electrochemical water softening technology is a typical active technology and the most attractive advantage lies in without additional chemical reagents the hardness ions can be removed in the form of solid precipitation from the recirculating cooling water substantially preventing the water fouling 4 6 9 therefore the surface of heat exchanger could be remained clean the concentration ratio of recirculating water could be improved the emissions of contaminated effluent could be reduced and the water resource could be effectively economized which conform with the national policy of current ecological and environmental protection industry hence possessing a market in the field of recirculating water treatment with promising prospect 2 principle of electrochemical water quality stabilization technology electrochemical water quality stabilization technology plays an important role in scale removal of recirculating cooling water also favorable to killing and inhibiting of bacteria and algae as well as removal of organic matter the relevant reactions occur in the cathode interface region the anode interface region and the solution respectively the schematic diagram of technical principle is illustrated as fig 1 2 1 cathode interface region in the process of cathode polarization oh is generated in two regions namely oxygen reduction eq 1 and hydrogen evolution eq 2 10 12 during the practical reaction process it can be deduced from a large number of bubbles generated on the cathode that the hydrogen evolution process shown in eq 2 inclines to be the dominant reaction of oh generation 13 14 under the effect of mass transfer hco3 in solution migrate to the cathode surface area converted to co3 2 in accordance with eq 3 12 15 furthermore after the migration to the cathode surface area under the combined effect of mass transfer and electric field calcium and magnesium ions in the recirculating water react with co3 2 and oh generated in the cathode area to form precipitation eqs 4 and 5 16 17 which deposit on the cathode surface as a scale layer so that the hardness of water is eventually reduced 1 o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 2 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 3 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 4 ca2 co3 2 caco3 5 mg2 oh mg oh 2 2 2 anode interface region the primary electrochemical reaction in anode interface region is the process with water participating and forms a high acidity area as eq 6 where if the strong oxidizing substance oh formed is not consumed in time mass oxygen will be generated by means of self compound of hydroxyl radicals eq 7 hco3 migrates to the anode surface area motivated by the effect of mass transfer and electric field and subsequently reacts in the high acidity area to release co2 eq 8 33 thus the alkalinity declines eqs 9 and 10 demonstrates that with existence of chlorine ions in recirculating water strong oxidizing ocl shall be formed giving rise to a reduction of the solution ph value organics bacteria and algae in recirculating cooling water tend to react with the strong oxidizing substance oh or ocl where the organic matter is oxidized to co2 and water eq 11 34 36 meanwhile the algae and bacteria die or become inactivated eq 12 37 40 it should be particularly noted that oh only react with organic matter or bacteria and algae in the polar water interface area of the anode surface due to the lack of stability 41 whereas with relatively stronger stability ocl can leave the polar water interface region and diffuse into the solution so that the treated recirculating water still has certain ability to inhibit bacteria and algae when out of the electrochemical treatment region 42 6 h2o oh h e 7 oh 1 2 o2 h e 8 hco3 h co2 h2o 9 2cl cl2 2e 10 cl2 h2o cl ocl h 11 r oh ocl ro co2 h2o 12 bacteria algae oh ocl death inactivation 3 electrochemical devices and systems 3 1 core components the core components of electrochemical water quality stabilization technology include anode cathode and power supply system 3 1 1 anode the effects of anode in electrochemical water quality stabilization technology are described as follows 1 a high acidity zone is formed to accomplish a partial removal of alkalinity 33 2 the formation of strong oxidizing substances could contribute to the oxidation of organic matter algae and bacteria 43 the common electrochemical water treatment anode is graphite electrode noble metal electrode titanium based metal oxide electrode including pbo2 electrode 35 44 46 sb sno2 electrode 47 48 ir ru electrode 49 50 and ti4o7 electrode 51 52 etc and boron doped diamond electrode among them the titanium based anode has been widely concerned and inquired by researchers because of its advantages such as convenient processing remarkable performance and moderate price although the pbo2 electrode and sb sno2 electrode have great merits in terms of price and electro catalytic performance they are not suitable for the high chlorine water quality conditions of recirculating cooling water considering the technical cost and electrode stability the most extensively employed anode for scale removal in current market is ruthenium iridium composite oxide electrode on titanium matrix the stability and catalytic capacity of that electrode are directly affected by the preparation conditions of the electrode and the thickness of the surface oxide coating 53 since anode cost accounts for a large proportion of the total equipment investment the balance between anode performance and price should be paid more attention in the practical procurement process 3 1 2 cathode the cathode plays a role in electrochemical water quality stabilization technology to create a region with high alkalinity so as to complete the hardness removal 54 56 since the cathode is the site where scale deposition takes place the material type surface state and area size of the cathode have a great influence on the deposition process and efficiency 57 59 theoretically various conductive materials can be adopted for cathode while from perspective of the availability processing and cost of materials the relatively more preferable cathode materials in the market are stainless steel cast iron and carbon steel 6 60 the scale precipitation rate and energy consumption of an electrochemical water softening system are significantly dependent on the nature of cathode that is material type and surface state jaouhari 58 et al declared that despite of the composition of treated water the golden substrate for cathode exhibited the most ideal performance on scale precipitation followed by bronze and then stainless steel which was partially because oxides layer on those kinds of electrode alleviated the scale deposition in varying extent gold and bronze however are of incompetence for engineering application due to their low resource availability and economic efficiency according to karoui 6 et al different from the gold and carbon steel stainless steel was capable of facilitating the mg oh 2 brucite deposition through rising the ph of the cathode solution interface via temperature increase and cathodic potential augment as for the inquiry to effect of different surface state of identical material type three kinds of stainless steel with varying roughness mirror frosted and normal were employed in experiment by chen s group 3 8 61 62 and the mirror stainless steel turned out to be with most favorable descaling performance of up to 25 5 34 3 g h m2 deposition rate owing to the relatively low probability of cathode deactivation by scale accumulation it can be deduced that a cathode fabricated from the suitable material with smooth surface is not only conducive to descaling promotion and energy consumption decline but the scale detachment is also able to be facilitated which is one of the most valuable research directions for future application of electrochemical water quality stabilization when conventional plate or mesh cathode is employed the cathode area expansion can increase the contact area between water and cathode and multiply the chance of ca2 mg2 contacting with cathode in solution which is conducive to the precipitation reaction of caco3 mg oh 2 54 in addition extending the cathode area can reduce the water connection resistance of the cathode so that the voltage of the equipment can be declined under the same current condition which is advantageous for the reduction of operation energy consumption therefore the electrochemical descaling equipment design can be promoted to fully optimize the internal structure of the electrochemical equipment and maximize the available cathode area xu 33 et al modeled and optimized the internal dimensions of the classical plate type electrochemical reactor and pointed out that the flattening of the electrochemical reactor size could effectively improve the available cathode area furthermore other researchers adopted various configuration of cathodes that are different from conventional flat or reticulated ones luan 54 et al used 304 stainless steel mesh of 20 12 8 and 50 meshes to synthesize a multi mesh composite cathode which effectively provided reaction sites for electrochemical reaction and scale deposition accomplishing a great improvement of the scale deposition rate up to 29 16 g h m2 and a significant decrease of the energy consumption down to 6 0 kw h kg caco3 thus proposing a system to moderate the struggle between the scale deposition and alkalinity formation is an essential strategy to promote electrochemical water softening process applying three dimensional stainless steel wool cathode ignacio 63 et al demonstrated a 20 higher scale deposition rate and a 65 lower energy consumption than the conventional two dimensional cathode with titanium plate during a short period 30 h operation 3d cathode is a promising choice to rise above the restriction of electrochemical water softening industrial application while the more feasible reactor design for cathode resuming and reliability enhancing is urgently required in following research a porous aerogel carbon electrode was adopted by rinat 59 et al to optimize the distribution of calcium carbonate deposition on the surface as well as within the pores of the cathode by means of more negative potential that insight has referential value for electrochemical softening of recirculating cooling water when adopting inexpensive material for cathode whereas cost effectiveness should be ensured by reactor design as the higher cathodic potential means the larger energy input besides although the descaling performance of those work is still far behind to that of scale removal system adopting ion exchange membrane reaching 1000 g h m2 54 relatively low maintenance and simple equipment with satisfactory effect are worth taking efforts to optimize the membrane free softening technologies last but not least it should be pointed out that the hydrogen generation on the cathode during the reaction is inevitable eq 2 however in practice it is observed that if the current parameters are not properly controlled the surface of the cathode plate will produce hydrogen in large quantity instead of developing scale resulting in hydrogen embrittlement of the cathode plate which endangers the operation safety of the equipment 3 1 3 power supply system the power supply system mainly takes on the responsibility of furnishing and guaranteeing electric power common power supply modes used in electrochemical process include direct current dc constant voltage power supply dc constant current power supply pulse constant voltage power supply and pulse constant current power supply 34 the present market is generally dominated by dc constant current power supply mode in consideration of the equipment investment and the power stability moreover another benefit of the dc constant current mode is that the voltage variation during the process can be used as a criterion for determining whether the scale layer needs to be cleaned during the reaction process the deposition of scale could thicken the scale layer on the cathode surface resulting in the increase of the electrolytic cell resistance and the rise of the voltage in the electrolytic cell in the constant current state when the voltage of the electrolytic cell grows to a certain level the scale deposition on the cathode surface is excessively thick 61 62 and inevitably requires cleaning to resume the state and function of the cathode which is conducive to the continuous scale deposition process the commonly used power supply in practice is designed as adjustable current or voltage thus the current parameters can be adjusted reasonably according to the actual water quality and operation condition of the engineering project nonetheless some small electrochemical devices on the market cancel the current voltage adjustable function due to cost considerations and the device can only be operated at specific current values of predetermined logic significantly impairing the flexibility of power supply devices according to yu 3 et al the method of alternating input of high and low current density was adopted to conduct the automatic detachment of the scale layer on the cathode surface illustrated as fig 2 a after parameter optimization the scale deposition rate reached 40 47 g h m2 the energy consumption value and the total hardness removal rate were promoted to 8 9 13 2 kwh kg caco3 and 17 8 22 8 respectively jin 62 et al investigated the use of the electrodes inversion method i e the polarity of anode and cathode was designated to be exchanged regularly exhibited as fig 2b to remove the scale produced on the cathode surface nevertheless that approach is significantly affected by the length of inverting time the size of inverting current and the materials of the cathodes it is therefore of necessity to select and optimize the aforementioned parameters on basis of the practical conditions 3 2 electrochemical devices at present manual and automatic devices predominantly occupy the mainstream market of electrochemical devices 3 2 1 manual devices there is no function of automatic scale detachment to manual equipment which require to take out or open the reactor manually and clean the scale after the operation of the reactor for a period of time generally the voltage value of the reactor system increases significantly when the current is constant so as to restore the clean state of the cathode surface and facilitate the subsequent operation a typical open manual electrochemical descaling device used in china is shown as fig 3 fig 3a and b represent an equipment with the rod like titanium matrix metal oxide anode as the center and stainless steel strip as the external cathode when the strip cathode is substituted with a mesh cathode as shown in fig 3c the surface pores of the cathode are evenly distributed so that the corresponding electric field structure is symmetrical and the scaling effect is substantially promoted this kind of equipment is characterized by no shell convenient processing flexible application and the number of equipment can be accordingly adjusted with the actual engineering situation fig 4 shows a typical closed manual electrochemical descaling device the space between the cathode plate and the anode plate is used to form a kind of channel with folded flow inside the device leading to a higher probability of the effective contact between water and the electrode 64 compared with the open equipment the closed equipment is more complicated in processing whereas a more favorable efficiency of scale removal can be attained on account of the folded flow 3 2 2 automatic devices automatic scaling mode refers to the device with an automatic scraping system for scale detachment when the system runs to a certain designated operating condition the scraping system can be started automatically to detach the scale and clean the inner part of the reactor so that the reactor could resume its original performance to continue operation a types of representative automatic electrochemical scale detachment device are illustrated as fig 5 the mechanism of automatic scale detachment is to use the motor reduction gear to drive the internal scraper system of the equipment to rotate mechanically clean the scale layer on the cathode surface and then cooperating with the cleaning process the device performance is effectively recovered on account of indispensability of numerous components or devices for automatic equipment to scrap and discharge scale on the cathode the device volume is supposed to be larger leading to the reduction of available cathode area therefore aiming at facilitating the precipitation of scale at the cathode to accordingly promote processing efficiency and capacity of the equipment the internal structure needs to be adequately optimized also the effective cathode area of electrochemical device requires enlargement as much as possible in addition to mechanical scale detachment and the aforementioned automatic descaling with special power supply system yu 61 et al also proposed an idea of adopting aeration in electrochemical equipment to clean the scale on the cathode surface in time as illustrated in fig 6 the results revealed that the scale on the cathode surface could be effectively removed when the air flow per unit cathode area was 6 m3 m2h and the treatment period was 5 min after 20 cycles of continuous operation the total hardness removal rate remained between 12 2 and 15 2 indicating that the electrochemical process still maintained satisfactorily effective scale removal performance after periodic aeration treatment moreover the average energy consumption was 17 6 22 3 kw h kgcaco3 with no distinct increase in the operating cycle which demonstrated that the aeration method can maintain the scale deposition rate on the cathode surface and ensure the efficient electrochemical descaling process compared with other traditional approaches that innovative method has superiority of efficient scale detachment without interrupting the removal process of scale ions in cathode however the condition of cathode such as surface type makes a difference for the effect of exfoliating scale layer thereby the parameters should be decided by actual condition if applied in practice also that the generation of aeration may burden energy requirement should be addressed properly and the effective collection for detached scaled need to be optimized in the future because the scale will intersperse among the water and may take a while to settle down 3 3 electrochemical system there are two prevalent installation modes of electrochemical reactors in recirculating water system the directly immersive type and outer tank operated type the directly immersive installation refers to placing the non shell electrolytic equipment such as the scale absorption cage shown in fig 2 directly in the recirculating pond and connecting it with the dc power supply outside the pond when the reaction proceeds to a certain extent the equipment is taken out for manual scale detachment and then placed into the pond again for subsequently repetitive process there are some non negligible drawbacks attached with directly immersive electrochemical reactor that the scale removal requires to be accomplished by means of manual scraping clubbing or high pressure water jet impact etc which is time wasting and energy consuming also easily causes the deformation and breakdown of the cathode greatly influencing the convenient usage of customer and the continuity of equipment performance as for outer tank operated mode the recirculating water is introduced into the shell electrolytic equipment outside the tank through pump extraction path 1 in fig 7 or artesian effect with pressure path 2 in fig 7 and is then discharged into the pond for successive recirculation after a period time of reaction compared with the directly immersive device the outer tank operated installation requires the addition of pumps pipes valves and containers etc which attaches a significant burden to the equipment investment consequently with regard to some small or micro recirculating cooling water systems the more favorable economic efficiency can be derived from directly immersive installation mode than that of outer tank operated type 4 influence factors 4 1 electrical parameters there are great significance and influence of electrical parameters attaching to electrochemical treatment performance in the process of scientific research and engineering application the current is more convenient to control than the voltage and other parameters thus the current i e current density is used to represent the electrical parameters prevailingly on the one hand xu 65 66 et al indicated that the current directly affects the theoretical processing capacity of the electrochemical equipment and both the hardness and alkalinity removal efficiency are verified to be improve with the increase of the current the reason is that the electrochemical alkali production process shown as eq 2 accelerates with the rise of the current input so that the scale deposition process presented as eqs 3 5 are expedited accordingly also according to the researches results of chen s group 8 61 the precipitation rate of hardness ions could be promoted with the augments of the current density at the beginning i e under 40 a m2 while an asymptotic limit would exist no matter how high the current density is applied i e over 260 a cm2 owing to the restricted mass transfer of ca2 and hco3 it is worth noting that as demonstrated by karoui 4 6 9 and zeppenfeld 16 17 et al higher cathodic potential was proved to be conducive to the formation brucite mg oh 2 deposition instead of aragonite caco3 and there is no specific boundary for the rate growth of brucite precipitation derived from the rise of current density because unlike caco3 the oh for brucite formation is not restricted by the mass transfer in the vicinity of cathode although the actual hardness removal usually conforms to the principle described above of caco3 because the calcium ions are dominant in recirculating cooling water that mechanisms about brucite provide us a novel thinking about the influence of current density on different wastewater anyhow on the other hand based on the investigation of chen s group 3 8 61 62 the increase of current density could distinctly burden the energy consumption since higher current density means more energy input 1 9 kw h kg caco3 of energy consumption at 20 a m3 of current density and 37 6 kw h kg caco3 at 300 a m3 so as to cause that current efficiency could be prominently reduced and reach a nearly constant value where 17 and 5 of current efficiency corresponded to 20 a m3 and 300 a m3 of current density respectively moreover xu 65 66 et al revealed that the current value however affects the stable state of the cathode surface area and the crystalline morphology of scale formed with improperly high current adopting the gas evolution phenomenon in the cathode surface area shall be severe resulting in the failure of water stability around the vicinity of cathode namely in the complete turbulence state which eventually affects the directional migration process of ca2 mg2 and further impairs the scale precipitation effect it is interesting that with the similar mechanism but different purpose yu 3 et al introduced an approach that increasing the current density significantly to address the issue of scale detachment as mentioned above to sum up the appropriate range of the current value i e current density is supposed to be determined through specific objective in experimental scale and in combination with the engineering situation in actual practice 4 2 hydraulic retention time hydraulic retention time can be defined as the time that water stays in the electrochemical reactor under the premise that the volume of the electrochemical device is determined flow rate which is inversely proportional to hydraulic retention time can substitute that index for description the higher value of the hydraulic retention time brings about the longer time of water participating in the processes in the reactor and the milder flow disturbance state which is conducive to the directional migration of ca2 mg2 to the cathode for better treatment effect as stated in the work of chen s group 3 8 61 62 that the removal efficiency reduced from 20 9 to 18 8 as the increase of flow rate from 10 l h to 15 l h indicated that higher flow rate could bring about the worse hardness removal performance due to insufficient diffusion rate and inadequate disposal conversely the augment of flow rate could promote the precipitation rate because more hardness ions were deposited due to more recirculating cooling water treated from higher flow rate in addition the specific energy consumption could be reduced and the current efficiency could be increased through rising the flow rate to remove more total hardness the energy consumption decreased from 24 5 kw h kg caco3 to 17 5 kw h kg caco3 and current efficiency grow up from 10 0 to 13 4 with the increase of the flow rate from 10 l h to 15 l h those aforementioned rules were also scientifically verified by other researchers such as chen 3 and hasson 10 12 et al in summary the higher flow rate could reduce the energy consumption per unit mass of scale as well as increase current efficiency but could lead to the unsatisfactory hardness removal effect nevertheless the lower flow rate i e the longer hydraulic retention time implies the expand of the processor volume demand or the reduction of the achievable processing flow at the expense of the economic benefits thus the choice of hydraulic retention time needs to be comprehensively considered with the actual situation of equipment and engineering project 4 3 water quality parameters since the calcium ions play the predominant role in actual recirculating water chen s group 3 8 61 62 pointed out that the hardness removal coincides with the variation trend of ca2 although chen 8 et al declared that the caco3 precipitation was more closely related to hco3 however if the hardness is extremely low the concentration of ca2 in the interface between cathode and water will be restrained by effects of diffusion and mass transfer 67 according to the experiment of hasson 10 12 et al the augment of ca2 from 160 to 610 mg l could bring about the improvement of scale deposition and decline of specific energy consumption from 8 7 to 2 2 kw h kg caco3 an apparent reason is that energy consumption could be reduced via the solution with higher conductivity while the more hardness ions are capable of increasing the conductivity of solution on the other hand the improperly high hardness can however give rise to the incompetence of the electrochemical equipment processing capacity causing that water treatment degree is degraded and inadequate to meet the requirements on the project site water quality parameters including water sample hardness value and hardness alkalinity mole ratio are uncontrollable conditions 68 so that it is unpractical to change the water quality determined by customer through available techniques moreover as demonstrated by tlili 10 12 et al there is considerable disparity of the hardness between the solution and the vicinity of the electrode thus it is supposed to practically verify the feasibility of electrochemical descaling performance under corresponding situation anyhow it is still not neglectable to attach close considerations to water quality parameters in particular hardness as they have important guiding significance for the selection of electrochemical reactor number for recirculating cooling water system 5 practical application the electrochemical water quality stabilization technology of recirculating water has been applied in the engineering practice in china to some extent also it has brought certain economic benefits on account of superiorities some relevant practical projects reported in chinese academic journals are reviewed herein to illustrate the application of this technology in china zhang 69 et al reported the pilot application details of the electrochemical device on a 1700 m3 h inter cooling open recirculating cooling water system in a steel and metallurgical enterprise the equipment was put into operation in april 2012 and after seven months of processing the water quality indexes were significantly optimized with the total hardness calcium hardness alkalinity chloride ion conductivity and total phosphorus dropping by 24 81 35 42 25 57 23 84 14 90 and 63 01 respectively the corrosion rates of the recovered 2 pieces of carbon steel were 0 0072 mm a and 0 0083 mm a respectively which were lower than the 0 075 mm a required by the corrosion index in the code for design of industrial recirculating cooling water treatment gb50050 2007 indicating a productive anti corrosion effect after accounting the whole process cost of electrochemical method including equipment fee construction fee electricity fee water fee reagent fee and management and maintenance fee was 687 400 yuan far less than those of the traditional method with chemicals up to 1 374 million yuan wang 70 et al stated the employment of electrochemical descaling device in the 4000 m3 h recirculating water system of cnooc dxpc china national offshore oil corporation daxie petrochemical phase ii which realized the operation of recirculating water concentration multiple greater than 6 0 reduced the water make up rate by 0 54 and saved 199 000 tons of clean water every year under assistance of the electrochemical treatment system the dosage of corrosion inhibitor scale inhibitor bactericide and ph regulator were reduced by 10 15 19 and 100 respectively with evidently preferable economic efficiency apart from the electricity cost of the electrochemical treatment system the direct economic benefit is about 1 4693 million yuan per year according to duan 71 et al electrochemical water softening device was adopted for the recirculating water system of 7700 m3 h in yida chemical industry co ltd coke group shanxi province and was operated for 3 months to reduce the total alkalinity total hardness chloride ion calcium ion as well as total phosphorus by 67 4 64 8 67 3 43 3 and 58 7 respectively which can decrease 36 000 tons of new water consumption every year and save more than 1 1 million yuan of all kinds of investment besides zhang 72 et al described the specific situation of applying the plate electrochemical descaling device in the 9000 m3 h recirculating water system of chutian oxygen co ltd then compared the treatment performance of electrochemical method with chemical reagent the experimental data from 56 day operation indicated that the total hardness conductivity and turbidity of treated water by chemical reagent method were 1 98 2 18 and 1 1 times respectively higher than that by electrochemical method during processing for 56 days the plate electrochemical water softening device reduced 1 171 tons of scale from raw water and decreased the total hardness of recirculating water effectively from 675 mg l to 198 mg l it can reasonably be demonstrated by the above data that electrochemical method has distinct superiorities in terms of recirculating water quality stabilization li 73 et al reported the application of electrochemical ultrasonic technology in the 2000 3000 m3 h recirculating water system for 6 mw waste heat power station of zibo chongzheng cement co ltd after installing the combined system the concentration rate of recirculating water increased from less than 3 times to 5 6 times and the percentage of sewage discharge in the total recirculating water decreased from 1 25 to 0 3 according to the calculation 702 400 yuan annual cost saving was successfully achieved those above cases demonstrate that the electrochemical water quality stabilization technique exerts prominent advantages in terms of retaining water quality of recirculating cooling water system decrease recharge of make up water cutting down emissions of pollutant and reducing chemical reagents usage etc which can bring direct objective economic benefit for enterprises however on account of limitation of current technology by the treatment capacity of cathode per unit area single electrochemical equipment usually cannot meet requirement of recirculating cooling water system with large scale inflow which is a main challenge for further industrialization consequently it has a promising market prospect in water treatment solution yet urgently demands more attention and further research 6 conclusion and prospect it is of great significance for enterprises to operate the recirculating cooling water system safely and stably with distinctive technical characteristics electrochemical water quality stabilization technology exerts favorable advantages in maintaining the stability of recirculating water quality saving water resource and reducing effluent emissions as well as cutting down the usage of chemical reagents the primary focus of this paper has been to highlight the promising prospect of electrochemical water quality stabilization technology it firstly gives a detailed comparison of prevalent method for stabilizing the recirculating cooling water quality and then illustrates the mechanism of electrochemical technology for that purpose that is scale cleaning sterilization algae and organic substances removal next we introduce the primary components i e anode cathode and power supply system typical forms i e manual and automatic and system installation i e directly immersive type and outer tank operated type of electrochemical devices on the market the relevant influencing factors are also discussed in terms of electrical indexes power supply mode hydraulic retention time the cathode and water quality lastly we review some applications reported in china to demonstrate the marketing feasibility of this technology however as a newly promoted technology it has a nonnegligible defect of insufficient scale removal ability in some circumstances chen 3 8 61 62 et al declared that the hardness removal rate of traditional electrochemical water quality stabilization technology for recirculating water was merely maintained within the range of 15 25 not as ideally competent as engineering requirement according to d hasson 22 74 et al to achieve half of hardness reduction adopting the electrochemical method for the treatment of a recirculating water system with a hardness of 2000 mg l and a flow rate of 20 m3 h the required cathode area was up to 400 m2 far exceeding the cathode area of the currently available electrochemical scale removal equipment in the market the promotion of this technology as a result demand urgently intensive research and rapid development including in depth inquiry on technical principles advantageous optimization of core components maturity and cost control of engineering equipment application as well as the combination with other parallel technologies as shown in table 1 etc in sum technical performance improvement and application cost reduction
