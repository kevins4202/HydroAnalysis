15295,adaptation to substrate fluctuations is a life actuality of microbes in global municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps yet there remains a lack of definite information on how influent changes with different alternation frequencies shape the stability of anammox consortia and the metabolic regulations they feedback according to human rhythmic activity day fluctuant fed every 6 h alternating between 50 and 100 mg nh4 n l substantially diminished the robustness of nitrogen removal efficiency nre 84 1 7 0 left skewed distribution r 2 0 87 and shock resistance ability 30 effluent

yields and superior tolerance juggling the shortest recovery time and highest nre tightest protein secondary structure facing long term load shocks than steady state 75 mg nh4 n l 16s sequencing showed that the influent disturbance led to increased levels of bacterial diversity however a similar microbiota composition between week fluctuant and steady systems was detected notably k strategist candidatus kuenenia was more sensitive to substrate fluctuations with the lower relative abundance at day fluctuant 23 4 5 1 and week fluctuant 39 5 4 3 than at steady state community 47 5 4 2 conversely candidatus jettenia had higher relative abundance at day fluctuant i e 1 3 0 1 compared to that at week fluctuant 0 2 0 04 and steady state 0 05 0 03 importantly untargeted metabolomics revealed that week fluctuant grown anammox microbiota increased protein synthesis and transporter expression while decreasing expression of catabolic pathways citric acid cycle and bypass as a strategy for efficient substrate uptake and utilization which clearly different to day fluctuant and steady state survival ways overall we predictively reported an anabolic adaptation growth state for the anammox consortia and put forward the associated reinforcement control strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox robustness substrate concentration fluctuation frequency eps protein secondary structure metabolomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria deeply branched in the phylum planctomycetes are the main players in the global nitrogen cycle which utilize nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 to form dinitrogen gas n2 stein and klotz 2016 in engineering practice anammox mediated microbial systems have been used extensively and are one of the most successful biotechnologies for removal of high ammonia sewage e g anaerobic sludge digestion effluent under mesophilic and microaerobic or oxygen free conditions lackner et al 2014 they are deployed in mainstream sewage plants 30 100 mg nh4 n l cao et al 2017 lotti et al 2015 including partial nitrification anammox pn a and partial denitrification anammox pd a processes cao et al 2019 and may even address issues of energy autarky and reduction of carbon footprints however exploitation of robust anammox processes in mainstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps faces unpredictable instabilities due to low temperatures and or human induced fluctuations of environmental influent i e low n concentrations and variable n loads laureni et al 2016 chemolithoautotrophic anammox taxa are highly sensitive to changes in substrate concentration frequency and duration including irreversible nitrite 70 2000 mg no2 n l thresholds inhibition wang et al 2016 a successful strategy for microbes to manage substrate fluctuation requires accurate sensing of resource availability and rapid adjustment of metabolic programs resource richness bacteria utilize external nutrients and typically grow quickly faster growth requires higher ribosome content roller et al 2016 resource deficiency starvation selects for bacteria with a higher affinity to the limiting substrate and the bacteria activate coherent responses to express catabolic enzymes li et al 2020b recent studies have highlighted that a secret key to enriching anammox bacteria is applying short hydraulic retention time hrt and maintaining low nitrogen strength c a 100 mg tn l which increases nucleic acid activity and amino acid metabolism guo et al 2018 zhang and okabe 2020 as well as specific substrate concentration studies have shown that pulse fed feeding frequency lowers effluent concentrations of long chain fatty acids lcfa and increases methane yields in anaerobic digesters svensson et al 2018 ziels et al 2018 as well as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha storage in activated sludge ciggin et al 2011 even in medicine and health management similar mechanisms for frequency optimization have been described for example intermittent fasting alternate day fasting frequency the 5 2 diet and time restricted feeding improves glucose regulation increases stress resistance and suppresses inflammation et al lamos et al 2020 thus it can be anticipated that metabolic flexibility and adaptation of anammox consortia can also be improved by selecting suitable substrate feeding frequencies previously theoretical and empirical research on anammox substrate supply is primarily on knowledge derived from a given nutrient environment e g dormancy mode xu et al 2020 starvation zhang et al 2019 relative a high versus a low nitrogen loading rate nlr li et al 2020a or single transitions between steady states e g famine and feast kang et al 2019 stepwise increase decrease influent concentrations wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018a only a few studies have measured the rate of inflow fluctuations rapid varying hrt showing high anammox granule robustness to various low strength shocks from abundant polysaccharides ps protection mechanisms wang et al 2019a however that study did not include the steady state flux control necessary to dissociate the effects of fluctuation from the net anammox property a similar faster anammox granulation process was found at side stream concentrations with week alternating loadings c a 400 600 mg tn l guo et al 2017 hence whether and how substrate fluctuations of different frequencies under low nitrogen strength affect the physiological biochemical properties of anammox consortia remains unknown this is a crucial question as in modern sewage plants influent concentrations are rarely constant and in many cases there exists an order of magnitude discrepancy between the lowest and highest load during the day olsson 2012 for example the cyclical nature of human activities that vary with the hour of the day and the day of the week inappropriate connections of rainfall and runoff water pumping stations deliver intermittently and mechanical failures may induce influent loading fluctuations furthermore it is difficult to accurately classify fluctuations in terms of duration as they can be from a few hours diurnal rhythms up to many days weak weekly rhythms or even longer seasonal rhythms leitao et al 2006 olsson 2012 in this context prospective studies to develop strategies achieving efficient and robust anammox ecosystem runs around the clock are urgently required and have high commercial potential herein using a combination of comparative and experimental approaches the ecological and metabolic profiles of anammox consortia exposed to rhythmic influent fluctuations were investigated robust analysis of operational performance and extracellular polymeric substances eps properties were conducted based on custom membrane bioreactors mbrs that mimicked the day and week fluctuant ca 6 h barbu et al 2017 cheng et al 2021 le tallec et al 1997 and 6 d guo et al 2017 sun et al 2016 alternation frequency respectively under 100 200 mg tn l substrate concentration tomaszewski et al 2019 and steady state influent environments over 120 d the composition of anammox community and the response of keystone species diversity and stability were determined by 16 s amplicon sequencing gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms based metabolomics enabled quantification of how substrate perturbations concentration and frequency affect cellular growth strategy importantly we tested the engineering metrics of effluents representing central tendency and variation under extreme high load shocks with an emphasis on the hypothesis that mainstream like substrate fluctuations in concentration under optimal frequency regimes likely reinforce metabolic adaptation and ecological stability of anammox consortia together this multifaceted approach will provide a predictive framework to further our understanding for substrate change timescales and assiciated control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and load control three custom continuous mbrs with complete biomass retention ability and a working volume of 7 5 l supporting information fig s1 were inoculated with a nearly equal amount of anammox bacteria ca 1 2 g dry weight dominated by candidatus kuenenia and operated over 180 days from may 2019 to december 2019 40 days start up 120 days fluctuation and 26 days shock load phases the seed sludge was obtained from a lab scale anammox reactor chen et al 2020 achieving 85 nre under nlr of 1 2 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 adjusted nutrient media were prepared in the membrane bioreactor as previously described table s1 van der star et al 2008 initially anammox biomass of the paralleled mbrs was adaptively cultured at steady influent c a 150 mg tn l regulated by the addition of nh4 2so4 and nano2 with a molar ratio of 1 1 zhang et al 2018 the hrt was set at 12 h and then stepwise decreased to 9 h then 6 h until an nlr of 0 6 kg n m 3 d 1 was reached in the start up period to mimic daily and weekly rhythmic influent concentration and frequency variations in the mainstream of wwtps 30 100 mg nh4 n l cao et al 2017 lotti et al 2015 the approximately 6 h barbu et al 2017 cheng et al 2021 le tallec et al 1997 and 6 day guo et al 2017 sun et al 2016 alterations in frequency that occur under substrate concentrations of 100 200 mg tn l tomaszewski et al 2019 were adopted respectively according to the above relevant literature of these the high nitrogen concentration 200 mg l was selected considering the possible industrial effluent leakages and the periodicity of human activities as a control the nitrogen loading strength of steady state was set to 75 mg nh4 n l and 75 mg no2 n l of equal average concentrations to minimize the interference of residual nitrite zhang et al 2018 finally a side stream high load shock c a 400 mg tn l was added to the three mbrs for 26 days with a shock nlr up to 1 6 kg n m 3 d 1 for details of the operational strategy see table s2 to further test the efficiency and robustness of the mbrs under different shock strategies extreme short term nh4 n and no2 n loads were imposed by increasing the influent nitrogen concentration to 2 7 and 13 3 times higher than before at days 160 and 186 c a 400 mg tn l for 36 h and 2000 mg tn l for 6 h respectively fig s3 crucially the mixed anammox biomass of the three mbrs was withdrawn regularly at a rate of 800 ml week in the fluctuation stage to maintain a similar sludge retention time srt at 65 days when the transmembrane pressure tmp reached 0 02 mpa an off line cleaning i e cake and gel layers removal by tap water then immersed into 0 3 naocl solution for 12 h was simultaneously applied to the three mbrs for permeability recovery the three mbrs were maintained at 50 rpm mixing intensity with an almost mesophilic 32 c alkaline 7 9 ph and low dissolved oxygen do 0 3 mg l environment across the entire experimental period to collect representative in effluents in day fluctuant mbr of the fluctuation stage two replicates were harvested 1 h prior to the loading condition change i e 200 mg tn l influent at 11 12 am 100 mg tn l influent at 5 6 pm in effluents of week fluctuant and steady state reactors were correspondingly collected at 5 6 pm concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were analyzed every 2 days according to standard colorimetric methods baird et al 2017 anammox size was determined using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 uk on days 38 159 and 185 respectively to visualize the microstructure anammox aggregates were gradient dehydrated and freeze dried and a field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini300 german was employed on day 159 mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss baird et al 2017 were measured on days 0 30 70 100 130 160 and 185 respectively 2 2 eps extraction quantification and secondary structure characterization natural anammox eps was extracted according to a nondestructive quartz sand protocol chen et al 2020 for the week fluctuant mode four biological replicates in a fluctuating cycle 2 2 10 cycles in total were harvested 1 2 days prior to each loading change i e two duplicates before the end of 200 mg n l influent two duplicates before the end of 100 mg n l influent day fluctuant and steady state grown anammox biomass were collected simultaneously at the fluctuation phase in the same way on days 45 50 56 62 68 75 81 87 93 98 105 110 117 123 129 135 141 147 153 159 besides this three biological replicates were conducted to obtain the eps matrix in the start up day 38 and shock load day 185 phases all extracted eps samples were collected in duplicate one portion was used to quantify extracellular proteins pn polysaccharides ps and nucleic acids edna utilizing the bca osnes et al 1993 phenol sulfuric acid dubois et al 1955 and diphenylamine colorimetric approaches sun et al 1999 respectively the other duplicate portion was lyophilized for fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicoletis 10 usa detection details are presented in text s1 hierarchical clustering analysis hca of pn secondary structure amide i band 1700 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 was performed further based on squared euclidean distance chen et al 2020 yin et al 2015 2 3 anammox microbiota 16s rrna gene sequencing fifteen anammox biomass samples were collected from the three mbrs on days 35 n 1 3 mbrs start up 153 n 2 3 week 10 fluctuation 200 mg tn l and 159 n 2 3 week 10 fluctuation 100 mg tn l and snap frozen at 80 c until use dna was extracted from 0 1 g of anammox biomass using magnetic soil dna kit tiangen biotech co ltd beijing china according to the manufacturer s instructions bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified using the universal primer 515f 806r v4 region earth microbiome project caporaso et al 2012 and sequenced on an illumina novaseq platform 250 bp paired end reads the uparse pipeline edgar 2013 was used to quality filter raw sequences and merge and classify sequences into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity following clustering the silva database version 132 quast et al 2013 was used for taxonomic annotations raw sequences have been stored in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under project number prjna778901 2 4 gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms measurement to further investigate the metabolite profiles under different substrate fluctuation modes n 2 biological replicates 3 mbrs on days 153 and 159 respectively anammox bio aggregates were snap frozen lyophilized and chemically derivatized for gc ms tian et al 2020 for further details on the metabolite extraction and gc separation process see text s2 ms dial was used for preprocessing gc ms data including removing noise recognizing adducts and finding and quantifying features tsugawa et al 2015 metabolite annotation was performed using a custom lug database fu et al 2021 to exclude false positives all peak strength peak area of the biosamples were screened and piecewise normalized threshold set to a coefficient of variation cv of the interior label 30 suchmacher and geller 2021 2 5 bioinformatic analyses microbial metabolic pathways were determined by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database http www genome jp kegg statistical analyses were performed in graphpad prism or r the shapiro wilk test was used for testing normality the nonparametric mann whitney u test compare ranks and median or kolmogorov smirnov test compare cumulative distribution was applied to determine statistical differences between groups besides significant differences between two experimental groups were identified using two tailed unpaired t tests p 0 05 considered significant graphpad prism and adobe illustrator were used to generate figures 3 results 3 1 bioreactor performance and anammox biomass features complex dynamic fluctuations in substrate inflow concentration magnitude and frequency induced notably differentiated process level performances and anammox morphologic heterogeneity figs 1 and s2 after day 40 nitrogen conversion mean 83 9 85 8 and mlvss 1 70 1 76 g l were comparable in the three mbrs at start up baseline nlr of 0 3 kg n m 3 d 1 stepwise increased to 0 6 kg n m 3 d 1 fig 1a 4a however the total nitrogen removal efficiency nre of week fluctuant mean sd 86 6 3 1 median 86 6 was higher than day fluctuant 84 1 7 0 86 1 p 0 05 kolmogorov smirnov test compare cumulative distribution and steady state 85 5 3 0 p 0 05 after two srt 65 day fluctuating runs particularly clear anomalies were frequently observed in the day fluctuant reactor sudden reduction in nre and stoppage of n2 output on days 103 and 154 which were only resolved by average stable influent c a 150 mg tn l hrt 6 h to buffer for 5 days and 24 h respectively statistical distribution determined that week fluctuant and steady output data were best fit to normal distribution models r 2 0 97 and r 2 0 96 respectively while total nitrogen tn data for day fluctuant were described by a typical left skewed distribution r 2 0 86 mean 84 1 median 86 1 fig 1c notably 86 6 of the model average of week fluctuant was closest to the theoretical maximum nre of 89 kartal et al 2010 additionally in the distribution width of the gaussian model i e sd day fluctuant value was higher than the week fluctuant and steady state 3 5 versus 2 7 and 2 7 respectively indicating high data dispersal and ecosystem destabilization that is anammox organisms are susceptible to sudden or fast hourly or daily substrate concentration changes but unexpectedly robust to weekly variations in nutrient supply after entering the shock load phase c a 400 mg tn l hrt 6 h week fluctuant nre 84 7 1 6 85 1 was still significantly higher than steady state mbr median 82 6 p 0 05 mann whitney u test high dispersal ner 79 6 10 1 of day fluctuant were also observed figs 1a and s2 to further fix evidences nre effluent variability and recovery time indicators were employed to determine the robustness and stability of the three ecosystems figs 1b and s3 a series of short term shock assays were performed to replicate occasional perturbations e g industrial effluents and pipeline leakages leitao et al 2006 with a 2 67 fold load nlr 1 6 kg n m 3 d 1 at the upcoming long term shock phase 160 day the week fluctuant average of 85 2 nre outperformed day fluctuant and steady state for 36 h the effluent cv value of week fluctuant 25 6 had the lowest dispersion tendency cv 30 suchmacher and geller 2021 high dispersal and needed the shortest time 12 h to resume stability secondary operation with extreme side stream 8 0 kg n m 3 d 1 loading i e 2000 mg tn l at the end of the shock phase within intensive monitoring still showed that the most superior stress resistance occurred in the week fluctuant 80 5 nre and 6 h recovery time compared with the other mbrs an auxiliary evaluation further showed phenotypic discrepancy in particle size color and mlvss for example week fluctuant grown anammox bio aggregates were bright red representing active anammox property kang et al 2020 with larger diameters 350 4 3 μm p 0 05 and denser microstructure analogous to crowded pomegranate seeds implying high settle ability zhu et al 2018 as well as marginally higher mlvss figs s4 and s5 fig 1d table s3 especially average 3 53 g l biomass yield was 1 1 and 1 5 fold higher than that of steady state and day fluctuant at the shock load phase respectively furthermore long term high nlr triggered severe biofilm dispersion representing cell death rumbaugh and sauer 2020 for 200 μm with 90 proportion and anammox whitening in the steady control however the day and week fluctuant anammox bacteria further showed pink and dark red respectively figs s4 and s5 therefore substantial evidence suggests that week fluctuant substrate supply dramatically increases anammox ecosystem stability and productivity potential against extreme ambient disturbances 3 2 profiling of anammox eps composition and structure the properties and functions of anammox consortia rely on not the organisms but also the surrounding extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix yu 2020 endogenous eps secretion benefits the nucleation or granulation of anammox cells and thus can substantially improve mechanical stability and withstand high loads wang et al 2020b overall all secreted eps content gradually decreased from start up baseline 36 7 43 9 mg g vss to the first half of fluctuation phase and then maintained at a low and constant level hereafter 20 8 26 1 mg g vss before finally reaching a 2 fold yield before the stable state in the shock load phase 36 8 69 3 mg g vss fig 2a moreover the high average pn concentration of week fluctuant was in stark contrast to the day fluctuant and steady state over time statistically week fluctuant 52 2 3 6 mg pn g vss was significantly higher than day and steady versus 22 5 1 9 mg pn g vss and 38 6 2 5 mg pn g vss respectively both p 0 05 in the shock load phase consistent with mlvss measurements fig s4a importantly congruent with previously report zhang et al 2016 there was a strong positive correlation pearson r 0 69 p 0 05 between anammox eps production and nitrogen removal rate nrr levels fig 2b especially the week fluctuant system had the highest 1 34 kg n m 3 d 1 nrr in the shock environment thus these evidences suggest that anammox consortia grown in the week fluctuant had higher eps secretion ability and metabolic activity the high concentration of pn compared with ps and dna fig 2a indicated that anammox bio aggregates produce n rich eps chen et al 2019 of these a marginally higher pn ps ratio was observed in the week fluctuant anammox consortia 6 0 2 0 5 9 suggesting slightly stronger hydrophobicity and aggregation capacity zhao et al 2018a relative to the others which was approximately in agreement with diameter results fig 1c fig s4 table s3 previous researches have shown that certain protein secondary structures promoted bioflocculation aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020a yin et al 2015 the secondary structures of pn were obtained from derivative ftir spectra in the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 a hierarchical clustering algorithm hca categorized the average pn secondary structure e g α helix β sheet of all operation phases into three main clusters and several subclusters independent of substrate fluctuations fig 2c despite this day week fluctuant and steady state pn had the higher proportions of hydrophobic β sheet structures chen et al 2020 jia et al 2017 48 6 49 8 in the fluctuating period in particular under long term shock load stress week fluctuant pn unexpectedly displayed the tightest structure α helix β sheet random coil 0 36 and high β sheet content 46 0 while the others did not thus these results show that week fluctuant grown anammox cell surfaces possess a stronger hydrophobicity and robust spatial conformation to perturbations 3 3 anammox mediated community structure and keystone species based on the fluctuation induced changes in nitrogen conversion apparent morphology and eps properties we wondered whether bacterial niches biodiversity and stability varies across influent environments as predicted the original anammox community day 35 in the custom mbrs was dominated by the phyla planctomycetes 33 4 37 9 proteobacteria 24 9 35 4 and chloroflexi 6 1 13 6 fig 3a and clustered very closely i e beta diversity fig 3c indicating that a stable and paralleled anammox performance was established at days 153 and 159 day fluctuant microbiota experienced a dramatic taxa turnover as compared with steady state dominated by planctomycetes 55 6 proteobacteria 36 9 armatimonadetes 12 6 and bacteroidetes 5 1 formerly chlorobi were more abundant p 0 05 fig s7 suggesting the vulnerability of planctomycetes less abundant 31 p 0 05 to rapid nutrient fluctuations lefse analysis further identified that the phylum armatimonadetes lda score up to 4 76 and 4 72 in day fluctuant versus steady state and day versus week fluctuant groups respectively which has diverse ecological roles and can utilize nh4 n zhang and liu 2014 zhao et al 2018b was significantly enriched in day fluctuant microbiota implying that the overmuch armatimonadetes play an important role in the unstable day fluctuant mbr p 0 05 fig s8 fig 1 correspondingly the week fluctuant community remained stable and less variable overall planctomycetes 46 9 and proteobacteria 33 6 were still the two most abundant groups partly explaining the positive autotrophic nitrogen removal although fluctuation operation increased alpha diversity i e shannon and simpson metrics p 0 05 relative to steady state with increasing alternating frequency the original bacteria complexity was essentially higher than day week fluctuant and steady state patterns fig 3b table s5 these findings indicate a strong selection of microbial species i e planctomycetes dominated in persistent nutrient media over time ratzke et al 2020 but substrate changes induced the different degree of ecotype and functioning transformation associations between substrate fed mode and overall anammox microbial composition i e beta diversity fig 3c were evaluated by principal coordinates analyses pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance the compositional differences were most obvious between day fluctuant and steady state in the fluctuation phase amova f 18 6 p 0 001 however steady microflora was located closer to the week fluctuant with only borderline significance amova f 4 8 p 0 054 this suggests that their communities were more uniform but optimal week frequency probably selects out fluctuation adapted anammox consortia the keystone species involved in the nitrogen cycle were specifically analyzed at genus rank through pairwise comparisons including day fluctuant versus steady state week fluctuant versus steady state and day versus week fluctuant figs 3d and s9 data s1 s3 among these week fluctuant and steady state microbiotas shared the minimum number of differentially abundant functional bacteria 14 increased abundance 4 decreased abundance which were mostly affiliated with proteobacteria planctomycetes and bacteroidetes data s2 eminently the relative abundance of the dominant candidatus kuenenia an affinity k strategist at low substrate concentrations van der star et al 2008 was reduced under strong substrate fluctuations from 47 5 in steady state to 39 5 in week fluctuant to 23 4 in day fluctuant corroborating the highly dispersed nre performance of day fluctuant mbr fig 1c conversely candidatus jettenia from 0 05 to 0 2 to 1 3 as above and candidatus anammoximicrobium were more abundant p 0 05 with increasing undulation frequencies indicating that these anammox bacteria adapted well to influent perturbations intriguingly candidatus brocadia a growth rate r strategist in high substrate concentrations van der star et al 2008 had a higher abundance in week fluctuant 0 03 than day fluctuant 0 01 p 0 05 and steady state 0 02 p 0 05 additionally steady state and week fluctuant ecosystems 1 1 possessed a higher abundance of aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob unidentified nitrosomonadaceae r kosgey et al 2021 compared with day fluctuant 0 2 p 0 05 data s1 s3 denitratisoma as the most dominant denitrifiers 17 0 23 8 showed no significant difference fig 3d p 0 05 among the three communities implying its high stress resistance and resilience other denitrifying genera e g haliangium pseudomonas achromobacter thermomonas azoarcus and thauera and substantial aerobic heterotrophs contribute to scavenging of detritus and peptides from lysed dead cells lawson et al 2017 e g unidentified ignavibacteria ignavibacterium terrimonas novosphingobium mesorhizobium ferruginibacter and sphingopyxis presented significantly higher abundance in the day fluctuant community compared with steady state p 0 05 indirectly showing a high diversity of species meng et al 2019 in comparison only a few symbiotic bacteroidetes affiliated heterotrophs i e ignavibacterium 0 8 and unidentified ignavibacteria 0 5 anammox bacterial candidatus jettenia and denitrifying azoarcus more commonly inhabited the week fluctuant environment trading off for the reduction in dominant candidatus kuenenia hence these findings provide clear evidence that week fluctuant biosystem developed a reinforced mutualistic network by limited elimination of k strategist candidatus kuenenia but selecting for well adapted bacteroidetes affiliated heterotrophs candidatus jettenia and high growth rate brocadia r and retaining stress resistant denitrifying denitratisoma and haliangium fig 3d 3 4 metabolic response of anammox consortia to substrate fluctuations to further understand the fluctuation adapted growth mechanism at a molecular level the metabolite levels of anammox consortia from fluctuant and steady systems were compared untargeted metabolomics quantified the expression of 367 known metabolites pca plot fig s10 and significantly altered metabolites of pairwise comparisons based on vip 1 p 0 05 fig 4a c e respectively showed highly distinct metabolic scenarios suggesting that they very likely adopted divergent survival strategies in particular unlike the 16s inventories fig 3d week fluctuant and steady state communities shared the maximum number of differentially expressed metabolites 41 up regulated and 94 down regulated most of which corresponded to functional organic acids and derivatives e g amino acids 22 2 followed by organic oxygen compounds e g carbohydrate glycogen 16 3 lipids and lipid like molecules e g fatty acid 5 9 strikingly fatty acid 2 octenoic acid and glycerolipids 2 monostearin were overexpressed in the day fluctuant metabolome 8 8 fold and 2 1 fold 4 8 fold and 1 9 fold up regulation compared with week fluctuant and steady state respectively data s4 s6 suggesting that rapid substrate fluctuation triggered excessive lipid storage a similar phenomenon has been widely reported for cold stress response in arabidopsis thaliana nair et al 2012 or siberian spruce angelcheva et al 2014 and even abnormal cancer metabolism du et al 2017 hoy et al 2021 glucose 6 phosphate and glucose 1 phosphate for routes to the biosynthesis of both glycogen and trehalose were significantly down regulated in day fluctuant versus steady state and week fluctuant versus steady state p 0 05 data s4 s5 more importantly trehalose 6 phosphate the precursor of trehalose was also 2 fold down regulated indicating that trehalose synthesis a starvation stress protectant okabe et al 2021 is probably activated in the steady state community amino acids are the building blocks of proteins numerically dominant hydrophobic amino acids e g proline alanine methionine and glycine and limited hydrophilic glutamic acid and lysine were significantly up regulated in week fluctuant versus steady state p 0 05 data s4 suggesting that week fluctuant protein synthesis would increase this was in accordance with the marginally higher hydrophobicity pn ps ratio of week fluctuant fig 2a additionally the levels of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides e g adenosine 5 monophosphate amp 1 methylinosine and 5 thymidylic acid dtmp associated with rna dna synthesis were remarkably increased in week fluctuant microbial metabolome relative to day fluctuant 5 fold p 0 05 data s6 implying rapid bacterial growth guo et al 2018 further kegg enrichment analysis highlighted that steady state metabolites were more highly expressed in central carbon metabolism pathways for the generation of small molecular precursors and energy transfer such as citric acid cycle tca cycle catabolic pathways of most organisms pentose phosphate pp pathway nadph formation stincone et al 2015 glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism incomplete tca bypass okabe et al 2021 and galactose metabolism end products could enter glycolysis iskandar et al 2019 as well as more highly expressed in the phosphotransferase system pts for membrane transport than day fluctuant fig 4b this indicates that catabolism of steadily cultivated anammox microbiota is activated and substantial substrate was rapidly consumed consistent with the high nre 85 5 fig 1a 1c however week fluctuant microbiota dependent metabolic pathways were overwhelming enriched in amino acids and aminoacyl trna biosynthesis delivering amino acids to the ribosome for translation ling et al 2009 abc transporters membrane transport and pp pathways etc compared with day fluctuant fig 4f furthermore even when the week fluctuant group was compared with the steady state group a decrease in catabolic pathways e g tca cycle and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and an increase in substrate transport e g abc transporters and anabolic pathways e g amino acid and aminoacyl trna synthesis remained fig 4d finally metabolic evidence indicates that week fluctuant fed drove bacterial anabolism to exceed catabolism to rapid biomass yield i e costly protein synthesis as identified by measuring the anammox pn content diameter and mlvss particularly reflected in the shock load phase figs 2a and s4 4 discussion robustness is a crucial system level property for anammox microflora to maintain their functions while tolerating disturbances continuous mbr devices have intrinsic reproducibility of microbial growth rate or behavior by regularly removing biomass hu et al 2019 in this study anammox consortia cultivated at different fed patterns underwent two srt 65 days operations in the fluctuation phase figs s2 s4 and s5 which had acquired the specific growth and metabolism characteristics firstly nitrogen removal data frequency distributions including central tendency e g median mean and mode and dispersal measures e g amplitude and sd should not be understated for example day fluctuant model parameters followed a left skewed distribution in which not only the mean nre value was smaller than the median but also the operation encountered persistent setbacks and become ecologically fragile once facing load shock figs 1a c and s3 that is the risk assessment process of microbial community engineering is not well represented merely by the mean utilization of distribution models and other indicators i e recovery time and cv fig 1b could better tease apart nuances associated with system robustness from these metrics the hypothesis that rhythmic week fluctuant ecosystems had superior nitrogen removal stability and phenotypic robustness at the

better or healthier ecosystem i e stability and robustness ives and carpenter 2007 pennekamp et al 2018 ratzke et al 2020 herein steady state and week fluctuant influent mode positively synchronized with nitrogen removal and eps productivity fig 1a 2a indicating that a slightly higher community complexity favors functionality when under low frequency selective pressure but rapid day fluctuant system with the higher alpha diversity emerged significant performance anomalies fig 3b previous studies on activated sludge performance via feeding toxic 3 chloroaniline at varying frequencies also showed similar behaviors in taxonomic diversity and ecosystem robustness santillan et al 2019 therefore it can be speculated that such intermediate biodiversity levels but higher functioning stability may be driven by specifically ruling out specialists with narrow niches e g candidatus kuenenia k while benefiting generalists e g bacteroidetes affiliated microbes candidatus jettenia brocadia r and haliangium within the week fluctuant anammox microflora fig 3d data s2 for example denitrifiers with relatively high growth rates can utilize abundant eps debris to form synergistic interactions with anammox bacteria for improving nitrate nitrite removal zhou et al 2020 in particular increased r strategist candidatus brocadia van der star et al 2008 and unidentified nitrosomonadaceae kosgey et al 2021 implied that high low load alternation during doubling time probably builds eutrophic illusion for anammox taxa because in the r k selection theory a high growth rate r is advantageous at low biomass densities but plenty of substrate availability van der star et al 2008 however symbiotic heterotrophic bacteria e g the exchange of peptides and vitamin b between phylum bacteroidetes and anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 the sharing of molybdenum cofactors and folic acid between armatimonadetes proteobacteria and anammox bacteria zhao et al 2018b that overmuch emerged in the day fluctuant community fig s7 were bound to occupy the limited niche space and substrates e g nh4 n zhang and liu 2014 further influencing the anammox process meng et al 2019 pholchan et al 2013 lefse analysis suggested that armatimonadetes has the highest lda score for unstable anammox operation fig s8 analysis of 16s inventories provides insights into microorganism presence and taxonomic diversity while metabolomics is a direct readout of the system function and most closely reflects phenotypic changes bauermeister et al al the dominant roles of fatty acid and conjugates act as raw ingredients for membrane synthesis energy stores and the production of signaling molecules however abnormal cell proliferation alters the balance in lipid metabolism toward excessive storage in the form of fatty acids du et al 2017 furthermore fatty acid synthesis could reduce membrane permeability to promote biotic resistance under severe environmental changes angelcheva et al 2014 hoy et al 2021 nair et al 2012 as observed in day fluctuant metabolome e g the high abundance of 2 octenoic acid and 2 monostearinan data s4 s6 additionally almost every regulatory aspect of carbohydrate glycogen metabolism is designed for the rapid provision of adenosine triphosphate atp to maintain higher power activity the highly active tca cycle and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism incomplete tca bypass okabe et al 2021 of the steady state metabolome demonstrated that the perennially stable substrate supply did not effectively meet the demand for additional rapid proliferation such a community could be prone to starvation due to nutrient deficiency fig 4b 4d li et al 2020b importantly there is compelling evidence that the steady state high concentration of trehalose 6 phosphate a starvation stress protectant precursor was approximately 2 0 fold and 4 5 fold more abundant than the week and day fluctuant respectively data s4 s6 correspondingly protein synthesis is the most energetically costly cellular process and an attractive target for explaining the growth rate mueller et al 2021 roller et al 2016 remarkably enriched abc transporters and biosynthesis of amino acid and aminoacyl trna protein translation were persistent in the week fluctuant fig 4d 4f indicating that nutrient fluctuation within doubling time not only effectively meets maintenance energy requirements but also achieves unexpectedly biomass enrichment and rapid growth anabolic adaptation this thus strongly supports week fluctuant anammox phenotypic traits 5 environmental implication by quantifying nre distribution across a range of substrate fluctuation timescales day week fluctuant and steady state this work delineated that metabolic responses to fluctuations are not merely simple conversions between two discrete states instead a strong dependence of anammox growth on the fluctuation frequency of substrate concentration was identified highlighting the significance of temporal variability particularly these findings have potential consequences for implementing week fluctuant reinforced control strategies against mainstream anammox techniques in practical engineering applications taking the pn a process as an example fig s11 the adverse effect of day fluctuant influent concentrations can be alleviated by control measures such as the treated effluent the peak concentration backflow regularly and enriched anammox cultures addition cheng et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 alternatively we put forward that sidestream sewage high concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n switches to mainstream anammox processes in wwtps at a weekly time scale or within anammox doubling time to enhance the internal reflux and thus achieve more robust mainstream systems 6 conclusions the robust ecological advantage and adaptation growth behavior of the week fluctuant anammox system are intriguing and important the following conclusions are drawn compared to the steady state influent pattern of low nitrogen strength rapid daily influent concentration fluctuations strongly diminished reactor performance nre with a left skewed distribution and shock resistance 30 cv of effluent whereas weekly frequency fluctuations had positive effects on nitrogen removal robustness eps production and anammox aggregation higher levels of bacterial diversity alpha diversity and significantly increased abundance of proteobacteria armatimonadetes and bacteroidetes affiliated microorganisms were observed in day fluctuant microflora whereas steady and week fluctuant community

yields and superior tolerance juggling the shortest recovery time and highest nre tightest protein secondary structure facing long term load shocks than steady state 75 mg nh4 n l 16s sequencing showed that the influent disturbance led to increased levels of bacterial diversity however a similar microbiota composition between week fluctuant and steady systems was detected notably k strategist candidatus kuenenia was more sensitive to substrate fluctuations with the lower relative abundance at day fluctuant 23 4 5 1 and week fluctuant 39 5 4 3 than at steady state community 47 5 4 2 conversely candidatus jettenia had higher relative abundance at day fluctuant i e 1 3 0 1 compared to that at week fluctuant 0 2 0 04 and steady state 0 05 0 03 importantly untargeted metabolomics revealed that week fluctuant grown anammox microbiota increased protein synthesis and transporter expression while decreasing expression of catabolic pathways citric acid cycle and bypass as a strategy for efficient substrate uptake and utilization which clearly different to day fluctuant and steady state survival ways overall we predictively reported an anabolic adaptation growth state for

phylum planctomycetes are the main players in the global nitrogen cycle which utilize nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 to form dinitrogen gas n2 stein and klotz 2016 in engineering practice anammox mediated microbial systems have been used extensively and are one of the most successful biotechnologies for removal of high ammonia sewage e g anaerobic sludge digestion effluent under mesophilic and microaerobic or oxygen free conditions lackner et al 2014 they are deployed in mainstream sewage plants 30 100 mg nh4 n l cao et al 2017 lotti et al 2015 including partial nitrification anammox pn a and partial denitrification anammox pd a processes cao et al 2019 and may even address issues of energy autarky and reduction of carbon footprints however exploitation of robust anammox processes in mainstream wastewater treatment plants wwtps faces unpredictable instabilities due to low temperatures and or human induced fluctuations of environmental influent i e low n concentrations and variable n loads laureni et al 2016 chemolithoautotrophic anammox taxa are highly sensitive to changes in substrate concentration frequency and duration including irreversible nitrite 70 2000 mg no2 n l thresholds inhibition wang et al 2016 a successful strategy for microbes to manage substrate fluctuation requires accurate sensing of resource availability and rapid adjustment of metabolic programs resource richness bacteria utilize external nutrients and typically grow quickly faster growth requires higher ribosome content roller et al 2016 resource deficiency starvation selects for bacteria with a higher affinity to the limiting substrate and the bacteria activate coherent responses to express catabolic enzymes li et al 2020b recent studies have highlighted that a secret key to enriching anammox bacteria is applying short hydraulic retention time hrt and maintaining low nitrogen strength c a 100 mg tn l which increases nucleic acid activity and amino acid metabolism guo et al 2018 zhang and okabe 2020 as well as specific substrate concentration studies have shown that pulse fed feeding frequency lowers effluent concentrations of long chain fatty acids lcfa and increases methane yields in anaerobic digesters svensson et al 2018 ziels et al 2018 as well as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha storage in activated sludge ciggin et al 2011 even in medicine and health management similar mechanisms for frequency optimization have been described for example intermittent fasting alternate day fasting frequency the 5 2 diet and time restricted feeding improves glucose regulation increases stress resistance and suppresses inflammation et al lamos et al 2020 thus it can be anticipated that metabolic flexibility and adaptation of anammox consortia can also be improved by selecting suitable substrate feeding frequencies previously theoretical and empirical research on anammox substrate supply is primarily on knowledge derived from a given nutrient environment e g dormancy mode xu et al 2020 starvation zhang et al 2019 relative a high versus a low nitrogen loading rate nlr li et al 2020a or single transitions between steady states e g famine and feast kang et al 2019 stepwise increase decrease influent concentrations wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018a only a few studies have measured the rate of inflow fluctuations rapid varying hrt showing high anammox granule robustness to various low strength shocks from abundant polysaccharides ps protection mechanisms wang et al 2019a however that study did not include the steady state flux control necessary to dissociate the effects of fluctuation from the net anammox property a similar faster anammox granulation process was found at side stream concentrations with week alternating loadings c a 400 600 mg tn l guo et al 2017 hence whether and how substrate fluctuations of different frequencies under low nitrogen strength affect the physiological biochemical properties of anammox consortia remains unknown this is a crucial question as in modern sewage plants influent concentrations are rarely constant and in many cases there exists an order of magnitude discrepancy between the lowest and highest load during the day olsson 2012 for example the cyclical nature of human activities that vary with the hour of the day and the day of the week inappropriate connections of rainfall and runoff water pumping stations deliver intermittently and mechanical failures may induce influent loading fluctuations furthermore it is difficult to accurately classify fluctuations in terms of duration as they can be from a few hours diurnal rhythms up to many days weak weekly rhythms or even longer seasonal rhythms leitao et al 2006 olsson 2012 in this context prospective studies to develop strategies achieving efficient and robust anammox ecosystem runs around the clock are urgently required and have high commercial potential herein using a combination of comparative and experimental approaches the ecological and metabolic profiles of anammox consortia exposed to rhythmic influent fluctuations were investigated robust analysis of operational performance and extracellular polymeric substances eps properties were conducted based on custom membrane bioreactors mbrs that mimicked the day and week fluctuant ca 6 h barbu et al 2017 cheng et al 2021 le tallec et al 1997 and 6 d guo et al 2017 sun et al 2016 alternation frequency respectively under 100 200 mg tn l substrate concentration tomaszewski et al 2019 and steady state influent environments over 120 d the composition of anammox community and the response of keystone species diversity and stability were determined by 16 s amplicon sequencing gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms based metabolomics enabled quantification of how substrate perturbations concentration and frequency affect cellular growth strategy importantly we tested the engineering metrics of effluents representing central tendency and variation under extreme high load shocks with an emphasis on the hypothesis that mainstream like substrate fluctuations in concentration under optimal frequency regimes likely reinforce metabolic adaptation and ecological stability of anammox consortia together this multifaceted approach will provide a predictive framework to further our understanding for substrate change timescales and assiciated control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and load control three custom continuous mbrs with complete biomass retention ability and a working volume of 7 5 l supporting information fig s1 were inoculated with a nearly equal amount of anammox bacteria ca 1 2 g dry weight dominated by candidatus kuenenia and operated over 180 days from may 2019 to december 2019 40 days start up 120 days fluctuation and 26 days shock load phases the seed sludge was obtained from a lab scale anammox reactor chen et al 2020 achieving 85 nre under nlr of 1 2 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 adjusted nutrient media were prepared in the membrane bioreactor as previously described table s1 van der star et al 2008 initially anammox biomass of the paralleled mbrs was adaptively cultured at steady influent c a 150 mg

reached in the start up period to mimic daily and weekly rhythmic influent concentration and frequency variations in the mainstream of wwtps 30 100 mg nh4 n l cao et al 2017 lotti et al 2015 the approximately 6 h barbu et al 2017 cheng et al 2021 le tallec et al 1997 and 6 day guo et al 2017 sun et al 2016 alterations in frequency that occur under substrate concentrations of 100 200 mg tn l tomaszewski et al 2019 were adopted respectively according to the above relevant literature of these the high nitrogen concentration 200 mg l was selected considering the possible industrial effluent leakages and the periodicity of human activities as a control the nitrogen loading strength of steady state was set to 75 mg nh4 n l and 75 mg no2 n l of equal average concentrations to minimize the interference of residual nitrite zhang et al 2018 finally a side stream high load shock c a 400 mg tn l was added to the three mbrs for 26 days with a shock nlr up to 1 6 kg n m 3 d 1 for details of the operational strategy see table s2 to further test the efficiency and robustness of the mbrs under different shock strategies extreme short term nh4 n and no2 n loads were imposed by increasing the influent nitrogen concentration to 2 7 and 13 3 times higher than before at days 160 and 186 c a 400 mg tn l for 36 h and 2000 mg tn l for 6 h respectively fig s3 crucially the mixed anammox biomass

representative in effluents in day fluctuant mbr of the fluctuation stage two replicates were harvested 1 h prior to the loading condition change i e 200 mg tn l influent at 11 12 am 100 mg tn l influent at 5 6 pm in effluents of week fluctuant and steady state reactors were correspondingly collected at 5 6 pm concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were analyzed every 2 days according to standard colorimetric methods baird et al 2017 anammox size was determined using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 uk on days 38 159 and 185 respectively to visualize the

suspended solids mlvss baird et al 2017 were measured on days 0 30 70 100 130 160 and 185 respectively 2 2 eps extraction quantification and secondary structure characterization natural anammox eps was extracted according to a nondestructive quartz sand protocol chen et al 2020 for the week fluctuant mode four biological replicates in a fluctuating cycle 2 2 10 cycles in total were harvested 1 2 days prior to each loading change i e two duplicates before the end of 200 mg n l influent two duplicates before the end of 100 mg n l influent day fluctuant and steady state grown anammox biomass

considered significant graphpad prism and adobe illustrator were used to generate figures 3 results 3 1 bioreactor performance and anammox biomass features complex dynamic fluctuations in substrate inflow concentration magnitude and frequency induced notably differentiated process level performances and anammox morphologic heterogeneity figs 1 and s2 after day 40 nitrogen conversion mean 83 9 85

srt 65 day fluctuating runs particularly clear anomalies were frequently observed in the day fluctuant reactor sudden reduction in nre and stoppage of n2 output on days 103 and 154 which were only resolved by average stable influent c a 150 mg tn l hrt 6 h to buffer for 5 days and 24 h respectively statistical distribution determined that week fluctuant and steady output data were best fit to normal distribution models r 2 0 97 and r 2 0 96 respectively while total nitrogen tn data for day fluctuant were described by a typical left skewed distribution r 2 0 86 mean 84 1 median 86 1 fig 1c notably 86 6 of the model average of week fluctuant was closest to the theoretical maximum nre of 89 kartal et al 2010 additionally in the distribution width of the gaussian model i e sd day fluctuant value was higher than the week fluctuant and steady state 3 5 versus 2 7 and 2 7 respectively indicating high data dispersal and ecosystem destabilization that is anammox organisms are susceptible to sudden or fast hourly or daily substrate concentration changes but unexpectedly robust to weekly variations in nutrient supply after entering the shock load phase c a 400 mg tn l hrt 6 h week fluctuant nre 84 7 1 6 85 1 was still significantly higher than steady state mbr median 82 6 p 0 05 mann whitney u test high dispersal ner 79 6 10 1 of day fluctuant were also observed figs 1a and s2 to further fix evidences nre effluent variability and recovery time indicators were employed to determine the robustness and stability of the three ecosystems figs 1b and s3 a series of short term shock assays were performed to replicate occasional perturbations e g industrial effluents and pipeline leakages leitao et al 2006 with a 2 67 fold load nlr 1 6 kg n m 3 d 1 at the upcoming long term shock phase 160 day the week fluctuant average of 85 2 nre outperformed day fluctuant and steady state for 36 h the effluent cv value of week fluctuant 25 6 had the lowest dispersion tendency cv 30 suchmacher and geller 2021 high dispersal and needed the shortest time 12 h to resume stability secondary operation with extreme side stream 8 0 kg n m 3 d 1 loading i e 2000 mg tn l at the end of the shock phase within intensive monitoring still showed that the most superior stress resistance occurred in the week fluctuant 80 5 nre and 6 h recovery time compared with the other mbrs an auxiliary evaluation further showed phenotypic discrepancy in particle size color and mlvss for example week fluctuant grown anammox bio aggregates were bright red representing active anammox property kang et al 2020 with larger diameters 350 4 3 μm p 0 05 and denser microstructure analogous to crowded pomegranate seeds implying high settle ability zhu et al 2018 as well as marginally higher mlvss figs s4 and s5 fig 1d table s3 especially average 3 53 g l biomass yield was 1 1 and 1 5 fold higher than that of steady state and day fluctuant at the shock load phase respectively furthermore long term high nlr triggered severe biofilm dispersion representing cell death rumbaugh and sauer 2020 for 200 μm with 90 proportion and anammox whitening in the steady control however the day and week fluctuant anammox bacteria further showed pink and dark red respectively figs s4 and s5 therefore substantial evidence suggests that week fluctuant substrate supply dramatically increases anammox ecosystem stability and productivity potential against extreme ambient disturbances 3 2 profiling of anammox eps composition and structure the properties and functions of anammox consortia rely on not the organisms but also the surrounding extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix yu 2020 endogenous eps secretion benefits the nucleation or granulation of anammox cells and thus can substantially improve mechanical stability and withstand high loads wang et al 2020b overall all secreted eps content gradually decreased from start up baseline 36 7 43 9 mg g vss to the first half of fluctuation phase and then maintained at a low and constant level hereafter 20 8 26 1 mg g vss before finally reaching a 2 fold yield before the stable state in the shock load phase 36 8 69 3 mg g vss fig 2a moreover the high average pn concentration of week fluctuant was in stark contrast to the day fluctuant and steady state over time statistically week fluctuant 52 2 3 6 mg pn g vss was significantly higher than day and steady versus 22 5 1 9 mg pn g vss and 38 6 2 5 mg pn g vss respectively both p 0 05 in the shock load phase consistent with mlvss measurements fig s4a importantly congruent with previously report zhang et al 2016 there was a strong positive correlation pearson r 0 69 p 0 05 between anammox eps production and nitrogen removal rate nrr levels fig 2b especially the week fluctuant system had the highest 1 34 kg n m 3 d 1 nrr in the shock environment thus these evidences suggest that anammox consortia grown in the week fluctuant had higher eps secretion ability and metabolic activity the high concentration of pn compared with ps and dna fig 2a indicated that anammox bio aggregates produce n rich eps chen et al 2019 of these a marginally higher pn ps ratio was observed in the week fluctuant anammox consortia 6 0 2 0 5 9 suggesting slightly stronger hydrophobicity and aggregation capacity zhao et al 2018a relative to the others which was approximately in agreement with diameter results fig 1c fig s4 table s3 previous researches have shown that certain protein secondary structures promoted bioflocculation aggregation adsorption and biofilm formation jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020a yin et al 2015 the secondary structures of pn were obtained from derivative ftir spectra in the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 a hierarchical clustering algorithm hca categorized the average pn secondary structure e g α helix β sheet of all operation phases into three main clusters and several subclusters independent of substrate fluctuations fig 2c despite this day week fluctuant and steady state pn had the higher proportions of hydrophobic β sheet structures chen et al 2020 jia et al 2017 48 6 49 8 in the fluctuating period in particular under long term shock load stress week fluctuant pn unexpectedly displayed the tightest structure α helix β sheet random coil 0 36 and high β sheet content 46 0 while the others did not thus these results show that week fluctuant grown anammox cell surfaces possess a stronger hydrophobicity and robust spatial conformation to perturbations 3 3 anammox mediated community structure and keystone species based on the fluctuation induced changes in nitrogen conversion apparent morphology and eps properties we wondered whether bacterial niches biodiversity and stability varies across influent environments as predicted the original anammox community day 35 in the custom mbrs was dominated by the phyla planctomycetes 33 4 37 9 proteobacteria 24 9 35 4 and chloroflexi 6 1 13 6 fig 3a and clustered very closely i e beta diversity fig 3c indicating that a stable and paralleled anammox performance was established at days 153 and 159 day fluctuant microbiota experienced a dramatic taxa turnover as compared with steady state dominated by planctomycetes 55 6 proteobacteria 36 9 armatimonadetes 12 6 and bacteroidetes 5 1 formerly chlorobi were more abundant p 0 05 fig s7 suggesting the vulnerability of planctomycetes less abundant 31 p 0 05 to rapid nutrient fluctuations lefse analysis further identified that the phylum armatimonadetes lda score up to 4 76 and 4 72 in day fluctuant versus steady state and day versus week fluctuant groups respectively which has diverse ecological roles and can utilize nh4 n zhang and liu 2014 zhao et al 2018b was significantly enriched in day fluctuant microbiota implying that the overmuch armatimonadetes play an important role in the unstable day fluctuant mbr p 0 05 fig s8 fig 1 correspondingly the week fluctuant community remained stable and less variable overall planctomycetes 46 9 and proteobacteria 33 6 were still the two most abundant groups partly explaining the positive autotrophic nitrogen removal although fluctuation operation increased alpha diversity i e shannon and simpson metrics p 0 05 relative to steady state with increasing alternating frequency the original bacteria complexity was essentially higher than day week fluctuant and steady state patterns fig 3b table s5 these findings indicate a strong selection of microbial species i e planctomycetes dominated in persistent nutrient media over time ratzke et al 2020 but substrate changes induced the different degree of ecotype and functioning transformation associations between substrate fed mode and overall anammox microbial composition i e beta diversity fig 3c were evaluated by principal coordinates analyses pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance the compositional differences were most obvious between day fluctuant and steady state in the fluctuation phase amova f 18 6 p 0 001 however steady microflora was located closer to the week fluctuant with only borderline significance amova f 4 8 p 0 054 this suggests that their communities were more uniform but optimal week frequency probably selects out fluctuation adapted anammox consortia the keystone species involved in the nitrogen cycle were specifically analyzed at genus rank through pairwise comparisons including day fluctuant versus steady state week fluctuant versus steady state and day versus week fluctuant figs 3d and s9 data s1 s3 among these week fluctuant and steady state microbiotas shared the minimum number of differentially abundant functional bacteria 14 increased abundance 4 decreased abundance which were mostly affiliated with proteobacteria planctomycetes and bacteroidetes data s2 eminently the relative abundance of the dominant candidatus kuenenia an affinity k strategist at low substrate concentrations van der star et al 2008 was reduced under strong substrate fluctuations from 47 5 in steady state to 39 5 in week fluctuant to 23 4 in day fluctuant corroborating the highly dispersed nre performance of day fluctuant mbr fig 1c conversely candidatus jettenia from 0 05 to 0 2 to 1 3 as above and candidatus anammoximicrobium were more abundant p 0 05 with increasing undulation frequencies indicating that these anammox bacteria adapted well to influent perturbations intriguingly candidatus brocadia a growth rate r strategist in high substrate concentrations van der star et al 2008 had a higher abundance in week fluctuant 0

unidentified nitrosomonadaceae r kosgey et al 2021 compared with day fluctuant 0 2 p 0 05 data s1 s3 denitratisoma as the most dominant denitrifiers 17 0 23 8 showed no significant difference fig 3d p

2019 in comparison only a few symbiotic bacteroidetes affiliated heterotrophs i e ignavibacterium 0 8 and unidentified ignavibacteria 0 5 anammox bacterial candidatus jettenia and denitrifying azoarcus more commonly inhabited the week fluctuant environment trading off for the reduction in dominant candidatus kuenenia hence these findings provide clear evidence that week fluctuant biosystem developed a reinforced mutualistic network by limited elimination of k strategist candidatus kuenenia but selecting for well adapted bacteroidetes affiliated heterotrophs candidatus jettenia and high growth rate brocadia r and retaining stress resistant denitrifying denitratisoma and haliangium fig 3d 3 4 metabolic response of anammox consortia to substrate fluctuations to further understand the fluctuation adapted growth mechanism at a molecular level the metabolite levels of anammox consortia from fluctuant and steady systems were compared untargeted metabolomics quantified the expression of 367 known metabolites pca plot fig s10 and significantly altered metabolites of pairwise comparisons based on vip 1 p 0 05 fig 4a c e respectively showed highly distinct metabolic scenarios suggesting that they very likely adopted divergent survival strategies in particular unlike the 16s inventories fig 3d week fluctuant and steady state communities shared the maximum number of differentially expressed metabolites 41 up regulated and 94 down regulated most of which corresponded to functional organic acids and derivatives e g amino acids 22 2 followed by organic oxygen compounds e g carbohydrate glycogen 16 3 lipids and lipid like molecules e g fatty acid 5 9 strikingly fatty acid 2 octenoic acid and glycerolipids 2 monostearin were overexpressed in the day fluctuant metabolome 8 8 fold and 2 1 fold 4 8 fold and 1 9 fold up regulation compared with week fluctuant and steady state respectively data s4 s6 suggesting that rapid substrate fluctuation triggered excessive lipid storage a similar phenomenon has been widely reported for cold stress response in arabidopsis thaliana nair et al 2012 or siberian spruce angelcheva et al 2014 and even abnormal cancer metabolism du et al 2017 hoy et al 2021 glucose 6 phosphate and glucose 1 phosphate for routes to the biosynthesis of both glycogen and trehalose were significantly down regulated in day fluctuant versus steady state and week fluctuant versus steady state p 0 05 data s4 s5 more importantly trehalose 6 phosphate the precursor of trehalose was also 2 fold down regulated indicating that trehalose synthesis a starvation stress protectant okabe et al 2021 is probably activated in the steady state community amino acids are the building blocks of proteins numerically dominant hydrophobic amino acids e g proline alanine methionine and glycine and limited hydrophilic glutamic acid and lysine were significantly up regulated in week fluctuant versus steady state p 0 05 data s4 suggesting that week fluctuant protein synthesis would increase this was in accordance with the marginally higher hydrophobicity pn ps ratio of week fluctuant fig 2a additionally the levels of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides e g adenosine 5 monophosphate amp 1 methylinosine and 5 thymidylic acid dtmp associated with rna dna synthesis were remarkably increased in week fluctuant microbial metabolome relative to day fluctuant 5 fold p 0 05 data s6 implying rapid bacterial growth guo et al 2018 further kegg enrichment analysis highlighted that steady state metabolites were more highly expressed in central carbon metabolism pathways for the generation of small molecular precursors and energy transfer such as citric acid cycle tca cycle catabolic pathways of most organisms pentose phosphate pp pathway nadph formation stincone et al 2015 glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism incomplete tca bypass okabe et al 2021 and galactose metabolism end products could enter glycolysis iskandar et al 2019 as well as more highly expressed in the phosphotransferase system pts for membrane transport than day fluctuant fig 4b this indicates that catabolism of steadily cultivated anammox microbiota is activated and substantial substrate was rapidly consumed consistent with the high nre 85 5 fig 1a 1c however week fluctuant microbiota dependent metabolic pathways were overwhelming enriched in amino acids and aminoacyl trna biosynthesis delivering amino acids to the ribosome for translation ling et al 2009 abc transporters membrane transport and pp pathways etc compared with day fluctuant fig 4f furthermore even when the week fluctuant group was compared with the steady state group a decrease in catabolic pathways e g tca cycle and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and an increase in substrate transport e g abc transporters and anabolic pathways e g amino acid and aminoacyl trna synthesis remained fig 4d finally metabolic evidence indicates that week fluctuant fed drove bacterial anabolism to exceed catabolism to rapid biomass yield i e costly protein synthesis as identified by measuring the anammox pn content diameter and mlvss particularly reflected in the shock load phase figs 2a and s4 4 discussion robustness is a crucial system level property for anammox microflora to maintain their functions while tolerating disturbances continuous mbr devices have intrinsic reproducibility of microbial growth rate or behavior by regularly removing biomass hu et al 2019 in this study anammox consortia cultivated at different fed patterns underwent two srt 65 days operations in the fluctuation phase figs s2 s4 and s5 which had acquired the specific growth and metabolism characteristics firstly nitrogen removal data frequency distributions including central tendency e g median mean and mode and dispersal measures e g amplitude and sd should not be understated for example day fluctuant model parameters followed a left skewed distribution in which not only the mean nre value was smaller than the median but also the operation encountered persistent setbacks and become ecologically fragile once facing load shock figs 1a c and s3 that is the risk assessment process of microbial community engineering is not well represented merely by the mean utilization of distribution models and other indicators i e recovery time and cv fig 1b could better tease apart nuances associated with system robustness from these metrics the hypothesis that rhythmic week fluctuant ecosystems had superior nitrogen removal stability and phenotypic robustness at the behavioral level was verified e g a significantly bigger particle size abundant eps yields and higher mlvss to withstand higher nlr secondly higher biodiversity often but not necessarily implies a better or healthier ecosystem i e stability and robustness ives and carpenter 2007 pennekamp et al 2018 ratzke et al 2020 herein steady state and week fluctuant influent mode positively synchronized with nitrogen removal and eps productivity fig 1a 2a indicating that a slightly higher community complexity favors functionality when under low frequency selective pressure but rapid day fluctuant system with the higher alpha diversity emerged significant performance anomalies fig 3b previous studies on activated sludge performance via feeding toxic 3 chloroaniline at varying frequencies also showed similar behaviors in taxonomic diversity and ecosystem robustness santillan et al 2019 therefore it can be speculated that such intermediate biodiversity levels but higher functioning stability may be driven by specifically ruling out specialists with narrow niches e g candidatus kuenenia k while benefiting generalists e g bacteroidetes affiliated microbes candidatus jettenia brocadia r and haliangium within the week fluctuant anammox microflora fig 3d data s2 for example denitrifiers with relatively high growth rates can utilize abundant eps debris to form synergistic interactions with anammox bacteria for improving nitrate nitrite removal zhou et al 2020 in particular increased r strategist candidatus brocadia van der star et al 2008 and unidentified nitrosomonadaceae kosgey et al 2021 implied that high low load alternation during doubling time probably builds eutrophic illusion for anammox taxa because in the r k selection theory a high growth rate r is advantageous at low biomass densities but plenty of substrate availability van der star et al 2008 however symbiotic heterotrophic bacteria e g the exchange of peptides and vitamin b between phylum bacteroidetes and anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 the sharing of molybdenum cofactors and folic acid between armatimonadetes proteobacteria and anammox bacteria zhao et al 2018b that overmuch emerged in the day fluctuant community fig s7 were bound to occupy the limited niche space and substrates e g nh4 n zhang and liu 2014 further influencing the anammox process meng et al 2019 pholchan et al 2013 lefse analysis suggested that armatimonadetes has the highest lda score for unstable anammox operation fig s8 analysis of 16s inventories provides insights into microorganism presence and taxonomic diversity while metabolomics is a direct readout of the system function and most closely reflects phenotypic changes bauermeister et al al the dominant roles of fatty acid and conjugates act as raw ingredients for membrane synthesis energy stores and the production of signaling molecules however abnormal cell proliferation alters the balance in lipid metabolism toward excessive storage in the form of fatty acids du et al 2017 furthermore fatty acid synthesis could reduce membrane permeability to promote biotic resistance under severe environmental changes angelcheva et al 2014 hoy et al 2021 nair et al 2012 as observed in day fluctuant metabolome e g the high abundance of 2 octenoic acid and 2 monostearinan data s4 s6 additionally almost every regulatory aspect of carbohydrate glycogen metabolism is designed for the rapid provision of adenosine triphosphate atp to maintain higher power activity the highly active tca cycle and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism incomplete tca bypass okabe et al 2021 of the steady state metabolome demonstrated that the perennially stable substrate supply did not effectively meet the demand for additional rapid proliferation such a community could be prone to starvation due to nutrient deficiency fig 4b 4d li et al 2020b importantly there is compelling evidence that the steady state high concentration of trehalose 6 phosphate a starvation stress protectant precursor was approximately 2 0 fold and 4 5 fold more abundant than the week and day fluctuant respectively data s4 s6 correspondingly protein synthesis is the most energetically costly cellular process and an attractive target for explaining the growth rate mueller et al 2021 roller et al 2016 remarkably enriched abc transporters and biosynthesis of amino acid and aminoacyl trna protein translation were persistent in the week fluctuant fig 4d 4f indicating that nutrient fluctuation within doubling time not only effectively meets maintenance energy requirements but also achieves unexpectedly biomass enrichment and rapid growth anabolic adaptation this thus strongly supports week fluctuant anammox phenotypic traits 5 environmental implication by quantifying nre distribution across a range of substrate fluctuation timescales day week fluctuant and steady state this work delineated that metabolic responses to fluctuations are not merely simple conversions between two discrete states instead a strong dependence of anammox growth on the fluctuation frequency of substrate concentration was identified highlighting the significance of temporal variability particularly these findings have potential consequences for implementing week fluctuant reinforced control strategies against mainstream anammox techniques in practical engineering applications taking the pn a process as an example fig s11 the adverse effect of day fluctuant influent concentrations can be alleviated by control measures such as the treated effluent the peak concentration backflow regularly and enriched anammox cultures addition cheng et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 alternatively we put forward that sidestream sewage high concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n switches to mainstream anammox processes in wwtps at a weekly time scale or within anammox doubling time to enhance the internal reflux and thus achieve more robust mainstream systems 6 conclusions the robust ecological advantage and adaptation growth behavior of the week fluctuant anammox system are intriguing and important the following conclusions are drawn compared to the steady state influent pattern of low nitrogen strength rapid daily influent concentration fluctuations strongly diminished reactor performance nre with a left skewed distribution and shock resistance 30 cv of effluent whereas weekly frequency fluctuations had positive effects on nitrogen removal robustness eps production and anammox aggregation higher levels of bacterial diversity alpha diversity and significantly increased abundance of proteobacteria armatimonadetes and bacteroidetes affiliated microorganisms were observed in day fluctuant microflora whereas steady and week fluctuant community composition converged in the fluctuation phase rapidly day fluctuant anammox metabolome increases fatty acid storage against ambient perturbations however week fluctuant metabolome exhibited a

15296,salinization caused by climate change and nitrogen n pollution are both important environmental threats for inland lakes however evaluating their interactive effects continues to be challenging here field observation and microcosmic experiments were conducted in six lakes of east asia with the different salinity and climate characteristics to explore the response of the key n cycle processes related to n fate to the climate induced change in salinity the results indicated that increased salinity inhibited denitrification which was the outcome of two cumulative effects the long term microbial adaptation effect and the direct salinity stress whereas increased salinity had unsignificant or positive effects on dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium it had caused that n retention capacity is relatively stronger in saline than freshwater lakes inland lakes are long term basin wide integrators of climatic conditions that drying salinization and wetting desalination with climate change in semi arid regions of east asia lake shrinkage salinization and increasing temperature driven by climate warming and drying may exert a negative impact on n pollution through concentrating decreasing denitrification and increasing ammonium release from sediment the threat of climate change on these lakes is not just the quantity of water but its quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification dnra inland lake salinity semi arid region climate warming data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the human activities result in more than doubled the amount of nitrogen n circulating in the biosphere making n has changed from improvement of food production to eutrophication fowler et al 2013 galloway et al 2008 this alteration leads to reduced water quality and ecology health greaver et al 2016 stevens 2019 and is considered as one of the most serious threats to inland waters ho et al 2019 in aquatic ecosystems denitrification is considered the primary pathway for permanent n removal via reducing nitrate to dinitrogen n2 pina ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 seitzinger 1988 and provide a valuable ecosystem service by mitigating the impacts of increased n inputs finlay et al 2013 alternatively some microbes can reduce nitrate to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and retain n as a more bioavailable form burgin and hamilton 2007 giblin et al 2013 therefore understanding the nitrate reduction whether it is removed via denitrification or retained via dnra have far reaching implications for evaluating and predicting the n fate in aquatic ecosystems dong et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 nizzoli et al 2010 scott et al 2008 van den berg et al 2017 inland lakes are long term basin wide integrators of climatic conditions woolway et al 2020 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 while climate change introduces a new challenge for lake ecology health mosley 2015 tao et al 2015 trenberth et al 2014 climate change can influence on inland lakes either by the higher temperature or by changes in salinity greaver et al 2016 mosley 2015 the latter particularly in arid and semi arid lakes brucet et al 2012 lin et al 2017 lakes in arid or semi arid region are usually naturally saline as the evaporative concentration process leads to progressive salt accumulation wurtsbaugh et al 2017 yapiyev et al 2017 many of these lakes are salinizing at alarming rates as climate change guo et al 2015 tao et al 2015 yapiyev et al 2021 the change in salinity can disturb the nutrients cycle processes ardon et al 2013 herbert et al 2015 laverman et al 2007 so the problem of eutrophication will be even more complicated the inland lake is facing difficult water management challenges with the interactive effects of n pollution and salinization therefore how the key processes related to n fate in inland lakes will respond to climatically induced changes in salinity is a key question considerable studies have reported that salinity can affect n cycling processes such as denitrification and dnra through osmotic stress ionic toxicity and oxidative stress ardon et al 2013 laverman et al 2007 rysgaard et al 1999 zhao et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 herbert et al 2015 reviewed that increased salinity have been proposed to increase nitrate reduction via dnra and decrease n removal in freshwater wetlands from a global perspective but a meta analysis of zhou et al 2016 indicated that salinity have no effects to denitrification and dnra in coastal ecosystems a consensus remains elusive likely due to the differences in microbial community involved in n cycling and the composition of salts franklin et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 neubauer et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in addition these studies mainly focus on the coastal ecosystem and the change in salinity is mainly attributed to seawater intrusion we lack a direct understanding of salinity response of n cycling processes in inland lakes here we selected six lakes with the different salinity and climate characteristics in east asia to explore the influence of changes in salinity on denitrification and dnra meanwhile we combined a salinity gradient test with a long term water quality monitoring in lake bosten to reveal the relationship among climate change salinity and lake n fate we test the following hypotheses a the influencing mechanism will be differences between lakes of arid or semi arid region asr and humid or semi humid region hsr due to the difference in salinity and climate characteristics b increased salinity will lead to the decrease of denitrification and the increase of n retention capacity c the climate change can influence lake n fate via changing in salinity our study provides insights into the influence of changes in salinity on n cycling in inland lakes and can be used to predict future response of n fate to climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample

dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured at each sampling site in situ with a multiparameter water quality sonde ysi exo2 yellow springs instruments inc yellow spring oh usa in this study ec is used as a proxy for salinity in addition a long term water quality monitoring was conducted based on the routine cruises of the institute of lake bosten of environmental protection bureau in bayingolin mongolia autonomous prefecture of xinjiang from 1997 to 2018 water samples were collected twice a year in the spring and autumn at 13 sampling sites to determine ec and total nitrogen tn concentrations 2 2 slurry incubation experiments in six lakes potential denitrification and dnra rates were measured using slurry incubation incorporating the 15n isotope tracing technique following previously published methods jiang et al 2020 briefly the sediments were mixed with lake water at a ratio of 1 10 to make homogenized slurry the slurry was stirred continuously and purged with helium for 40 min the purged slurry was distributed into 12 ml vials labco exetainer uk and then immediately sealed subsequently preincubation was conducted in field temperature on a shaker table 200 rpm for 24 h to eliminate residual nitrate and do after preincubation a certain amount of 15n sodium nitrate solution was injected into each vial to give a final concentration of 100 μmol l 1 six of the vials were randomly selected and immediately preserved with the addition of 200 ml zncl2 as the initial samples for the measurement of 29n2 30n2 and 15n ammonium concentrations the remaining vials were incubated under the same conditions for 8 h and then sacrificed to measure the production of 29n2 30n2 and 15n ammonium in addition a salinity gradient test has been conducted in lake bosten to explore the direct effect of changes in salinity on potential denitrification and dnra rates the experimental details were exhibited in the materials and methods of supplementary material 2

fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the quality and quantity of dna were checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and by a nanodrop nd 1000 uv vis spectral photometer extracts were stored at 80 c prior to gene quantification and sequencing real time quantitative pcr qpcr was used to quantify the genetic potential of denitrification and dnra nitrous oxide reductase catalyzes the microbial reduction of nitrous oxide to n2 which is only one known sink for nitrous oxide this enzyme encoded by the nosz gene has traditionally been assigned to bacteria and archaea performing complete denitrification throback et al 2004 nitrite reductase can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to ammonium which is encoded by the nrfa gene during dnra welsh et al 2014 the gene of noszi and nrfa is commonly used as an amplicon for quantifying and sequencing denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers respectively the primers and thermocycling

reads using cutadapt v1 9 1 sequences shorter and suspected to be chimeras were discarded using usearch v10 0 240 edgar and flyvbjerg 2015 the sequences were initially grouped at 97 of the sequence similarities and representative sequences were translated and compared to the noszi and nrfa reference sequence in the genbank by blastx frameshift errors were removed subsequently the high quality sequences were aligned based on the amino acid residues and grouped based on the 85 of the nucleotide sequence similarities to form a new otu table for the subsequent analysis 2 6 statistical analyses

in lake daihai to 124 39 24 28 μmol n kg 1 h 1 in lake chao fig 2 a increased ec was negatively correlated with a decrease in denitrification rates table s3 meanwhile denitrification rate was positively correlated with wt and negatively correlated with sulfate tn avs do ph and ammonium the potential dnra rates ranged from 4 34 2 21 μmol n kg 1 h 1 in lake gaoyou to 19 07 8 27 μmol n kg 1 h

increased ec was positively correlated with an increase in nri which was the most important factor in affecting lake n retention capacity in addition nri was positively correlated with do tn and avs and negatively correlated with wt 3 3 abundance and diversity of denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers abundance diversity and community structure of denitrifiers were closely associated with the change in salinity the abundance of noszi gene ranged from 9 24 4 25 107 copies g 1 in lake dalinor to 4 11 2 21 108 copies g 1 in lake chao fig 3 a the microbial diversity index richness noszi ranged from 89 7 32 8 in lake bosten to 531 7 144 3 in lake gaoyou fig 3b their spatial distributions positively correlated with the potential denitrification rates table s3 and a decrease trend in the abundance and diversity of denitrifiers was also found associated to the increase of ec in addition the community structure of denitrifiers was significantly different among lakes ec ph tn nitrate ammonium stoc stn and avs were the main factors affecting the microbial community structure the results of canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that the first two axis explained 49 of the microbial community variation fig 3c the change in salinity affected the microbial diversity and community structure rather than the abundance of nitrite ammonifiers the abundance of nrfa gene ranged from 4 24 4 32 105 copies g 1 in lake gaoyou to 9 78 4 10 108 copies g 1 in lake nansi fig 4 a the microbial diversity index richness nrfa ranged from 171 3 24 4 in lake dalinor to 815 0 82 4 in lake nansi fig 4b the potential dnra rates were significantly correlated with the abundance of functional gene but not the microbial diversity similarly ec ph tn nitrate ammonium stoc stn and avs were also the main factors affecting the community structure of nitrite ammonifiers the results of canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that the first two axis explained 54 of the microbial community variation fig 4c 3 4 species composition of denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers the relative abundance of denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers at phylum level was exhibited in figure s2 the dominant taxa of denitrifiers were mainly restricted to one phylum proteobacteria in all lakes its relative abundance was 91 8 77 1 63 0 87 0 99 8 and 99 8 in lake chao lake gaoyou lake nansi lake bosten lake dalinor and lake daihai respectively by contrast the pathway encoding dnra was broadly distributed across sediment microbes mainly including proteobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi verrucomicrobia euryarchaeota and thermodesulfobacteria which accounted for over 80 of the relative abundance 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of eutrophic level on dissimilatory nitrate reduction in lakes of hsr eutrophic level plays a central role in controlling the magnitude of nitrate reduction in lakes of hsr dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes are usually mediated by heterotrophic microbes in freshwater sediment which use organic matter as the terminal electron donor burgin and hamilton 2007 hardison et al 2015 mccarthy et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the concentration of tp was the important factor that affecting the potential denitrification rates in lakes of hsr table 2 increased p availability will stimulate algal production and inorganic n uptake which in turn increase the releasing and sinking of organic matter to lake sediments finlay et al 2013 jiang et al 2020 these drives can increase heterotrophic metabolism and decreased dissolved oxygen in sediments which enhance denitrification rates in lakes of hsr the potential dnra rates were positively correlated with stoc table 2 many studies indicated that high organic matter loading is a prerequisite for fermentative dnra hardison et al 2015 salk et al 2017 the biomarker mediated dnra was myxococcales in lakes of hsr fig 5 they were usually found as the dominant nitrite ammonifiers in freshwater lakes pang and ji 2019 wang et al 2020 and wetland li et al 2020 and were typical fermentative microbes our previous research also revealed the relationship between dnra rates and stoc in freshwater lakes of east china plain jiang et al 2020 unexpectedly the concentration of nitrate was negatively related to denitrification and dnra rates in lakes of hsr low nitrate concentrations were observed with high algal biomass in these shallow lakes in such nitrate limiting situations the mineralization of organic matter and nitrification may be the dominant nitrate source for dissimilatory nitrate reduction which was indicated by the positive correlation between stn and the potential denitrification and dnra rates overall eutrophic level represented by tp stoc and stn controlled nitrate reduction rates in lakes of hsr 4 2 salinity shapes dissimilatory nitrate reduction in lakes of asr it is well known that salinity fundamentally shapes the structure and function of lake ecosystems brucet et al 2012 dugan et al 2017 lin et al 2017 the change in salinity can cause decreases or increases in cytoplasmic volume through imposing considerable osmotic and matric stress on the involved microbes resulting in the loss of metabolic activity neubauer et al 2019 zaghmouri et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 the potential denitrification rates were negatively related to ec in lakes of asr table 2 indicating that high salinity inhibited denitrification rates the influence of salinity on n cycling processes is usually considered as a long term adaptation effect on the microbial community such an influence has been defined as a change in microbial abundance diversity and species composition involved in n cycling franklin et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 wang et al 2018 which has a net result of metabolism rates being better optimized to a given salinity our results indicated that the community structure of nitrous oxide reducer was closely associated with the change of salinity the nitrous oxide reducers are usually more sensitive to salt stress than nitrate and nitrite reducers burgin and hamilton 2007 laverman et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 high salinity appears to decrease the abundance and diversity of nitrous oxide reducer resulting in incomplete denitrification the influence of salinity on dnra seems more complicated nitrite ammonifiers are usually described as a metabolically versatile microbes thorup et al 2017 van den berg et al 2017 wang et al 2020 increased salinity may inhibit fermentative dnra but enhance other metabolic pathways pelobacter and desulfurivibrio were the biomarker in lake bosten and lake dalinor respectively fig 5 which can grow by coupling sulfide oxidation to chemoautotrophic dnra li et al 2021 thorup et al 2017 geobacter was the biomarker in lake daihai which was usually assumed to perform respiratory dnra van den berg et al 2017 2015 the possible electron donor such as stoc and avs had negative or unsignificant effects to dnra rates table 2 it may be difficult that revealing a consistent salinity response of dnra due to the differences of metabolic pathways 4 3 high salinity led to lakes tending to high n retention overall salinity was the most important factor affecting nri in all lakes table s3 increased salinity enhanced lake n retention capacity through affecting denitrification and dnra in freshwater lakes the nri are usually ranged from zero to near 30 and our results also fall into this range table 3 to our knowledge there is only one study that estimating the n retention index in inland saline lakes the nri was about 41 in lake pétrola of spain ec 72 1 ms cm 1 valiente et al 2022 which was lower than lake daihai but obviously higher than freshwater lakes most work on saline sediments has been done in estuaries hu et al 2021 kessler et al 2018 lagoons enrich prast et al 2016 and coastal sediments giblin et al 2013 where the nri can account for a very wide range for example enrich prast et al 2016 found that the nri increased from 1 2 to 98 8 with the increase of salinity in 12 coastal lagoons inside or near the restinga de jurubatiba national park of brazil burgin and hamilton 2007 reviewed that n retention may be relatively more important in saline than freshwater sediments according to the results of coastal ecosystems our results indicated that this phenomenon can extend to inland lakes 4 4 the climate change is affecting n fate in inland lake inland lakes are long term basin wide integrators of climatic conditions wurtsbaugh et al 2017 climate change is affecting the hydrological cycle in the basin with more frequent and intense precipitation changes in evaporation potential deepening and lengthening of dry periods and altered snow accumulation and melt woolway et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the fluctuation in hydrological cycle determines the wetting and drying pattern of lakes and consequently concentration and dilution effects alter the concentration of salt ions climate wetting or drying pattern can be quantified or described through the change in relative humidity and pdsi sheffield et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 in this study lake salinity was closely related to relative humidity and pdsi in both the spatial table 1 and temporal figure s3 scales indicating salinity is a sensitive indicator in revealing hydrological cycle and climate change mccormack et al 2019 interestingly tn concentration was closely related to ec in the long term record of lake bosten with high resolution data fig 6 perhaps indicating an internal connection among n fate hydrological cycle and climate change the gradient test of salinity showed that increased salinity had the negative effects on denitrification rates but the positive effects on dnra rates figure s4 lake bosten is sulfate type lake and sulfate is a main component of salt anions high sulfide from sulfate reduction can enhance chemoautotrophic dnra burgin and hamilton 2007 franklin et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 simultaneously salt cations can displace ammonium ions adsorbed on sediments promoting the release of ammonium to water column ardon et al 2013 rysgaard et al 1999 given that increased salinity can decrease n2 production and increase ammonium release from sediment these effects could synergistically lead to n accumulation in water furthermore it should not be ignored that hydrological cycle can affect directly n concentrations through concentration and dilution effects therefore climate change between drying and wetting is expected to alter lake n fate the climate wetting and drying caused by climate warming are alternating in east asia for example lake bosten is getting warmer and wetter in recent decades because of acceleration of glacier retreat and local water cycle yang et al 2020 in the most semi arid regions of east asia however the climate is getting warmer and drier due to the weakened east asian monsoon chen et al 2019 in the past decades the transition from semi humid humid to semi arid primarily occurs in east asia which accounts for nearly 50 of the global semi arid expansion huang et al 2016 meanwhile lakes have experienced significant salinization such as in the mongolian plateau bai et al 2021 tao et al 2015 in daihai and dalinor the extremely high n accumulations have been found due to shrinkage and salinization in warmer and drier regions of east asia climate change is more likely to contribute to lake bioavailable n retention as well as n pollution the threat of climate change on these lakes is not just the quantity of water but its quality climate change can influence on lake n fates not only by changes in hydrological cycle and salinity but by the higher temperature greaver et al 2016 mosley 2015 denitrifiers usually have a marked temperature dependence kuypers et al 2018 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 denitrification rates may be temperature limited in lakes of asr due to cold climate besides high salinity in addition denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers was different in sensitivity to temperature and dnra usually have a higher temperature preference than denitrification dong et al 2011 giblin et al 2013 however the accurate estimation of the temperature response of n fate is difficult for lakes located in mid latitudes because there is a large seasonal variation in temperature therefore in order to fully understand climate change impacts on lake n fates further studies are required on the intrinsic temperature response of key n cycling processes 5 conclusions to summarize we confirmed that increased salinity inhibited denitrification rates in inland lakes the influence of salinity on denitrification was the outcome of the cumulative effects the direct salinity effect and the long term adaptation effect in contrast increased salinity had unsignificant or positive effects on dnra these results caused that n retention capacity is relatively stronger in saline than freshwater lakes in addition we found that climate change is expected to alter lake n fate through the combined effects of hydrological cycle and salinity in warmer and drier regions of east asia climate change is more likely to contribute to lake shrinkage and salinization and then lead to n pollution even in the absence of additional n loading to ecosystems this study provides insights into the influence of changes in salinity on n cycling in inland lakes and can be used to predict future response of n fate to climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest acknowledgments this study was

15296,salinization caused by climate change and nitrogen n pollution are both important environmental threats for inland lakes however evaluating their interactive effects continues to be challenging here field observation and microcosmic experiments were conducted in six lakes of east asia with the different salinity and climate characteristics to explore the response of the key n cycle processes related to n fate to the climate induced change in salinity the results indicated that increased salinity inhibited denitrification which was the outcome of two cumulative effects the long term microbial adaptation effect and the direct salinity stress whereas increased salinity had unsignificant or positive effects on dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium it had caused that n retention capacity is relatively stronger in saline than freshwater lakes inland lakes are long term basin wide integrators of climatic conditions that drying salinization and wetting desalination with climate change in semi arid regions of east asia lake shrinkage salinization and increasing temperature driven by climate warming and drying may exert a negative impact on n pollution through concentrating decreasing denitrification and increasing ammonium release from sediment the threat of climate change on these lakes is not just the quantity of water but its quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification dnra inland lake salinity semi arid region climate warming data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the human activities result in more than doubled the amount of nitrogen n circulating in the biosphere making n has changed from improvement of food production to eutrophication fowler et al 2013 galloway et al 2008 this alteration leads to reduced water quality and ecology health greaver et al 2016 stevens 2019 and is considered as one of the most serious threats to inland waters ho et al 2019 in aquatic ecosystems denitrification is considered the primary pathway for permanent n removal via reducing nitrate to dinitrogen n2 pina ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 seitzinger 1988 and provide a valuable ecosystem service by mitigating the impacts of increased n inputs finlay et al 2013 alternatively some microbes can reduce nitrate to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and retain n as a more bioavailable form burgin and hamilton 2007 giblin et al 2013 therefore understanding the nitrate reduction whether it is removed via denitrification or retained via dnra have far reaching implications for evaluating and predicting the n fate in aquatic ecosystems dong et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 nizzoli et al 2010 scott et al 2008 van den berg et al 2017 inland lakes are long term basin wide integrators of climatic conditions woolway et al 2020 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 while climate change introduces a new challenge for lake ecology health mosley 2015 tao et al 2015 trenberth et al 2014 climate change can influence on inland lakes either by the higher temperature or by changes in salinity greaver et al 2016 mosley 2015 the latter particularly in arid and semi arid lakes brucet et al 2012 lin et al 2017 lakes in arid or semi arid region are usually naturally saline as the evaporative concentration process leads to progressive salt accumulation wurtsbaugh et al 2017 yapiyev et al 2017 many of these lakes are salinizing at alarming rates as climate change guo et al 2015 tao et al 2015 yapiyev et al 2021 the change in salinity can disturb the nutrients cycle processes ardon et al 2013 herbert et al 2015 laverman et al 2007 so the problem of eutrophication will be even more complicated the inland lake is facing difficult water management challenges with the interactive effects of n pollution and salinization therefore how the key processes related to n fate in inland lakes will respond to climatically induced changes in salinity is a key question considerable studies have reported that salinity can affect n cycling processes such as denitrification and dnra through osmotic stress ionic toxicity and oxidative stress ardon et al 2013 laverman et al 2007 rysgaard et al 1999 zhao et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 herbert et al 2015 reviewed that increased salinity have been proposed to increase nitrate reduction via dnra and decrease n removal in freshwater wetlands from a global perspective but a meta analysis of zhou et al 2016 indicated that salinity have no effects to denitrification and dnra in coastal ecosystems a consensus remains elusive likely due to the differences in microbial community involved in n cycling and the composition of salts franklin et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 neubauer et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in addition these studies mainly focus on the coastal ecosystem and the change in salinity is mainly attributed to seawater intrusion we lack a direct understanding of salinity response of n cycling processes in inland lakes here we selected six lakes with the different salinity and climate characteristics in east asia to explore the influence of changes in salinity on denitrification and dnra meanwhile we combined a salinity gradient test with a long term water quality monitoring in lake bosten to reveal the relationship among climate change salinity and lake n fate we test the following hypotheses a the influencing mechanism will be differences between lakes of arid or semi arid region asr and humid or semi humid region hsr due to the difference in salinity and climate characteristics b increased salinity will lead to the decrease of denitrification and the increase of n retention capacity c the climate change can influence lake n fate via changing in salinity our study provides insights into the influence of changes in salinity on n cycling in inland lakes and can be used to predict future response of n fate to climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection lake chao lake gaoyou lake nansi lake bosten lake dalinor and lake daihai are located at east asia and the climate is mainly influenced by east asian monsoon fig 1 lake chao lake gaoyou and lake nansi are located at hsr which belong to out flowing freshwater lakes in contrast lake bosten lake dalinor and lake daihai are located at asr which belong to endorheic lakes lake bosten is located in arid area of xinjiang uygur autonomous region the location is closer to central asia and westerlies and east asian monsoon have a combined effect on the local climate dramatic changes in water level and salinity during the last 50 years have led to this freshwater lake evolved to subsaline lake lake dalinor and lake daihai are located at the semi arid regions of mongolia plateau which are hyposaline lakes in addition other climate characteristics included air temperature precipitation humidity and palmer s drought severity index pdsi have been exhibited in table 1 the data of air

which was provided by national climate data center https www ncdc noaa gov water and sediment samples were collected during august lake chao lake gaoyou and lake nansi and september lake bosten lake dalinor and lake daihai 2018 water samples mixed top middle and bottom were collected using a polymethyl methacrylate water sampler uwitec austria 50 ml water samples were filtered using whatman gf f filters immediately following collection in the field the surface sediments about 3 cm depth were collected with a 60 cm long gravity corer uwitec austria and then placed in clean airtight plastic bags during transportation back to the laboratory the filtered water and partial sediment were stored at 20 c in a vehicle mounted refrigerator for determination of dissolved nutrient concentrations and dna extraction respectively the remaining water and sediment samples were transported to the laboratory for other chemical analysis and incubation experiments meanwhile water temperature wt ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured at each sampling site in situ with a multiparameter water quality sonde ysi exo2 yellow springs instruments inc yellow spring oh usa in this study ec is used as a proxy for salinity in addition a long term water quality monitoring was conducted based on the routine cruises of the institute of lake bosten of environmental protection bureau in bayingolin mongolia autonomous prefecture of xinjiang from 1997 to 2018 water samples were collected twice a year in the spring and autumn at 13 sampling sites to determine ec and total nitrogen tn concentrations 2 2 slurry incubation experiments in six lakes potential denitrification and dnra rates were measured using slurry incubation incorporating the 15n isotope tracing technique following previously published methods jiang et al 2020 briefly the sediments were mixed with lake water at a ratio of 1 10 to make homogenized slurry the slurry was stirred continuously and purged with helium for 40 min the purged slurry was distributed into 12 ml vials labco exetainer uk and then immediately sealed subsequently preincubation was conducted in field temperature on a shaker table 200 rpm for 24 h to eliminate residual nitrate and do after preincubation a certain amount of 15n sodium nitrate solution was injected into each vial to give a final concentration of 100 μmol l 1 six of the vials were randomly selected and immediately preserved with the addition of 200 ml zncl2 as the initial samples for the measurement of 29n2 30n2 and 15n ammonium concentrations the remaining vials were incubated under the same conditions for 8 h and then sacrificed to measure the production of 29n2 30n2 and 15n ammonium in addition a salinity gradient test has been conducted in lake bosten to explore the direct effect of changes in salinity on potential denitrification and dnra rates the experimental details were exhibited in the materials and methods of supplementary material 2 3 the measurement of parameters tn total phosphorus tp ammonium nitrate and sulfate in water and total organic carbon stoc and total nitrogen stn in sediment were measured according to standard methods detailed in our previous study jiang et al 2020 acid volatile sulfides avs in sediments was determined by the following methods sulfide in sediment samples were converted into h2s by hcl extraction for 1 h subsequently released h2s was captured in a naoh solution with a continuous n2 flow the dissolved sulfide concentration in the naoh solution was measured spectrophotometrically by the methylene blue method dissolved 29n2 and 30n2 were determined by membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims analysis kana et al 1998 15n ammonium was determined by a combination of the ammonium oxidation technique and mims analysis yin et al 2014 the potential denitrification and dnra rate as well as the nitrogen retention index nri were calculated according to our previous study jiang et al 2020 more details were exhibited in the materials and methods of supplementary material 2 4 dna extraction and real time quantitative pcr genomic dna was extracted from the sediment samples using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the quality and quantity of dna were checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and by a nanodrop nd 1000 uv vis spectral photometer extracts were stored at 80 c prior to gene quantification and sequencing real time quantitative pcr qpcr was used to quantify the genetic potential of denitrification and dnra nitrous oxide reductase catalyzes the microbial reduction of nitrous oxide to n2 which is only one known sink for nitrous oxide this enzyme encoded by the nosz gene has traditionally been assigned to bacteria and archaea performing complete denitrification throback et al 2004 nitrite reductase can catalyze the reduction of nitrite to ammonium which is encoded by the nrfa gene during dnra welsh et al 2014 the gene of noszi and nrfa is commonly used as an amplicon for quantifying and sequencing denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers respectively the primers and thermocycling conditions are included in the supporting information table s1 the total qpcr reaction volume of 20 μl contained 10 μl of sybr green qpcr master mix 1 μl of forward primer 1 μl of reverse primer 7 μl of ddh2o and 1 μl of the template dna reactions were performed using an eco real time pcr system melting curves were checked for each reaction to confirm the purity of the amplified products standard curves were obtained using tenfold serial gradient dilutions of standard plasmids containing targeted genes with known copy numbers the qpcr amplification efficiencies and other calibration curve parameters are listed in table s2 gene abundance was calculated based on the constructed standard curve and then converted into copies per gram of dry sediment 2 5 high throughput sequencing the functional genes of denitrification noszi and dnra nrfa were amplified using the afore mentioned primers the purified dna products of noszi and nrfa gene were conducted for high throughput sequencing using the illumina miseq platform paired end sequencing reads were merged using flash fast length adjustment of short reads v1 2 11 magoc and salzberg 2011 adapters and primers were trimmed off all reads using cutadapt v1 9 1 sequences shorter and suspected to be chimeras were discarded using usearch v10 0 240 edgar and flyvbjerg 2015 the sequences were initially grouped at 97 of the sequence similarities and representative sequences were translated and compared to the noszi and nrfa reference sequence in the genbank by blastx frameshift errors were removed subsequently the high quality sequences were aligned based on the amino acid residues and grouped based on the 85 of the nucleotide sequence similarities to form a new otu table for the subsequent analysis 2 6 statistical analyses the statistical analyses were performed using r 3 5 3 and the rstudio 1 1 462 interface unless otherwise indicated alpha diversity indices and canonical correspondence analysis were constructed with the vegan package in r independent samples t test 2 tailed and one way anova were used to evaluate the differences between group means at the 95 confidence interval p 0 05 pearson correlation to examine the relationships between nitrate reduction rates and environmental properties the significance levels are reported as significant if p 0 05 data visualization was performed using the packages

highest values of wt ec sulfate avs ph and do were 31 2 0 1 c lake chaohu 17 808 230 μs cm 1 lake daihai 339 9 42 3 mg l 1 lake bosten 0 47 0 09 mg g 1 lake daihai 9 5 0 0 lake dalinor and 10 6 0 5 mg

among all lakes the highest stoc and stn concentrations were observed in lake bosten and the lowest values were observed in lake gaoyou increased ec was associated with an increase in tn r 0 80 p 0

in lake daihai to 124 39 24 28 μmol n kg 1 h 1 in lake chao fig 2 a increased ec was negatively correlated with a decrease in denitrification rates table s3 meanwhile denitrification rate was positively correlated with wt and negatively correlated with sulfate tn avs do ph and ammonium the potential dnra rates ranged from 4 34 2 21 μmol n kg 1 h 1 in lake gaoyou to 19 07 8 27 μmol n kg 1 h 1 in lake nansi fig 2b the potential dnra rates did not vary with ec as well as other environmental properties nitrogen retention index ranged from 6 86 in lake chao to 60 57 in lake daihai fig 2c increased ec was positively correlated with an increase in nri which was the most important factor in affecting lake n retention capacity in addition nri was positively correlated with do tn and avs and negatively correlated with wt 3 3 abundance and diversity of denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers abundance diversity and community structure of denitrifiers were closely associated with the change in salinity the abundance of noszi gene ranged from 9 24 4 25 107 copies g 1 in lake dalinor to 4 11 2 21 108 copies g 1 in lake chao fig 3 a the microbial diversity index richness noszi ranged from 89 7 32 8 in lake bosten to 531 7 144 3 in lake gaoyou fig 3b their spatial distributions positively correlated with the potential denitrification rates table s3 and a decrease trend in the abundance and diversity of denitrifiers was also found associated to the increase of ec in addition the community structure of denitrifiers was significantly different among lakes ec ph tn nitrate ammonium stoc stn and avs were the main factors affecting the microbial community structure the results of canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that the first two axis explained 49 of the microbial community variation fig 3c the change in salinity affected the microbial diversity and community structure rather than the abundance of nitrite ammonifiers the abundance of nrfa gene ranged from 4 24 4 32 105 copies g 1 in lake gaoyou to 9 78 4 10 108 copies g 1 in lake nansi fig 4 a the microbial diversity index richness nrfa ranged from 171 3 24 4 in lake dalinor to 815 0 82 4 in lake nansi fig 4b the potential dnra rates were significantly correlated with the abundance of functional gene but not the microbial diversity similarly ec ph tn nitrate ammonium stoc stn and avs were also the main factors affecting the community structure of nitrite ammonifiers the results of canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that the first two axis explained 54 of the microbial community variation fig 4c 3 4 species composition of denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers the relative abundance of denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers at phylum level was exhibited in figure s2 the dominant taxa of denitrifiers were mainly restricted to one phylum proteobacteria in all lakes its relative abundance was 91 8 77 1 63 0 87 0 99 8 and 99 8 in lake chao lake gaoyou lake nansi lake bosten lake dalinor and lake daihai respectively by contrast the pathway encoding dnra was broadly distributed across sediment microbes mainly including proteobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi verrucomicrobia euryarchaeota and thermodesulfobacteria which accounted for over 80 of the relative abundance 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of eutrophic level on dissimilatory nitrate reduction in lakes of hsr eutrophic level plays a central role in controlling the magnitude of nitrate reduction in lakes of hsr dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes are usually mediated by heterotrophic microbes in freshwater sediment which use organic matter as the terminal electron donor burgin and hamilton 2007 hardison et al 2015 mccarthy et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the concentration of tp was the important factor that affecting the potential denitrification rates in lakes of hsr table 2 increased p availability will stimulate algal production and inorganic n uptake which in turn increase the releasing and sinking of organic matter to lake sediments finlay et al 2013 jiang et al 2020 these drives can increase heterotrophic metabolism and decreased dissolved oxygen in sediments which enhance denitrification rates in lakes of hsr the potential dnra rates were positively correlated with stoc table 2 many studies indicated that high organic matter loading is a prerequisite for fermentative dnra hardison et al 2015 salk et al 2017 the biomarker mediated dnra was myxococcales in lakes of hsr fig 5 they were usually found as the dominant nitrite ammonifiers in freshwater lakes pang and ji 2019 wang et al 2020 and wetland li et al 2020 and were typical fermentative microbes our previous research also revealed the relationship between dnra rates and stoc in freshwater lakes of east china plain jiang et al 2020 unexpectedly the concentration of nitrate was negatively related to denitrification and dnra rates in lakes of hsr low nitrate concentrations were observed with high algal biomass in these shallow lakes in such nitrate limiting situations the mineralization of organic matter and nitrification may be the dominant nitrate source for dissimilatory nitrate reduction which was indicated by the positive correlation between stn and the potential denitrification and dnra rates overall eutrophic level represented by tp stoc and stn controlled nitrate reduction rates in lakes of hsr 4 2 salinity shapes dissimilatory nitrate reduction in lakes of asr it is well known that salinity fundamentally shapes the structure and function of lake ecosystems brucet et al 2012 dugan et al 2017 lin et al 2017 the change in salinity can cause decreases or increases in cytoplasmic volume through imposing considerable osmotic and matric stress on the involved microbes resulting in the loss of metabolic activity neubauer et al 2019 zaghmouri et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 the potential denitrification rates were negatively related to ec in lakes of asr table 2 indicating that high salinity inhibited denitrification rates the influence of salinity on n cycling processes is usually considered as a long term adaptation effect on the microbial community such an influence has been defined as a change in microbial abundance diversity and species composition involved in n cycling franklin et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 wang et al 2018 which has a net result of metabolism rates being better optimized to a given salinity our results indicated that the community structure of nitrous oxide reducer was closely associated with the change of salinity the nitrous oxide reducers are usually more sensitive to salt stress than nitrate and nitrite reducers burgin and hamilton 2007 laverman et al 2007 zhou et al 2016 high salinity appears to decrease the abundance and diversity of nitrous oxide reducer resulting in incomplete denitrification the influence of salinity on dnra seems more complicated nitrite ammonifiers are usually described as a metabolically versatile microbes thorup et al 2017 van den berg et al 2017 wang et al 2020 increased salinity may inhibit fermentative dnra but enhance other metabolic pathways pelobacter and desulfurivibrio were the biomarker in lake bosten and lake dalinor respectively fig 5 which can grow by coupling sulfide oxidation to chemoautotrophic dnra li et al 2021 thorup et al 2017 geobacter was the biomarker in lake daihai which was usually assumed to perform respiratory dnra van den berg et al 2017 2015 the possible electron donor such as stoc and avs had negative or unsignificant effects to dnra rates table 2 it may be difficult that revealing a consistent salinity response of dnra due to the differences of metabolic pathways 4 3 high salinity led to lakes tending to high n retention overall salinity was the most important factor affecting nri in all lakes table s3 increased salinity enhanced lake n retention capacity through affecting denitrification and dnra in freshwater lakes the nri are usually ranged from zero to near 30 and our results also fall into this range table 3 to our knowledge there is only one study that estimating the n retention index in inland saline lakes the nri was about 41 in lake pétrola of spain ec 72 1 ms cm 1 valiente et al 2022 which was lower than lake daihai but obviously higher than freshwater lakes most work on saline sediments has been done in estuaries hu et al 2021 kessler et al 2018 lagoons enrich prast et al 2016 and coastal sediments giblin et al 2013 where the nri can account for a very wide range for example enrich prast et al 2016 found that the nri increased from 1 2 to 98 8 with the increase of salinity in 12 coastal lagoons inside or near the restinga de jurubatiba national park of brazil burgin and hamilton 2007 reviewed that n retention may be relatively more important in saline than freshwater sediments according to the results of coastal ecosystems our results indicated that this phenomenon can extend to inland lakes 4 4 the climate change is affecting n fate in inland lake inland lakes are long term basin wide integrators of climatic conditions wurtsbaugh et al 2017 climate change is affecting the hydrological cycle in the basin with more frequent and intense precipitation changes in evaporation potential deepening and lengthening of dry periods and altered snow accumulation and melt woolway et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the fluctuation in hydrological cycle determines the wetting and drying pattern of lakes and consequently concentration and dilution effects alter the concentration of salt ions climate wetting or drying pattern can be quantified or described through the change in relative humidity and pdsi sheffield et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 in this study lake salinity was closely related to relative humidity and pdsi in both the spatial table 1 and temporal figure s3 scales indicating salinity is a sensitive indicator in revealing hydrological cycle and climate change mccormack et al 2019 interestingly tn concentration was closely related to ec in the long term record of lake bosten with high resolution data fig 6 perhaps indicating an internal connection among n fate hydrological cycle and climate change the gradient test of salinity showed that increased salinity had the negative effects on denitrification rates but the positive effects on dnra rates figure s4 lake bosten is sulfate type lake and sulfate is a main component of salt anions high sulfide from sulfate reduction can enhance chemoautotrophic dnra burgin and hamilton 2007 franklin et al 2017 murphy et al 2020 simultaneously salt cations can displace ammonium ions adsorbed on sediments promoting the release of ammonium to water column ardon et al 2013 rysgaard et al 1999 given that increased salinity can decrease n2 production and increase ammonium release from sediment these effects could synergistically lead to n accumulation in water furthermore it should not be ignored that hydrological cycle can affect directly n concentrations through concentration and dilution effects therefore climate change between drying and wetting is expected to alter lake n fate the climate wetting and drying caused by climate warming are alternating in east asia for example lake bosten is getting warmer and wetter in recent decades because of acceleration of glacier retreat and local water cycle yang et al 2020 in the most semi arid regions of east asia however the climate is getting warmer and drier due to the weakened east asian monsoon chen et al 2019 in the past decades the transition from semi humid humid to semi arid primarily occurs in east asia which accounts for nearly 50 of the global semi arid expansion huang et al 2016 meanwhile lakes have experienced significant salinization such as in the mongolian plateau bai et al 2021 tao et al 2015 in daihai and dalinor the extremely high n accumulations have been found due to shrinkage and salinization in warmer and drier regions of east asia climate change is more likely to contribute to lake bioavailable n retention as well as n pollution the threat of climate change on these lakes is not just the quantity of water but its quality climate change can influence on lake n fates not only by changes in hydrological cycle and salinity but by the higher temperature greaver et al 2016 mosley 2015 denitrifiers usually have a marked temperature dependence kuypers et al 2018 palacin lizarbe et al 2018 denitrification rates may be temperature limited in lakes of asr due to cold climate besides high salinity in addition denitrifiers and nitrite ammonifiers was different in sensitivity to temperature and dnra usually have a higher temperature preference than denitrification dong et al 2011 giblin et al 2013 however the accurate estimation of the temperature response of n fate is difficult for lakes located in mid latitudes because there is a large seasonal variation in temperature therefore in order to fully understand climate change impacts on lake n fates further studies are required on the intrinsic temperature response of key n cycling processes 5 conclusions to summarize we confirmed that increased salinity inhibited denitrification rates in inland lakes the influence of salinity on denitrification was the outcome of the cumulative effects the direct salinity effect and the long term adaptation effect in contrast increased salinity had unsignificant or positive effects on dnra these results caused that n retention capacity is relatively stronger in saline than freshwater lakes in addition we found that climate change is expected to alter lake n fate through the combined effects of hydrological cycle and salinity in warmer and drier regions of east asia climate change is more likely to contribute to lake shrinkage and salinization and then lead to n pollution even in the absence of additional n loading to ecosystems this study provides insights into the influence of changes in salinity on n cycling in inland lakes and can be used to predict future response of n fate to climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest acknowledgments this study was

15297,vacuum ultraviolet ultraviolet vuv uv oxidation using a low pressure mercury lamp emitting dual wavelengths 185 nm vuv and 254 nm uv significantly varies in performance along the light path l p which has not been fully characterized therefore vuv uv oxidation in solution was investigated at various l p in terms of the degradation kinetics and mineralization pathway of representative aldehydes with various alkyl chain lengths oxidative degradation of parent aldehydes with shorter alkyl chains was less efficient specifically the pseudo zero order rate constant k obs of formaldehyde was only 51 of that of propionaldehyde k obs 0 078 μm s 1 in contrast the mineralization of aldehydes with longer alkyl chains was less efficient because these aldehydes underwent mineralization into more refractory carboxylic byproducts e g oxalic acid vuv was mainly absorbed by superficial water l p 0 55 cm which resulted in highly heterogeneous oxidation in homogeneous water thus k obs of acetaldehyde dramatically decreased from 0 13 to 0 033 μm s 1 as the total l p of solution increased from 1 0 to 3 0 cm on the basis of mineralization pathways proposed above an iterative kinetic model was developed to characterize the degradation of parent aldehydes and the formation of carboxylic acids along l p this model predicted the vuv uv oxidaton for the first time by considering the fast diffusion of pollutants by limited diffusion of transient radical species thus it realized the prediction of oh concentration at specific water solution and byproduct evolution within specific water solution in turbulent flow regime wherein oh was predominantly formed in superficial water layers wherein oh in water layers of l p 0 16 cm and 0 81 cm contributed to 50 and 90 of the total oxidation performance respectively this result would help to improve the vuv uv reactor design in terms of optimizing the thickness of water layer and turbulence of water flow graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vacuum uv aldehyde kinetics mineralization variation along light path data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aldehydes in drinking water and potable recycled water are odorous and potentially carcinogenic which raised considerable attention joo and mitch 2007 nawrocki et al 2003 however aldehydes are highly resistant to physical separation and chemical oxidation for example aldehydes can penetrate reverses osmosis ro membranes accounting for 19 38 of the total organic carbon in the ro permeate marron et al 2020 yu et al 2021 additionally only 27 45 of aldehydes are eliminated during uv h2o2 treatment even at high fluences of 800 2000 mj cm2 marron et al 2020 moreover aldehydes may be formed during oxidation treatments and have been observed in treated water in the concentration range of 40 6 63 5 μg l lin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 the chemical structure of aldehydes such as the length of alkyl chains and number of carbonyl groups affects the oxidation reactions aloisio and francisco 2000 anglada et al 1996 hidalgo et al 2017 the c c bond dissociation energy decreases as the length of aldehyde alkyl chains increase da silva and bozzelli 2006 as a result the rates of reactions between aldehydes and oh increase as the alkyl carbon number increases pelucchi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 aldehydes with two carbonyl groups are usually less reactive with oh than those with one carbonyl group and thus the rates of reactions between monoaldehydes and oh are more than 1 4 times those between counterpart dialdehydes i e acetaldehyde and glyoxal and oh liggio et al 2005 semmes et al 1985 however the degradation and mineralization pathways of aldehydes with various structures have not been comprehensively elucidated in terms of the loss of parent aldehydes and formation of representative products recently low pressure mercury lamps simultaneously emitting at wavelengths in the vacuum ultraviolet vuv 185 nm and ultraviolet uv 254 nm regions have become commercially available and have been used in chemical free oxidation treatments for aquatic purification organic mineralization and dehalogenation bentel et al 2020 heit and m braun 1997 kong et al 2021 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 high purity synthetic quartz is used as lamp tubes to ensure penetration of 185 nm vuv radiation zoschke et al 2014 as primary reactions vuv homolyzes h2o to form oh with a quantum yield of 0 375 reaction s1 and s2 in table s1 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 which directly oxidizes organic contaminants and self recombines to form h2o2 reaction s5 s16 in table s1 as secondary reactions h2o2 is photolyzed in the presence of vuv and uv to generate secondary oh gao et al 2020 long et al 2019 therefore vuv uv oxidation including vuv h2o vuv h2o2 and uv h2o2 is a powerful method that does not require the addition of chemical agents takeuchi and tanaka 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 owing to the above advantages vuv uv oxidation has been widely used to mineralize organic compounds during the production of ultrapure water choi and chung 2019a choi and chung 2019b vuv uv oxidation in homogeneous water solutions is highly heterogeneous along the light path l p heit and m braun 1997 because vuv rapidly decays by approximately 90 in superficial water l p 0 55 cm mora and mohseni 2018 specifically the absorption coefficient of water at 185 nm is 1 8 cm 1 zoschke et al 2014 therefore oxidation in water layers closest to the lamp l p 0 55 cm are predominantly driven by primary oxidation reactions i e vuv h2o which differs from oxidation in the remaining water layers l p 0 55 cm wherein oh from uv h2o2 is more important heit and m braun 1997 in previous study kinetic models have been developed in laminar flow regime for continuous flow reactors which illustrated the non linear response between vuv fluence rate and oh concentration bagheri and mohseni 2014 crapulli et al 2014 however previous models still need some improvements in terms of the pollutant diffusion in turbulent flow formation and degradation of oxidation byproducts in addition no reports have thus far presented quantitative information on the contribution of oh oxidization to the degradation of organic pollutants in various water layers this study aimed to employ vuv uv oxidation to eliminate aldehydes in the ro permeate for potable reuse or ultrapure water production first vuv uv oxidation of aldehydes with various alkyl carbon numbers in solutions of various water depths i e total l p was investigated second the mineralization pathways were evaluated via the oxidation byproducts under various vuv uv fluences third considering the radical chain reactions rapid vuv decay and limited transfer of radical species along l p an iterative model was developed in a fully mixed solution to quantify the heterogeneous distribution of radicals along l p with considering the pollutant transfer among water layers the oh utilization can be increased and oxidation performance could be improved with considering the formation and degradation of oxidation byproducts the steady state oh concentration could be more precisely predicted and mineralization of target organic pollutants could be clarified in vuv uv system 2 materials and experiments 2 1 chemical reagents four kinds of

were prepared using ultrapure water produced by the millipore purifier milli q merck germany 2 2 experimental equipment and operational procedure the vuv uv oxidation system produced a collimated beam in a sealed chamber containing n2 as the purging gas to avoid the absorption of vuv 185 nm by oxygen in air fig s1 two low pressure ultraviolet lpuv lamps with suprasil quartz as the lamp walls 48 w gzw48d15y z436 comwin light electricity co ltd china were used to emit light at two wavelengths 185nm and 254nm simultaneously before the experiments the lpuv lamps were turned on with n2 gas purging for 1 h to stabilize the lamp and to replace the air in the collimated beam chamber vuv and uv irradiance on the solution were 0 75 and 4 36 mw cm2 respectively the irradiation experiments were conducted in cylindrical beakers of 8 cm in diameter the solution volumes of 50 75 100 125 and 150 ml corresponded to water depths total l p of 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 cm respectively solutions containing an individual aldehyde were placed under the collimated beam for vuv uv irradiation and were continuously stirred during irradiation samples were withdrawn after specific irradiation times and the concentrations of target aldehydes and oxidation products in the samples were determined all experiments were conducted in duplicates 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of aldehydes were determined using a gas chromatography gc machine equipped with an electron capture detector ecd agilent 7890b santa clara ca usa pretreatment of derivatives and liquid liquid extraction are detailed in the supplementary information text s1 the concentrations of carboxylic acids and h2o2 in water solutions were determined using ion chromatography dionex aquion thermo scientific usa the separation column for carboxylic acids was ionpac as18 4 250 mm and the mobile phases were 5 mm koh and 20 mm koh the separation column for h2o2 was as15 column 4 250 mm and koh was continuously leached at a concentration of 25 mm for 15 min song et al 2017 total organic carbon toc was measured using a m9e portable toc analyzer ge analytical instruments inc u s a with the online model 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of various aldehydes compared to the negligible photolysis by uv vuv uv oxidation was more effective in the degradation of aldehydes fig 1 a which was attributed to oh formed during the homolysis of h2o by vuv the vuv uv irradiation times required to eliminate 90 of formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxal and propionaldehyde were 5 8 3 2 3 1 and 1 5 min vuv uv fluence of 1779 981 951 460 mj cm2 respectively to assess oxidation quantitatively the degradation of aldehydes i e the degradation rate of aldehydes as a function of time was fit to the pseudo zero order kinetics because aldehyde was calculated as the main oh consumer at initial vuv uv irradiation time text s2 the zero order rate constants k obs were 0 040 0 048 0 057 and 0 078 μm s 1 for formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxal and propionaldehyde respectively in general the k obs values increased as the alkyl carbon number increased for monoaldehydes the proportional relationship between k obs and k oh ah further verified the dominant contribution of oh fig 1b notably k obs of glyoxal with two carbonyl groups deviated from the above linear relationship the oh usually primarily attacks the cho of aldehydes butkovskaya and setser 2000 rosado reyes and francisco 2007 even the k obs of glyoxal was normalized to the number of cho in glyoxal glyoxal still does not fit the linear correlation previous studies reported the ineligible contribution of reductive species to the degradation of organic pollutants herein uv sulfite was employed to investigate the degradation of aldehydes by reductive species as shown in fig s8 uv sulfite can moderately eliminate glyoxal but hardly eliminate acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde the vuv absorbance of glyoxal was estimated to be 5 48 m 1cm 1 following the method proposed by pan et al fig s9 malik and joens 2000 pan et al 2022 which is much lower than that of water thus the photolysis by uv and vuv of glyoxal is presumed to be low thus the deviation of k obs glyoxal to the linear relation between k obs and k oh ah can be explained by the high reactive of glyoxal to reductive species such as the h and e the quantitative information of the reactivities need further investigations this result indicates that vuv uv oxidation is beneficial for the removal of aldehydes with polycarbonyl groups 3 2 mineralization pathways of various aldehydes the proportion of each organic carbon component e g parent aldehyde and oxidation byproducts was evaluated during vuv uv oxidation as shown in fig 2 carboxylic acids were the dominant oxidation byproducts which was confirmed with the fit of carboxylic carbons to the experimentally measured dissolved organic carbons in the vuv uv oxidation of acetaldehyde in contrast to k obs the mineralization of aldehydes became inefficient as the alkyl carbon number increased suggesting that aldehydes with longer alkyl groups were converted into more recalcitrant polybasic carboxylic acid such as oxalic acid stefan et al 1996 the evolution of oxidation byproducts indicated that aldehydes were primarily converted into their counterpart mono carboxylic acid via the hydroxylation of cho by oh and the subsequent oxidation of alkyl groups into binary carboxylic acid fig 3 formaldehyde was primarily converted into formic acid during which h2c oh 2 was the hydration intermediate and the formyl radical was the h abstraction intermediate mcelroy and waygood 1991 schaefer et al 2020 the formyl radical rapidly reacted with o2 and h2o2 to form formic acid which was formed within a short irradiation time but minimally accumulated as the irradiation time increased a few acetic acids and oxalic acids possibly formed via dimerization acetaldehyde was dominantly transformed into acetic acid within the initial 6 min vuv uv fluence of 1840 mj cm2 during which ch3co was the transient intermediate from h abstraction by oh butkovskaya and setser 2000 acetic acid was further converted into the ch2c o oh intermediate to form oxalic acid kamath et al 2018 rosado reyes and francisco 2006 subsequently oxalic acid was directly mineralized as confirmed by the low accumulation of formic acid table s1 reaction s34 stefan et al 1996 propionaldehyde likely underwent de carbonylation to form acetic acid or carboxylation to form propionic acid with ch3ch2c o as the main transient intermediate from the initial h abstraction le crane et al 2005 rosado reyes and francisco 2007 notably the total known carboxylic carbon decreased rapidly within 2 min of vuv uv irradiation vuv uv fluence of 613 mj cm2 and carboxylic carbons with 3 c were degraded within 4 min vuv uv fluence of 1226 mj cm2 thus propionaldehyde and propionic acid were directly mineralized into acetic acid and oxalic acid via dealkylation or converted into other byproducts such as glyoxylic acid and malonaldehyde which were not targeted in this study and require further investigation the quantitative information in this research identified both the main oxidation products and major pathway for the degradation of aldehydes by vuv uv oxidation this provides basic information between irradiation intensity and degradation rate or mineralization rate of mono aldehydes furthermore the information of the main oxidation products and pathway help to establish the kinetic model and then predict the oxidation performance at the water later with different l p values 3 3 variation of vuv uv oxidation performance with total l p 3 3 1 influence of total l p on the degradation rate the performance of vuv uv oxidation in the degradation of aldehydes decreased as the total l p i e water depth of the solution increased as total l p increased from 1 0 to 3 0 cm k obs decreased from 0 13 to 0 033 μm s 1 fig 4 in addition to achieve 90 elimination of acetaldehyde the vuv uv irradiation time increased from 1 0 to 4 3 min i e the vuv uv fluence increased from 302 to 1303 mj cm2 with increasing l p from 1 0 to 3 0 cm although vuv contributed to oxidative degradation it was mostly absorbed by superficial water layers i e l p 0 55 cm the degradation of acetaldehyde in the bulk solution can be analyzed by dividing total l p into multiple water layers and integrating the concentrations of aldehydes and oh across these water layers fig s2 and eq 1 oh is formed from vuv driven oxidation e g vuv h2o and vuv h2o2 and uv driven oxidation e g uv h2o2 as shown in eqs 2 5 1 d ah d t 0 l k oh ah ah oh ss l 1 l d l 2 r f l r vuv h 2 o l r vuv h 2 o 2 l r uv h 2 o 2 l 3 r vuv h 2 o

where ah is the concentration of acetaldehyde m oh ss l is the transient steady state concentration of oh in a specific water layer m l is the total l p of the solution i e water depth cm r f l r vuv h2o l r vuv h2o2 l and r uv h2o2 l are respectively the oh formation rates of the total pathway vuv h2o pathway vuv h2o2 pathway and uv h2o2 pathway in a specific water layer m s e p vuv 0 and e p uv

respectively the absorbance of the solution at uv and vuv cm 1 assuming that the degradation of acetaldehyde follows pseudo zero order kinetics in each water layer then the degradation kinetics can be simplified as expressed in eqs 6 8 thus k obs of acetaldehyde in the bulk solution should be inversely proportional to the total l p i e water depth inset of fig 4 which further verifies that vuv oxidation e g vuv h2o and vuv h2o2 contributes to the fast decrease in k obs as l p increases 6 m e p vuv 0 φ h 2 o f h 2 o vuv φ h 2 o 2 f h 2 o 2 vuv 7 n e p uv 0 φ h 2 o 2 f h 2 o 2 uv 8 d ah d t k obs 1 l 0 l r f l d l 1 l 0 l m 1 10 b l n 1 10 a l d l m n 2 303 a m b n a 1 l similarly the formation rate of h2o2 during the initial vuv uv irradiation time is inversely proportional to the total l p where the formation rate decreased from 0 087 to 0 017 μm s 1 as the l p increased from 1 0 to 3 0 cm fig s5 b from this analysis h2o2 is predominantly generated in superficial water layers l p 0 55 cm and then diffuses into deeper water layers for the degradation of organic pollutants 3 3 2 modeling of the oxidation kinetics in addition to determining the decrease of k obs along l p vuv uv oxidation performance was further characterized in terms of the formation of oxidation byproducts to quantitatively examine oxidation as a function of l p and irradiation time an iterative kinetic model was developed on the basis of the mineralization pathways of acetaldehyde proposed in fig 3 and the chain oxidation reactions between radical species and organic matter as shown in table s1 and s2 and fig 3 the model was developed with the vuv uv system under a fully mixed solution in this model the whole oxidation system was divided into multiple water layers along l p because the vuv irradiance decayed rapidly in the water layers the radical concentrations e g oh o2 and ho2 differed a lot between water layers because of the short lifetime and limited diffusion distance this directly leads to the lower degradation rate of organic pollutant at the water layer with deeper l p in the fully mixed solution the concentration of organic pollutants should be uniform for all water layers thus after each irradiation time interval dt the concentrations of the parent aldehyde and oxidation byproducts in the bulk solution were calculated using eq 11 and then assigned to each water layer fig s2 c the formation rate of radical species i e oh r f l was calculated from the vuv uv irradiance in each water layer eqs 2 5 which decreased along l p followed the beer lambert law eqs 9 and 10 fig s2 the consumption of radical species was calculated from the second order rate constant multiplying the concentration of reactants as shown in table s1 similarly the degradation rate of the parent aldehydes and the formation and degradation of oxidation byproducts can be expressed in table s1 the change of the concentration of radical species parent aldehydes or oxidation byproducts can be expressed in table s2 using the ode 15s function in matlab to solve all differential equations in table s2 the concentration of radicals and byproducts in each water layer within a specific irradiation time interval dt is solvable the modeling results converged with setting the water layer increasing from 103 to 104 fig s6 thus the optimized number of water layers was 103 to assess the oxidation performance in the water layers with various light path l p 9 e p vuv l e p vuv 0 1 10 b l 10 e p uv l e p uv 0 1 10 a l 11 ah t d t ah t 0 l k oh ah ah t oh ss l δ l l d l where e p vuv l and e p uv l are respectively the incident irradiance of vuv and uv at the light path of l ein cm2 s and k oh ah is the second order rate constant of oh reacting with acetaldehyde m 1s 1 considering the heterogeneous distribution of radical species and homogeneous distribution of organic pollutants in a fully mixed solution the oxidation would be more efficient in a turbulent flow system wherein organic pollutants are more possibly exposed to oh with the calculated contribution to pollutant elimination the variation of oxidation performance can be better clarified than the spatial distribution of oh concentration the iterative kinetic model was able to characterize the degradation of acetaldehyde and formation of oxidation byproducts in solutions with various total l p values fig 5 a c which will help to understand the degradation kinetics and mineralization of organic pollutants the above results suggested that in a turbulent flow regime the fast diffusion of pollutants aldehyde and its byproducts and limited diffution of transient radicals should be considered for modelling the vuv uv reactors with fast flow rate high reynolds number especially the fast diffusion of pollutants in a turbulent flow regime may favor a better energy cost for vuv uv reactors matsushita et al 2019 interestingly the main intermediates of acetic acid were accumulated to similar maximum concentrations but formed with different rates in solutions of various l p values 3 4 vuv uv oxidation performance along l p to quantify the spatial and temporal variation of the oxidation performance the oh concentration was simulated fig 6 the concentration of oh increased rapidly within the initial 3 min of irradiation specifically the oh concentration was 2 45 10 10 2 19 10 11 and 1 07 10 12 m at the l p values of 0 003 cm superficial water layer 0 55 cm and 3 0 cm deep water layer respectively thereafter as the irradiation time continuously increased to 30 min the oh concentration in the water layers slightly increased notably the oh concentration in water layer of l p 0 55 converged to similar levels 0 4 2 8 10 11 m oh is generated from the vuv h2o and uv h2o2 processes and then consumed during organic oxidation and radical self recombination changes in the oh concentration as the irradiation time increases can be attributed to the dynamic equilibrium during the initial stage of irradiation oh and secondary oxidants i e h2o2 as show in fig s5 are accumulated because generation is more rapid than consumption with prolonged irradiation the concentrations of target organic matter i e acetaldehyde and reactive species reach steady states as a result the oh concentration reaches a plateau after prolonged irradiation the oh concentration significantly decreased along l p during the initial stage of irradiation 0 0 2 min the oh dramatically decreased by 3 orders of magnitude along l p from 1 4 10 11 m in the superficial water layer l p 0 003 cm to 1 2 10 14 m in the deep water layer l p 3 0 cm to illustrate the spatial distribution of oxidation performance the accumulated contribution of oh to oxidation was calculated fig 6 b in turbulence flow pollutants in the water layers far from the lamp could diffuse to the superficial water layers and then realized the improvement on oh utilization and pollutants elimination the degradation of aldehydes in bulk solution was analyzed in terms of aldehyde oxidation via oh exposure oh l dt in all water layers l thus the accumulated contribution of oh oxidation along l p was quantified by σ l oh l dt after the irradiation time of 5 min at which acetaldehyde was almost eliminated oh oxidation in the superficial water layers of l p 0 16 cm accounted for 50 of the total oxidation performance while oh oxidation in the water layers of l p 0 81 cm accounted for 90 of the total oxidation performance in addition the model indicated that the accumulated contribution along l p was minorly influenced by irradiation time because the relative increment of oh was similar between all water layers this model considered the mass transfer of organic pollutants which providing an appropriate method to optimize the design parameters of photoreactor under fully mixed condition e g the reactor diameter and spatial layout of the lamps decay of vuv along l p vuvl vuv0 was the dominant reason for changes in the oh concentration oh l oh 0 which was confirmed by the generally proportional decrease in oh l oh 0 to vuvl vuv0 fig s7 notably at the initial stage of irradiation 0 2 min oh l oh 0 decreased faster than vuvl vuv0 because the consumption of oh increased during this stage including self recombination to generate h2o2 and consumption by parent aldehyde and oxidation byproducts as the irradiation time increased toward the steady state 5 30 min h2o2 was accumulated and reached a stable high concentration 4 conclusions vuv uv oxidation was demonstrated as an efficient chemical free process for the degradation of recalcitrant aldehydes the performance of oxidation was found to depend on the structure of the parent aldehyde and varied along the l p degradation was faster for parent aldehydes with longer alky chains but the mineralization rate was lower because of the formation of more recalcitrant intermediates i e binary carboxylic acids the degradation rate constant k obs of formaldehyde was only 51 of that of propionaldehyde after 4 min of vuv uv oxidation the mineralization rates of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were approximately 50 and 8 respectively the carbonyl group was the primary oxidation site where primary oxidation of counterpart monocarboxylic acids and binary carboxylic acids occurred the performance of vuv uv oxidation decreased as the total l p increased to eliminate 90 of acetaldehydes the vuv uv fluence was increased from 302 to 1303 mj cm2 with increasing the total l p from 1 0 to 3 0 cm an iterative kinetic model was developed for the first time on the basis of radical chain reactions and mass transfer in multiple water layers the model was able to simulate heterogeneous oxidation in homogeneous water and provided information on the degradation of aldehydes by oh exposure and formation of carboxylic acid in turbulent flow regime pollutant and its byproducts diffuse faster among water layers while transient oh diffuse limitedly with the new iterative model of this study the prediction of vuv uv oxidation performance in turbulent flow regime could be improved in further study oh formed in superficial water layers with l p lower than 0 16 and 0 81 cm contributed to 50 and 90 of the total oxidation performance respectively in engineering this result would help to improve the vuvuv reactor design in terms of optimizing the thickness of water

15297,vacuum ultraviolet ultraviolet vuv uv oxidation using a low pressure mercury lamp emitting dual wavelengths 185 nm vuv and 254 nm uv significantly varies in performance along the light path l p which has not been fully characterized therefore vuv uv oxidation in solution was investigated at various l p in terms of the degradation kinetics and mineralization pathway of representative aldehydes with various alkyl chain lengths oxidative degradation of parent aldehydes with shorter alkyl chains was less efficient specifically the pseudo zero order rate constant k obs of formaldehyde was only 51 of that of propionaldehyde k obs 0 078 μm s 1 in contrast the mineralization of aldehydes with longer alkyl chains was less efficient because these aldehydes underwent mineralization into more refractory carboxylic byproducts e g oxalic acid vuv was mainly absorbed by superficial water l p 0 55 cm which resulted in highly heterogeneous oxidation in homogeneous water thus k obs of acetaldehyde dramatically decreased from 0 13 to 0 033 μm s 1 as the total l p of solution increased from 1 0 to 3 0 cm on the basis of mineralization pathways proposed above an iterative kinetic model was developed to characterize the degradation of parent aldehydes and the formation of carboxylic acids along l p this model predicted the vuv uv oxidaton for the first time by considering the fast diffusion of pollutants by limited diffusion of transient radical species thus it realized the prediction of oh concentration at specific water solution and byproduct evolution within specific water solution in turbulent flow regime wherein oh was predominantly formed in superficial water layers wherein oh in water layers of l p 0 16 cm and 0 81 cm contributed to 50 and 90 of the total oxidation performance respectively this result would help to improve the vuv uv reactor design in terms of optimizing the thickness of water layer and turbulence of water flow graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vacuum uv aldehyde kinetics mineralization variation along light path data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aldehydes in drinking water and potable recycled water are odorous and potentially carcinogenic which raised considerable attention joo and mitch 2007 nawrocki et al 2003 however aldehydes are highly resistant to physical separation and chemical oxidation for example aldehydes can penetrate reverses osmosis ro membranes accounting for 19 38 of the total organic carbon in the ro permeate marron et al 2020 yu et al 2021 additionally only 27 45 of aldehydes are eliminated during uv h2o2 treatment even at high fluences of 800 2000 mj cm2 marron et al 2020 moreover aldehydes may be formed during oxidation treatments and have been observed in treated water in the concentration range of 40 6 63 5 μg l lin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 the chemical structure of aldehydes such as the length of alkyl chains and number of carbonyl groups affects the oxidation reactions aloisio and francisco 2000 anglada et al 1996 hidalgo et al 2017 the c c bond dissociation energy decreases as the length of aldehyde alkyl chains increase da silva and bozzelli 2006 as a result the rates of reactions between aldehydes and oh increase as the alkyl carbon number increases pelucchi et al 2015 wang et al 2015 aldehydes with two carbonyl groups are usually less reactive with oh than those with one carbonyl group and thus the rates of reactions between monoaldehydes and oh are more than 1 4 times those between counterpart dialdehydes i e acetaldehyde and glyoxal and oh liggio et al 2005 semmes et al 1985 however the degradation and mineralization pathways of aldehydes with various structures have not been comprehensively elucidated in terms of the loss of parent aldehydes and formation of representative products recently low pressure mercury lamps simultaneously emitting at wavelengths in the vacuum ultraviolet vuv 185 nm and ultraviolet uv 254 nm regions have become commercially available and have been used in chemical free oxidation treatments for aquatic purification organic mineralization and dehalogenation bentel et al 2020 heit and m braun 1997 kong et al 2021 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 high purity synthetic quartz is used as lamp tubes to ensure penetration of 185 nm vuv radiation zoschke et al 2014 as primary reactions vuv homolyzes h2o to form oh with a quantum yield of 0 375 reaction s1 and s2 in table s1 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 which directly oxidizes organic contaminants and self recombines to form h2o2 reaction s5 s16 in table s1 as secondary reactions h2o2 is photolyzed in the presence of vuv and uv to generate secondary oh gao et al 2020 long et al 2019 therefore vuv uv oxidation including vuv h2o vuv h2o2 and uv h2o2 is a powerful method that does not require the addition of chemical agents takeuchi and tanaka 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 owing to the above advantages vuv uv oxidation has been widely used to mineralize organic compounds during the production of ultrapure water choi and chung 2019a choi and chung 2019b vuv uv oxidation in homogeneous water solutions is highly heterogeneous along the light path l p heit and m braun 1997 because vuv rapidly decays by approximately 90 in superficial water l p 0 55 cm mora and mohseni 2018 specifically the absorption coefficient of water at 185 nm is 1 8 cm 1 zoschke et al 2014 therefore oxidation in water layers closest to the lamp l p 0 55 cm are predominantly driven by primary oxidation reactions i e vuv h2o which differs from oxidation in the remaining water layers l p 0 55 cm wherein oh from uv h2o2 is more important heit and m braun 1997 in previous study kinetic models have been developed in laminar flow regime for continuous flow reactors which illustrated the non linear response between vuv fluence rate and oh concentration bagheri and mohseni 2014 crapulli et al 2014 however previous models still need some improvements in terms of the pollutant diffusion in turbulent flow formation and degradation of oxidation byproducts in addition no reports have thus far presented quantitative information on the contribution of oh oxidization to the degradation of organic pollutants in various water layers this study aimed to employ vuv uv oxidation to eliminate aldehydes in the ro permeate for potable reuse or ultrapure water production first vuv uv oxidation of aldehydes with various alkyl carbon numbers in solutions of various water depths i e total l p was investigated second the mineralization pathways were evaluated via the oxidation byproducts under various vuv uv fluences third considering the radical chain reactions rapid vuv decay and limited transfer of radical species along l p an iterative model was developed in a fully mixed solution to quantify the heterogeneous distribution of radicals along l p with considering the pollutant transfer among water layers the oh utilization can be increased and oxidation performance could be improved with considering the formation and degradation of oxidation byproducts the steady state oh concentration could be more precisely predicted and mineralization of target organic pollutants could be clarified in vuv uv system 2 materials and experiments 2 1 chemical reagents four kinds of aldehydes were used in this study to examine the performance of vuv uv oxidation in the degradation of organic contaminants formaldehyde and acetaldehyde solutions 1000 mg l were purchased from o2si smart solutions charleston sc usa glyoxal solution 400 g l was purchased from beijing innochem sci and tech co ltd beijing china and propionaldehyde 97 purity was purchased from tci tokyo japan carboxylic acids of formic acid acetic acid oxalic acid and propyl acid were of analytical grade and purchased from j t baker new jersey usa derivative reagents namely o 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride pfbha and potassium hydrogen phthalate were analytically pure and purchased from j k scientific beijing china chromatographic grade n hexane was purchased from j t baker

were prepared using ultrapure water produced by the millipore purifier milli q merck germany 2 2 experimental equipment and operational procedure the vuv uv oxidation system produced a collimated beam in a sealed chamber containing n2 as the purging gas to avoid the absorption of vuv 185 nm by oxygen in air fig s1 two low pressure ultraviolet lpuv lamps with suprasil quartz as the lamp walls 48 w gzw48d15y z436 comwin light electricity co ltd china were used to emit light at two wavelengths 185nm and 254nm simultaneously before the experiments the lpuv lamps were turned on with n2 gas purging for 1 h to stabilize the lamp and to replace the air in the collimated beam chamber vuv and uv irradiance on the solution were 0 75 and 4 36 mw cm2 respectively the irradiation experiments were conducted in cylindrical beakers of 8 cm in diameter the solution volumes of 50 75 100 125 and 150 ml corresponded to water depths total l p of 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 cm respectively solutions containing an individual aldehyde were placed under the collimated beam for vuv uv irradiation and were continuously stirred during irradiation samples were withdrawn after specific irradiation times and the concentrations of target aldehydes and oxidation products in the samples were determined all experiments were conducted in duplicates 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of aldehydes were determined using a gas chromatography gc machine equipped with an electron capture detector ecd agilent 7890b santa clara ca usa pretreatment of derivatives and liquid liquid extraction are detailed in the supplementary information text s1 the concentrations of carboxylic acids and h2o2 in water solutions were determined using ion chromatography dionex aquion thermo scientific usa the separation column for carboxylic acids was ionpac as18 4 250 mm and the mobile phases were 5 mm koh and 20 mm koh the separation column for h2o2 was as15 column 4 250 mm and koh was continuously leached at a concentration of 25 mm for 15 min song et al 2017 total organic carbon toc was measured using a m9e portable toc analyzer ge analytical instruments inc u s a with the online model 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of various aldehydes compared to the negligible photolysis by uv vuv uv oxidation was more effective in the degradation of aldehydes fig 1 a which was attributed to oh formed during the homolysis of h2o by vuv the vuv uv irradiation times required to eliminate 90 of formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxal and propionaldehyde were 5 8 3 2 3 1 and 1 5 min vuv uv fluence of 1779 981 951 460 mj cm2 respectively to assess oxidation quantitatively the degradation of aldehydes i e the degradation rate of aldehydes as a function of time was fit to the pseudo zero order kinetics because aldehyde was calculated as the main oh consumer at initial vuv uv irradiation time text s2 the zero order rate constants k obs were 0 040 0 048 0 057 and 0 078 μm s 1 for formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxal and propionaldehyde respectively in general the k obs values increased as the alkyl carbon number increased for monoaldehydes the proportional relationship between k obs and k oh ah further verified the dominant contribution of oh fig 1b notably k obs of glyoxal with two carbonyl groups deviated from the above linear relationship the oh usually primarily attacks the cho of aldehydes butkovskaya and setser 2000 rosado reyes and francisco 2007 even the k obs of glyoxal was normalized to the number of cho in glyoxal glyoxal still does not fit the linear correlation previous studies reported the ineligible contribution of reductive species to the degradation of organic pollutants herein uv sulfite was employed to investigate the degradation of aldehydes by reductive species as shown in fig s8 uv sulfite can moderately eliminate glyoxal but hardly eliminate acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde the vuv absorbance of glyoxal was estimated to be 5 48 m 1cm 1 following the method proposed by pan et al fig s9 malik and joens 2000 pan et al 2022 which is much lower than that of water thus the photolysis by uv and vuv of glyoxal is presumed to be low thus the deviation of k obs glyoxal to the linear relation between k obs and k oh ah can be explained by the high reactive of glyoxal to reductive species such as the h and e the quantitative information of the reactivities need further investigations this result indicates that vuv uv oxidation is beneficial for the removal of aldehydes with polycarbonyl groups 3 2 mineralization pathways of various aldehydes the proportion of each organic carbon component e g parent aldehyde and oxidation byproducts was evaluated during vuv uv oxidation as shown in fig 2 carboxylic acids were the dominant oxidation byproducts which was confirmed with the fit of carboxylic carbons to the experimentally measured dissolved organic carbons in the vuv uv oxidation of acetaldehyde in contrast to k obs the mineralization of aldehydes became inefficient as the alkyl carbon number increased suggesting that aldehydes with longer alkyl groups were converted into more recalcitrant polybasic carboxylic acid such as oxalic acid stefan et al 1996 the evolution of oxidation byproducts indicated that aldehydes were primarily converted into their counterpart mono carboxylic acid via the hydroxylation of cho by oh and the subsequent oxidation of alkyl groups into binary carboxylic acid fig 3 formaldehyde was primarily converted into formic acid during which h2c oh 2 was the hydration intermediate and the formyl radical was the h abstraction intermediate mcelroy and waygood 1991 schaefer et al 2020 the formyl radical rapidly reacted with o2 and h2o2 to form formic acid which was formed within a short irradiation time but minimally accumulated as the irradiation time increased a few acetic acids and oxalic acids possibly formed via dimerization acetaldehyde was dominantly transformed into acetic acid within the initial 6 min vuv uv fluence of 1840 mj cm2 during which ch3co was the transient intermediate from h abstraction by oh butkovskaya and setser 2000 acetic acid was further converted into the ch2c o oh intermediate to form oxalic acid kamath et al 2018 rosado reyes and francisco 2006 subsequently oxalic acid was directly mineralized as confirmed by the low accumulation of formic acid table s1 reaction s34 stefan et al 1996 propionaldehyde likely underwent de carbonylation to form acetic acid or carboxylation to form propionic acid with ch3ch2c o as the main transient intermediate from the initial h abstraction le crane et al 2005 rosado reyes and francisco 2007 notably the total known carboxylic carbon decreased rapidly within 2 min of vuv uv irradiation vuv uv fluence of 613 mj cm2 and carboxylic carbons with 3 c were degraded within 4 min vuv uv fluence of 1226 mj cm2 thus propionaldehyde and propionic acid were directly mineralized into acetic acid and oxalic acid via dealkylation or converted into other byproducts such as glyoxylic acid and malonaldehyde which were not targeted in this study and require further investigation the quantitative information in this research identified both the main oxidation products and major pathway for the degradation of aldehydes by vuv uv oxidation this provides basic information between irradiation intensity and degradation rate or mineralization rate of mono aldehydes furthermore the information of the main oxidation products and pathway help to establish the kinetic model and then predict the oxidation performance at the water later with different l p values 3 3 variation of vuv uv oxidation performance with total l p 3 3 1 influence of total l p on the degradation rate the performance of vuv uv oxidation in the degradation of aldehydes decreased as the total l p i e water depth of the solution increased as total l p increased from 1 0 to 3 0 cm k obs decreased from 0 13 to 0 033 μm s 1 fig 4 in addition to achieve 90 elimination of acetaldehyde the vuv uv irradiation time increased from 1 0 to 4 3 min i e the vuv uv fluence increased from 302 to 1303 mj cm2 with increasing l p from 1 0 to 3 0 cm although vuv contributed to oxidative degradation it was mostly absorbed by superficial water layers i e l p 0 55 cm the degradation of acetaldehyde in the bulk solution can be analyzed by dividing total l p into multiple water layers and integrating the concentrations of aldehydes and oh across these water layers fig s2 and eq 1 oh is formed from vuv driven oxidation e g vuv h2o and vuv h2o2 and uv driven oxidation e g uv h2o2 as shown in eqs 2 5 1 d ah d t 0 l k oh ah ah oh ss l 1 l d l 2 r f l r vuv h 2 o l r vuv h 2 o 2 l r uv h 2 o 2 l 3 r vuv h 2 o

where ah is the concentration of acetaldehyde m oh ss l is the transient steady state concentration of oh in a specific water layer m l is the total l p of the solution i e water depth cm r f l r vuv h2o l r vuv h2o2 l and r uv h2o2 l are respectively the oh formation rates of the total pathway vuv h2o pathway vuv h2o2 pathway and uv h2o2 pathway in a specific water layer m s e p vuv 0 and e p uv 0 are respectively the incident irradiance of vuv and uv ein cm2 s φh2o and φh2o2 are respectively the radical quantum yields of oh by h2o and h2o2 photolysis mol ein a 0 01 cm 1 and b 1 76 cm 1 are respectively the absorbance of the solution at uv and vuv cm 1 assuming that the degradation of acetaldehyde follows pseudo zero order kinetics in each water layer then the degradation kinetics can be simplified as expressed in eqs 6 8 thus k obs of acetaldehyde in the bulk solution should be inversely proportional to the total l p i e water depth inset of fig 4 which further verifies that vuv oxidation e g vuv h2o and vuv h2o2 contributes to the fast decrease in k obs as l p increases 6 m e p vuv 0 φ h 2 o f h 2 o vuv φ h 2 o 2 f h 2 o 2 vuv 7 n e p uv 0 φ h 2 o 2 f h 2 o 2 uv 8 d ah d t k obs 1 l 0 l r f l d l 1 l 0 l m 1 10 b l n 1 10 a l d l m n 2 303 a m b n a 1 l similarly the formation rate of h2o2 during the initial vuv uv irradiation time is inversely proportional to the total l p where the formation rate decreased from 0 087 to 0 017 μm s 1 as the l p increased from 1 0 to 3 0 cm fig s5 b from this analysis h2o2 is predominantly generated in superficial water layers l p 0 55 cm and then diffuses into deeper water layers for the degradation of organic pollutants 3 3 2 modeling of the oxidation kinetics in addition to determining the decrease of k obs along l p vuv uv oxidation performance was further characterized in terms of the formation of oxidation byproducts to quantitatively examine oxidation as a function of l p and irradiation time an iterative kinetic model was developed on the basis of the mineralization pathways of acetaldehyde proposed in fig 3 and the chain oxidation reactions between radical species and organic matter as shown in table s1 and s2 and fig 3 the model was developed with the vuv uv system under a fully mixed solution in this model the whole oxidation system was divided into multiple water layers along l p because the vuv irradiance decayed rapidly in the water layers the radical concentrations e g oh o2 and ho2 differed a lot between water layers because of the short lifetime and limited diffusion distance this directly leads to the lower degradation rate of organic pollutant at the water layer with deeper l p in the fully mixed solution the concentration of organic pollutants should be uniform for all water layers thus after each irradiation time interval dt the concentrations of the parent aldehyde and oxidation byproducts in the bulk solution were calculated using eq 11 and then assigned to each water layer fig s2 c the formation rate of radical species i e oh r f l was calculated from the vuv uv irradiance in each water layer eqs 2 5 which decreased along l p followed the beer lambert law eqs 9 and 10 fig s2 the consumption of radical species was calculated from the second order rate constant multiplying the concentration of reactants as shown in table s1 similarly the degradation rate of the parent aldehydes and the formation and degradation of oxidation byproducts can be expressed in table s1 the change of the concentration of radical species parent aldehydes or oxidation byproducts can be expressed in table s2 using the ode 15s function in matlab to solve all differential equations in table s2 the concentration of radicals and byproducts in each water layer within a specific irradiation time interval dt is solvable the modeling results converged with setting the water layer increasing from 103 to 104 fig s6 thus the optimized number of water layers was 103 to assess the oxidation performance in the water layers with various light path l p 9 e p vuv l e p vuv 0 1 10 b l 10 e p uv l e p uv 0 1 10 a l 11 ah t d t ah t 0 l k oh ah ah t oh ss l δ l l d l where e p vuv l and e p uv l are respectively the incident irradiance of vuv and uv at the light path of l ein cm2 s and k oh ah is the second order rate constant of oh reacting with acetaldehyde m 1s 1 considering the heterogeneous distribution of radical species and homogeneous distribution of organic pollutants in a fully mixed solution the oxidation would be more efficient in a turbulent flow system wherein organic pollutants are more possibly exposed to oh with the calculated contribution to pollutant elimination the variation of oxidation performance can be better clarified than the spatial distribution of oh concentration the iterative kinetic model was able to characterize the degradation of acetaldehyde and formation of oxidation byproducts in solutions with various total l p values fig 5 a c which will help to understand the degradation kinetics and mineralization of organic pollutants the above results suggested that in a turbulent flow regime the fast diffusion of pollutants aldehyde and its byproducts and limited diffution of transient radicals should be considered for modelling the vuv uv reactors with fast flow rate high reynolds number especially the fast diffusion of pollutants in a turbulent flow regime may favor a better energy cost for vuv uv reactors matsushita et al 2019 interestingly the main intermediates of acetic acid were accumulated to similar maximum concentrations but formed with different rates in solutions of various l p values 3 4 vuv uv oxidation performance along l p to quantify the spatial and temporal variation of the oxidation performance the oh concentration was simulated fig 6 the concentration of oh increased rapidly within the initial 3 min of irradiation specifically the oh concentration was 2 45 10 10 2 19 10 11 and 1 07 10 12 m at the l p values of 0 003 cm superficial water layer 0 55 cm and 3 0 cm deep water layer respectively thereafter as the irradiation time continuously increased to 30 min the oh concentration in the water layers slightly increased notably the oh concentration in water layer of l p 0 55 converged to similar levels 0 4 2 8 10 11 m oh is generated from the vuv h2o and uv h2o2 processes and then consumed during organic oxidation and radical self recombination changes in the oh concentration as the irradiation time increases can be attributed to the dynamic equilibrium during the initial stage of irradiation oh and secondary oxidants i e h2o2 as show in fig s5 are accumulated because generation is more rapid than consumption with prolonged irradiation the concentrations of target organic matter i e acetaldehyde and reactive species reach steady states as a result the oh concentration reaches a plateau after prolonged irradiation the oh concentration significantly decreased along l p during the initial stage of irradiation 0 0 2 min the oh dramatically decreased by 3 orders of magnitude along l p from 1 4 10 11 m in the superficial water layer l p 0 003 cm to 1 2 10 14 m in the deep water layer l p 3 0 cm to illustrate the spatial distribution of oxidation performance the accumulated contribution of oh to oxidation was calculated fig 6 b in turbulence flow pollutants in the water layers far from the lamp could diffuse to the superficial water layers and then realized the improvement on oh utilization and pollutants elimination the degradation of aldehydes in bulk solution was analyzed in terms of aldehyde oxidation via oh exposure oh l dt in all water layers l thus the accumulated contribution of oh oxidation along l p was quantified by σ l oh l dt after the irradiation time of 5 min at which acetaldehyde was almost eliminated oh oxidation in the superficial water layers of l p 0 16 cm accounted for 50 of the total oxidation performance while oh oxidation in the water layers of l p 0 81 cm accounted for 90 of the total oxidation performance in addition the model indicated that the accumulated contribution along l p was minorly influenced by irradiation time because the relative increment of oh was similar between all water layers this model considered the mass transfer of organic pollutants which providing an appropriate method to optimize the design parameters of photoreactor under fully mixed condition e g the reactor diameter and spatial layout of the lamps decay of vuv along l p vuvl vuv0 was the dominant reason for changes in the oh concentration oh l oh 0 which was confirmed by the generally proportional decrease in oh l oh 0 to vuvl vuv0 fig s7 notably at the initial stage of irradiation 0 2 min oh l oh 0 decreased faster than vuvl vuv0 because the consumption of oh increased during this stage including self recombination to generate h2o2 and consumption by parent aldehyde and oxidation byproducts as the irradiation time increased toward the steady state 5 30 min h2o2 was accumulated and reached a stable high concentration 4 conclusions vuv uv oxidation was demonstrated as an efficient chemical free process for the degradation of recalcitrant aldehydes the performance of oxidation was found to depend on the structure of the parent aldehyde and varied along the l p degradation was faster for parent aldehydes with longer alky chains but the mineralization rate was lower because of the formation of more recalcitrant intermediates i e binary carboxylic acids the degradation rate constant k obs of formaldehyde was only 51 of that of propionaldehyde after 4 min of vuv uv oxidation the mineralization rates of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were approximately 50 and 8 respectively the carbonyl group was the primary oxidation site where primary oxidation of counterpart monocarboxylic acids and binary carboxylic acids occurred the performance of vuv uv oxidation decreased as the total l p increased to eliminate 90 of acetaldehydes the vuv uv fluence was increased from 302 to 1303 mj cm2 with increasing the total l p from 1 0 to 3 0 cm an iterative kinetic model was developed for the first time on the basis of radical chain reactions and mass transfer in multiple water layers the model was able to simulate heterogeneous oxidation in homogeneous water and provided information on the degradation of aldehydes by oh exposure and formation of carboxylic acid in turbulent flow regime pollutant and its byproducts diffuse faster among water layers while transient oh diffuse limitedly with the new iterative model of this study the prediction of vuv uv oxidation performance in turbulent flow regime could be improved in further study oh formed in superficial water layers with l p lower than 0 16 and 0 81 cm contributed to 50 and 90 of the total oxidation performance respectively in engineering this result would help to improve the vuvuv reactor design in terms of optimizing the thickness of water

the monetary value of wapys gained e g in us could be estimated by willingness to pay and included in a cost benefit analysis some interventions might result in greater waterqol gains than others or

important to distinguish between measuring the state of an individual s self perceived domestic water security and quantifying its value 2 1 definition water security has often been defined in terms of water scarcity at the level of national or sub national geographies grey and sadoff 2007 hall and borgomeo 2013 in domestic settings the focus has often been on levels of daily per capita water consumption or levels of service bartram et al 2014 the definition of safely managed drinking water in the sustainable development goals focuses on characteristics of the service accessible on premises available when needed and free of contamination who and unicef 2021 this focus on service characteristics in global monitoring is appropriate given constraints on the data collected in nationally representative household surveys however understanding people s experience of water is also important recent advances in the characterisation of water security at the household and individual level have focused on such experiential outcomes wutich and brewis 2014 focusing on what people are able to do sen 1980 given their level of water service lends itself to a definition of domestic water security focused on individuals ability to benefit rather on service characteristics young et al 2019a such capability based approaches can measure domestic water security as a state of

15298,domestic water insecurity harms quality of life outcomes beyond health for example in worry about water availability or anger at disrupted plans however these outcomes are excluded from cost benefit analyses of water supply interventions which typically measure and value only prevented disease and time savings in this paper i propose a means of quantifying the value of being water secure for an individual s quality of life the water adjusted person year wapy one wapy represents a year lived in complete water security it is inspired by the quality adjusted life year in health economics which combines time with a health related quality of life index the wapy combines time using water services with a water related quality of life waterqol index where 0 completely water insecure and 1 completely water secure the index could be derived from an existing four attribute water insecurity experiences scale which includes questions such as how often did you worry that you would not have enough water for all of your needs other questions concern drinking water disrupted plans and handwashing responses can be combined in a weighted index based on the relative importance of the four attributes to people if someone has a waterqol index of 0 6 over a 10 year period they would have 6 wapys if a water supply intervention raised waterqol to 0 8 they would gain 2 wapys over 10 years the monetary value of wapys gained e g in us could be estimated by willingness to pay and included in a cost benefit analysis some interventions might result in greater waterqol gains than others or

weighted by an index of water related quality of life derived from experiential measures such as wise 2 defining measuring and valuing domestic water security before moving to the wapy itself it is important to distinguish between measuring the state of an individual s self perceived domestic water security and quantifying its value 2 1 definition water security has often been defined in terms of water scarcity at the level of national or sub national geographies grey and sadoff 2007 hall and borgomeo 2013 in domestic settings the focus has often been on levels of daily per capita water consumption or levels of service bartram et al 2014 the definition of safely managed drinking water in the sustainable development goals focuses on characteristics of the service accessible on premises available when needed and free of contamination who and unicef 2021 this focus on service characteristics in global monitoring is appropriate given constraints on the data collected in nationally representative household surveys however understanding people s experience of water is also important recent advances in the characterisation of water security at the household and individual level have focused on such experiential outcomes wutich and brewis 2014 focusing on what people are able to do sen 1980 given their level of water service lends itself to a definition of domestic water security focused on individuals ability to benefit rather on service characteristics young et al 2019a such capability based approaches can measure domestic water security as a state of being 2 2 measurement the aforementioned water insecurity experiences wise family of scales was developed based on a review and primary qualitative research boateng et al 2018 jepson et al 2017 the

15299,for over 30 years biological gas desulfurization under halo alkaline conditions has been studied and optimized this technology is currently applied in already 270 commercial installations worldwide sulfur particle separation however remains a challenge a fraction of sulfur particles is often too small for liquid solid separation with conventional separation technology in this article we report the effects of a novel sulfidic reactor inserted in the conventional process set up on sulfur particle size and morphology in the sulfidic reactor polysulfide is produced by the reaction of elemental sulfur particles and sulfide which is again converted to elemental sulfur in a gas lift reactor we analyzed sulfur particles produced in continuous long term lab scale reactor experiments under various sulfide concentrations and sulfidic retention times the analyses were performed with laser diffraction particle size analysis and light microscopy these show that the smallest particles 1 µm have mostly disappeared under the highest sulfide concentration 4 1 mm and sulfidic retention time 45 min under these conditions also agglomeration of sulfur particles was promoted model calculations with thermodynamic and previously derived kinetic data on polysulfide formation confirm the experimental data on the removal of the smallest particles under the highest sulfidic pressure the model predicts that equilibrium conditions are reached between sulfur sulfide and polysulfide and that 100 of the sulfur particles 1 µm are dissolved by the autocatalytic formation of polysulfides these experiments and modeling results demonstrate that the insertion of a novel sulfidic reactor in the conventional process set up promotes the removal of the smallest individual sulfur particles and promotes the production of sulfur agglomerates the novel sulfidic reactor is therefore a promising process addition with the potential to improve process operation sulfur separation and sulfur

pressure and temperature and without toxic chemicals cline et al 2003 van den bosch et al 2007 in bd under halo alkaline conditions h2s present in sour gas gas with substantial amounts of h2s is absorbed in a moderately alkaline solution reacts to soluble bisulfide and is subsequently oxidized in a gas lift reactor by a mixed culture of sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob to elemental sulfur eq 1 1 h s 1 2 o 2 s 0 o h at ambient temperatures and pressures elemental sulfur exists in rings and polymeric chains of different sizes sn in bd under halo alkaline conditions eight s0 atoms form a ring s8 and crystallize to the most stable configuration in aqueous systems which is orthorhombic α s8 mol et al 2020 next to formation of elemental sulfur oxidized by products such as sulfate and thiosulfate are formed due to overexposure to dissolved oxygen sulfate is formed biologically while thiosulfate is formed abiotically these compounds are undesirable as they lead to acidification and consequently addition of chemicals is needed to neutralize the process solution moreover elemental sulfur is the preferred s species as it is stable easy to separate transport store and re use due to its solid properties biologically produced sulfur is known to have hydrophilic properties which makes it more suitable for applications in water in comparison with chemically produced sulfur janssen et al 2009 in this study we further refer to elemental sulfur as sulfur describing the solid elemental material although bd under halo alkaline conditions has been intensively studied and is already largely applied on a commercial scale 270 installations worldwide in 2017 buisman et al 1990 de rink et al 2019 janssen et al 1999 kiragosyan et al 2019 klok et al 2017 2013 2012 van den bosch et al 2007 the sulfur settleability is still a major challenge in recent years the scale of bd installations has increased due to their application for natural gas desulfurization this trend makes certain operational parameters such as sulfur separation even more important even though sulfur separation in larger installations often happens with a decanter centrifuge or hydrocyclone a concentration step of the reactor suspension before entering the centrifuge is still beneficial for operation of the centrifuge for smaller installations a centrifuge is often not economically viable so sulfur separation relies solely on the settleability of the sulfur particles due to the lack of control over sulfur particle properties such as size and morphology the sulfur particles sometimes settle poorly in this study we use the term particle as an umbrella term including colloids crystals intergrown crystals aggregates agglomerates etc unless otherwise specified in this case a particle is any shape the elemental sulfur can take as long as in a sedimentation context it settles as one unit differences in settleability between various industrial reactors were found in an earlier study mol et al 2020 in this earlier study we described that small non settling sulfur particles with a median diameter of 0 3 µm could account for at least 13 6 of the total number of particles additionally it was reported that in industrial bd installations settleability of the produced sulfur can fluctuate over time l feenstra industriewater eerbeek personal communication 7 september 2021 poorly settleable sulfur may lead to hampered process operation as it accumulates in the system accumulated sulfur can cause clogging of pumps and pipes and under high concentrations foaming as well kleinjan et al 2006 moreover small sulfur particles are more prone to side reactions such as oxidation due to their larger relative surface area another reason why sulfur needs to be recovered effectively is that sulfur as raw material is expected to become more important in the future not only is sulfur an essential nutrient for agriculture but there is also an emerging market for sulfur in other applications such as capacity cathode material in rechargeable batteries advanced materials metal bioleaching or as electron donor in autotrophic denitrification di capua et al 2016 eriksen et al 2004 florentino et al 2015 lim et al 2015 roig et al 2004 seidel et al 2006 soares 2002 ucar et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 therefore it is relevant to improve sulfur recovery sulfur particle recovery is a challenge as a solution we propose a new process design to remove the smallest particles 1 µm from the reactor liquid this new design was used in two earlier studies but with a different experimental purpose de rink et al 2019 kiragosyan et al 2020 the design consists of a sulfidic reactor in which the smallest sulfur particles are dissolved to polysulfides by a reaction with sulfide the formed polysulfides can then again be biologically oxidized to elemental sulfur upon exposure to oxygen in the gas lift reactor the sulfidic reactor is placed between the absorber and the gas lift reactor and the reactor content buffered medium sob sulfur particles dissolved sulfur species is continuously circulated over all reactor compartments of the set up the retention time in the absorber and sulfidic reactor can be called sulfidic retention time surt surt is defined as the amount of time the reactor content is retained under sulfidic anoxic conditions before being pumped to the gas lift reactor in this study we have investigated the effect of various total dissolved sulfide tds concentrations and surts on the presence of sulfur particles with a diameter 1 µm in the solution this was tested by long term continuous lab scale bioreactor experiments the results were validated with a model based on physical and chemical laws describing the effect of tds concentration and surt on polysulfide formation rates and particle dissolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a lab scale reactor set up was used with an absorber a and gas lift reactor c fig 1 for extended configuration two additional reactor compartments were added a sulfidic reactor b between the absorber and the gas lift reactor and a settler d after the gas lift reactor reactor a had a height of 27 cm and an inner diameter of 4 5 cm reactor b had a height of 75 cm and inner diameter of 12 5 cm reactor c had a height of 85 cm and inner diameter of 12 5 cm and reactor d had a height of 55 cm and upper inner diameter of 10 cm and bottom inner diameter of 3 2 cm reactor a was not stirred but mixed by the liquid in and outflows reactor b was mechanically stirred with a stainless steel stirrer reactor c was a gas lift reactor which was stirred by the downer riser flows created by the introduction of gas in the bottom of the reactor the inner column was 8 cm in diameter and had a height of 44 5 cm reactor d was not stirred the sulfidic reactor is a zone with retention time of reactor content buffered medium sob sulfur particles dissolved sulfur species under anoxic poly sulfidic pressure the absorber by itself is also a small sulfidic zone the liquid volumes of the set ups with and without the sulfidic reactor were 9 1 and 5 6 l respectively both with settler without settler but with sulfidic reactor the wet volume was 7 6 l the volume of the gas lift reactor was 3 7 l the gas flow was recycled over the headspace of gas lift reactor with a vacuum pump to prevent any release of the h2s gas and to reach low oxygen concentrations the gas was introduced with a porous stone to the bottom of the inner column of the gas lift reactor to ensure proper oxygen transfer and mixing pure h2s gas and oxygen were supplied by mass flow controllers brooks 5850e series 0 100 nml min and 0 20 nml min for oxygen and h2s during the experiment with the middle and lowest h2s loading brooks instrument llc hatfield usa in case of pressure build up excess gas was discharged via a water lock saturated with zinc acetate to capture any potentially present h2s the reactors were operated at 35 c using a thermostat bath and climate controlled cabinet 2 2 medium composition the medium consisted of a buffer with 6 6 g l 1 na2co3 and 69 3 g l 1 nahco3 in demineralized water at ph 8 5 fresh buffer was supplied at a constant flow to maintain enough alkalinity in the system furthermore a nutrient stock was supplied for biological growth containing in g per 1 l of demineralized water k2hpo4 0 1 mgcl2 6h2o 0 0203 nacl 0 6 ch4n2o 0 06 and 2 ml l 1 trace element solution as in pfenning and lippert pfennig and lippert 1966 2 3 experimental operation the experiments carried out with the various conditions are numbered exp 1 4 an overview of the operational conditions per experiment is provided in table 1 a settler was included for the experiments with the highest h2s loading rate to prevent sulfur accumulation in the system i e to avoid operational issues such as foaming and clogging due to sulfur build up experiments with lower h2s loading rate were conducted without the settler to collect a sample in which all particles that were produced under the specific experimental conditions were present without removing any particles with the settler we assume that the removal of the largest settling particles does not impact the presence of the smallest particles in the process solution the latter is studied in this paper reactors were filled with medium and inoculated in all experiments the set up was operated in continuous mode without interruption throughout all experiments the h2s supply was kept constant for that experiment the h2s load was used to set the tds concentration in the sulfidic reactor to keep the conversion efficiency from sulfide to sulfur high the oxidation reduction potential orp was set at 360 mv vs ag agcl which is a representative set point for industrial reactors the orp set point was controlled by a proportional integral pi controller the pi controller regulated the oxygen supply rate samples well mixed reactor content with sulfur particles medium and microorganisms were taken for analysis at a sampling port in the middle of the sulfidic reactor exp 3 4 and the gas lift reactor all experiments the sampling tubes from the reactor were flushed three times prior to sampling to obtain a representative sample 2 4 inoculum exp 1 was inoculated with centrifuged microorganisms to remove excess sulfur from a lab scale sulfur producing gas lift bioreactor operated under continuous conditions like the conditions applied in this experiment the original inoculum of this reactor was obtained from a well characterized industrial scale bd facility under halo alkaline conditions of industriewater eerbeek b v eerbeek the netherlands hereafter referred to as eerbeek janssen et al 2009 to remove the sulfur the reactor content was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 min firlabo froilabo paris france a pellet was formed with two layers a bottom layer of elemental sulfur and a layer with microorganisms on top the layer with microorganisms was carefully washed off exp 4 was inoculated with centrifuged microorganisms directly taken from eerbeek exp 2 and 3 were inoculated with microorganism rich process solution from exp 1 and 4 as described in table 1 2 5 analysis reactors were equipped with sensors for temperature and orp triple junction platinum rod glass electrode equipped with an internal ag agcl reference electrode prosense oosterhout the netherlands methods to measure sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations sulfur particle size distribution psd alkalinity conductivity ph and total sulfur concentration were previously described elsewhere mol et al 2020 psd can be expressed both volumetrically and numerically in a volumetric based particle size distribution larger particles have a heavier weight as due to their size they often comprise a larger percentage of the total solid volume in a numeric based distribution each particle has an equal weight independent of the particle size according to common practice when a psd had to be represented by a single value the median d50 of the psd was reported to show the particle size development over time the median has a better way of representing the central location of the data in a non normal distribution than the mean and is relatively unaffected by outliers field 2009 the microorganism concentration was measured as the amount of total nitrogen as in de rink et al 2019 this method is based on the absorbance of nitrophenol at 345 nm and performed with the tntplus 826 persulfate digestion method hach company loveland colorado united states presence of biologically produced sulfur did not affect the measured nitrogen concentration van den bosch et al 2007 analysis of sulfur particles with light microscopy was performed according to mol et al 2020 process selectivity for elemental sulfur was calculated by the mass balance based on h2s supply and the measurement of dissolved sulfur products formed de rink et al 2019 in our study when the term hs is used we refer to the sum of tds h2s hs and s2 as most of the dissolved sulfide is present as hs at ph 8 5 operational reactor data can be found in si table 1 2 6 mathematical model a mathematical model of a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr was developed to simulate the polysulfide formation in the sulfidic zone of the experimental setup it is assumed that this zone is

the s that originates from hs in the reaction with elemental sulfur or polysulfide and thus does not contribute to the mass balance of zero valent elemental sulfur while polysulfide formation is known to be a sequence of reaction steps after which long chain polysulfides s9 2 can rearrange to shorter chain length we assume for the sake of simplicity that all polysulfides that are formed have an average chain length x which is calculated based on the thermodynamic expressions by kamyshny et al 2004 the calculated value of x for the experimental conditions is 5 05 which is in agreement with reported measurements under similar conditions by roman et al i e 5 17 and 5 18 2014 the polysulfide formation rate is generally described by both uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions slightly adjusted

zero a list with parameters is provided in the supplementary information si table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle size four long term 16 41 days continuous lab scale reactor experiments were performed at different tds concentrations and surts i e using an additional sulfidic process step sulfide was successfully converted to elemental sulfur under all four applied conditions leading to the presence of sulfur particles in the reactor solution operational reactor performance data on parameters such as product formation bacteria concentration etc can be found in si table 1 particle size distributions psd of sulfur particle samples at the end of each experiment taken from the gas lift reactor during the experiments are shown in fig 2 in general the number based particle size distributions ranged from 0 1 to 50 µm this is a typical size distribution for biologically formed sulfur particles in these types of systems janssen et al 1996 kleinjan et al 2005a leerdam et al 2011 li et al 2020 mol et al 2020 mu et al 2021 roman 2016 the particles had a unimodal distribution except for exp 3 where the distribution had a bimodal tendency the particles from exp 1 had a median particle size of 0 6 µm the particles from exp 2 are considerably larger with a median diameter of 3 8 µm from previous work it is known that the peak of exp 2 likely belongs to sulfur agglomerates and the peaks of exp 1 3 and 4 to single particles or a mix thereof mol et al 2020 for the samples from exp 3 and 4 the median particle sizes were 0 9 and 0 7 µm respectively fig 3 provides an overview of the median particle diameters of particles from all four experiments over time as the range on the y axis does not allow for details to be visible for exp 1 3 and 4 the same data can be found in si fig 1 with a y axis range of 0 2 µm the conditions in exp 2 were found to be optimal for the removal of the smallest particles in this experiment the tds concentration was relatively high in the sulfidic reactor 4 4 mm and surt was the longest of all experiments 45 0 min this combination of high tds concertation and long surt lead to high sulfidic pressure during the entire experiment exp 2 is dominated by larger particles 3 5 1 9 µm whereas the particles from the other experiments are considerably smaller in exp 2 submicron 1 µm particles have almost completely disappeared a likely explanation is that they have reacted to polysulfides at higher tds concentration 8 3 mm but much shorter surt 4 8 min the particles had an average median diameter of 0 3 0 2 µm exp 1 at a moderate tds concentration 1 9 mm but with similar surt as exp 2 the median particle diameter was 0 5 0 2 µm exp 3 the median particle diameter of exp 3 is thus also smaller than the median particle diameter of exp 2 interestingly the particles in exp 3 seemed to grow towards the end of the experiment fig 4 at day 13 an elbow shaped peak appears after 1 µm and the peak below 1 µm shifts to the right and becomes smaller this shows that small particles are disappearing however at day 10 the particle size on average again became smaller a peak appeared at 50 100 nm in one of the triplicate measurements possibly the particles causing this peak were freshly formed sulfur nuclei perhaps they were only present in smaller amounts and therefore were not measured on other psds such as on day 3 on the last day day 16 the median particle diameter was 0 9 µm this final median particle diameter is considerably larger than average median particle diameter of exp 3 the hydraulic retention time hrt in exp 3 was 25 days and as the set up used in exp 3 did not have a settler the hrt was assumed to be equal to the retention time of particles in the set up the slow dynamics of the behavior of particle size along time in exp 3 were due to this long hrt and relatively low sulfide loading rate interestingly in exp 4 which has a similar hrt of 23 days no growth at all was observed likely due to the even lower sulfide loading rate in addition in the gas lift reactor the particles were significantly larger than in the sulfidic reactor towards the end of the experiment see si fig 1 for a figure with smaller range on y axis this is likely due to the partial breakdown of particles in the sulfidic reactor which are then rebuilt due to new sulfur formation by poly sulfide oxidation in the gas lift reactor in mol et al 2021 2022 the agglomeration process was studied in more detail it was shown that the agglomerates are shaped through a balance between build up by freshly formed particles and breakdown of particles to polysulfide for exp 4 at the lowest tds concentration 1 0 mm the particle size remained stable throughout the experiment with a median diameter of 0 5 0 1 µm probably because the hs concentration was limiting the dissolution of sulfur evidently the addition of a sulfidic reactor leads to the removal of the smallest submicron particles if the tds concentration is sufficiently high it seems that exp 3 was operated at boundary conditions as we observe just a slight effect on particle size and only at the end of the experiment 3 2 particle size and morphology analysis with light microscopy the sulfur particles formed under the various experimental conditions had distinctively different morphologies as observed with light microscopy fig 5 sulfur particles were distinguished in the light microscopy pictures as light radiant particles single particles or darker patches with light radiant edges agglomerated particles the black spots in the background were microorganisms as they showed movement and on occasion a dividing black spot was observed furthermore the appearance of sob is similar in light microscopy pictures in other publications marnocha et al 2016 sorokin et al 2006 in the pictures of exp 1 and 4 many small individual sub micron sized sulfur particles were visible which is in good agreement with the particle size distribution fig 5a d in exp 1 also large agglomerates 20 µm were present in seemingly low concentration the concentration was likely too low to be visible in the number based particle size distribution in exp 1 and 4 the particles seemed mainly globular rough and smooth and around a size of 1 µm in exp 2 however small sub micron particles were hardly visible fig 5b also in exp 3 not a lot of these particles seemed present at least not as many as in exp 1 and 4 fig 5c larger agglomerated sulfur particles were observed in the pictures of exp 2 and 3 in both experiments large agglomerates were visible of 20 30 µm but also smaller ones of 5 10 µm the center of the agglomerates appeared dark due to the thickness of the sample which could be observed while focusing the microscope no microorganisms were observed attached to the agglomerates as they could easily be distinguished as small black spots of around 1 µm in the sample it is possible that due to mixing during psd measurement the larger aggregates were slightly broken down and thus not measured in addition since the psd is number based the small particles weigh just as heavy in the distribution as the larger ones and there are clearly more small particles than larger ones in terms of numbers however the larger ones were more visible in the microscopy picture from the rough lumpy edges of the agglomerates it was observed that they were composed of many small individual crystals see 1000x magnification pictures for more detail in si fig 2 it is very likely that the addition of the sulfidic reactor also influenced the formation of these agglomerates yet from the light microscopy pictures it became clear that the smallest individual particles were hardly present in exp 2 and only to some extent in exp 3 therefore as a result of the dissolution of the smallest particles and the enhanced agglomeration observed by addition of the sulfidic reactor we measured a larger particle size in the gas lift reactor in mol et al 2021 we elaborated on the agglomeration mechanism the agglomeration is a result of the balance between dissolution and formation of elemental sulfur it is argued that a potential change in biomass composition did not affect the sulfur particle properties we reported the hydraulic retention times hrt of the total reactor set up in si table 1 hereby we assume that the mean cell residence time mcrt is equal to the hrt as the biomass is suspended for example exp 1 and 2 had similar hrts 8 and 12 days and durations 31 and 28 days but the sulfur particle properties were very different in another publication mol et al 2021 we show similar experiments where we followed the relative abundance of species in the reactor and we did not see a large change in composition whereas the properties of the sulfur particles did change within the measured timeframe in another study it was shown that after 73 days of operation the biomass composition did change whereas this change was not yet visible after 19 days de rink et al 2019 3 3 role of polysulfide formation in removal of the smallest particles the removal of the smallest particles in the experiments was likely due to the formation of polysulfides in the sulfidic reactor during the surt sulfur reacted with dissolved bisulfide and an equilibrium is established with polysulfides eq 7 7 h s s 8 h s 9 s 9 2 h 8 s 9 2 h s 2 s 5 2 h the long chain polysulfides can rearrange to shorter polysulfides by reacting with another hs ion eq 8 polysulfides are known to have an autocatalytic effect on the rate of sulfur dissolution in aqueous sulfide solutions hartler et al 1967 kleinjan et al 2005a this means that once polysulfide is formed subsequent formation is accelerated as the polysulfide like the hs ion can also break open the s8 ring and dissolve the elemental sulfur the general formula for polysulfide can be described as sx 2 the chain length x can vary between 2 and 9 but at moderately alkaline conditions chain lengths of 4 5 and 6 are dominant kamyshny et al 2004 roman et al 2014 polysulfides are yellow to orange kamyshny et al 2006 kleinjan et al 2005c by the yellow color of the sulfidic reactor it was deduced that indeed polysulfides were formed si fig 3 the degree to which polysulfide formation takes place in the bd process under halo alkaline conditions is mainly dependent on the amount of available hs and sulfur as well as time under anoxic conditions kleinjan et al 2005a 2005b in the conventional process reactor line up this condition is only met in the absorber often the liquid retention time in the absorber is kept short to ensure proper removal of h2s from the gas by chemical absorption in the mildly alkaline solution thus polysulfide formation takes place only in moderate amounts in the current bd process under halo alkaline conditions roman et al 2014 however polysulfide formation should be stimulated as we hypothesize that its formation dissolves the small non settleable sulfur particles to verify whether our observations fit with known thermodynamic and previously reported kinetic data on polysulfide formation kamyshny et al 2004 kleinjan et al 2005a 2005b we created a mathematical model to assess the obtained data the model inputs were the volume based average psd of the four experiments and the operational conditions under which these particles were produced fig 6 and si table 3 the psd data was not from the experiments in steady state phase but were averages of collected psd data along the course of the experiments from these psds the volume fraction of particles with a diameter 1 µm was calculated by multiplying this volume fraction by the average measured concentration of elemental sulfur in the experiments the total concentration of particles 1 µm was calculated then three outputs were calculated the percentage of s0 that could be converted to sx 2 under the specific conditions from the volume fraction of particles 1 µm the percentage of sx 2 that could be formed out of the maximal sx 2 concentration at equilibrium and the absolute concentration of sx 2 that could be formed fig 7 our modeling results support the experimentally obtained findings that the smallest sulfur particles dissolve in the sulfidic zone due to polysulfide formation to the extent allowed by the conditions equilibrium between sulfur tds and polysulfide was reached for exp 2 3 and 4 fig 7 gray bars from the model calculations it can thus be concluded that a longer surt would not have led to more polysulfide formation for these experiments in the same way it is not expected that a longer surt would lead to more particle dissolution in exp 1 little polysulfide formation was expected due to the short surt which agrees with the large amount of submicron particles found in the corresponding laboratory experiment these particles would have been the ones most prone to react to polysulfide due to their high surface to volume ratio exp 2 was the only experiment in which sulfur particles with a diameter 1 µm were nearly absent in the end product it means that if particles with a diameter 1 µm were formed somewhere in the process they are all dissolved in the sulfidic reactor the model results also supported this finding as 100 of the s0 present in particles 1 µm could be converted to sx 2 as one of the model assumptions is that sulfur was present in excess we calculated under the process conditions of exp 2 the maximum capacity of dissolving sulfur particles while in total 0 93 mg l 1 of particles with a size 1 µm was present in the gas lift reactor 128 mg l 1 of particles could be dissolved when polysulfide concentrations reached equilibrium this is almost 140 times more sulfur which could be dissolved in exp 2 consequently more than 0 93 mg l 1 sulfur dissolved and this probably led to the dissolution of some larger particles hence the model agrees with the experimental data that almost all small particles were dissolved in this experiment although equilibrium is reached in exp 3 and 4 the model predicted that not enough sulfide was present to dissolve all submicron sulfur particles this was also shown with the experimental data as in these experiments submicron particles were still present 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis in addition to experimental validation we performed a model simulation to explore the effects of typical operational parameters on polysulfide formation in the bd process the main factors that we identified to be the most influential on polysulfide formation are 1 sulfidic retention time surt sufficient time in an oxygen free environment is needed to reach the equilibrium between tds sulfur and polysulfide and consequently the maximum achievable polysulfide concentration kleinjan et al 2005a 2 total dissolved sulfide concentration the higher the concentration the more polysulfide can be formed assuming elemental sulfur is in abundance and the faster the equilibrium is reached due to the autocatalytic effect of polysulfide formation hartler et al 1967 in this study the s0 hs ratio was different in each experiment the s0 hs ratios were 1 6 6 7 33 7 and 63 8 for exp 1 4 respectively based on the tds concentration in the sulfidic zone table 1 and elemental sulfur concentration si table 1 however in exp 1 equilibrium was not reached which means that not all of the polysulfide that potentially could be formed under the given ratio indeed was formed 3 particle size the smaller the particles the more rapid the formation of polysulfides is due to the higher specific surface area kleinjan et al 2005a 4 ph the higher the ph the more the equilibrium between total dissolved sulfide and polysulfides shifts towards polysulfides kleinjan et al 2005b van den bosch et al 2008 in our study the ph was kept constant at around 8 5 and therefore it is expected not to have influenced the outcome of this study 5 temperature a higher temperature will lead to more rapid polysulfide formation kamyshny et al 2004 kleinjan et al 2005a however the temperature limit for the bd process is around 40 c above 45 c irreversible thermal inactivation of the sob occurs de rink et al 2020 on the other hand if the temperature is too low i e below 25 c the metabolism of the sob will be reduced such that not enough activity remains to carry out desulfurization adequately in our experiments temperature was kept constant at around 35 c and therefore is not expected to have influence the results as an example we show the simulation of the dependency of two parameters tds and surt on the steady state polysulfides concentration in a cstr under sulfidic conditions assuming all other parameters remain constant fig 8 we choose these parameters as they have most potential for adjustment in the current process during operation the polysulfide concentration in steady state depends proportionally on the tds concentration fig 8a at the highest concentration of tds 4 mm the highest polysulfide concentration is reached close to 1 mm this in turn affects the amount of sulfur that can be dissolved to polysulfide the more sulfur is dissolved the more likely it will be that all poorly settleable particles are dissolved the surt at which polysulfide equilibrium concentrations are reached also strongly depends on the total dissolved sulfide concentration the higher the concentration the quicker the equilibrium is reached fig 8b this pattern does not show a proportional effect in contrast the lower the tds concentration in the sulfidic reactor the exponentially longer it takes to reach equilibrium this can be attributed to the autocatalytic effect of polysulfide formation described earlier for the bd process it can thus be concluded that two variables are the most important for sulfur particle dissolution how much polysulfide will be formed at equilibrium and the rate at which equilibrium is reached the amount of polysulfide that will be formed is mainly dependent on the tds concentration and when equilibrium is not reached surt assuming equal ph and temperature the rate at which equilibrium is reached is mainly influenced by tds assuming equal temperature one would expect a higher formation of thiosulfate due to chemical oxidation of the increased polysulfide concentration however it was shown by de rink et al 2019 that addition of the sulfidic reactor did not lead to extra thiosulfate formation the product selectivity for thiosulfate was only 2 0 the thiosulfate selectivity in our experiments was also not significantly different between experiments and on average below 4 3 in addition avetisyan et al 2021 showed that at ph 8 5 chemically almost no thiosulfate was formed based on these results it is hypothesized that the oxidation of polysulfide is not chemical but biological hence not leading to thiosulfate formation eq 9 9 s x 2 1 2 o 2 h x s 0 o h this reaction also ensures that polysulfide formation itself as shown in eqs 7 and 8 does not lead to an overall acidification and thus is ph neutral 3 4 future research sulfur is a strongly hydrophobic molecular crystal with extremely low solubility 5 µg l 1 boulègue 1978 which makes its crystallization quite complex to study especially in continuous biological reactor systems where local sulfur concentrations may vary as shown in our experiments the polysulfide formation in the sulfidic reactor leads to a substantial amount of sulfur dissolution this means that in the bd process not only sulfur particle formation is important for the particle size distribution but also the particle dissolution however the sulfur which has been dissolved to polysulfides is oxidized again once it reaches the gas lift reactor and thereby sulfur is produced again to understand this process better polysulfide concentration and speciation should be determined during reactor experiments furthermore in relation to polysulfide formation it should be investigated what the boundary conditions are to remove of the smallest sulfur particles and to produce large enough agglomerates for proper settling this could be achieved by experiments varying the s0 hs ratio and surt but modeling work could also help to predict what these boundary conditions would be 4 conclusion in this paper we investigated the effect of the addition of a sulfidic reactor on the properties of sulfur particles formed in the bd process with this novel process design the smallest particles 1 µm were dissolved to polysulfides this almost complete removal of particles only occurred when the surt was long enough to reach polysulfide equilibrium concentration and when tds levels were sufficiently high that enough polysulfide could be formed these results have great implications from an engineering perspective model calculations with thermodynamic and kinetic data on polysulfide formation support the experimental findings the novel line up is thus a promising reactor configuration that allows for improved sulfur recovery due to the removal of the smallest sulfur particles annemerel mol reports financial support was provided by paqell bv

15299,for over 30 years biological gas desulfurization under halo alkaline conditions has been studied and optimized this technology is currently applied in already 270 commercial installations worldwide sulfur particle separation however remains a challenge a fraction of sulfur particles is often too small for liquid solid separation with conventional separation technology in this article we report the effects of a novel sulfidic reactor inserted in the conventional process set up on sulfur particle size and morphology in the sulfidic reactor polysulfide is produced by the reaction of elemental sulfur particles and sulfide which is again converted to elemental sulfur in a gas lift reactor we analyzed sulfur particles produced in continuous long term lab scale reactor experiments under various sulfide concentrations and sulfidic retention times the analyses were performed with laser diffraction particle size analysis and light microscopy these show that the smallest particles 1 µm have mostly disappeared under the highest sulfide concentration 4 1 mm and sulfidic retention time 45 min under these conditions also agglomeration of sulfur particles was promoted model calculations with thermodynamic and previously derived kinetic data on polysulfide formation confirm the experimental data on the removal of the smallest particles under the highest sulfidic pressure the model predicts that equilibrium conditions are reached between sulfur sulfide and polysulfide and that 100 of the sulfur particles 1 µm are dissolved by the autocatalytic formation of polysulfides these experiments and modeling results demonstrate that the insertion of a novel sulfidic reactor in the conventional process set up promotes the removal of the smallest individual sulfur particles and promotes the production of sulfur agglomerates the novel sulfidic reactor is therefore a promising process addition with the potential to improve process operation sulfur separation and sulfur recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological desulfurization elemental sulfur particle size polysulfide sulfide data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sulfur is the 10th most abundant element in the universe and plays a vital role in the earth s ecosystem through the bio chemical sulfur cycle palme et al 2014 the element can be present in various oxidation states from sulfide s2 being the most reduced state 2 to sulfate so4 2 being the most oxidized state 6 elemental sulfur s with an oxidation state of zero can be recovered from bio gas streams using biological desulfurization bd sulfur is present in this bio gas as toxic and corrosive h2s by removing h2s corrosion of pipes toxicity to humans and the ecosystem and the generation of acid rain are prevented guidotti 2010 likens and bormann 1974 pope et al 2007 smith et al 2011 main advantages of bd in comparison with chemical and physical alternatives are operation at ambient pressure and temperature and without toxic chemicals cline et al 2003 van den bosch et al 2007 in bd under halo alkaline conditions h2s present in sour gas gas with substantial amounts of h2s is absorbed in a moderately alkaline solution reacts to soluble bisulfide and is subsequently oxidized in a gas lift reactor by a mixed culture of sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob to elemental sulfur eq 1 1 h s 1 2 o 2 s 0 o h at ambient temperatures and pressures elemental sulfur exists in rings and polymeric chains of different sizes sn in bd under halo alkaline conditions eight s0 atoms form a ring s8 and crystallize to the most stable configuration in aqueous systems which is orthorhombic α s8 mol et al 2020 next to formation of elemental sulfur oxidized by products such as sulfate and thiosulfate are formed due to overexposure to dissolved oxygen sulfate is formed biologically while thiosulfate is formed abiotically these compounds are undesirable as they lead to acidification and consequently addition of chemicals is needed to neutralize the process solution moreover elemental sulfur is the preferred s species as it is stable easy to separate transport store and re use due to its solid properties biologically produced sulfur is known to have hydrophilic properties which makes it more suitable for applications in water in comparison with chemically produced sulfur janssen et al 2009 in this study we further refer to elemental sulfur as sulfur describing the solid elemental material although bd under halo alkaline conditions has been intensively studied and is already largely applied on a commercial scale 270 installations worldwide in 2017 buisman et al 1990 de rink et al 2019 janssen et al 1999 kiragosyan et al 2019 klok et al 2017 2013 2012 van den bosch et al 2007 the sulfur settleability is still a major challenge in recent years the scale of bd installations has increased due to their application for natural gas desulfurization this trend makes certain operational parameters such as sulfur separation even more important even though sulfur separation in larger installations often happens with a decanter centrifuge or hydrocyclone a concentration step of the reactor suspension before entering the centrifuge is still beneficial for operation of the centrifuge for smaller installations a centrifuge is often not economically viable so sulfur separation relies solely on the settleability of the sulfur particles due to the lack of control over sulfur particle properties such as size and morphology the sulfur particles sometimes settle poorly in this study we use the term particle as an umbrella term including colloids crystals intergrown crystals aggregates agglomerates etc unless otherwise specified in this case a particle is any shape the elemental sulfur can take as long as in a sedimentation context it settles as one unit differences in settleability between various industrial reactors were found in an earlier study mol et al 2020 in this earlier study we described that small non settling sulfur particles with a median diameter of 0 3 µm could account for at least 13 6 of the total number of particles additionally it was reported that in industrial bd installations settleability of the produced sulfur can fluctuate over time l feenstra industriewater eerbeek personal communication 7 september 2021 poorly settleable sulfur may lead to hampered process operation as it accumulates in the system accumulated sulfur can cause clogging of pumps and pipes and under high concentrations foaming as well kleinjan et al 2006 moreover small sulfur particles are more prone to side reactions such as oxidation due to their larger relative surface area another reason why sulfur needs to be recovered effectively is that sulfur as raw material is expected to become more important in the future not only is sulfur an essential nutrient for agriculture but there is also an emerging market for sulfur in other applications such as capacity cathode material in rechargeable batteries advanced materials metal bioleaching or as electron donor in autotrophic denitrification di capua et al 2016 eriksen et al 2004 florentino et al 2015 lim et al 2015 roig et al 2004 seidel et al 2006 soares 2002 ucar et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 therefore it is relevant to improve sulfur recovery sulfur particle recovery is a challenge as a solution we propose a new process design to remove the smallest particles 1 µm from the reactor liquid this new design was used in two earlier studies but with a different experimental purpose de rink et al 2019 kiragosyan et al 2020 the design consists of a sulfidic reactor in which the smallest sulfur particles are dissolved to polysulfides by a reaction with sulfide the formed polysulfides can then again be biologically oxidized to elemental sulfur upon exposure to oxygen in the gas lift reactor the sulfidic reactor is placed between the absorber and the gas lift reactor and the reactor content buffered medium sob sulfur particles dissolved sulfur species is continuously circulated over all reactor compartments of the set up the retention time in the absorber and sulfidic reactor can be called sulfidic retention time surt surt is defined as the amount of time the reactor content is retained under sulfidic anoxic conditions before being pumped to the gas lift reactor in this study we have investigated the effect of various total dissolved sulfide tds concentrations and surts on the presence of sulfur particles with a diameter 1 µm in the solution this was tested by long term continuous lab scale bioreactor experiments the results were validated with a model based on physical and chemical laws describing the effect of tds concentration and surt on polysulfide formation rates and particle dissolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a lab scale reactor set up was used with an absorber a and gas lift reactor c fig 1 for extended configuration two additional reactor compartments were added a sulfidic reactor b between the absorber and the gas lift reactor and a settler d after the gas lift reactor reactor a had a height of 27 cm and an inner diameter of 4 5 cm reactor b had a height of 75 cm and inner diameter of 12 5 cm reactor c had a height of 85 cm and inner diameter of 12 5 cm and reactor d had a height of 55 cm and upper inner diameter of 10 cm and bottom inner diameter of 3 2 cm reactor a was not stirred but mixed by the liquid in and outflows reactor b was mechanically stirred with a stainless steel stirrer reactor c was a gas lift reactor which was stirred by the downer riser flows created by the introduction of gas in the bottom of the reactor the inner column was 8 cm in diameter and had a height of 44 5 cm reactor d was not stirred the sulfidic reactor is a zone with retention time of reactor content buffered medium sob sulfur particles dissolved sulfur species under anoxic poly sulfidic pressure the absorber by itself is also a small sulfidic zone the liquid volumes of the set ups with and without the sulfidic reactor were 9 1 and 5 6 l respectively both with settler without settler but with sulfidic reactor the wet volume was 7 6 l the volume of the gas lift reactor was 3 7 l the gas flow was recycled over the headspace of gas lift reactor with a vacuum pump to prevent any release of the h2s gas and to reach low oxygen concentrations the gas was introduced with a porous stone to the bottom of the inner column of the gas lift reactor to ensure proper oxygen transfer and mixing pure h2s gas and oxygen were supplied by mass flow controllers brooks 5850e series 0 100 nml min and 0 20 nml min for oxygen and h2s during the experiment with the middle and lowest h2s loading brooks instrument llc hatfield usa in case of pressure build up excess gas was discharged via a water lock saturated with zinc acetate to capture any potentially present h2s the reactors were operated at 35 c using a thermostat bath and climate controlled cabinet 2 2 medium composition the medium consisted of a buffer with 6 6 g l 1 na2co3 and 69 3 g l 1 nahco3 in demineralized water at ph 8 5 fresh buffer was supplied at a constant flow to maintain enough alkalinity in the system furthermore a nutrient stock was supplied for biological growth containing in g per 1 l of demineralized water k2hpo4 0 1 mgcl2 6h2o 0 0203 nacl 0 6 ch4n2o 0 06 and 2 ml l 1 trace element solution as in pfenning and lippert pfennig and lippert 1966 2 3 experimental operation the experiments carried out with the various conditions are numbered exp 1 4 an overview of the operational conditions per experiment is provided in table 1 a settler was included for the experiments with the highest h2s loading rate to prevent sulfur accumulation in the system i e to avoid operational issues such as foaming and clogging due to sulfur build up experiments with lower h2s loading rate were conducted without the settler to collect a sample in which all particles that were produced under the specific experimental conditions were present without removing any particles with the settler we assume that the removal of the largest settling particles does not impact the presence of the smallest particles in the process solution the latter is studied in this paper reactors were filled with medium and inoculated in all experiments the set up was operated in continuous mode without interruption throughout all experiments the h2s supply was kept constant for that experiment the h2s load was used to set the tds concentration in the sulfidic reactor to keep the conversion efficiency from sulfide to sulfur high the oxidation reduction potential orp was set at 360 mv vs ag agcl which is a representative set point for industrial reactors the orp set point was controlled by a proportional integral pi controller the pi controller regulated the oxygen supply rate samples well mixed reactor content with sulfur particles medium and microorganisms were taken for analysis at a sampling port in the middle of the sulfidic reactor exp 3 4 and the gas lift reactor all experiments the sampling tubes from the reactor were flushed three times prior to sampling to obtain a representative sample 2 4 inoculum exp 1 was inoculated with centrifuged microorganisms to remove excess sulfur from a lab scale sulfur producing gas lift bioreactor operated under continuous conditions like the conditions applied in this experiment the original inoculum of this reactor was obtained from a well characterized industrial scale bd facility under halo alkaline conditions of industriewater eerbeek b v eerbeek the netherlands hereafter referred to as eerbeek janssen et al 2009 to remove the sulfur the reactor content was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 min firlabo froilabo paris france a pellet was formed with two layers a bottom layer of elemental sulfur and a layer with microorganisms on top the layer with microorganisms was carefully washed off exp 4 was inoculated with centrifuged microorganisms directly taken from eerbeek exp 2 and 3 were inoculated with microorganism rich process solution from exp 1 and 4 as described in table 1 2 5 analysis reactors were equipped with sensors for temperature and orp triple junction platinum rod glass electrode equipped with an internal ag agcl reference electrode prosense oosterhout the netherlands methods to measure sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations sulfur particle size distribution psd alkalinity conductivity ph and total sulfur concentration were previously described elsewhere mol et al 2020 psd can be expressed both volumetrically and numerically in a volumetric based particle size distribution larger particles have a heavier weight as due to their size they often comprise a larger percentage of the total solid volume in a numeric based distribution each particle has an equal weight independent of the particle size according to common practice when a psd had to be represented by a single value the median d50 of the psd was reported to show the particle size development over time the median has a better way of representing the central location of the data in a non normal distribution than the mean and is relatively unaffected by outliers field 2009 the microorganism concentration was measured as the amount of total nitrogen as in de rink et al 2019 this method is based on the absorbance of nitrophenol at 345 nm and performed with the tntplus 826 persulfate digestion method hach company loveland colorado united states presence of biologically produced sulfur did not affect the measured nitrogen concentration van den bosch et al 2007 analysis of sulfur particles with light microscopy was performed according to mol et al 2020 process selectivity for elemental sulfur was calculated by the mass balance based on h2s supply and the measurement of dissolved sulfur products formed de rink et al 2019 in our study when the term hs is used we refer to the sum of tds h2s hs and s2 as most of the dissolved sulfide is present as hs at ph 8 5 operational reactor data can be found in si table 1 2 6 mathematical model a mathematical model of a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr was developed to simulate the polysulfide formation in the sulfidic zone of the experimental setup it is assumed that this zone is ideally mixed i e ph and temperature are constant the mass balances in terms of a set of differential equations are given by 2 d c s d t q v c s i n c s x 1 r s x 3 d c s x d t q v c s x r s x 4 d c h s d t q v c h s i n c h s r s x whereby c s is the concentration of sulfur present in small sulfur particles in the sulfidic zone fig 1 reactor b mol s l 1 c s i n the concentration of sulfur present

concentration of polysulfide mol l 1 c h s the concentration of tds in the sulfidic zone and c h s i n the concentration of tds in the feed of the sulfidic zone mol s l 1 the term 1 in eq 2 represents the s that originates from hs in the reaction with elemental sulfur or polysulfide and thus does not contribute to the mass balance of zero valent elemental sulfur while polysulfide formation is known to be a sequence of reaction steps after which long chain polysulfides s9 2 can rearrange to shorter chain length we assume for the sake of simplicity that all polysulfides that are formed have an average chain length x which is calculated based on the thermodynamic expressions by kamyshny et al 2004 the calculated value of x for the experimental conditions is 5 05 which is in agreement with reported measurements under similar conditions by roman et al i e 5 17 and 5 18 2014 the polysulfide formation rate is generally described by both uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions slightly adjusted

zero a list with parameters is provided in the supplementary information si table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle size four long term 16 41 days continuous lab scale reactor experiments were performed at different tds concentrations and surts i e using an additional sulfidic process step sulfide was successfully converted to elemental sulfur under all four applied conditions leading to the presence of sulfur particles in the reactor solution operational reactor performance data on parameters such as product formation bacteria concentration etc can be found in si table 1 particle size distributions psd of sulfur particle samples at the end of each experiment taken from the gas lift reactor during the experiments are shown in fig 2 in general the number based particle size distributions ranged from 0 1 to 50 µm this is a typical size distribution for biologically formed sulfur particles in these types of systems janssen et al 1996 kleinjan et al 2005a leerdam et al 2011 li et al 2020 mol et al 2020 mu et al 2021 roman 2016 the particles had a unimodal distribution except for exp 3 where the distribution had a bimodal tendency the particles from exp 1 had a median particle size of 0 6 µm the particles from exp 2 are considerably larger with a median diameter of 3 8 µm from previous work it is known that the peak of exp 2 likely belongs to sulfur agglomerates and the peaks of exp 1 3 and 4 to single particles or a mix thereof mol et al 2020 for the samples from exp 3 and 4 the median particle sizes were 0 9 and 0 7 µm respectively fig 3 provides an overview of the median particle diameters of particles from all four experiments over time as the range on the y axis does not allow for details to be visible for exp 1 3 and 4 the same data can be found in si fig 1 with a y axis range of 0 2 µm the conditions in exp 2 were found to be optimal for the removal of the smallest particles in this experiment the tds concentration was relatively high in the sulfidic reactor 4 4 mm and surt was the longest of all experiments 45 0 min this combination of high tds concertation and long surt lead to high sulfidic pressure during the entire experiment exp 2 is dominated by larger particles 3 5 1 9 µm whereas the particles from the other experiments are considerably smaller in exp 2 submicron 1 µm particles have almost completely disappeared a likely explanation is that they have reacted to polysulfides at higher tds concentration 8 3 mm but much shorter surt 4 8 min the particles had an average median diameter of 0 3 0 2 µm exp 1 at a moderate tds concentration 1 9 mm but with similar surt as exp 2 the median particle diameter was 0 5 0 2 µm exp 3 the median particle diameter of exp 3 is thus also smaller than the median particle diameter of exp 2 interestingly the particles in exp 3 seemed to grow towards the end of the experiment fig 4 at day 13 an elbow shaped peak appears after 1 µm and the peak below 1 µm shifts to the right and becomes smaller this shows that small particles are disappearing however at day 10 the particle size on average again became smaller a peak appeared at 50 100 nm in one of the triplicate measurements possibly the particles causing this peak were freshly formed sulfur nuclei perhaps they were only present in smaller amounts and therefore were not measured on other psds such as on day 3 on the last day day 16 the median particle diameter was 0 9 µm this final median particle diameter is considerably larger than average median particle diameter of exp 3 the hydraulic retention time hrt in exp 3 was 25 days and as the set up used in exp 3 did not have a settler the hrt was assumed to be equal to the retention time of particles in the set up the slow dynamics of the behavior of particle size along time in exp 3 were due to this long hrt and relatively low sulfide loading rate interestingly in exp 4 which has a similar hrt of 23 days no growth at all was observed likely due to the even lower sulfide loading rate in addition in the gas lift reactor the particles were significantly larger than in the sulfidic reactor towards the end of the experiment see si fig 1 for a figure with smaller range on y axis this is likely due to the partial breakdown of particles in the sulfidic reactor which are then rebuilt due to new sulfur formation by poly sulfide oxidation in the gas lift reactor in mol et al 2021 2022 the agglomeration process was studied in more detail it was shown that the agglomerates are shaped through a balance between build up by freshly formed particles and breakdown of particles to polysulfide for exp 4 at the lowest tds concentration 1 0 mm the particle size remained stable throughout the experiment with a median diameter of 0 5 0 1 µm probably because the hs concentration was limiting the dissolution of sulfur evidently the addition of a sulfidic reactor leads to the removal of the smallest submicron particles if the tds concentration is sufficiently high it seems that exp 3 was operated at boundary conditions as we observe just a slight effect on particle size and only at the end of the experiment 3 2 particle size and morphology analysis with light microscopy the sulfur particles formed under the various experimental conditions had distinctively different morphologies as observed with light microscopy fig 5 sulfur particles were distinguished in the light microscopy pictures as light radiant particles single particles or darker patches with light radiant edges agglomerated particles the black spots in the background were microorganisms as they showed movement and on occasion a dividing black spot was observed furthermore the appearance of sob is similar in light microscopy pictures in other publications marnocha et al 2016 sorokin et al 2006 in the pictures of exp 1 and 4 many small individual sub micron sized sulfur particles were visible which is in good agreement with the particle size distribution fig 5a d in exp 1 also large agglomerates 20 µm were present in seemingly low concentration the concentration was likely too low to be visible in the number based particle size distribution in exp 1 and 4 the particles seemed mainly globular rough and smooth and around a size of 1 µm in exp 2 however small sub micron particles were hardly visible fig 5b also in exp 3 not a lot of these particles seemed present at least not as many as in exp 1 and 4 fig 5c larger agglomerated sulfur particles were observed in the pictures of exp 2 and 3 in both experiments large agglomerates were visible of 20 30 µm but also smaller ones of 5 10 µm the center of the agglomerates appeared dark due to the thickness of the sample which could be observed while focusing the microscope no microorganisms were observed attached to the agglomerates as they could easily be distinguished as small black spots of around 1 µm in the sample it is possible that due to mixing during psd measurement the larger aggregates were slightly broken down and thus not measured in addition since the psd is number based the small particles weigh just as heavy in the distribution as the larger ones and there are clearly more small particles than larger ones in terms of numbers however the larger ones were more visible in the microscopy picture from the rough lumpy edges of the agglomerates it was observed that they were composed of many small individual crystals see 1000x magnification pictures for more detail in si fig 2 it is very likely that the addition of the sulfidic reactor also influenced the formation of these agglomerates yet from the light microscopy pictures it became clear that the smallest individual particles were hardly present in exp 2 and only to some extent in exp 3 therefore as a result of the dissolution of the smallest particles and the enhanced agglomeration observed by addition of the sulfidic reactor we measured a larger particle size in the gas lift reactor in mol et al 2021 we elaborated on the agglomeration mechanism the agglomeration is a result of the balance between dissolution and formation of elemental sulfur it is argued that a potential change in biomass composition did not affect the sulfur particle properties we reported the hydraulic retention times hrt of the total reactor set up in si table 1 hereby we assume that the mean cell residence time mcrt is equal to the hrt as the biomass is suspended for example exp 1 and 2 had similar hrts 8 and 12 days and durations 31 and 28 days but the sulfur particle properties were very different in another publication mol et al 2021 we show similar experiments where we followed the relative abundance of species in the reactor and we did not see a large change in composition whereas the properties of the sulfur particles did change within the measured timeframe in another study it was shown that after 73 days of operation the biomass composition did change whereas this change was not yet visible after 19 days de rink et al 2019 3 3 role of polysulfide formation in removal of the smallest particles the removal of the smallest particles in the experiments was likely due to the formation of polysulfides in the sulfidic reactor during the surt sulfur reacted with dissolved bisulfide and an equilibrium is established with polysulfides eq 7 7 h s s 8 h s 9 s 9 2 h 8 s 9 2 h s 2 s 5 2 h the long chain polysulfides can rearrange to shorter polysulfides by reacting with another hs ion eq 8 polysulfides are known to have an autocatalytic effect on the rate of sulfur dissolution in aqueous sulfide solutions hartler et al 1967 kleinjan et al 2005a this means that once polysulfide is formed subsequent formation is accelerated as the polysulfide like the hs ion can also break open the s8 ring and dissolve the elemental sulfur the general formula for polysulfide can be described as sx 2 the chain length x can vary between 2 and 9 but at moderately alkaline conditions chain lengths of 4 5 and 6 are dominant kamyshny et al 2004 roman et al 2014 polysulfides are yellow to orange kamyshny et al 2006 kleinjan et al 2005c by the yellow color of the sulfidic reactor it was deduced that indeed polysulfides were formed si fig 3 the degree to which polysulfide formation takes place in the bd process under halo alkaline conditions is mainly dependent on the amount of available hs and sulfur as well as time under anoxic conditions kleinjan et al 2005a 2005b in the conventional process reactor line up this condition is only met in the absorber often the liquid retention time in the absorber is kept short to ensure proper removal of h2s from the gas by chemical absorption in the mildly alkaline solution thus polysulfide formation takes place only in moderate amounts in the current bd process under halo alkaline conditions roman et al 2014 however polysulfide formation should be stimulated as we hypothesize that its formation dissolves the small non settleable sulfur particles to verify whether our observations fit with known thermodynamic and previously reported kinetic data on polysulfide formation kamyshny et al 2004 kleinjan et al 2005a 2005b we created a mathematical model to assess the obtained data the model inputs were the volume based average psd of the four experiments and the operational conditions under which these particles were produced fig 6 and si table 3 the psd data was not from the experiments in steady state phase but were averages of collected psd data along the course of the experiments from these psds the volume fraction of particles with a diameter 1 µm was calculated by multiplying this volume fraction by the average measured concentration of elemental sulfur in the experiments the total concentration of particles 1 µm was calculated then three outputs were calculated the percentage of s0 that could be converted to sx 2 under the specific conditions from the volume fraction of particles 1 µm the percentage of sx 2 that could be formed out of the maximal sx 2 concentration at equilibrium and the absolute concentration of sx 2 that could be formed fig 7 our modeling results support the experimentally obtained findings that the smallest sulfur particles dissolve in the sulfidic zone due to polysulfide formation to the extent allowed by the conditions equilibrium between sulfur tds and polysulfide was reached for exp 2 3 and 4 fig 7 gray bars from the model calculations it can thus be concluded that a longer surt would not have led to more polysulfide formation for these experiments in the same way it is not expected that a longer surt would lead to more particle dissolution in exp 1 little polysulfide formation was expected due to the short surt which agrees with the large amount of submicron particles found in the corresponding laboratory experiment these particles would have been the ones most prone to react to polysulfide due to their high surface to volume ratio exp 2 was the only experiment in which sulfur particles with a diameter 1 µm were nearly absent in the end product it means that if particles with a diameter 1 µm were formed somewhere in the process they are all dissolved in the sulfidic reactor the model results also supported this finding as 100 of the s0 present in particles 1 µm could be converted to sx 2 as one of the model assumptions is that sulfur was present in excess we calculated under the process conditions of exp 2 the maximum capacity of dissolving sulfur particles while in total 0 93 mg l 1 of particles with a size 1 µm was present in the gas lift reactor 128 mg l 1 of particles could be dissolved when polysulfide concentrations reached equilibrium this is almost 140 times more sulfur which could be dissolved in exp 2 consequently more than 0 93 mg l 1 sulfur dissolved and this probably led to the dissolution of some larger particles hence the model agrees with the experimental data that almost all small particles were dissolved in this experiment although equilibrium is reached in exp 3 and 4 the model predicted that not enough sulfide was present to dissolve all submicron sulfur particles this was also shown with the experimental data as in these experiments submicron particles were still present 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis in addition to experimental validation we performed a model simulation to explore the effects of typical operational parameters on polysulfide formation in the bd process the main factors that we identified to be the most influential on polysulfide formation are 1 sulfidic retention time surt sufficient time in an oxygen free environment is needed to reach the equilibrium between tds sulfur and polysulfide and consequently the maximum achievable polysulfide concentration kleinjan et al 2005a 2 total dissolved sulfide concentration the higher the concentration the more polysulfide can be formed assuming elemental sulfur is in abundance and the faster the equilibrium is reached due to the autocatalytic effect of polysulfide formation hartler et al 1967 in this study the s0 hs ratio was different in each experiment the s0 hs ratios were 1 6 6 7 33 7 and 63 8 for exp 1 4 respectively based on the tds concentration in the sulfidic zone table 1 and elemental sulfur concentration si table 1 however in exp 1 equilibrium was not reached which means that not all of the polysulfide that potentially could be formed under the given ratio indeed was formed 3 particle size the smaller the particles the more rapid the formation of polysulfides is due to the higher specific surface area kleinjan et al 2005a 4 ph the higher the ph the more the equilibrium between total dissolved sulfide and polysulfides shifts towards polysulfides kleinjan et al 2005b van den bosch et al 2008 in our study the ph was kept constant at around 8 5 and therefore it is expected not to have influenced the outcome of this study 5 temperature a higher temperature will lead to more rapid polysulfide formation kamyshny et al 2004 kleinjan et al 2005a however the temperature limit for the bd process is around 40 c above 45 c irreversible thermal inactivation of the sob occurs de rink et al 2020 on the other hand if the temperature is too low i e below 25 c the metabolism of the sob will be reduced such that not enough activity remains to carry out desulfurization adequately in our experiments temperature was kept constant at around 35 c and therefore is not expected to have influence the results as an example we show the simulation of the dependency of two parameters tds and surt on the steady state polysulfides concentration in a cstr under sulfidic conditions assuming all other parameters remain constant fig 8 we choose these parameters as they have most potential for adjustment in the current process during operation the polysulfide concentration in steady state depends proportionally on the tds concentration fig 8a at the highest concentration of tds 4 mm the highest polysulfide concentration is reached close to 1 mm this in turn affects the amount of sulfur that can be dissolved to polysulfide the more sulfur is dissolved the more likely it will be that all poorly settleable particles are dissolved the surt at which polysulfide equilibrium concentrations are reached also strongly depends on the total dissolved sulfide concentration the higher the concentration the quicker the equilibrium is reached fig 8b this pattern does not show a proportional effect in contrast the lower the tds concentration in the sulfidic reactor the exponentially longer it takes to reach equilibrium this can be attributed to the autocatalytic effect of polysulfide formation described earlier for the bd process it can thus be concluded that two variables are the most important for sulfur particle dissolution how much polysulfide will be formed at equilibrium and the rate at which equilibrium is reached the amount of polysulfide that will be formed is mainly dependent on the tds concentration and when equilibrium is not reached surt assuming equal ph and temperature the rate at which equilibrium is reached is mainly influenced by tds assuming equal temperature one would expect a higher formation of thiosulfate due to chemical oxidation of the increased polysulfide concentration however it was shown by de rink et al 2019 that addition of the sulfidic reactor did not lead to extra thiosulfate formation the product selectivity for thiosulfate was only 2 0 the thiosulfate selectivity in our experiments was also not significantly different between experiments and on average below 4 3 in addition avetisyan et al 2021 showed that at ph 8 5 chemically almost no thiosulfate was formed based on these results it is hypothesized that the oxidation of polysulfide is not chemical but biological hence not leading to thiosulfate formation eq 9 9 s x 2 1 2 o 2 h x s 0 o h this reaction also ensures that polysulfide formation itself as shown in eqs 7 and 8 does not lead to an overall acidification and thus is ph neutral 3 4 future research sulfur is a strongly hydrophobic molecular crystal with extremely low solubility 5 µg l 1 boulègue 1978 which makes its crystallization quite complex to study especially in continuous biological reactor systems where local sulfur concentrations may vary as shown in our experiments the polysulfide formation in the sulfidic reactor leads to a substantial amount of sulfur dissolution this means that in the bd process not only sulfur particle formation is important for the particle size distribution but also the particle dissolution however the sulfur which has been dissolved to polysulfides is oxidized again once it reaches the gas lift reactor and thereby sulfur is produced again to understand this process better polysulfide concentration and speciation should be determined during reactor experiments furthermore in relation to polysulfide formation it should be investigated what the boundary conditions are to remove of the smallest sulfur particles and to produce large enough agglomerates for proper settling this could be achieved by experiments varying the s0 hs ratio and surt but modeling work could also help to predict what these boundary conditions would be 4 conclusion in this paper we investigated the effect of the addition of a sulfidic reactor on the properties of sulfur particles formed in the bd process with this novel process design the smallest particles 1 µm were dissolved to polysulfides this almost complete removal of particles only occurred when the surt was long enough to reach polysulfide equilibrium concentration and when tds levels were sufficiently high that enough polysulfide could be formed these results have great implications from an engineering perspective model calculations with thermodynamic and kinetic data on polysulfide formation support the experimental findings the novel line up is thus a promising reactor configuration that allows for improved sulfur recovery due to the removal of the smallest sulfur particles annemerel mol reports financial support was provided by paqell bv
