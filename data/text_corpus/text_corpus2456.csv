experimental set up the experiments were conducted using a flat sheet cross flow module as illustrated in fig 3 the experimental setup was operated as a closed circuit system with a feed water tank containing 50 l of solution to avoid heat exchange with the environment the feed tank was wrapped with heat insulation material aluminum foil air bubble heat insulation sheet prior to the start of the experiments overhead stirrers heidolph rzr 2020 heidolph instruments gmbh co germany were utilized for a period of 4 h to guarantee the homogeneity of the solution during this time the solution was heated to the desired temperature 25 c or 50 c the temperature of the solution was controlled by a recirculating thermostatic bath tc 16 tamson instruments b v nl which was connected to a heat exchanger coil submerged in the solution after this stage the feed water was pumped using a rotary vane positive displacement pump fluid o tech s r l italy from the tank into stainless steel plates containing the nf membrane the active area of the rectangular flat sheet nf membrane inside the metallic plates was 0 25 m2 the solution was filtered through the membrane for two hours to achieve stabilization of the rejection and to reach thermal equilibrium between the solution and flat sheet cross flow module at the end of the preliminary filtration cycle the rejection experiments began the pressure in the feed permeate and concentrate line was monitored with a pressure gauge en 837 1 econosto nl sampling of the feed permeate and concentrate was performed at both the middle and the end of each filtration cycle 2 2 nf membranes and solutions two commercially available nf polyamide membranes were used the specifications given by the respective manufacturers indicate that dow nf270 dow filmtec has a molecular weight cut off mwco ranging between 200 and 400 da and a recommended maximum operating temperature of 45 c nevertheless due the relatively short duration of the experiment we decided to exceed the maximum recommended temperature the second membrane from alfa laval nf alfa laval has a mwco of 300 da and a maximum operating temperature of 55 c in general polyamide membranes are negatively charged for the tested ph range between 6 and 8 bellona and drewes 2005 boussu et al 2006 childress and elimelech 2000 nguyen et al 2009 a standard stock solution of 1 g l of as v was prepared using na2haso47h2o sigma aldrich dissolved in deionized water and acidified ph 3 using 1 6 m hcl sigma aldrich the solution used in all as v rejection experiments was kept in an aluminum foil covered glass container and refrigerated 5 8 c the individual salt rejection experiments were carried out with monovalent nacl vwr chemical and divalent na2so4 sigma aldrich salts to obtain the desired as v concentration of 300 μg l 0 004 mm h2aso4 haso4 2 the stock solution was diluted in demineralized water to ensure the buffering capacity of the water matrix nahco3 sigma aldrich was dosed according to the requirements of the experiments 1 6 m hcl sigma aldrich or 0 1 m naoh sigma aldrich was employed for ph adjustment 2 3 effect of temperature on mwco the determination of mwco for dow nf270 and alfa laval membranes was carried out at 25 c and 50 c the solution used for the determination of mwco was prepared using ethylene glycol 62 g mol and different polyethylene glycols pegs with molecular weights ranging from 200 to 1000 g mol sigma aldrich the experiments were performed at constant flux 30 l m2 h and a recovery of 15 samples of the feed permeate and concentrate were taken every 3 h mwco was measured by filtering the ethylene glycol pegs mixture and measuring the rejection with hplc gpc shimadzu with ri detection 2 4 transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature using demineralized water as feed solution the relation between transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature 25 c and 50 c was determined for dow nf270 and alfa laval demineralized water was used as feed solution the experiments were conducted at constant flux 40 l m2 h a cross flow velocity of 0 15 m s and a recovery of 10 2 5 nf rejection experiments table 1 provides an overview of the experimental settings membranes tested and the water composition used for the nf rejection experiments the rejection experiments were conducted at constant flux 40 l m2 h a cross flow velocity of 0 15 m s and a recovery of 10 all experiments were performed in duplicate and executed at both 25 c or 50 c 2 5 1 rejection of cl and so4 2 single solutions of monovalent nacl and divalent na2so4 salts were used to determine the individual rejection of cl and so4 2 the ionic strengths of the solutions were 1 mm for nacl and 3 mm for na2so4 dow nf270 and alfa laval were used for these experiments 2 5 2 rejection of monovalent h2aso4 and divalent haso4 2 species in the presence of nahco3 rejection of h2aso4 and haso4 2 was evaluated by maintaining constant temperature 25 c or 50 c and varying the ph ph 8 7 and 6 of the feed water samples were was collected over 5 h of operation for each evaluated ph value for each temperature a series of three 5 h runs was executed with the starting solution adjusted to ph 8 0 1 m naoh and then corrected to ph 7 and ph 6 in the 2nd and 3rd run using hcl 1 62 m dow nf270 and alfa laval nf were used for these experiments 2 6 analysis of samples temperature ph and electrical conductivity of the feed water were measured using a multimeter wtw gmbh germany for the single solute rejection experiments of cl and so4 2 conductivity measurements of the feed and permeate were used to determine the rejection of both anions the conductivity of the samples of the experiments carried out at 50 c was automatically converted into an equivalent conductivity at 25 c for the rejection experiments of h2aso4 haso4 2 the concentrations of hco3 and cl were determined using titrimetric 702 sm titrino metrohm and ion chromatography analysis ic 883 basic plus metrohm respectively for the analysis of as v the samples from the feed permeate and concentrate were acidified using 1 7 ml of hno3 22 per 330 ml of sample the concentration of as v in the samples was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo xseries ll thermo fisher scientific the method is equivalent to nen en iso 172941 2 and can be applied to drinking surface process and groundwater 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature on mwco fig 4 summarizes the effect of temperature increase on mwco for dow nf270 and alfa laval an increase of 39 from 231 da to 322 da and 20 from 217 da to 260 da in mwco was observed for dow nf270 and alfa laval nf respectively as a result of temperature increase from 25 c to 50 c the larger increase in mwco was found for dow nf270 compared to alfa laval nf the suggestion that pore size of the nf membranes is larger at 50 c agrees with earlier findings that for mono component solutions rejection is lower at higher temperatures 3 2 transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature using demineralized water as feed solution the relation between temperature 25 c and 50 c and tmp is depicted in fig 5 for a constant flux of 40 l m2h temperature and pressure had an inverse relationship i e an increase in temperature resulted in a lower transmembrane pressure for both membranes the transmembrane pressure at 50 c was approximately 50 of the transmembrane pressure at 25 c for both temperatures dow nf270 needed lower transmembrane pressures than alfa laval nf to produce the same flux the low operating pressure required by dow nf270 at 50 c 15 mwc in combination with the elevated topography found in nicaragua s volcanic region may make it feasible to operate the system without a pump i e gravity fed nf system for both membranes the reduction in transmembrane pressure could be associated to both the decrease in water viscosity and the expansion of the effective pore diameter due to increased temperature the difference between the two tested membranes could be associated with their different physical properties i e pore size thickness tortuosity 3 3 rejection of cl and so4 2 fig 6 depicts the single solute rejection of cl left and so4 2 right at 25 c and 50 c the rejection of cl monovalent ion was lower compared to so4 2 divalent ion at both temperatures this order in rejection was valid for both nf membranes and is in line with expectations for negatively charged nf membranes peeters et al 1998 a considerable decrease in rejection was noted for the monovalent anion cl as a consequence of the temperature increase 26 for dow nf270 and 68 for alfa laval nf on the other hand the rejection of the divalent anion so4 2 was found to be less sensitive to temperature changes with the temperature increase from 25 c to 50 c the reduction of cl rejection can be ascribed to changes in its thermodynamic and physical properties e g increase in diffusivity decreases in hydration free energy and hydrated radius as well as to the diminishing size exclusion mechanism due to thermal expansion of the pore sharma et al 2003 as a consequence there was an increase in the diffusive transport of cl across the membrane layer resulting from increased temperature brandhuber and amy 2001 j waypa et al 1997 this effect was more significant for cl compared to so4 2 because of its higher diffusivity lower charge lower hydrated radius and lower hydration free energy nightingale 1959 tansel 2012 offering an explanation for the large decrease of the cl rejection and the unaffected rejection of so4 2 a lower rejection of cl and so4 2 was observed for alfa laval nf when compared with the rejection for dow nf270 while the average pore size at 25 c and 50 c of alfa laval nf is smaller than dow nf270 this could imply that aside from the size exclusion the membrane charge and membrane material had a significant effect on the rejection particularly for monovalent ions cl nguyen et al nguyen et al 2009 tested as v concentration ranging from 20 to 100 µg l reporting an improvement in the rejection of h2aso4 3 6 and haso4 2 1 3 when using deionized water 10 mm nacl as a background solution compared to the rejection values obtained when only deionized water was used the same study noted a decrease in the rejection of h2aso4 1 1 7 and haso4 2 0 6 when deionized water 10 mm na2so4 was used as a bulk solution compared to the rejection values obtained when only deionized water was used vrijenhoek and waypa vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 compared the effect of two background solutions on the rejection of a wide range of divalent arsenate concentrations from 10 to 1000 µg l the first solution contained deionized water 1 mm nahco3 and the second contained deionized water 10 mm nacl 1 mm nahco3 in both cases the rejection of haso4 2 increased as a function of its concentration in the bulk solution in general a higher rejection was achieved during filtration of the solution containing nacl and nahco3 this phenomenon has been ascribed to the relative mobility or permeability of the ions present in the bulk solution hodgson 1970 vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 the so called mobility or permeability of the ion could be defined by the thermodynamic and physical properties e g charge diffusivity hydrated radius and hydration free energy for example anions such as cl and hco3 e g with smaller hydrated radius and smaller hydration free energy compared to h2aso4 and haso4 2 are considered more permeable binder and zschörnig 2002 linde and jönsson 1995 nightingale 1959 saitua et al 2011 stumm and morgan 2009 tansel 2012 the rejection of the more mobile anions is lower e g cl and hco3 and because of the electro neutrality that needs to be maintained in the feed solution the rejection of the less permeable anions tends to be enhanced in other words the as v species tend to increase in the presence of cl and hco3 3 4 rejection of monovalent h2aso4 and divalent haso4 2 species in presence of nahco3 fig 7 a shows that at 25 c the order of rejection of as v in the presence of nahco3 for dow nf270 was h2aso4 ph 6 haso4 2 ph 7 8 although there was only a slight difference 2 at 50 c this rejection order was reversed and the rejection of monovalent as v was equal or greater than that of the divalent as v at ph 7 and ph 8 h2aso4 haso4 2 however the hierarchy in rejection of as v species for alfa laval nf was h2aso4 ph 6 haso4 2 ph 7 8 for both temperatures fig 7 b i e divalent as v was better rejected than monovalent as v the degree of rejection for both as v species was higher at 50 c than the rejection obtained at 25 c for both membranes tested dow nf270 showed a rejection up to 0 97 and 0 93 for mono and divalent as v respectively at 50 c at the same temperature alfa laval presented a rejection of 0 86 for monovalent and 0 97 and 0 94 for divalent as v at 25 c the as concentration in the permeate of both membranes tested exceeded the who regulatory limit of arsenic in drinking water 10 µg l the as concentration in the permeate for dow nf270 is close to 35 µg l for the evaluated ph values whereas the concentration in the permeate of alfa laval nf was around 57 27 and 21 µg l for ph 6 7 and 8 respectively at 50 c the permeate quality is improved furthermore for some of the evaluated ph values the as concentration in the permeate was reduced to less than 10 µg l for dow nf270 ph 6 and ph 7 and alfa laval nf ph 7 our results suggest that there is a restriction related with the maximum as v concentration that can be treated with nf where nf systems seem most appropriate at as v concentrations below 300 µg l an improvement in rejection of h2aso4 and haso4 2 was achieved as the result of an increase in temperature one would not expect this result based on the observed cl and so4 2 rejection at higher temperatures where a lower and an equal rejection were observed for these mono and divalent ions respectively furthermore previous work figoli et al 2010 executed in deionized water showed a decline in the rejection of as v as a result of increased temperature the difference between the cited research and our findings could be explained by the presence of hco3 and cl used as a ph and ionic strength buffer in our study which may have played a considerable role in the improvement of as v rejection earlier studies nguyen et al 2009 vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 conducted at 25 c have shown that in a multi component solution the rejection of h2aso4 and haso4 2 during nanofiltration could be influenced by the presence of co occurring anions our results suggest that this phenomenon was temperature dependent supporting the rejection of as v at higher temperatures anions such as cl and hco3 with an equal or lower valence higher diffusivity smaller hydrated radius and lower hydrated free energy are generally more permeable than h2aso4 and haso4 2 nightingale 1959 padilla et al 2010 vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 as temperature increases the permeability or mobility of cl and hco3 also increases in addition due to friction forces originating during nanofiltration cl and hco3 with lower hydration free energy decrease their hydrated radius tansel 2012 because of the inverse relationship between the hydration free energy with temperature the hydrated radius of cl and hco3 decrease as the temperature increases this characteristic in combination with the enlargement of the pore size and the increase in the mass transfer across the membrane due to the temperature effect enhanced the permeation of cl and hco3 correspondingly the rejection of the less permeable as v species increases because of electro neutrality that needs to be maintained in the bulk solution therefore cl and hco3 permeation had a beneficial effect on the rejection of as v species and this effect was enhanced as temperature increased in natural waters other anions will also interact with as v and thus may affect the rejection efficiency of the membranes this study is a first step towards understanding as v rejection at higher temperatures but further research will be required to elucidate the mechanism of as v rejection in the complex natural water quality matrices in nicaraguan geothermal waters 4 conclusions at 50 c the transmembrane pressure required to operate the nf membranes was on average 50 lower than at 25 c this can be explained by the decreased viscosity of the water and the expansion of membrane pores mwco at higher temperatures the operational pressure for dow nf270 at 50 c was 1 5 bar 15 mwc making it suitable for the use of natural elevation in volcanic areas therefore not requiring electricity for operation depending on the ph tested the as v concentration in the permeate was either slightly below 9 µg l or above 21 µg l the who regulatory limit in drinking water 10 µg l which indicates that there are restrictions related with the maximum as v concentration to be treated with nf it was found that at the higher temperature the rejection of both monovalent h2aso4 and divalent haso4 2 species increased this finding differs from previous work where the as v rejection from deionized water showed a decline as a consequence of temperature increase the presence of more permeable anions hco3 and cl may have been responsible for enhanced as v rejection the interaction between ions as will also be present in natural waters in nicaragua apparently counteracts the effect of increased pore size resulting in enhanced as v rejection at higher

heated to the desired temperature 25 c or 50 c the temperature of the solution was controlled by a recirculating thermostatic bath tc 16 tamson instruments b v nl which was connected to a heat exchanger coil submerged in the solution after this stage the feed water was pumped using a rotary vane positive displacement pump fluid o tech s r l italy from the tank into stainless steel plates containing the nf membrane the active area of the rectangular flat sheet nf membrane inside the metallic plates was 0 25 m2 the solution was filtered through the membrane for two hours to achieve stabilization of the rejection and to reach thermal equilibrium between the solution and flat sheet cross flow module at the end of the preliminary filtration cycle the rejection experiments began the pressure in the feed permeate and concentrate line was monitored with a pressure gauge en 837 1 econosto nl sampling of the feed permeate and concentrate was performed at both the middle and the end of each filtration cycle 2 2 nf membranes and solutions two commercially available nf polyamide membranes were used the specifications given by the respective manufacturers indicate that dow nf270 dow filmtec has a molecular weight cut off mwco ranging between 200 and 400 da and a recommended maximum operating temperature of 45 c nevertheless due the relatively short duration of the experiment we decided to exceed the maximum recommended temperature the second membrane from alfa laval nf alfa laval has a mwco of 300 da and a maximum operating temperature of 55 c in general polyamide membranes are negatively charged for the tested ph range between 6 and 8 bellona and drewes 2005 boussu et al 2006 childress and elimelech 2000 nguyen et al 2009 a standard stock solution of 1 g l of as v was prepared using na2haso47h2o sigma aldrich dissolved in deionized water and acidified ph 3 using 1 6 m hcl sigma aldrich the solution used in all as v rejection experiments was kept in an aluminum foil covered glass container and refrigerated 5 8 c the individual salt rejection experiments were carried out with monovalent nacl vwr chemical and divalent na2so4 sigma aldrich salts to obtain the desired as v concentration of 300 μg l 0 004 mm h2aso4 haso4 2 the stock solution was diluted in demineralized water to ensure the buffering capacity of the water matrix nahco3 sigma aldrich was dosed according to the requirements of the experiments 1 6 m hcl sigma aldrich or 0 1 m naoh sigma aldrich was employed for ph adjustment 2 3 effect of temperature on mwco the determination of mwco for dow nf270 and alfa laval membranes was carried out at 25 c and 50 c the solution used for the determination of mwco was prepared using ethylene glycol 62 g mol and different polyethylene glycols pegs with molecular weights ranging from 200 to 1000 g mol sigma aldrich the experiments were performed at constant flux 30 l m2 h and a recovery of 15 samples of the feed permeate and concentrate were taken every 3 h mwco was measured by filtering the ethylene glycol pegs mixture and measuring the rejection with hplc gpc shimadzu with ri detection 2 4 transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature using demineralized water as feed solution the relation between transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature 25 c and 50 c was determined for dow nf270 and alfa laval demineralized water was used as feed solution the experiments were conducted at constant flux 40 l m2 h a cross flow velocity of 0 15 m s and a recovery of 10 2 5 nf rejection experiments table 1 provides an overview of the experimental settings membranes tested and the water composition used for the nf rejection experiments the rejection experiments were conducted at constant flux 40 l m2 h a cross flow velocity of 0 15 m s and a recovery of 10 all experiments were performed in duplicate and executed at both 25 c or 50 c 2 5 1 rejection of cl and so4 2 single solutions of monovalent nacl and divalent na2so4 salts were used to determine the individual rejection of cl and so4 2 the ionic strengths of the solutions were 1 mm for nacl and 3 mm for na2so4 dow nf270 and alfa laval were used for these experiments 2 5 2 rejection of monovalent h2aso4 and divalent haso4 2 species in the presence of nahco3 rejection of h2aso4 and haso4 2 was evaluated by maintaining constant temperature 25 c or 50 c and varying the ph ph 8 7 and 6 of the feed water samples were was collected over 5 h of operation for each evaluated ph value for each temperature a series of three 5 h runs was executed with the starting solution adjusted to ph 8 0 1 m naoh and then corrected to ph 7 and ph 6 in the 2nd and 3rd run using hcl 1 62 m dow nf270 and alfa laval nf were used for these experiments 2 6 analysis of samples temperature ph and electrical conductivity of the feed water were measured using a multimeter wtw gmbh germany for the single solute rejection experiments of cl and so4 2 conductivity measurements of the feed and permeate were used to determine the rejection of both anions the conductivity of the samples of the experiments carried out at 50 c was automatically converted into an equivalent conductivity at 25 c for the rejection experiments of h2aso4 haso4 2 the concentrations of hco3 and cl were determined using titrimetric 702 sm titrino metrohm and ion chromatography analysis ic 883 basic plus metrohm respectively for the analysis of as v the samples from the feed permeate and concentrate were acidified using 1 7 ml of hno3 22 per 330 ml of sample the concentration of as v in the samples was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo xseries ll thermo fisher scientific the method is equivalent to nen en iso 172941 2 and can be applied to drinking surface process and groundwater 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature on mwco fig 4 summarizes the effect of temperature increase on mwco for dow nf270 and alfa laval an increase of 39 from 231 da to 322 da and 20 from 217 da to 260 da in mwco was observed for dow nf270 and alfa laval nf respectively as a result of temperature increase from 25 c to 50 c the larger increase in mwco was found for dow nf270 compared to alfa laval nf the suggestion that pore size of the nf membranes is larger at 50 c agrees with earlier findings that for mono component solutions rejection is lower at higher temperatures 3 2 transmembrane pressure tmp and temperature using demineralized water as feed solution the relation between temperature 25 c and 50 c and tmp is depicted in fig 5 for a constant flux of 40 l m2h temperature and pressure had an inverse relationship i e an increase in temperature resulted in a lower transmembrane pressure for both membranes the transmembrane pressure at 50 c was approximately 50 of the transmembrane pressure at 25 c for both temperatures dow nf270 needed lower transmembrane pressures than alfa laval nf to produce the same flux the low operating pressure required by dow nf270 at 50 c 15 mwc in combination with the elevated topography found in nicaragua s volcanic region may make it feasible to operate the system without a pump i e gravity fed nf system for both membranes the reduction in transmembrane pressure could be associated to both the decrease in water viscosity and the expansion of the effective pore diameter due to increased temperature the difference between the two tested membranes could be associated with their different physical properties i e pore size thickness tortuosity 3 3 rejection of cl and so4 2 fig 6 depicts the single solute rejection of cl left and so4 2 right at 25 c and 50 c the rejection of cl monovalent ion was lower compared to so4 2 divalent ion at both temperatures this order in rejection was valid for both nf membranes and is in line with expectations for negatively charged nf membranes peeters et al 1998 a considerable decrease in rejection was noted for the monovalent anion cl as a consequence of the temperature increase 26 for dow nf270 and 68 for alfa laval nf on the other hand the rejection of the divalent anion so4 2 was found to be less sensitive to temperature changes with the temperature increase from 25 c to 50 c the reduction of cl rejection can be ascribed to changes in its thermodynamic and physical properties e g increase in diffusivity decreases in hydration free energy and hydrated radius as well as to the diminishing size exclusion mechanism due to thermal expansion of the pore sharma et al 2003 as a consequence there was an increase in the diffusive transport of cl across the membrane layer resulting from increased temperature brandhuber and amy 2001 j waypa et al 1997 this effect was more significant for cl compared to so4 2 because of its higher diffusivity lower charge lower hydrated radius and lower hydration free energy nightingale 1959 tansel 2012 offering an explanation for the large decrease of the cl rejection and the unaffected rejection of so4 2 a lower rejection of cl and so4 2 was observed for alfa laval nf when compared with the rejection for dow nf270 while the average pore size at 25 c and 50 c of alfa laval nf is smaller than dow nf270 this could imply that aside from the size exclusion the membrane charge and membrane material had a significant effect on the rejection particularly for monovalent ions cl nguyen et al nguyen et al 2009 tested as v concentration ranging from 20 to 100 µg l reporting an improvement in the rejection of h2aso4 3 6 and haso4 2 1 3 when using deionized water 10 mm nacl as a background solution compared to the rejection values obtained when only deionized water was used the same study noted a decrease in the rejection of h2aso4 1 1 7 and haso4 2 0 6 when deionized water 10 mm na2so4 was used as a bulk solution compared to the rejection values obtained when only deionized water was used vrijenhoek and waypa vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 compared the effect of two background solutions on the rejection of a wide range of divalent arsenate concentrations from 10 to 1000 µg l the first solution contained deionized water 1 mm nahco3 and the second contained deionized water 10 mm nacl 1 mm nahco3 in both cases the rejection of haso4 2 increased as a function of its concentration in the bulk solution in general a higher rejection was achieved during filtration of the solution containing nacl and nahco3 this phenomenon has been ascribed to the relative mobility or permeability of the ions present in the bulk solution hodgson 1970 vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 the so called mobility or permeability of the ion could be defined by the thermodynamic and physical properties e g charge diffusivity hydrated radius and hydration free energy for example anions such as cl and hco3 e g with smaller hydrated radius and smaller hydration free energy compared to h2aso4 and haso4 2 are considered more permeable binder and zschörnig 2002 linde and jönsson 1995 nightingale 1959 saitua et al 2011 stumm and morgan 2009 tansel 2012 the rejection of the more mobile anions is lower e g cl and hco3 and because of the electro neutrality that needs to be maintained in the feed solution the rejection of the less permeable anions tends to be enhanced in other words the as v species tend to increase in the presence of cl and hco3 3 4 rejection of monovalent h2aso4 and divalent haso4 2 species in presence of nahco3 fig 7 a shows that at 25 c the order of rejection of as v in the presence of nahco3 for dow nf270 was h2aso4 ph 6 haso4 2 ph 7 8 although there was only a slight difference 2 at 50 c this rejection order was reversed and the rejection of monovalent as v was equal or greater than that of the divalent as v at ph 7 and ph 8 h2aso4 haso4 2 however the hierarchy in rejection of as v species for alfa laval nf was h2aso4 ph 6 haso4 2 ph 7 8 for both temperatures fig 7 b i e divalent as v was better rejected than monovalent as v the degree of rejection for both as v species was higher at 50 c than the rejection obtained at 25 c for both membranes tested dow nf270 showed a rejection up to 0 97 and 0 93 for mono and divalent as v respectively at 50 c at the same temperature alfa laval presented a rejection of 0 86 for monovalent and 0 97 and 0 94 for divalent as v at 25 c the as concentration in the permeate of both membranes tested exceeded the who regulatory limit of arsenic in drinking water 10 µg l the as concentration in the permeate for dow nf270 is close to 35 µg l for the evaluated ph values whereas the concentration in the permeate of alfa laval nf was around 57 27 and 21 µg l for ph 6 7 and 8 respectively at 50 c the permeate quality is improved furthermore for some of the evaluated ph values the as concentration in the permeate was reduced to less than 10 µg l for dow nf270 ph 6 and ph 7 and alfa laval nf ph 7 our results suggest that there is a restriction related with the maximum as v concentration that can be treated with nf where nf systems seem most appropriate at as v concentrations below 300 µg l an improvement in rejection of h2aso4 and haso4 2 was achieved as the result of an increase in temperature one would not expect this result based on the observed cl and so4 2 rejection at higher temperatures where a lower and an equal rejection were observed for these mono and divalent ions respectively furthermore previous work figoli et al 2010 executed in deionized water showed a decline in the rejection of as v as a result of increased temperature the difference between the cited research and our findings could be explained by the presence of hco3 and cl used as a ph and ionic strength buffer in our study which may have played a considerable role in the improvement of as v rejection earlier studies nguyen et al 2009 vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 conducted at 25 c have shown that in a multi component solution the rejection of h2aso4 and haso4 2 during nanofiltration could be influenced by the presence of co occurring anions our results suggest that this phenomenon was temperature dependent supporting the rejection of as v at higher temperatures anions such as cl and hco3 with an equal or lower valence higher diffusivity smaller hydrated radius and lower hydrated free energy are generally more permeable than h2aso4 and haso4 2 nightingale 1959 padilla et al 2010 vrijenhoek and waypa 2000 as temperature increases the permeability or mobility of cl and hco3 also increases in addition due to friction forces originating during nanofiltration cl and hco3 with lower hydration free energy decrease their hydrated radius tansel 2012 because of the inverse relationship between the hydration free energy with temperature the hydrated radius of cl and hco3 decrease as the temperature increases this characteristic in combination with the enlargement of the pore size and the increase in the mass transfer across the membrane due to the temperature effect enhanced the permeation of cl and hco3 correspondingly the rejection of the less permeable as v species increases because of electro neutrality that needs to be maintained in the bulk solution therefore cl and hco3 permeation had a beneficial effect on the rejection of as v species and this effect was enhanced as temperature increased in natural waters other anions will also interact with as v and thus may affect the rejection efficiency of the membranes this study is a first step towards understanding as v rejection at higher temperatures but further research will be required to elucidate the mechanism of as v rejection in the complex natural water quality matrices in nicaraguan geothermal waters 4 conclusions at 50 c the transmembrane pressure required to operate the nf membranes was on average 50 lower than at 25 c this can be explained by the decreased viscosity of the water and the expansion of membrane pores mwco at higher temperatures the operational pressure for dow nf270 at 50 c was 1 5 bar 15 mwc making it suitable for the use of natural elevation in volcanic areas therefore not requiring electricity for operation depending on the ph tested the as v concentration in the permeate was either slightly below 9 µg l or above 21 µg l the who regulatory limit in drinking water 10 µg l which indicates that there are restrictions related with the maximum as v concentration to be treated with nf it was found that at the higher temperature the rejection of both monovalent h2aso4 and divalent haso4 2 species increased this finding differs from previous work where the as v rejection from deionized water showed a decline as a consequence of temperature increase the presence of more permeable anions hco3 and cl may have been responsible for enhanced as v rejection the interaction between ions as will also be present in natural waters in nicaragua apparently counteracts the effect of increased pore size resulting in enhanced as v rejection at higher

12281,present study is carried out in the drought prone barind tract in the north western part of bangladesh to identify zones of groundwater potentiality using remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis based geospatial multi criteria approach decreasing rainfall trend along with increasing demand for groundwater irrigation of this agro based area utters urgent need for sustainable groundwater resource development the study area possesses sub dendritic drainage pattern with highly irregular to irregular geomorphological character with mostly flat to gentle slope represents not so good category for groundwater development because of lower rainfall with less favorable infiltration capacity of top soil with respect to time of percolation of runoff here major portion of runoff water loses and not allows more infiltration to recharge the groundwater and therefore is less potential for groundwater occurrence and development to delineate groundwater potentiality thematic layers like geomorphology drainage density rainfall lithology lineament density slope and land use land cover lulc have taken into consideration to integrate in the gis environment and has categorized as 4 48 km2 very good 13 170 km2 good 25 342 km2 moderate 30 405 km2 poor and 28 365 km2 as very poor category on the other hand this potential zonation is most sensitive to lithology followed by slope and lineament density and succeeded by geomorphology drainage density rainfall and lulc this study helps not only to classify zones of groundwater resource potentiality but also to assess groundwater resource potentiality and scopes for its future development at a glance and provides a guideline for the groundwater resource management approach particularly in the area graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater potentiality remote sensing gis barind tract bangladesh 1 general introduction like other disaster vulnerable countries in the world bangladesh suffers from effect of climatic variability and extreme weather events moreover high population density high poverty level and social inequity poor institutional capacity inadequate financial resources and poor infrastructure make it more vulnerable to disasters the country experienced nine major droughts in last 45 years and unfortunately its devastating nature was not studied sufficiently as floods or cyclones but the drought has impact on groundwater resources hence understanding the drought phenomena have implication in water resources potentiality water is one of the most valuable natural resources which supports human life and their socio economic development and needs to be managed and developed on a sustainable way it remained at the core of sustainable development in the 1992 rio world summit on the united nation conference on environment and development unced drought is mentioned in the national water management plan nwmp bangladesh water act 2013 bwa 2013 and bangladesh water rules 2018 bwr 2018 as a major water deficiency issue in the agro based northwest part of the country that leads to loss of food production and shortages resulting starvation for many people in bangladesh the demand of groundwater has increased along with the increasing rate of irrigated agriculture in recent years the unsustainable groundwater use is increasing apparently and the key concern particularly for the drought prone barind tract in the north western part of bangladesh in the study area only very limited regional hydrogeological studies were done in the past few decades despite the enormous role of groundwater resources in the development process of the country huge growth of irrigated agriculture in recent years resulted increasing demand of groundwater but significant gap exists between groundwater resources assessment and identification of groundwater potential zones moreover planed management of water resource is becoming difficult due to changing climatic scenario along with irregular annual frequency and intensity of rainfall rahman et al 2016 so evaluation of water resources potentiality in the area for descent livelihood and sustainable ecosystem is demand of time various scientific studies report that physiographic hydrological and hydrogeological factors like geomorphology drainage pattern soil cover rainfall geology slope land use land cover lulc etc are the controlling factors for the groundwater resource among seven different thematic layers geomorphology plays a dominant role in the occurrence movement and development of groundwater in an area jaiswal et al 2003 chowdhury et al 2009 thomas et al 2009 machiwal et al 2011 fashae et al 2014 it identifies and characterizes landforms along with structural patterns the drainage pattern reflects the nature and characteristics of surface and subsurface lithology the drainage density dd values are important parameter for delineating the groundwater potentiality jaiswal et al 2003 chowdhury et al 2009 rose and krishnan 2009 fashae et al 2014 smith 1950 classified dd values into five drainage texture t viz very coarse less than 2 coarse 2 4 moderate 4 6 fine 6 8 and very fine greater than 8 where the fine drainage texture values indicate less porous and less permeable lithology waikar and nilawar 2014 rain water is the major source of groundwater recharge and the recharge to aquifer indicates the amount of water that would be allowed or percolated to the groundwater system terzer et al 2013 lineament is structural feature that indicates the signature of faulting or fracturing in an area and ultimately develops secondary porosity and permeability the area with higher lineament density intensifies infiltration and ultimately groundwater recharge capacity and provides a good guide for groundwater potentiality study and its development bhuvaneswaran et al 2015 lithology acts also as an important factor on quantitative occurrence of groundwater where porosity and permeability of the aquifer have major contribution bhuvaneswaran et al 2015 ayazi et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2009 the slope of an area plays an important role to control the run off flow and hence contributes to the infiltration capacity of soil and groundwater recharge the higher value of slope causes less infiltration of rainwater through surface soil to recharge the aquifer and vice versa and also an indicator of barrier or suitability for groundwater potentiality in order to characterize the hydrogeological zones and groundwater potentiality berhanu et al 2013 classified slope map produced from shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem as 0 3 flat 3 8 gentle 8 15 moderate and 15 30 steep the infiltration of surface runoff through surface soil and ultimately recharge phenomenon to groundwater is favoured greatly through in the flat and gentle slope areas where that of steep slope facilitates rapid flow of runoff and hence results comparatively less infiltration jaiswal et al 2003 rao and jugran 2003 sener et al 2005 chowdhury et al 2009 machiwal et al 2011 hammouri et al 2012 fashae et al 2014 the lulc largely relies on landscape climate ecology etc as well as anthropogenic activities and has an active contribution in the occurrence distribution and potentiality of groundwater of an area according to sener et al 2005 the ranking of the lulc classes for groundwater potentiality is as water body cultivated land sand bar settlement singh 2014 stated that lulc information represents important role in recharge capacity of aquifer and its storage indifferent way they affect groundwater potentiality of an area with spatio temporal consideration sener et al 2005 ganapuram et al 2009 avtar et al 2010 gaur et al 2011 adiat et al 2012 moreover occurrence of groundwater and its withdrawal for different purposes like drinking agricultural industrial uses etc are controlled by topographic features geological settings hydrogeological environments etc gintamo 2010 recent scientific studies embrace digital satellite data that provides baseline information about geomorphology geology lineaments lulc etc controlling occurrence and potentiality of groundwater in this context geospatial tools like rs and gis are effective tools for analyzing voluminous geomorphic geologic and hydrological data and for modeling of complex features in decision making level goodchild 1993 lu et al 1997 gogu et al 2001 gossel et al 2004 stafford et al 2008 recent studies reveal that the integrated rs and gis technique application helps for groundwater resource potentiality and exploration in pinpointing areas for conducting detailed hydrogeological and geophysical studies from surface but unfortunately till now there are no studies on groundwater resource potentiality in the barind tract using rs and gis techniques hence present research has attempted to prepare groundwater potential zonation map applying geospatial technologies like rs and gis based multi criteria analysis viz geomorphology geology drainage pattern soil cover slope lulc etc for better planning and management of this valuable resource this study is very much important for sustainable use of the groundwater resource thereby enhancing groundwater recharge for proper management in the drought prone barind tract in bangladesh 2 area of study the study area comprises of the barind tract as major portion dissected and undulating and the floodplains two morphologically different landforms present study comprises four upazilas sub district godagari tanore nachole and gomastapur covering an area of 1369 km2 and a population of 435 971 fig 1 a b the area lies in the catchment of the river ganges padma with drainage system predominantly of the atrai mahananda purnabhaba rivers and other minor seasonal streams except the padma all others are seasonal the area enjoys a sub tropical monsoon climate and characterized mainly by three seasons winter november february cool and dry with almost no rainfall pre monsoon march may hot and dry and monsoon june october rainy the average annual rainfall for the period 1980 2015 1600 mm is much less than the national average 2550 mm average monthly humidity varies from 62 in march to 87 in july with annual mean of 78 monthly average temperature ranges from 10 c in january to 33 c in may moderate to high drought risk condition prevails here physiographic map of the area is shown in fig 2 north south oriented dome shaped barind tract 20 25 km wide in east west direction edged parallel to the river valleys demarcate the topography with elevation ranging from 47 0 m in its central part the slope has differential gradient to the west and east 0 79 2 2 m km geologically the tract is a horst block flanked by actively subsiding regions formed during the late pleistocene morgan and mcintire 1959 and is covered by semi impervious clay silt aquitard of recent pleistocene period thickness 3 0 47 5 m is characterized by 5 0 42 5 m thick single to multiple layered two four plio pleistocene aquifer system jahan et al 2007 with low infiltration rate of upper clay silt aquitard part 1 2 mm day undp 1992 the area is characterized by potential aquifer for groundwater development at greater depth the aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity k transmissivity t and specific yield sy values in the area as obtained from pumping test results of institute of water modeling iwm 2006 are 10 20 m day 1000 m2 day and 0 06 0 30 respectively the aquifer is characterized by lower values of t 500 m2 day mainly in central part of the tract suitable only for domestic water supply whereas surrounding area has t values of 500 1000 m2 day suitable for irrigation and domestic needs jahan and ahmed 1997 pitman 1981 this area is a granary where agricultural practices run mostly by groundwater irrigation groundwater abstraction of for irrigation higher than the recharge restricts dry season agriculture the increasing demand of groundwater for country s food security causes over exploitation of resource the monsoon rain and floodwater recharge groundwater raises water level in the area but later owing to effluent drainage nature part of the groundwater discharges into the rivers streams and low lying areas the aquifer generally is not fully recharged in recent years even during rainy season and this situation differs with widely accepted assumption of its fully recharged condition during rainy season in bangladesh here the recent declining trend of groundwater table is of higher rate than earlier and after 2002 2004 it did not return to its original level jahan et al 2015 presently the tract suffers from groundwater drought condition and the groundwater resource of the area is under stress and situation is worsening due to over exploitation of groundwater and extension of irrigated areas 3 materials and methods for identification of groundwater potential zones the methodology for the present research work is designed using multi parametric data set like conventional maps from secondary source viz topographic

occurrence of groundwater and leads barrier to the delineation of hydro morphological usefulness dey 2014 4 1 2 drainage density dd the drainage map of the area is prepared with the help of topographic maps scale 1 50 000 and srtm dem and its dd values ranges from 0 00 to 1 46 km km2 the major portions have values ranging from 0 00 to 0 09 km km2 indicates inverse function of permeability the high drainage density values of the area indicates poor potentiality of groundwater occurrence the tract possess sub dendritic drainage pattern and are generally characterized by a tree like branching system with less homogeneity and uniformity based on cording to sener et al 2005 and hammouri et al 2012 the drainage density map fig 3 b is classified into five classes using equal interval classification and the corresponding rates are shown in table 2 the drainage pattern in this area indicates scope of loss of major portion of runoff water with less infiltration

fig 4 a is classified into five categories based on sener et al 2005 and rose and krishnan 2009 along with corresponding rates table 2 in generally comparatively less annual amount of rainfall indicates low groundwater potentiality of an area so the low rainfall area should be given less weighted value than that of the high rainfall while considering its the groundwater potentiality 4 1 4 lineament density lineament density map is computed from lineaments produced by edge enhancement of the landsat etm panchromatic band band 8 and varies from 0 00 to 0 017 km km2 table 2 based on equal

in these zones of less rainfall and mostly flat to gentle slope land area with low surface soil infiltration capacity of runoff water to recharge groundwater has effect on groundwater potentiality the crop cultivation in the area mainly depends on the groundwater irrigation where surface lithology is characterized mostly by barind clay residuum of low infiltration to groundwater resource and followed by the alluvial silt marshy clay and peat etc the results sensitivity analysis using map removal techniques for groundwater potentiality zonation is highly varied due to possible removal of lineament density from the computation with mean variation index mvi value of 1 99 that may be mainly contributed to relatively higher weight assigned to the lithology layer with empirical mean weight

12281,present study is carried out in the drought prone barind tract in the north western part of bangladesh to identify zones of groundwater potentiality using remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis based geospatial multi criteria approach decreasing rainfall trend along with increasing demand for groundwater irrigation of this agro based area utters urgent need for sustainable groundwater resource development the study area possesses sub dendritic drainage pattern with highly irregular to irregular geomorphological character with mostly flat to gentle slope represents not so good category for groundwater development because of lower rainfall with less favorable infiltration capacity of top soil with respect to time of percolation of runoff here major portion of runoff water loses and not allows more infiltration to recharge the groundwater and therefore is less potential for groundwater occurrence and development to delineate groundwater potentiality thematic layers like geomorphology drainage density rainfall lithology lineament density slope and land use land cover lulc have taken into consideration to integrate in the gis environment and has categorized as 4 48 km2 very good 13 170 km2 good 25 342 km2 moderate 30 405 km2 poor and 28 365 km2 as very poor category on the other hand this potential zonation is most sensitive to lithology followed by slope and lineament density and succeeded by geomorphology drainage density rainfall and lulc this study helps not only to classify zones of groundwater resource potentiality but also to assess groundwater resource potentiality and scopes for its future development at a glance and provides a guideline for the groundwater resource management approach particularly in the area graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater potentiality remote sensing gis barind tract bangladesh 1 general introduction like other disaster vulnerable countries in the world bangladesh suffers from effect of climatic variability and extreme weather events moreover high population density high poverty level and social inequity poor institutional capacity inadequate financial resources and poor infrastructure make it more vulnerable to disasters the country experienced nine major droughts in last 45 years and unfortunately its devastating nature was not studied sufficiently as floods or cyclones but the drought has impact on groundwater resources hence understanding the drought phenomena have implication in water resources potentiality water is one of the most valuable natural resources which supports human life and their socio economic development and needs to be managed and developed on a sustainable way it remained at the core of sustainable development in the 1992 rio world summit on the united nation conference on environment and development unced drought is mentioned in the national water management plan nwmp bangladesh water act 2013 bwa 2013 and bangladesh water rules 2018 bwr 2018 as a major water deficiency issue in the agro based northwest part of the country that leads to loss of food production and shortages resulting starvation for many people in bangladesh the demand of groundwater has increased along with the increasing rate of irrigated agriculture in recent years the unsustainable groundwater use is increasing apparently and the key concern particularly for the drought prone barind tract in the north western part of bangladesh in the study area only very limited regional hydrogeological studies were done in the past few decades despite the enormous role of groundwater resources in the development process of the country huge growth of irrigated agriculture in recent years resulted increasing demand of groundwater but significant gap exists between groundwater resources assessment and identification of groundwater potential zones moreover planed management of water resource is becoming difficult due to changing climatic scenario along with irregular annual frequency and intensity of rainfall rahman et al 2016 so evaluation of water resources potentiality in the area for descent livelihood and sustainable ecosystem is demand of time various scientific studies report that physiographic hydrological and hydrogeological factors like geomorphology drainage pattern soil cover rainfall geology slope land use land cover lulc etc are the controlling factors for the groundwater resource among seven different thematic layers geomorphology plays a dominant role in the occurrence movement and development of groundwater in an area jaiswal et al 2003 chowdhury et al 2009 thomas et al 2009 machiwal et al 2011 fashae et al 2014 it identifies and characterizes landforms along with structural patterns the drainage pattern reflects the nature and characteristics of surface and subsurface lithology the drainage density dd values are important parameter for delineating the groundwater potentiality jaiswal et al 2003 chowdhury et al 2009 rose and krishnan 2009 fashae et al 2014 smith 1950 classified dd values into five drainage texture t viz very coarse less than 2 coarse 2 4 moderate 4 6 fine 6 8 and very fine greater than 8 where the fine drainage texture values indicate less porous and less permeable lithology waikar and nilawar 2014 rain water is the major source of groundwater recharge and the recharge to aquifer indicates the amount of water that would be allowed or percolated to the groundwater system terzer et al 2013 lineament is structural feature that indicates the signature of faulting or fracturing in an area and ultimately develops secondary porosity and permeability the area with higher lineament density intensifies infiltration and ultimately groundwater recharge capacity and provides a good guide for groundwater potentiality study and its development bhuvaneswaran et al 2015 lithology acts also as an important factor on quantitative occurrence of groundwater where porosity and permeability of the aquifer have major contribution bhuvaneswaran et al 2015 ayazi et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2009 the slope of an area plays an important role to control the run off flow and hence contributes to the infiltration capacity of soil and groundwater recharge the higher value of slope causes less infiltration of rainwater through surface soil to recharge the aquifer and vice versa and also an indicator of barrier or suitability for groundwater potentiality in order to characterize the hydrogeological zones and groundwater potentiality berhanu et al 2013 classified slope map produced from shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem as 0 3 flat 3 8 gentle 8 15 moderate and 15 30 steep the infiltration of surface runoff through surface soil and ultimately recharge phenomenon to groundwater is favoured greatly through in the flat and gentle slope areas where that of steep slope facilitates rapid flow of runoff and hence results comparatively less infiltration jaiswal et al 2003 rao and jugran 2003 sener et al 2005 chowdhury et al 2009 machiwal et al 2011 hammouri et al 2012 fashae et al 2014 the lulc largely relies on landscape climate ecology etc as well as anthropogenic activities and has an active contribution in the occurrence distribution and potentiality of groundwater of an area according to sener et al 2005 the ranking of the lulc classes for groundwater potentiality is as water body cultivated land sand bar settlement singh 2014 stated that lulc information represents important role in recharge capacity of aquifer and its storage indifferent way they affect groundwater potentiality of an area with spatio temporal consideration sener et al 2005 ganapuram et al 2009 avtar et al 2010 gaur et al 2011 adiat et al 2012 moreover occurrence of groundwater and its withdrawal for different purposes like drinking agricultural industrial uses etc are controlled by topographic features geological settings hydrogeological environments etc gintamo 2010 recent scientific studies embrace digital satellite data that provides baseline information about geomorphology geology lineaments lulc etc controlling occurrence and potentiality of groundwater in this context geospatial tools like rs and gis are effective tools for analyzing voluminous geomorphic geologic and hydrological data and for modeling of complex features in decision making level goodchild 1993 lu et al 1997 gogu et al 2001 gossel et al 2004 stafford et al 2008 recent studies reveal that the integrated rs and gis technique application helps for groundwater resource potentiality and exploration in pinpointing areas for conducting detailed hydrogeological and geophysical studies from surface but unfortunately till now there are no studies on groundwater resource potentiality in the barind tract using rs and gis techniques hence present research has attempted to prepare groundwater potential zonation map applying geospatial technologies like rs and gis based multi criteria analysis viz geomorphology geology drainage pattern soil cover slope lulc etc for better planning and management of this valuable resource this study is very much important for sustainable use of the groundwater resource thereby enhancing groundwater recharge for proper management in the drought prone barind tract in bangladesh 2 area of study the study area comprises of the barind tract as major portion dissected and undulating and the floodplains two morphologically different landforms present study comprises four upazilas sub district godagari tanore nachole and gomastapur covering an area of 1369 km2 and a population of 435 971 fig 1 a b the area lies in the catchment of the river ganges padma with drainage system predominantly of the atrai mahananda purnabhaba rivers and other minor seasonal streams except the padma all others are seasonal the area enjoys a sub tropical monsoon climate and characterized mainly by three seasons winter november february cool and dry with almost no rainfall pre monsoon march may hot and dry and monsoon june october rainy the average annual rainfall for the period 1980 2015 1600 mm is much less than the national average 2550 mm average monthly humidity varies from 62 in march to 87 in july with annual mean of 78 monthly average temperature ranges from 10 c in january to 33 c in may moderate to high drought risk condition prevails here physiographic map of the area is shown in fig 2 north south oriented dome shaped barind tract 20 25 km wide in east west direction edged parallel to the river valleys demarcate the topography with elevation ranging from 47 0 m in its central part the slope has differential gradient to the west and east 0 79 2 2 m km geologically the tract is a horst block flanked by actively subsiding regions formed during the late pleistocene morgan and mcintire 1959 and is covered by semi impervious clay silt aquitard of recent pleistocene period thickness 3 0 47 5 m is characterized by 5 0 42 5 m thick single to multiple layered two four plio pleistocene aquifer system jahan et al 2007 with low infiltration rate of upper clay silt aquitard part 1 2 mm day undp 1992 the area is characterized by potential aquifer for groundwater development at greater depth the aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity k transmissivity t and specific yield sy values in the area as obtained from pumping test results of institute of water modeling iwm 2006 are 10 20 m day 1000 m2 day and 0 06 0 30 respectively the aquifer is characterized by lower values of t 500 m2 day mainly in central part of the tract suitable only for domestic water supply whereas surrounding area has t values of 500 1000 m2 day suitable for irrigation and domestic needs jahan and ahmed 1997 pitman 1981 this area is a granary where agricultural practices run mostly by groundwater irrigation groundwater abstraction of for irrigation higher than the recharge restricts dry season agriculture the increasing demand of groundwater for country s food security causes over exploitation of resource the monsoon rain and floodwater recharge groundwater raises water level in the area but later owing to effluent drainage nature part of the groundwater discharges into the rivers streams and low lying areas the aquifer generally is not fully recharged in recent years even during rainy season and this situation differs with widely accepted assumption of its fully recharged condition during rainy season in bangladesh here the recent declining trend of groundwater table is of higher rate than earlier and after 2002 2004 it did not return to its original level jahan et al 2015 presently the tract suffers from groundwater drought condition and the groundwater resource of the area is under stress and situation is worsening due to over exploitation of groundwater and extension of irrigated areas 3 materials and methods for identification of groundwater potential zones the methodology for the present research work is designed using multi parametric data set like conventional maps from secondary source viz topographic maps rainfall data geological map etc and rs information here the geospatial technology like rs information are used directly for the thematic map preparation which include geomorphology drainage

ranks etc for the thematic layers have different impacts in delineating groundwater occurrence and movement so for their computation the gis based multi criteria evaluation based on analytical hierarchy process ahp arivalagan et al 2015 is used here the maximum likelihood classification mlc methods is applied and common land use categories are identified with reference to their water requirement i e cultivated land settlement sand bar and water bodies like wet land pond river etc finally the groundwater potentiality gp is calculated as follows fenta et al 2015 groundwater

aggregate thematic layers are the steps used to delineate groundwater potential zones here relative importance of each class within the same map and thematic maps are compared to others by pair wise comparison matrices and each criterion is compared with the other relative to its importance on saaty s scale from 1 to 9 where value 1 for equal 3 for moderate 5 for strong 7 for very strong 2 4 6

electrolyte the co ions present in the matrix of ion exchange matrix of ion exchange material exclude most ions of the identical charge and attract counter ions of opposite charge to proceed the ion exchange process and the selectivity of a particular ionic group can be calculated on the basis of distribution coefficient kd values khan and akhtar 2011 the ion exchange membrane prepared by such type of ionomeric materials can be used as an ion exchange membrane electrode since the ionic charge fixed on the matrices of the material attract opposite charge based on selectivity from the solution the concentration of the mobile ion become higher in the solution then the ionomeric membrane thus concentration gradients are established between membrane and the solution this concentration gradient act as driving force for the mobile co ions to move in to the solution and mobile counter ion to move in to the membrane thus the attempt of diffusion of ions into the membrane phase change the concentration between an ionomer membrane and adjacent ionic solution which establish electrical potential difference that can be calculated if the polymeric ionomeric material is electrically conductive the selectivity of this material for a particular ionic species can also be measured on the basis of its electrical conductivity this conductive property of the material can help to make

important role in determining the selectivity of the material it is the measure of a fraction uptake of metal ions competing for h ions from a solution by an ion exchange material kd values of some heavy metal ions such as cu2 hg2 cd2 pb2 cr3 with 0 1 m concentration were determined on ppy tsp ptsp 4 table 3 by batch method in different aqueous solvents khan et al 2010 200 mg of the composite

at constant ionic strength the electrode response was measured at room temperature as described by iupac commission for analytical nomenclature khan and alam 2003 the membrane electrode was conditioned by soaking in 0 1 m pb no3 2 solution for 4 5 days before use the calibration curves of the measured electrode potential were plotted against logarithm of pb2 ion concentration to check

prepared by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of tsp nanoparticles using fecl3 as oxidant under different conditions table s2 tsp binds through electrostatic binding of negatively charged tsp nanoparticles with positive charge of hydrogen of nh group of the polymer the mechanistic representation of formation of ppy tsp nanocomposite showing interaction of tsp with polypyrrole is shown in scheme 1 the ion exchanger sample ptsp 4 possessed better na ion exchange capacity 2 10 meq g as compared to the inorganic tsp sample tsp 2 table s1 1 40 meq g the iec of ppy tsp composite was increased due to addition of conductive polymer into the inorganic material tsp which increases the surface area of the material thus exchangeable ionic sites were increased due to the better ion exchange capacity sample ptsp 4 table s2 was selected for membrane preparation a number of samples of the ppy tsp nanocomposite membrane were prepared with different amount composite with fixed amount of polyvinylchloride as binder prepared membrane samples were checked for mechanical stability surface uniformity materials distribution and thickness etc on the basis of physicochemical characterization and good ion exchange capacity 0 8 meq g 1 membrane m 2 is selected for electro analytical studies condition of preparation and iec of ppy tsp composite ion exchanger membrane were given in table 1 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 ftir spectroscopic analysis fig 1 shows the ftir spectra of ppy tsp nanocomposite and ppy tsp nanocomposite membrane ftir spectra of ppy tsp nanocomposite shows a sharp peak at 3509 cm 1 may be attributed to the oh stretching frequency peak at 2940 cm 1 suggest the presence of secondary amino group nh stretching vibration and a broad band between 1250 and 800 cm 1 with a peak of intensity at 1042 cm 1 is due to presence of ionic phosphate group whereas peak at 795 cm 1 is attributed to m o bonding the stretching vibration of c n c c and c h stretching vibration in pyrrole ring observed at 1225 cm 1 1559 cm 1 and 3050 cm 1 respectively indicates that the polymerization of ppy has been successfully achieved on the surface of the tsp particles in ftir spectra of ppy tsp membrane the peaks appearing at 3519 cm 1 may be attributed to oh stretching frequency of water bound to polymer chain while a peak 2940 cm 1 suggest the presence of secondary amino group nh stretching vibration the peaks at 1600 cm 1 1310 cm 1 indicate the existence of c c c c stretching vibrations in addition peak of intensity at 1042 cm 1 is due to presence of ionic phosphate group whereas peak at 795 cm 1 is attributed to m o bonding day and underwood 2001 3 2 2 x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 2 illustrates the xrd pattern of tsp ppy tsp and ppy tsp membrane in the 2θ range between 0 and 80 it is evident from the xrd pattern that the ppy tsp composite is amorphous in nature with the diffraction peaks centered at 2θ 22 which is very close to characteristic peak of polypyrrole 2θ 26 khan and shaheen 2013 xrd pattern of ppy tsp membrane shows amorphous nature with a broad peak at 2θ 22 similar to diffraction of ppy tsp composite which suggest successful preparation of ppy tsp membrane 3 2 3 scanning electron microscopy sem studies sem images of tsp ppy tsp and ppy tsp membrane are shown in fig 3 a d the images showed the difference in surface morphology of inorganic material composite and composite membrane fig 3 a and fig 3 b show the granular morphology however the sem image of ppy tsp nanocomposite shows tsp nanoparticles are well embedded in the polymer matrix with uniform dispersion fig 3 c and fig 3 d shows sem images of ppy tsp membrane indicating successful preparation of membrane 3 2 4 thermo gravimetric analysis fig 4 shows the tga curve of ppy tsp ppy tsp nanocomposite and ppy tsp membrane in case of ppy the weight loss was observed in two stages at 200 c 10 27 and at 300 c 14 05 the first one due to physisorbed water molecule and volatile impurities and in second one due to degradation of the polymer about 31 11 weight was lost gradually up to 1000 c due to degradation of polymer in the case of tsp the first weight loss was observed at 100 c 5 67 due to removal of external water molecules and second weight loss up to 600 c 17 54 due to degradation of inorganic part of the material after 600 c the tsp was found stable up to 1000 c 1 6 weight loss in ppy tsp nanocomposite the first weight loss at 100 c 5 67 weight loss due to removal of external water molecules and second weight loss up to 900 c 8 03 weight because of degradation of ppy the total loss of mass up to 1000 c has been estimated to be about 65 43 23 37 and 38 64 for ppy tsp and ppy tsp respectively on heating up to 1000 c the amount of tsp present in the ppy tsp matrix is calculated as 47 02 from the above data the minimum loss of tsp from ppy tsp composite confirms that the presence of tsp in ppy tsp nanocomposite is responsible for the higher thermal stability of the composite material in comparison to pristine ppy from tga curve of ppy tsp composite ion exchange membrane it can be observed that ppy tsp composite membrane is stable up to 375 c after that there is gradual weight loss is appeared up to 575 c due to the removal of water absorbed in the polymer chain removal of water of crystallization of tsp and decomposition of polymer chain of the membrane another weight appeared at appeared at 700 c which may conversion of titanium sulphosalicylo phosphate into pyrophosphate due to the condensation f p oh groups guilbault 1981 umezawa et al 1995 fig s 3 shows the dta curve of pure ppy tsp ppy tsp nanocomposite and ppy tsp membrane dta curve of ppy tsp and ppy tsp indicate their endothermic peaks at near about 100 c correspond to removal of external water molecules one exothermic peak at 300 c in ppy and one exothermic peak at 800 c of ppy tsp are due to the polymeric degradation of material however the maximum degradation of the composite material was observed at 800 c in the case of ppy tsp membrane one endothermic peak appeared at 400 c due to the removal of water absorbed in the polymer chain removal of water of crystallization of tsp and decomposition of polymer chain two exothermic peaks appeared around 500 c of the membrane may be due to decomposition of polymer and inorganic materials thus it could be concluded from the dtg analysis that the rate of thermal decomposition was higher in the case of pristine ppy where as in the case of ppy tsp nanocomposite the rate of thermal decomposition is lower the better thermal resistance of ppy tsp nanocomposite was due to incorporation of tsp nanoparticles with polymer matrix 3 2 5 energy dispersive x ray analysis fig 5 shows the edax patterns of ppy tsp membrane the edx result shows that ppy tsp membrane after binding with pvc contains c n cl p o s and ti with the percentage compositions of elements are given in table 2 edax studies have provided clear evidence that ppy tsp membrane has been successfully prepared with pvc as binder 3 3 selectivity 3 3 1 selectivity by distribution coefficient kd values for the preparation of an ion selective membrane electrode selectivity of composite material ptsp 4 was determine by distribution studies of 5 metal ions in 9 different solvent systems the results of distribution studies table 3 indicated that kd values varied with the nature of ionic species in solution and contacting solvents it was observed from the distribution studies kd values that the pb2 was highly adsorbed in all solvents while remaining metal ions were poorly adsorbed the preference of pb2 by ppy tsp composite in comparison to the other ions depends on its smaller hydrated radii of pb2 4 01 å in comparison to other ions cd2 4 26 å cu2 4 19 å hg2 4 13 å and cr3 4 61 å pretsch 2007 the maximum numbers of pb2 ions are retained in the small pores of inorganic titanium iv sulphosalicylo phosphate matrices of the composite ion exchange material the high uptake of lead ions in all solvents demonstrate not only the ion exchange properties but also the adsorption and ion selective characteristics of the cation exchanger thus we can say that this composite cation exchanger is highly selective for lead and can be utilized for the determination of lead from waste water 3 3 2 selectivity by dc electrical conductivity measurement selectivity of composite material ptsp 4 for the preparation of an ion selective membrane electrode was also determine by dc electrical conductivity measurement of ppy tsp dipped in 5 different metal ion solutions of 0 1 m concentration fig 6 it was observed from fig that dc electrical conductivity of ppy tsp dipped in 0 1 m pb2 ion solution was found to be higher than cu2 hg2 cd2 cr3 ion solutions at same concentration it may be due to high adsorption of pb2 ion from the solution because of its smaller hydrated radii while remaining metal ions were poorly adsorbed the high uptake of lead ions increase the charge carrier in the matrices of materials which enhance the dc electrical conductivity of ppy tsp the high uptake of lead ion not only demonstrate the ion exchange properties but also the adsorption of lead ion thus we can say that this composite cation exchanger is highly selective for lead and can be utilized for the determination of lead from waste water 3 4 physicochemical characterization of ppy tsp composite membrane physicochemical characterization of membrane is essential before using it as ion selective electrode yin et al 2012 baig et al 2015 thickness swelling porosity water content capacity etc of the ppy tsp cation exchange composite membrane was investigated and the results are summarized in table 4 it was observed that increase in amount of illustrative components of the membrane i e ppy tsp composite increases the thickness swelling water content porosity membrane with lower orders of water content swelling and porosity with less thickness suggest that the interstices are negligible and diffusion across the membrane would occur primarily through the exchange sites the membrane with good surface qualities like porosity thickness and swelling etc was selected for further studies hence on the basis of iec water content thickness and porosity of the membrane m 2 thickness 0 2 mm was selected for further studies table 4 3 5 electro analytical studies of ppy tsp ion exchange membrane when ion selective membrane is placed between two electrolyte solutions of the same nature with different concentrations the migration of ions occurs mainly through the process of diffusion leading to creation of electrical potential difference membrane potential across the membrane ppy tsp ion selective membrane electrode when placed between the two pb no3 2 solutions at different concentrations the tsp of ppy tsp composite material plays an important role of repulsing the anions of solution and attracting the cations hence the ion exchange phenomenon predominates the ion selective to membrane are exchanged by h present on its surface thus producing an electrical potential difference i e membrane potential 3 5 1 potentiometric selectivity the ion selectivity of electrode is one of the important characteristics of the ion selective electrodes it indicates whether reliable measurement in the target sample is possible or not it was determined by the mixed solution method msm table 5 shows that no interference in the performance of the membrane electrode assembly was observed because of low values of selectivity coefficient of interfering ions such high selectivity of the proposed ion selective electrode over other ions reflects high affinity of the membrane towards pb2 3 5 2 working concentration range and slope the membrane electrical potential varies with the concentration and electrical properties of ionic species this causes variations in potentiometric response fig 7 shows the potentiometric response of ppy tsp membrane electrode m 2 over a wide concentration range 1 0 10 10 m to 1 0 10 1 m the electrode shows a linear response in the concentration range of 1 10 8 m to 1 0 10 1 m of pb2 with an average nerstian slope of 30 10 mv per decade change in concentrations the intersection of extrapolated segments of calibration graph gives the limit of detection as 1 10 8 m however the deviations from the linearity appearing at high pb2 concentrations are due to the differences between activities and concentrations thus the working concentration range of membrane m 2 was found to be 1 10 8 m to 1 0 10 1 m for pb2 3 5 3 effect of ph on electrode potential and response time the effect of ph on the electrode response for a fixed concentration of pb2 ions 1 0 10 2 m at different ph values were determined the potential remains unaffected within the ph range of 3 7 with an uncertainty of 1 mv fig 8 it means the electrode can work in slightly acidic to neutral medium the abrupt change in potential below ph 2 may be due to the interferences produced by h ions co fluxing of h ions while a sharp change in potential above ph 8 can be associated with the hydrolysis of pb2 ions response time is also an important factor for ion selective electrode it is defined as the time required for the electrode to reach a stable potential after successive immersion of the electrode in different ion solutions each having a 10 fold difference in concentration the response time of the membrane in contact with 1 10 2 m was found to 25 s which is evident from fig 9 the shelf life of membrane was found to be 12 months during this period it could be successfully used without any notable drift in potential reproducible within 1 mv per concentration decade whenever a drift in the potential was observed the membrane was re equilibrated with 1 0 10 1 m pb2 solution for 3 4 days 3 5 4 potentiometric titration in the potentiometric titration of pb2 against an edta solution the pb2 selective electrode was used as an indicator electrode the edta binds with pb2 to form complex as a result amount of free pb2 in the solution decreases gradually and it is manifested in potential drop across the electrode fig 10 a sharp equivalence point is evident from the resultant titration curve this curve can be used to accurately determine the amount of pb2 in solution hence the practical and analytical utility of the proposed composite cation exchanger membrane electrode is established 3 5 5 accuracy under laboratory conditions the ion selective membrane electrode was found working well the electrode results were validated with aas spectrophotometry for its accuracy these were found to be in close agreement with aas spectrophotometry the concentration of an unknown solution of pb2 was found to be 5 10 ppm from the calibration curve fig 7 whereas it was found to be 4 08 ppm by aas table 6 shows the comparative working concentration range response time life time ph range and detection limit of the proposed electrode in comparison to other reported pb2 ion selective electrode khan et al 2015 2009 chen et al 2010 srivastava et al 1978 jain and singh 1981 khan 2005 the results clearly indicated the superiority of the proposed electrode in terms of linear range ph response behavior and detection limit 4 conclusion in the present research work a novel organic inorganic polypyrrole titanium iv sulphosalicylo phosphate composite ion exchange membrane was prepared by solution casting method and characterized by using different instrumentation techniques the prepared membrane show good ion exchange capacity relatively high selectivity towards pb2 ions and was used to develop ion selective electrode for determination of pb2 ions in aqueous solution in the concentration range of 1 10 8 m to 1 0 10 1 m the obtained results shows that pb2 selective membrane electrode has good operating characteristics including nernstian response reasonable detection limit wide dynamic range fast response and can be operated over the ph range from 3 to 7 these characteristics and the typical applications presented in this work make the sensor a suitable one for measuring pb2 content in real samples without a significant interaction from anionic species acknowledgements authors are

important role in determining the selectivity of the material it is the measure of a fraction uptake of metal ions competing for h ions from a solution by an ion exchange material kd values of some heavy metal ions such as cu2 hg2 cd2 pb2 cr3 with 0 1 m concentration were determined on ppy tsp ptsp 4 table 3 by batch method in different aqueous solvents khan et al 2010 200 mg of the composite

at constant ionic strength the electrode response was measured at room temperature as described by iupac commission for analytical nomenclature khan and alam 2003 the membrane electrode was conditioned by soaking in 0 1 m pb no3 2 solution for 4 5 days before use the calibration curves of the measured electrode potential were plotted against logarithm of pb2 ion concentration to check the reproducibility of the electrode assembly measurement was repeated for three times 2 8 2 effect of ph various solution of pb no3 2 at constant ion concentration 1 10 2 m with ph ranging from 1 to

polypyrrole is shown in scheme 1 the ion exchanger sample ptsp 4 possessed better na ion exchange capacity 2 10 meq g as compared to the inorganic tsp sample tsp 2 table s1 1 40 meq g the iec of ppy tsp composite was increased due to addition of conductive polymer into the inorganic material tsp which increases the surface area of the material thus exchangeable ionic sites were increased due to the better ion exchange capacity sample ptsp 4 table s2 was selected for membrane preparation a number of samples of the ppy tsp nanocomposite membrane were prepared with different amount composite with fixed amount of polyvinylchloride as binder prepared membrane samples were checked for mechanical stability surface uniformity materials distribution and thickness etc on the basis of physicochemical characterization and good ion exchange capacity 0 8 meq g 1 membrane m 2 is selected for electro analytical studies condition of preparation and iec of ppy tsp composite ion exchanger membrane were given in table 1 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 ftir spectroscopic analysis fig 1 shows the ftir spectra of ppy tsp nanocomposite and ppy tsp nanocomposite membrane ftir spectra of ppy tsp nanocomposite shows a sharp peak at 3509 cm 1 may be attributed to the oh stretching frequency peak at 2940 cm 1 suggest the presence of secondary amino group nh stretching vibration and a broad band between 1250 and 800 cm 1 with a peak of intensity at 1042 cm 1 is due to presence of ionic phosphate group whereas peak at 795 cm 1 is attributed to m o bonding the stretching vibration of c n c c and c h stretching vibration in pyrrole ring observed at 1225 cm 1 1559 cm 1 and 3050 cm 1 respectively indicates that the polymerization of ppy has been successfully achieved on the surface of the tsp particles in ftir spectra of ppy tsp membrane the peaks appearing at 3519 cm 1 may be attributed to oh stretching frequency of water bound to polymer chain while a peak 2940 cm 1 suggest the presence of secondary amino group nh stretching vibration the peaks at 1600 cm 1 1310 cm 1 indicate the existence of c c c c stretching vibrations in addition peak of intensity at 1042 cm 1 is due to presence of ionic phosphate group whereas peak at 795 cm 1 is attributed to m o bonding day and underwood 2001 3 2 2 x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 2 illustrates the xrd pattern of tsp ppy tsp and ppy tsp membrane in the 2θ range between 0 and 80 it is evident from the xrd pattern that the ppy tsp composite is amorphous in nature with the diffraction peaks centered at 2θ 22 which is very close to characteristic peak of polypyrrole 2θ 26 khan and shaheen 2013 xrd pattern of ppy tsp membrane shows amorphous nature with a broad peak at 2θ 22 similar to diffraction of ppy tsp composite which suggest successful preparation of ppy tsp membrane 3 2 3 scanning electron microscopy sem studies sem images of tsp ppy tsp and ppy tsp membrane are shown in fig 3 a d the images showed the difference in surface morphology of inorganic material composite and composite membrane fig 3 a and fig 3 b show the granular morphology however the sem image of ppy tsp nanocomposite shows tsp nanoparticles are well embedded in the polymer matrix with uniform dispersion fig 3 c and fig 3 d shows sem images of ppy tsp membrane indicating successful preparation of membrane 3 2 4 thermo gravimetric analysis fig 4 shows the tga curve of ppy tsp ppy tsp nanocomposite and ppy tsp membrane in case of ppy the weight loss was observed in two stages at 200 c 10 27 and at 300 c 14 05 the first one due to physisorbed water molecule and volatile impurities and in second one due to degradation of the polymer about 31 11 weight was lost gradually up to 1000 c due to degradation of polymer in the case of tsp the first weight loss was observed at 100 c 5 67 due to removal of external water molecules and second weight loss up to 600 c 17 54 due to degradation of inorganic part of the material after 600 c the tsp was found stable up to 1000 c 1 6 weight loss in ppy tsp nanocomposite the first weight loss at 100 c 5 67 weight loss due to removal of external water molecules and second weight loss up to 900 c 8 03 weight because of degradation of ppy the total loss of mass up to 1000 c has been estimated to be about 65 43 23 37 and 38 64 for ppy tsp and ppy tsp respectively on heating up to 1000 c the amount of tsp present in the ppy tsp matrix is calculated as 47 02 from the above data the minimum loss of tsp from ppy tsp composite confirms that the presence of tsp in ppy tsp nanocomposite is responsible for the higher thermal stability of the composite material in comparison to pristine ppy from tga curve of ppy tsp composite ion exchange membrane it can be observed that ppy tsp composite membrane is stable up to 375 c after that there is gradual weight loss is appeared up to 575 c due to the removal of water absorbed in the polymer chain removal of water of crystallization of tsp and decomposition of polymer chain of the membrane another weight appeared at appeared at 700 c which may conversion of titanium sulphosalicylo phosphate into pyrophosphate due to the condensation f p oh groups guilbault 1981 umezawa et al 1995 fig s 3 shows the dta curve of pure ppy tsp ppy tsp nanocomposite and ppy tsp membrane dta curve of ppy tsp and ppy tsp indicate their endothermic peaks at near about 100 c correspond to removal of external water molecules one exothermic peak at 300 c in ppy and one exothermic peak at 800 c of ppy tsp are due to the polymeric degradation of material however the maximum degradation of the composite material was observed at 800 c in the case of ppy tsp membrane one endothermic peak appeared at 400 c due to the removal of water absorbed in the polymer chain removal of water of crystallization of tsp and decomposition of polymer chain two exothermic peaks appeared around 500 c of the membrane may be due to decomposition of polymer and inorganic materials thus it could be concluded from the dtg analysis that the rate of thermal decomposition was higher in the case of pristine ppy where as in the case of ppy tsp nanocomposite the rate of thermal decomposition is lower the better thermal resistance of ppy tsp nanocomposite was due to incorporation of tsp nanoparticles with polymer matrix 3 2 5 energy dispersive x ray analysis fig 5 shows the edax patterns of ppy tsp membrane the edx result shows that ppy tsp membrane after binding with pvc contains c n cl p o s and ti with the percentage compositions of elements are given in table 2 edax studies have provided clear evidence that ppy tsp membrane has been successfully prepared with pvc as binder 3 3 selectivity 3 3 1 selectivity by distribution coefficient kd values for the preparation of an ion selective membrane electrode selectivity of composite material ptsp 4 was determine by distribution studies of 5 metal ions in 9 different solvent systems the results of distribution studies table 3 indicated that kd values varied with the nature of ionic species in solution and contacting solvents it was observed from the distribution studies kd values that the pb2 was highly adsorbed in all solvents while remaining metal ions were poorly adsorbed the preference of pb2 by ppy tsp composite in comparison to the other ions depends on its smaller hydrated radii of pb2 4 01 å in comparison to other ions cd2 4 26 å cu2 4 19 å hg2 4 13 å and cr3 4 61 å pretsch 2007 the maximum numbers of pb2 ions are retained in the small pores of inorganic titanium iv sulphosalicylo phosphate matrices of the composite ion exchange material the high uptake of lead ions in all solvents demonstrate not only the ion exchange properties but also the adsorption and ion selective characteristics of the cation exchanger thus we can say that this composite cation exchanger is highly selective for lead and can be utilized for the determination of lead from waste water 3 3 2 selectivity by dc electrical conductivity measurement selectivity of composite material ptsp 4 for the preparation of an ion selective membrane electrode was also determine by dc electrical conductivity measurement of ppy tsp dipped in 5 different metal ion solutions of 0 1 m concentration fig 6 it was observed from fig that dc electrical conductivity of ppy tsp dipped in 0 1 m pb2 ion solution was found to be higher than cu2 hg2 cd2 cr3 ion solutions at same concentration it may be due to high adsorption of pb2 ion from the solution because of its smaller hydrated radii while remaining metal ions were poorly adsorbed the high uptake of lead ions increase the charge carrier in the matrices of materials which enhance the dc electrical conductivity of ppy tsp the high uptake of lead ion not only demonstrate the ion exchange properties but also the adsorption of lead ion thus we can say that this composite cation exchanger is highly selective for lead and can be utilized for the determination of lead from waste water 3 4 physicochemical characterization of ppy tsp composite membrane physicochemical characterization of membrane is essential before using it as ion selective electrode yin et al 2012 baig et al 2015 thickness swelling porosity water content capacity etc of the ppy tsp cation exchange composite membrane was investigated and the results are summarized in table 4 it was observed that increase in amount of illustrative components of the membrane i e ppy tsp composite increases the thickness swelling water content porosity membrane with lower orders of water content swelling and porosity with less thickness suggest that the interstices are negligible and diffusion across the membrane would occur primarily through the exchange sites the membrane with good surface qualities like porosity thickness and swelling etc was selected for further studies hence on the basis of iec water content thickness and porosity of the membrane m 2 thickness 0 2 mm was selected for further studies table 4 3 5 electro analytical studies of ppy tsp ion exchange membrane when ion selective membrane is placed between two electrolyte solutions of the same nature with different concentrations the migration of ions occurs mainly through the process of diffusion leading to creation of electrical potential difference membrane potential across the membrane ppy tsp ion selective membrane electrode when placed between the two pb no3 2 solutions at different concentrations the tsp of ppy tsp composite material plays an important role of repulsing the anions of solution and attracting the cations hence the ion exchange phenomenon predominates the ion selective to membrane are exchanged by h present on its surface thus producing an electrical potential difference i e membrane potential 3 5 1 potentiometric selectivity the ion selectivity of electrode is one of the important characteristics of the ion selective electrodes it indicates whether reliable measurement in the target sample is possible or not it was determined by the mixed solution method msm table 5 shows that no interference in the performance of the membrane electrode assembly was observed because of low values of selectivity coefficient of interfering ions such high selectivity of the proposed ion selective electrode over other ions reflects high affinity of the membrane towards pb2 3 5 2 working concentration range and slope the membrane electrical potential varies with the concentration and electrical properties of ionic species this causes variations in potentiometric response fig 7 shows the potentiometric response of ppy tsp membrane electrode m 2 over a wide concentration range 1 0 10 10 m to 1 0 10 1 m the electrode shows a linear response in the concentration range of 1 10 8 m to 1 0 10 1 m of pb2 with an average nerstian slope of 30 10 mv per decade change in concentrations the intersection of extrapolated segments of calibration graph gives the limit of detection as 1 10 8 m however the deviations from the linearity appearing at high pb2 concentrations are due to the differences between activities and concentrations thus the working concentration range of membrane m 2 was found to be 1 10 8 m to 1 0 10 1 m for pb2 3 5 3 effect of ph on electrode potential and response time the effect of ph on the electrode response for a fixed concentration of pb2 ions 1 0 10 2 m at different ph values were determined the potential remains unaffected within the ph range of 3 7 with an uncertainty of 1 mv fig 8 it means the electrode can work in slightly acidic to neutral medium the abrupt change in potential below ph 2 may be due to the interferences produced by h ions co fluxing of h ions while a sharp change in potential above ph 8 can be associated with the hydrolysis of pb2 ions response time is also an important factor for ion selective electrode it is defined as the time required for the electrode to reach a stable potential after successive immersion of the electrode in different ion solutions each having a 10 fold difference in concentration the response time of the membrane in contact with 1 10 2 m was found to 25 s which is evident from fig 9 the shelf life of membrane was found to be 12 months during this period it could be successfully used without any notable drift in potential reproducible within 1 mv per concentration decade whenever a drift in the potential was observed the membrane was re equilibrated with 1 0 10 1 m pb2 solution for 3 4 days 3 5 4 potentiometric titration in the potentiometric titration of pb2 against an edta solution the pb2 selective electrode was used as an indicator electrode the edta binds with pb2 to form complex as a result amount of free pb2 in the solution decreases gradually and it is manifested in potential drop across the electrode fig 10 a sharp equivalence point is evident from the resultant titration curve this curve can be used to accurately determine the amount of pb2 in solution hence the practical and analytical utility of the proposed composite cation exchanger membrane electrode is established 3 5 5 accuracy under laboratory conditions the ion selective membrane electrode was found working well the electrode results were validated with aas spectrophotometry for its accuracy these were found to be in close agreement with aas spectrophotometry the concentration of an unknown solution of pb2 was found to be 5 10 ppm from the calibration curve fig 7 whereas it was found to be 4 08 ppm by aas table 6 shows the comparative working concentration range response time life time ph range and detection limit of the proposed electrode in comparison to other reported pb2 ion selective electrode khan et al 2015 2009 chen et al 2010 srivastava et al 1978 jain and singh 1981 khan 2005 the results clearly indicated the superiority of the proposed electrode in terms of linear range ph response behavior and detection limit 4 conclusion in the present research work a novel organic inorganic polypyrrole titanium iv sulphosalicylo phosphate composite ion exchange membrane was prepared by solution casting method and characterized by using different instrumentation techniques the prepared membrane show good ion exchange capacity relatively high selectivity towards pb2 ions and was used to develop ion selective electrode for determination of pb2 ions in aqueous solution in the concentration range of 1 10 8 m to 1 0 10 1 m the obtained results shows that pb2 selective membrane electrode has good operating characteristics including nernstian response reasonable detection limit wide dynamic range fast response and can be operated over the ph range from 3 to 7 these characteristics and the typical applications presented in this work make the sensor a suitable one for measuring pb2 content in real samples without a significant interaction from anionic species acknowledgements authors are

2015 islam et al 2017d aghazadeh et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 and pazand et al 2018 a large number of groundwater studies also have focused on the assessments of suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes sarikhani et al 2015 keesari et al 2016 islam et al 2017b 2017d rahman et al 2017 iqbal et al 2018 saha et al 2018 the measurement of pollutant concentration at every point is not feasible due to time constraint and cost therefore spatial analysis using gis tool got popularity as alternative option to understand the pollution distribution webster and oliver 2007 bhattacharya et al 2011 islam et al 2016 moreover the application of different multivariate statistical techniques helps in the interpretation of complex data matrices and to better understand the water quality kumar et al 2017 islam et al 2017a 2017b these techniques also used to the identification of possible factors or sources that influence the water systems omo irabor et al 2008 islam et al 2018 the combined approaches of multivariate statistics and spatial analysis thus provide a reliable and valuable tools for reliable management of water resources in these background the aims of this study was to investigate the groundwater evolution and to characterize the natural and anthropogenic influences with a special emphasis on groundwater quality the study also intended to identify the factors that influence the groundwater and their spatial distribution for sustainable aquifers management in dhaka city area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dhaka city is located at the center of the bengal delta which lies between 23 40 n to 23 54 n latitude and 90 20 e to 90 31 e longitude fig 1 the city covering an area of 370 km2 and bounded by the interconnecting streams i e tongi canal to the north the buriganga river to the south the turag river to west and the balu river to the east fig 1 topographically dhaka is situated at the southern half of the madhupur tract pleistocene terrace and floodplain area hoque at el 2007 geologically the city is situated in the pleistocene uplifted block madhupur tract within the passive margin surrounded by subsiding floodplains the primary aquifer of dhaka city consists of unconsolidated sediments of the dupi tila formation which are overlain by the madhupur clay an approximately 48 m thick aquitard dwasa 2013 the groundwater is obtained locally from underlying fluvio deltaic sands of the highly productive dupi tila aquifer which is locally reported to be about 140 m thick morris et al 2003 the dupi tila formation is mainly composed of fine to coarse grained micaceous quartzofeldspathic sands iron oxyhydroxides and kaolinite are common weathering products of the original mafic rich sediments burgess et al 2011 from the lithologies and cross section the subsurface geology within 600 m of depth of dhaka city are sub divided into the six lithologic categories i e clay fine sand fine to medium sand medium sand medium to coarse sand and gravel bed fig 2 the dupi tila formation sands contain laterally discontinuous silts and clays fig 2 these fine grained units divide the aquifers into upper dupi tila aquifer udta and lower dupi tila aquifer ldta dwasa 2008 ahmed et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 the udta mainly composed of fine sand and fine to medium sand also occasional presence of medium sand and medium to coarse sand on the contrary ldta composed of medium sand and medium to coarse sand making it an excellent aquifer with a high hydraulic conductivity and a high storage capacity hoque et al 2007 burgess et al 2011 sultana 2009 rahman et al 2013 the aquifer has no outcrop on the madhupur tract itself but comparison of river bed elevations with the top of the dupi tila sands demonstrates that direct contact between the river buriganga and the aquifer is possible along certain reaches hasan et al 1998 it is possible that contact between the rivers surrounding dhaka and the dupi tila aquifer is more extensive than supposed burgess et al 2011 like other parts of the country the climate of the city is under humid sub tropical monsoon climate the mean annual rainfall is approximately 2000 mm and more than 80 of this occurs during the monsoon period from june to september monthly average temperatures range between 25 and 31 c while average humidity and evaporation range between 80 and 90 and 80 130 mm respectively bmd 2016 from quite long time the city faces problems related to waterlogging drainage congestions untreated waste disposal pollution and change in the hydrogeological system rahman et al 2013 hossain et al 2018 2 2 sampling and analytical procedure a total of 33 groundwater samples were collected from pre selected 26 production wells of dwasa and 7 household private wells of dhaka city area fig 1 since april 2016 the depths of the wells were varied from 57 91 to 320 04 m geographical locations of the wells were determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well were pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained usgs 2006 groundwater samples were filtered using cellulose acetate filter 0 45 µm for cations and anion analyses following the procedure of bhattacharya et al 2002 the samples were collected in 500 ml high density polypropylene bottles rinsed with 1 hno3 and washed with distilled water and properly labelled then samples were shipped to atomic energy center dhaka and stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 c in dark until analysis being performed the physicochemical parameters such as temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured on spot with calibrated portable instruments the ph meter model sensiontm1 hach international usa was employed to measure ph of groundwater temperature ec and tds were measured by using a conductivity meter jenway model 4520 the concentrations of major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions f cl br no3 so4 2 po4 3 were measured by ion chromatography model dionex dx 3000 usa using ionpac cs17 and ionpac as11 hc analytical columns respectively the instrument was calibrated with standards six cation ii standard and seven anion ii standard the standard was prepared by the dissolution of high purity salts in 18 2 megohm deionized water which was tested by the ic for ionic contaminants samples were diluted several times and the relative standard deviation of measured ions was found to be within 3 alkalinity hco3 was determined using digital titrator model 16900 hach international usa and 1 6 n h2so4 cartridge the accuracy of the chemical analyses was checked by taking the relationship between the total cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions f cl br no3 so4 2 po4 3 hco3 for each set of complete analyses of water sample using the ion charge balance equation mathhess 1982 by following 1 e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 where e is the error percent reaction error and cations and anions are the sum of the total cations and total anions expressed in miliequivalents per liter the reaction cationic and anionic balance error e of all the groundwater samples was less than the accepted limit of 10 an added proof of the precision of the data in addition the reaction error e of few groundwater samples greater than 10 which was eliminated from the subsequent analyses ravikumar et al 2011 2 3 multivariate statistical analysis multivariate statistics are useful tools to attaining significant information from hydrochemical data set in the groundwater system islam et al 2018 to evaluate the analytical data multivariate statistical techniques i e correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were used in this study by using spss version 22 0 software for windows parametric statistical methods were also used to calculate the normal statistical parameters i e range mean and standard deviation for the water quality parameters pearson s correlation matrix was used to identify the relationship among the pairs of parameters when more than two variables were considered simultaneously multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate their interdependency the coefficient of determination is more readily interpretable than r as a measure of the degree of association because r 2 is equal to the proportion of the total variability in the dependent variable that may be ascribed to the effects of the independent or causative variables adhikary et al 2009 in order to understand the geochemical processes and the sources of major anions and cations in groundwater hydrochemical data were subjected to pca that allowed to group them based on their inherited properties the pca was performed with an orthogonal kaiser s varimax rotation to make the factors more interpretable without changing the dataset mertler and vannatta 2005 islam et al 2018 the varimax rotation can successfully reduce the contribution of less significant parameters in the groundwater quality obtained from the pca the first pca was accounting for the highest variance in the dataset followed by the next pca and so on cluster analysis ca was further applied to identify groups or clusters of similar sites on the basis of similarities within a class and dissimilarities between different classes lattin et al 2003 bhuiyan et al 2016 hierarchical clustering is the most popular approach which provides intuitive similarity relationships between any one sample and the entire data set and can be illustrated by a dendrogram mckenna 2003 the dendrogram provides a visual summary of the clustering processes presenting a picture of the groups and their proximity with a dramatic reduction in dimensionality of the original data bhuiyan et al 2016 in the study ward s method with squared euclidean distances is used by following lattin et al 2003 2 4 spatial analysis inverse distance weighted idw method of arc gis version 10 1 was applied in this study for spatial analysis this method is comparatively easy and provide high accuracy compared to other interpolation methods like kriging islam et al 2018 the idw method estimates the values of an attribute at un sampled points using a linear combination of values at sampled points weighted by an inverse function of the distance from the point of interest to the sampled points the assumption is that sampled points closer to the un sampled point are more similar to it than those further away in their values the weights can be expressed as following 2 λ ᵢ 1 d ᵢ ᴾ i 1 n 1 d ᵢ ᴾ where d i is the distance between x 0 and x i p is a power parameter and n represents the number of sampled points used for the estimation the main factor affecting the accuracy of idw is the value of the power parameter islam et al 2017c the choice of power parameter and neighborhood size is arbitrary webster and oliver 2001 the most popular choice of p is 2 and the resulting method is often called inverse square distance or inverse distance squared ids 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry and water quality the results of measured parameters of groundwater samples of the study area are summarized in table 1 with the comparison of standard permissible limits the measured water temperatures varied from 24 to 29 5 c with an average of 27 33 c the ph of groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline ranging from 6 66 to 8 19 with a mean value of 7 25 the ph indicates the strength of the water to react with the acidic or alkaline material presents in water islam et al 2017d electric conductivity is considered as one of the important parameters to classify the drinking water quality subramani et al 2005 islam 2014 the ec of the water samples ranges from 55 0 to 353 0 μs cm with a mean of 117 44 μs cm this mean values lies within the permissible limit recommended by usepa 2006 and who 2011 for drinking purpose table 1 subsequently tds has an average value of 70 26 mg l that ranges from 32 90 to 211 0 mg l according to who 2011 recommendation tds up to 500 mg l is the highest desirable and up to 1000 mg l is maximum permissible suggested by doe 1997 bangladesh standard all of the samples of the study area fall within permissible limit sodium na concentration ranged from 10 95 to 274 73 mg l with an average value of 36 34 mg l the maximum allowable limit of na concentration in groundwater is 200 mg l set by doe 1997 who 2011 and eu 1998 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit except one sample s29 this may be attributed to the weathering of rock forming minerals like sodium plagioclase and halite and the influence of domestic and animal wastes selvam et al 2016 potassium k concentration varied from 1 34 to 12 94 mg l with an average value of 3 31 mg l the maximum allowable limit of k in groundwater is 12 0 mg l doe 1997 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit except s7 calcium ca2 concentration ranged from 9 86 to 45 75 mg l with an average value of 24 78 mg l the maximum allowable limit of ca2 in groundwater is 75 mg l as per doe 1997 and who 2011 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit the average value of magnesium mg2 is 10 77 mg l with the ranged from 4 4 to 25 34 mg l within the permissible limit table 1 mg2 occurs in groundwater due to dissolution of magnesium bearing minerals in rocks and animal domestic and industrial wastes selvam et al 2016 the mean value of chloride cl is 30 32 mg l with ranges from 1 03 to 289 73 mg l maximum allowable limit of cl concentration in groundwater is 250 mg l set by eu 1998 usepa 2006 who 2011 bis 2012 and 150 600 mg l by doe 1997 according to bangladesh standard all the samples fall within the permissible limit the average concentration of fluoride f bromide br sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 are 0 28 2 33 7 55 3 68 0 101 mg l respectively where all the samples fall within the permissible limits table 1 but in case of no3 one sample s5 exceed the permissible limit of doe 1997 and usepa 2006 standards no3 derived from agricultural and industrial areas due to leaching from plant nutrients nitrate fertilizers and domestic and industrial waste barzegar et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 the average value of bicarbonate hco3 is 131 52 mg l and ranged from 59 0 to 303 0 mg l dissolution of carbonate minerals like calcite and dolomite may contribute bicarbonate in groundwater selvam et al 2016 the variation of major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl f so4 2 no3 hco3 in groundwater samples is illustrated in the box and whisker plot fig 3 where na and hco3 are the dominant cation and anion respectively it showed that the order of relative abundance of major cations in the groundwater is na ca2 mg2 k while the anion is hco3 cl so4 2 no3 br f po4 3 ec of the groundwater samples showed large percentages of contribution are from na hco3 and cl since conductivity is a linear function of tds and for that matter the mineral salt content of groundwater kortatsi 2007 3 2 hydrochemical facies the total hardness th in mg l was determined by 2 497ca2 4 115 mg2 according to todd 1980 th in the groundwater varied from 43 04 to 206 67 mg l with an average value of 106 21 mg l table 1 it is an important parameter in decreasing the toxic effect of poisonous element and important criterion in determining the suitability of water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses thakur et al 2015 islam et al 2017d hardness of the water results from the presence of divalent metallic cations of which calcium and magnesium abundant jacintha et al 2017 a detailed classification of groundwater quality based on tds and th kumar 2014 is shown in fig 4 where all the samples were classified as soft fresh groundwater the concentrations of major ions determined in groundwater samples are presented in the piper 1953 trilinear plot fig 5 these plots include two triangles one for cations and the other for anions the cations and anion fields are combined to explain a single point in a diamond shaped field which inference is drawn on the basis of the hydrochemical facies concept ravikumar et al 2011 hydrochemical facies are distinct zones that possess cation and anion concentration and help to identify the water classes islam et al 2017d ahmed et al 2018 the diagram revealed that four types i e ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na k cl so4 2 na k hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 are the predominant facies type fig 5 most of the samples in this study belong to ca2 mg2 hco3 type followed by ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na k cl so4 2 and na k hco3 respectively durov 1948 introduced another diagram which provides more information on hydrochemical facies to identify the water types it displayed some possible geochemical processes that used to understanding the quality of groundwater and its evaluation onwuka and omonona 2017 this diagram is a composite plot consisting of two ternary diagrams where the cations of interest are plotted against the anions of interest the plot of major cations and anions are presented in durov diagram fig 6 mixed water types prevail in the study area after plotted on the diagram where 9 samples 27 27 fall in the field 5 of durov plot along the dissolution or mixing line according to lloyd and heathcoat 1985 the trend can be attributed to fresh recharge which exhibit simple dissolution or mixing with no dominant major anion or cation a total of 22 samples 66 67 fall in the field 6 showing so4 2 and na as anion and cation dominant respectively this association indicates probable mixing or uncommon dissolution influences ravikumar et al 2011 moreover only 2 samples 6 06 showing cl and na as dominant anion and cation indicated that the ground water samples are related to reverse ion exchange of na cl waters 3 3 hydrogeochemical processes evaluation gibbs plot gibbs 1970 was used to determine the mechanism controlling the groundwater chemistry the measured parameters of groundwater were plotted in gibbs diagram and found that groundwater samples have been affected largely by rock water interaction and mainly dominated by precipitation fig 7 these may have influenced by chemical weathering of rock forming minerals bhuiyan et al 2015 pazand et al 2018 the processes responsible for major solutes of groundwater are most likely controlled by mineral dissolution the cl anions ratios of groundwater samples varied from 0 0003 to 0 076 with an average value of 0 008 table 2 in contrast the hco3 anion ratios ranges from 0 009 to 0 046 with an average value of 0 020 table 2 these results suggest that rock weathering mostly silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and evaporate dissolution take dominant part in the aquifers halim et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018 the rock water interaction is a broad classification that encompasses all lithogenic influences like silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and evaporates dissolution kumar 2014 this result has been refined by plotting the bivariate plots of ca2 na vs hco3 na and ca2 na vs mg2 na fig 8a b both plots showed that silicate weathering and evaporation dissolution take part as the major processes that control the groundwater solute content furthermore plots of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 and na k vs hco3 also support the similar picture presented in fig 9 a b most of the groundwater samples fall along the 1 2 line on bivariate plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 and na k vs hco3 suggest that silicate weathering as a dominant process to introduce major ions in groundwater of the study area verma et al 2015 ahmed et al 2018 however groundwater samples of the study area showed a molar na k cl ratio 1 possibly indicating silicate weathering mukherjee et al 2008 calcium ca2 in groundwater can be derived from incongruent dissolution of plagioclase al ruwaih and qabazard 2005 which was found to be somewhat linearly related to mg2 r2 0 731 fig 10a the reaction involves the incongruent dissolution of plagioclase albite to montmorillonite and kaolinite can be expressed as follows 3 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 m g 2 4 h 2 o a l b i t e 2 n a 0 5 a l 1 5 m g 0 5 s i 4 o 10 o h 2 2 n a h 4 s i o 4 m o n t m o r i l l o n i t e 4 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 h 9 h 2 o a l b i t e a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 2 n a 4 h 4 s i o 4 k a o l i n i t e similarly na normalized ca2 vs mg2 plot fig 10b showed that most of the mg2 may derived from silicate weathering and mg2 ca2 molar ratios fall under 1 this can be explained as the excess in calcium contents related to cationic exchanges fig 10c the na cl ratio is used to identify the mechanism for acquiring salinity rock water interaction and saline intrusions sivasubramanian et al 2013 but most of the water samples plotted close to the trend line defined by nacl showing a continuum from precipitation and uncontaminated groundwater fig 10d the groundwater samples having cl anions ratio less than 0 8 and na na cl ratio greater than 0 5 suggest that they are not derived from seawater halim et al 2010 islam 2014 islam et al 2017d according to the result presented in table 2 the average value of cl anions ratio for the groundwater samples is 0 008 and for na na cl ratio is 0 746 indicates there is no seawater influence in the aquifers a bivariate plot between cl corrected na k and ca2 mg2 corrected hco3 so4 2 were generated in fig 11 in general the cation exchange between na from the water and ca2 and mg2 rich ambient groundwater can be explained by following 5 na 1 2 ca2 mg2 x2 na x 1 2 ca2 mg2 according to jankowski et al 1998 if active cation exchange between na and ca2 mg2 was occurred in the aquifer the slope of the plot would be 1 y x the slope obtained for this plot in this study 1 25 indicates that cation exchange is acting as a significant process in most of the samples and probably has strong influence on the water chemistry of aquifers this might be a reflection of the longer groundwater residence time and mature sediments in the study area verma et al 2015 this observation suggests that cation exchange is deduced to be the dominant mechanism in evolution of cations in the groundwater of study area 3 4 aqueous speciation modeling of groundwater aqueous speciation modeling was performed using phreeqc the saturated indices were calculated for the entire set of groundwater samples carbonate minerals such as aragonite calcite and dolomite showed positive si values for few groundwater samples in the study area the mean si values of aragonite calcite dolomite and halite were 0 890 0 724 1 424 and 8 127 respectively table 2 according to freeze and cherry 1979 if si is 0 dissolution is considered as the dominant process for the related mineral and when the si is 0 precipitation of the mineral is likely to be occurring in the system in the studied samples dissolution of the minerals is the dominant process occurring in the system however ph and residence time may create a situation where these dissolved minerals may precipitate and cause an elevated concentration in groundwater kumar 2014 on the other hand halite is highly under saturated indicates that this mineral is deficient in groundwater this means the groundwater is under saturated with na cl and so4 2 and occurs more dissolution which increases concentration kumar 2014 it was found that most of the groundwater samples are under saturated by carbonate minerals i e aragonite calcite and dolomite fig 12a c indeed dissolution of halite is also verified from the parabolic proportional relationships in the plots of na cl against saturation indices of waters with respect to referred minerals fig 12d a plot of calcite saturation index versus dolomite saturation index showed that except 3 samples most of the groundwater samples are close to unsaturated fig 13 in these three samples super saturation of carbonate species may result in the preferential precipitation of secondary calcite or dolomite during their transportation into different environments halim et al 2010 islam et al 2017a on the contrary most of the samples are under saturation with respect to both calcite and dolomite these samples possibly come from an environment where calcite and dolomite are impoverished or where ca2 and mg2 exist in other forms and have not reached equilibrium with the carbonates due to short residence time halim et al 2010 spatial distribution of si values fig 14 showed that the samples collected near the industrial area and polluted rivers are more saturated with aragonite calcite and dolomite where as highly under saturated with halite compared to the other recharge areas 3 5 correlation analysis correlation coefficients are generally used to establish the relationship between two variables it is an approach to demonstrate how well one variable predicts the others bahar and reza 2010 islam et al 2018 the pearson s correlation matrix for the analyzed parameters of the groundwater samples is presented in table 3 it observed that the correlations between ec and tds and other hydro geochemical parameters are significantly positive except ca2 mg2 br no3 po4 3 the correlation between ec and cl was significantly positive r 0 917 and coefficient of determination value indicated that ec could be ascribed to the variable cl concentration in water the significantly positive correlations between na and f cl so4 2 and hco3 are indicated that these ions are derived from the same source of water the correlations among ca2 mg2 k no3 f cl f so4 2 f hco3 cl so4 2 cl hco3 so4 2 hco3 are also positive and significant the strong correlation between chloride and sodium r 0 941 confirms their same origin magnesium is positively correlated with calcium r 0 855 and the presence of magnesium in these waters might be due to the silicate weathering sulfate concentrations are strongly correlated to the presence of sodium r 0 950 which is explained by the dissolution of evaporate minerals and the cation exchange in the clay minerals nitrates haven t correlation with the tds indicating their anthropogenic origin kraiem et al 2014 3 6 regression analysis to develop models relating a given hydrogeochemical parameter to a set of statistically significant independent chemical variables multiple linear regression method was employed the significant multiple linear regression models for predicting ec ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 were presented in table 4 all independent variables in the models had a significant effect from t test for the partial regression coefficients at 5 level of probability on the corresponding dependent variable the prediction of ec from the chosen ionic compositions was fairly good in predicting ec the independent variables for example na hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and ca2 mg2 had a significant effect the multiple r 2 value 0 961 showed that 96 1 of the variability in ec could be attributed to the combined effect of na hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and ca2 mg2 in predicting so4 2 96 4 of the variability could be described to the combined effect of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl no3 in case of no3 79 9 of the variability could be assigned to the combined effect of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 the existence of no3 in groundwater samples is probably more health concerning issue than the other ions the multiple r 2 value 0 799 in the model indicated that the maximum 79 9 observed variability in nitrate could be accounted for by this model a good correlation existed among ec cl and so4 2 either individually or in combination with other ions is very helpful for site specific monitoring of groundwater quality the multiple regression models could predict groundwater quality parameters with 5 significance level in dhaka city 3 7 principal component analysis pca a total of 14 water quality parameters i e ph ec tds na k ca2 mg2 f cl br so4 2 no3 po4 3 and hco3 were analyzed by pca for differentiating the various processes acting on the hydrogeochemistry these parameters were grouped into four major pcs explaining 87 of the total variance in the data set table 5 the selection of variables was solely based on the eigen values 1 the performed kaiser meyer olkin kmo test yielded a value 0 751 suggests that the data is eligible for performing principal component analysis varimax rotation gotelli and ellison 2004 was used to maximize the sum of the variance of the factor coefficients which better explained the possible sources that influenced the water systems bhuiyan et al 2010 2016 positive scores in pca indicate that water samples are affected by the parameters that significantly loaded on a specific component whereas negative scores suggest that water quality is essentially unaffected by those parameters bhuiyan et al 2010 the variances explained by the pcs are 42 506 18 83 15 957 and 9 771 for pc1 pc2 pc3 and pc4 respectively the scree plot is used to identify the number of pcs to be retained to understand the underlying parameters structure fig 15a the first three pcs accounted for more than 75 of the explained variance in the groundwater parameters fig 15b table 6 pc1 is heavily loaded with ph ec tds na f cl so4 2 and hco3 it largely controls the ionic chemistry and represents the natural hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater by groundwater geological interaction it can be explained by the dissolution of rocks and minerals inside the aquifer by chemical weathering nosrati and eeckhaut 2012 na in pc1 may be attributed by silicate albite and orthoclase feldspars weathering processes selvam et al 2016 hco3 derived from carbonate weathering aragonite calcite and dolomite and reverse ion exchange processes or from the bacterial degradation of organic contamination bahar and reza 2010 selvam et al 2016 the origin of cl is attributed from rainfall the dissolution of fluid inclusions and evaporates and also from industrial effluents municipal and domestic sewages fertilizers and septic tanks valdes et al 2007 jiang et al 2009 dissolution of gypsum mineral could increase so4 2 concentration in groundwater yidana 2010 besides extensive groundwater pumping also contribute so4 2 release into groundwater thompson et al 2007 the source of so4 2 in groundwater may also result from other various sources such as atmospheric deposition wayland et al 2003 so4 2 bearing fertilizer and bacterial oxidation of sulphur compounds sidle et al 2000 the positive factor loadings of so4 2 with ph and f ions are corresponded by dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals in the aquifer system selvam et al 2016 exclusion of ca2 in this group is the clear indication of cation exchange reaction occurring between ca2 and na kumar 2014 pc2 is loaded with ca2 and mg2 suggesting the primary weathering processes e g silicate weathering on groundwater chemistry in the case of silicate weathering there will be a uniform increase of ca2 and mg2 kumar 2014 pc3 is loaded with k no3 and po4 3 the weathering byproduct of silicate minerals elango et al 2003 during silicate weathering k ions may fix by clay minerals such as illite mohan et al 2000 this may be the reason for an insignificant factor loading of k in pc1 a strong loading for no3 0 809 and moderate positive loading for po4 3 0 76 indicates the effect of anthropogenic sources like municipal sewages agricultural fertilizers industrial waste etc kumar 2014 no3 is reported in the literature for anthropogenic source of no3 in groundwater kraiem et al 2014 in pc4 br has strong positive factor loadings which are distributed at s21 s23 s28 and s31 s33 samples bromine found in groundwater is in the form of the simple negative monovalent ion bromide davis et al 2004 inorganic compounds of bromide are highly soluble and move slightly faster than water in soils carrying a permanent charge because of anion exclusion davis et al 2004 bromide has proved to be a useful artificial tracer for groundwater winid 2015 water purification for municipalities may use chemicals that react with bromide and dissolved organic compounds which help to form carcinogens ningnoi et al 2013 various processes such as silicate weathering ion exchange mineral dissolution and anthropogenic effects e g leachate from landfills and percolation from industrial and municipal areas are controlling the groundwater chemistry of this region the relationships among the analyzed parameters are also visualized in pc1 vs pc2 and pc1 vs pc3 in fig 15b however the pca plot in fig 16a shows that tds is strongly correlated to ec the relationship among cl so4 2 hco3 na f are presented at pc1vs pc2 plot fig 16a similar groupings of parameters are observed at the plot of pc1 vs pc3 fig 16b where pc3 loadings k no3 and po4 3 for better understanding of pollution distribution factor scores pcs of the samples were interpolated using inverse distance weighted idw method of geostatistics fig 17 these analyses showed that the highest pc1 values have been marked at the eastern part of the study area especially near the samples s29 moderate loadings can be seen around samples s6 s7 s22 s23 and s24 at the south western part of the study area fig 17a these areas have been affected by both chemical weathering and anthropogenic influences the scores of pc2 are very high at sample number s13 s22 s23 and s24 located at the south western part of the study area fig 17b it showed that the samples may be affected by industrial wastewater however cation exchange reaction has significant influence at the respected area pc3 has higher loadings at the central north western south eastern parts of the study area fig 17c indicating the effect of anthropogenic sources like municipal sewages agricultural fertilizers industrial waste etc the highest loadings at pc4 have been noticeable at the samples close to the river supporting the argument of groundwater recharge form polluted river water and moderate pc4 loadings at the central part of the study area fig 17d indicating the natural geochemical processes 3 8 spatial similarities and sampling site grouping the hierarchical cluster analysis ca was performed which is very similar to the pca s results parameters belonging to the same cluster are likely to have originated from a same source bhuiyan et al 2016 r mode ca was applied to groupings in the groundwater datasets which generates 3 main clusters fig 18a cluster 1 consists of ph ec tds na f cl so42 and hco3 and this cluster is similar to pc1 in pca analysis cluster 2 contains k no3 and po4 3 and cluster 3 consists of ca2 mg2 and br fig 18a however br is slightly different from the other cluster members as depicted by its long linkage distance the r mode pca and ca have yielded the following associations in the water data set ec tds na so4 cl f hco3 ph k no3 po4 and ca mg br which are mainly derived from natural and anthropogenic sources these anthropogenic sources are linked to the processes of the municipal waste and industrial effluent polluting river and the river water recharging the aquifer q mode ca has been used to evaluate the spatial similarities and site groupings among the sampling sites where sampling sites belonging to a particular cluster exhibit similar characteristics with respect to the analyzed parameters bhuiyan et al 2011 four major clusters were recognized from all analyzed parameters for the 33 sampling sites fig 18b cluster 1 consists of 16 sampling sites s1 s6 s8 s10 s11 s14 s16 s19 s20 s26 and s32 cluster 2 consists of 8 sampling sites s17 s18 s25 s27 s28 s30 s31 and s33 cluster 3 consists of seven sampling sites s9 s12 s13 and s21 s24 and cluster 4 consists of two sampling sites s7 and s29 thus the sampling sites may have grouped into four clusters the average concentrations of the analyzed water quality parameters in the four categorized groups are presented in table 7 clusters 1 and 2 have the lowest concentrations for most of the parameters except br cluster 3 consists of s9 s12 s13 and s21 s24 has the highest concentrations of ca2 and mg2 signifying silicate weathering in the aquifer system cluster 3 also have moderate concentration of ec tds na cl so4 2 and no3 representing cation exchange reaction in the aquifer system and indicating groundwater recharge by polluted river water and relative position of these samples near the buriganga river is supporting this argument cluster 4 comprises samples s7 and s29 and has the highest concentrations of all analyzed parameters except ca2 mg2 and br the groundwater sample depth of s7 and s29 is 60 96 m and 106 68 m respectively these samples were collected from the relatively shallow aquifer moreover s7 was collected from the tejgaon industrial zone of dhaka city and the analysis showed that groundwater chemistry and shallow aquifer of this area is influence by industrial effluents rich in na cl no3 and so4 2 and leakage through landfill and urban areas furthermore s29 was collected from eastern part of dhaka city named beraid a semi urban area situated in the old brahmaputra floodplain comprises of alluvial silt and clay and marshy clay burgess et al 2011 where surface water has been disrupted as the small natural channels and low lying areas have been filled up with municipal wastes the groundwater in shallow aquifer of this area is mostly contaminated by anthropogenic inputs the results obtained from the analysis of s29 indicates that the groundwater of this area is contaminated moderately due to rapid infiltration of contaminated water in the porous alluvium 4 conclusions integrated approach of hydrochemistry gis and multivariate statistical tools were applied to evaluate the water quality and hydrogeochemical behavior of the aquifers in dhaka city area the results of the studied samples showed that groundwater is heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities and induced by contaminate recharge from the peripheral polluted rivers the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater samples belong to three main types ca2 mg2 hco3 and followed by ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and na k cl so4 2 groundwater of the study area has been affected by rock water interaction and silicate weathering it has been observed that solute content is the major controlling processes of the groundwater system which under saturated with carbonate minerals i e aragonite calcite and dolomite besides cation exchanges acting as a significant process in groundwater chemistry from regression analysis it is found that relation exists between ec cl and so4 2 either individually or in combination with other ions the results of this study showed that hydrogeochemical study coupled with gis and multivariate statistical analyses can elucidate the degrees and sources of groundwater contamination which is more elegant and specific this study illustrated the geochemical characters and influential factors which might be used as a primary step for sustainable aquifer management as shallow groundwater aquifer is influenced by peripheral rivers so it is essential to strengthen the regular monitoring and use of only deep groundwater for drinking purpose in addition it is important to conduct proper groundwater management policy for dhaka city to ensure sustainable water supply for the city dwellers acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge department of environmental sciences jahangirnagar university and chemistry

applied in this study to investigate the hydrogeochemical behavior source apportionment of groundwater pollutants and their spatial distribution in the aquifer system of dhaka city bangladesh a total of 33 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed in order to evaluate the geochemical constituents of groundwater results found that the trends of cations and anions are na mg2 ca2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 no3 respectively and ca2 mg2 hco3 is the dominant groundwater type except na k cl f and no3 all others measured parameters fall within the permissible limits however silicate weathering was identified as the major processes of controlling the groundwater solute content besides cation exchange plays a significant role influencing the water chemistry of the aquifers aqueous speciation model revealed that aquifer materials were more saturated with aragonite calcite and dolomite and under saturated with halite from regression and correlation analysis it was found that ec cl and so4 2 were correlated with each other s which might helpful for site specific monitoring of groundwater quality principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were also employed to appraise the sources of contaminants and it was explored that both natural and anthropogenic factors were influencing the groundwater quality groundwater was contaminated due to induced river recharge and rapid infiltration of contaminated water through the recharge areas in this situation it is expected that outcomes of this study will provide useful insights to planners for sustainable management of

may goes up 30 million by 2035 bbs 2011 dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa are responsible for potable water supply for the city dwellers dwasa 2013 currently 22 percent of the city s water supply is drawn from the surface water sources like buriganga and sitalakhya rivers bhuiyan et al 2011 and rest 78 of the total supply about 2420 million litre day is provided from groundwater source by 644 deep wells dwasa 2013 however the treatment of river water for drinking purpose is critical due to severe pollution sohel et al 2003 subramanian 2004 so the abstraction of groundwater is increasing day by day due to extra demand and groundwater level of dhaka city area is declining by 2 3 m per year nahar et al 2014 the impact of over abstraction has been well documented by many authors shamsudduha et al 2009 kagabu et al 2011 shao et al 2013 this intensive exploitation of groundwater from the aquifers of dhaka city area has led to the decline of water level which may have detrimental effects on groundwater quality hoque et al 2007 knappett et al 2016 akhter and hossain 2017 moreover large scale abstractions even changes in the geological formation of the aquifer hoque et al 2007 over abstraction may induce contaminant recharge from the nearby rivers and lagoons farnsworth and hering 2011 according to the recent study peripheral rivers of dhaka city i e the

of this area which may deteriorate the groundwater quality burgess et al 2011 therefore understanding of the geochemical processes of the aquifers is a time demanding needs for groundwater quality monitoring and sustainable water resources management perspective however the evaluation and management of groundwater resources require an understanding of hydrogeochemical properties of the aquifer umar et al 2001 islam 2014 in order to evaluate the characteristics of groundwater physicochemical parameters as well as hydrochemistry were studied by many researchers worldwide e g bhuiyan et al

due to time constraint and cost therefore spatial analysis using gis tool got popularity as alternative option to understand the pollution distribution webster and oliver 2007 bhattacharya et al 2011 islam et al 2016 moreover the application of different multivariate statistical techniques helps in the interpretation of complex data matrices and to better understand the water quality kumar et al

approaches of multivariate statistics and spatial analysis thus provide a reliable and valuable tools for reliable management of water resources in these background the aims of this study was to investigate the groundwater evolution and to characterize the natural and anthropogenic influences with a special emphasis on groundwater quality the study also intended to identify the factors that influence the groundwater and their spatial distribution for sustainable aquifers management in dhaka city area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dhaka city is located at the center of the bengal delta which lies between 23 40 n to 23 54 n latitude and 90 20 e to 90 31 e longitude fig 1 the city covering an area of 370 km2 and bounded by the interconnecting streams i e tongi canal to the north the buriganga river to the south the turag river to west and the balu river to the east fig 1 topographically dhaka is situated at the southern half of the madhupur tract pleistocene terrace and floodplain area hoque at el 2007 geologically the city is situated in the pleistocene uplifted block madhupur tract within the passive margin surrounded by subsiding floodplains the primary aquifer of dhaka city consists of unconsolidated sediments of the dupi tila formation which are overlain by the madhupur clay an approximately 48 m thick aquitard dwasa 2013 the groundwater is obtained locally from underlying fluvio deltaic sands of the highly productive dupi tila aquifer which is locally reported to be about 140 m thick morris et al 2003 the dupi tila formation is mainly composed of fine to coarse grained micaceous quartzofeldspathic sands iron oxyhydroxides and kaolinite are common weathering products of the original mafic rich sediments burgess et al 2011 from the lithologies and cross section the subsurface geology within 600 m of depth of dhaka city are sub divided into the six lithologic categories i e clay fine sand fine to medium sand medium sand medium to coarse sand and gravel bed fig 2 the dupi tila formation sands contain laterally discontinuous silts and clays fig 2 these fine grained units divide the aquifers into upper dupi tila aquifer udta and lower dupi tila aquifer ldta dwasa 2008 ahmed et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 the udta mainly composed of fine sand and fine to medium sand also occasional presence of medium sand and medium to coarse sand on the contrary ldta composed of medium sand and medium to coarse sand making it an excellent aquifer with a high hydraulic conductivity and a high storage capacity hoque et al 2007 burgess et al 2011 sultana 2009 rahman et al 2013 the aquifer has no outcrop on the madhupur tract itself but comparison of river bed elevations with the top of the dupi tila sands demonstrates that direct contact between the river buriganga and the aquifer is possible along certain reaches hasan et al 1998 it is possible that contact between the rivers surrounding dhaka and the dupi tila aquifer is more extensive than supposed burgess et al 2011 like other parts of the country the climate of the city is under humid sub tropical monsoon climate the mean annual rainfall is approximately 2000 mm and more than 80 of this occurs during the monsoon period from june to september monthly average temperatures range between 25 and 31 c while average humidity and evaporation range between 80 and 90 and 80 130 mm respectively bmd 2016 from quite long time the city faces problems related to waterlogging drainage congestions untreated waste disposal pollution and change in the hydrogeological system rahman et al 2013 hossain et al 2018 2 2 sampling and analytical procedure a total of 33 groundwater samples were collected from pre selected 26 production wells of dwasa and 7 household private wells of dhaka city area fig 1 since april 2016 the depths of the wells were varied from 57 91 to 320 04 m geographical locations of the wells were determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well were pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained usgs 2006 groundwater samples were filtered using cellulose acetate filter 0 45 µm for cations and anion analyses following the procedure of bhattacharya et al 2002 the samples were collected in 500 ml high density polypropylene bottles rinsed with 1 hno3 and washed with distilled water and properly labelled then samples were shipped to atomic energy center dhaka and stored in a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 c in dark until analysis being performed the physicochemical parameters such as temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured on spot with calibrated portable instruments the ph meter model sensiontm1 hach international usa was employed to measure ph of groundwater temperature ec and tds were measured by using a conductivity meter jenway model 4520 the concentrations of major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions f cl br no3 so4 2 po4 3 were measured by ion chromatography model dionex dx 3000 usa using ionpac cs17 and ionpac as11 hc analytical columns respectively the instrument was calibrated with standards six cation ii standard and seven anion ii standard the standard was prepared by the dissolution of high purity salts in 18 2 megohm deionized water which was tested by the ic for ionic contaminants samples were diluted several times and the relative standard deviation of measured ions was found to be within 3 alkalinity hco3 was determined using digital titrator model 16900 hach international usa and 1 6 n h2so4 cartridge the accuracy of the chemical analyses was checked by taking the relationship between the total cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions f cl br no3 so4 2 po4 3 hco3 for each set of complete analyses of water sample using the ion charge balance equation mathhess 1982 by following 1 e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 where e is the error percent reaction error and cations and anions are the sum of the total cations and total anions expressed in miliequivalents per liter the reaction cationic and anionic balance error e of all the groundwater samples was less than the accepted limit of 10 an added proof of the precision of the data in addition the reaction error e of few groundwater samples greater than 10 which was eliminated from the subsequent analyses ravikumar et al 2011 2 3 multivariate statistical analysis multivariate statistics are useful tools to attaining significant information from hydrochemical data set in the groundwater system islam et al 2018 to evaluate the analytical data multivariate statistical techniques i e correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were used in this study by using spss version 22 0 software for windows parametric statistical methods were also used to calculate the normal statistical parameters i e range mean and standard deviation for the water quality parameters pearson s correlation matrix was used to identify the relationship among the pairs of parameters when more than two variables were considered simultaneously multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate their interdependency the coefficient of determination is more readily interpretable than r as a measure of the degree of association because r 2 is equal to the proportion of the total variability in the dependent variable that may be ascribed to the effects of the independent or causative variables adhikary et al 2009 in order to understand the geochemical processes and the sources of major anions and cations in groundwater hydrochemical data were subjected to pca that allowed to group them based on their inherited properties the pca was performed with an orthogonal kaiser s varimax rotation to make the factors more interpretable without changing the dataset mertler and vannatta 2005 islam et al 2018 the varimax rotation can successfully reduce the contribution of less significant parameters in the groundwater quality obtained from the pca the first pca was accounting for the highest variance in the dataset followed by the next pca and so on cluster analysis ca was further applied to identify groups or clusters of similar sites on the basis of similarities within a class and dissimilarities between different classes lattin et al 2003 bhuiyan et al 2016 hierarchical clustering is the most popular approach which provides intuitive similarity relationships between any one sample and the entire data set and can be illustrated by a dendrogram mckenna 2003 the dendrogram provides a visual summary of the clustering processes presenting a picture of the groups and their proximity with a dramatic reduction in dimensionality of the original data bhuiyan et al 2016 in the study ward s method with squared euclidean distances is used by following lattin et al 2003 2 4 spatial analysis inverse distance weighted idw method of arc gis version 10 1 was applied in this study for spatial analysis this method is comparatively easy and provide high accuracy compared to other interpolation methods like kriging islam et al 2018 the idw method estimates the values of an attribute at un sampled points using a linear combination of values at sampled points weighted by an inverse function of the distance from the point of interest to the sampled points the assumption is that sampled points closer to the un sampled point are more similar to it than those further away in their values the weights can be expressed as following 2 λ ᵢ 1 d ᵢ ᴾ i 1 n 1 d ᵢ ᴾ where d i is the distance between x 0 and x i p is a power parameter and n represents the number of sampled points used for the estimation the main factor affecting the accuracy of idw is the value of the power parameter islam et al 2017c the choice of power parameter and neighborhood size is arbitrary webster and oliver 2001 the most popular choice of p is 2 and the resulting method is often called inverse square distance or inverse distance squared ids 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry and water quality the results of measured parameters of groundwater samples of the study area are summarized in table 1 with the comparison of standard permissible limits the measured water temperatures varied from 24 to 29 5 c with an average of 27 33 c the ph of groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline ranging from 6 66 to 8 19 with a mean value of 7 25 the ph indicates the strength of the water to react with the acidic or alkaline material presents in water islam et al 2017d electric conductivity is considered as one of the important parameters to classify the drinking water quality subramani et al 2005 islam 2014 the ec of the water samples ranges from 55 0 to 353 0 μs cm with a mean of 117 44 μs cm this mean values lies within the permissible limit recommended by usepa 2006 and who 2011 for drinking purpose table 1 subsequently tds has an average value of 70 26 mg l that ranges from 32 90 to 211 0 mg l according to who 2011 recommendation tds up to 500 mg l is the highest desirable and up to 1000 mg l is maximum permissible suggested by doe 1997 bangladesh standard all of the samples of the study area fall within permissible limit sodium na concentration ranged from 10 95 to 274 73 mg l with an average value of 36 34 mg l the maximum allowable limit of na concentration in groundwater is 200 mg l set by doe 1997 who 2011 and eu 1998 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit except one sample s29 this may be attributed to the weathering of rock forming minerals like sodium plagioclase and halite and the influence of domestic and animal wastes selvam et al 2016 potassium k concentration varied from 1 34 to 12 94 mg l with an average value of 3 31 mg l the maximum allowable limit of k in groundwater is 12 0 mg l doe 1997 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit except s7 calcium ca2 concentration ranged from 9 86 to 45 75 mg l with an average value of 24 78 mg l the maximum allowable limit of ca2 in groundwater is 75 mg l as per doe 1997 and who 2011 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit the average value of magnesium mg2 is 10 77 mg l with the ranged from 4 4 to 25 34 mg l within the permissible limit table 1 mg2 occurs in groundwater due to dissolution of magnesium bearing minerals in rocks and animal domestic and industrial wastes selvam et al 2016 the mean value of chloride cl is 30 32 mg l with ranges from 1 03 to 289 73 mg l maximum allowable limit of cl concentration in groundwater is 250 mg l set by eu 1998 usepa 2006 who 2011 bis 2012 and 150 600 mg l by doe 1997 according to bangladesh standard all the samples fall within the permissible limit the average concentration of fluoride f bromide br sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 are 0 28 2 33 7 55 3 68 0 101 mg l respectively where all the samples fall within the permissible limits table 1 but in case of no3 one sample s5 exceed the permissible limit of doe 1997 and usepa 2006 standards no3 derived from agricultural and industrial areas due to leaching from plant nutrients nitrate fertilizers and domestic and industrial waste barzegar et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 the average value of bicarbonate hco3 is 131 52 mg l and ranged from 59 0 to 303 0 mg l dissolution of carbonate minerals like calcite and dolomite may contribute bicarbonate in groundwater selvam et al 2016 the variation of major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl f so4 2 no3 hco3 in groundwater samples is illustrated in the box and whisker plot fig 3 where na and hco3 are the dominant cation and anion respectively it showed that the order of relative abundance of major cations in the groundwater is na ca2 mg2 k while the anion is hco3 cl so4 2 no3 br f po4 3 ec of the groundwater samples showed large percentages of contribution are from na hco3 and cl since conductivity is a linear function of tds and for that matter the mineral salt content of groundwater kortatsi 2007 3 2 hydrochemical facies the total hardness th in mg l was determined by 2 497ca2 4 115 mg2 according to todd 1980 th in the groundwater varied from 43 04 to 206 67 mg l with an average value of 106 21 mg l table 1 it is an important parameter in decreasing the toxic effect of poisonous element and important criterion in determining the suitability of water for domestic agricultural and industrial uses thakur et al 2015 islam et al 2017d hardness of the water results from the presence of divalent metallic cations of which calcium and magnesium abundant jacintha et al 2017 a detailed classification of groundwater quality based on tds and th kumar 2014 is shown in fig 4 where all the samples were classified as soft fresh groundwater the concentrations of major ions determined in groundwater samples are presented in the piper 1953 trilinear plot fig 5 these plots include two triangles one for cations and the other for anions the cations and anion fields are combined to explain a single point in a diamond shaped field which inference is drawn on the basis of the hydrochemical facies concept ravikumar et al 2011 hydrochemical facies are distinct zones that possess cation and anion concentration and help to identify the water classes islam et al 2017d ahmed et al 2018 the diagram revealed that four types i e ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na k cl so4 2 na k hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 are the predominant facies type fig 5 most of the samples in this study belong to ca2 mg2 hco3 type followed by ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 na k cl so4 2 and na k hco3 respectively durov 1948 introduced another diagram which provides more information on hydrochemical facies to identify the water types it displayed some possible geochemical processes that used to understanding the quality of groundwater and its evaluation onwuka and omonona 2017 this diagram is a composite plot consisting of two ternary diagrams where the cations of interest are plotted against the anions of interest the plot of major cations and anions are presented in durov diagram fig 6 mixed water types prevail in the study area after plotted on the diagram where 9 samples 27 27 fall in the field 5 of durov plot along the dissolution or mixing line according to lloyd and heathcoat 1985 the trend can be attributed to fresh recharge which exhibit simple dissolution or mixing with no dominant major anion or cation a total of 22 samples 66 67 fall in the field 6 showing so4 2 and na as anion and cation dominant respectively this association indicates probable mixing or uncommon dissolution influences ravikumar et al 2011 moreover only 2 samples 6 06 showing cl and na as dominant anion and cation indicated that the ground water samples are related to reverse ion exchange of na cl waters 3 3 hydrogeochemical processes evaluation gibbs plot gibbs 1970 was used to determine the mechanism controlling the groundwater chemistry the measured parameters of groundwater were plotted in gibbs diagram and found that groundwater samples have been affected largely by rock water interaction and mainly dominated by precipitation fig 7 these may have influenced by chemical weathering of rock forming minerals bhuiyan et al 2015 pazand et al 2018 the processes responsible for major solutes of groundwater are most likely controlled by mineral dissolution the cl anions ratios of groundwater samples varied from 0 0003 to 0 076 with an average value of 0 008 table 2 in contrast the hco3 anion ratios ranges from 0 009 to 0 046 with an average value of 0 020 table 2 these results suggest that rock weathering mostly silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and evaporate dissolution take dominant part in the aquifers halim et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018 the rock water interaction is a broad classification that encompasses all lithogenic influences like silicate weathering carbonate dissolution and evaporates dissolution kumar 2014 this result has been refined by plotting the bivariate plots of ca2 na vs hco3 na and ca2 na vs mg2 na fig 8a b both plots showed that silicate weathering and evaporation dissolution take part as the major processes that control the groundwater solute content furthermore plots of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 and na k vs hco3 also support the similar picture presented in fig 9 a b most of the groundwater samples fall along the 1 2 line on bivariate plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 and na k vs hco3 suggest that silicate weathering as a dominant process to introduce major ions in groundwater of the study area verma et al 2015 ahmed et al 2018 however groundwater samples of the study area showed a molar na k cl ratio 1 possibly indicating silicate weathering mukherjee et al 2008 calcium ca2 in groundwater can be derived from incongruent dissolution of plagioclase al ruwaih and qabazard 2005 which was found to be somewhat linearly related to mg2 r2 0 731 fig 10a the reaction involves the incongruent dissolution of plagioclase albite to montmorillonite and kaolinite can be expressed as follows 3 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 m g 2 4 h 2 o a l b i t e 2 n a 0 5 a l 1 5 m g 0 5 s i 4 o 10 o h 2 2 n a h 4 s i o 4 m o n t m o r i l l o n i t e 4 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 h 9 h 2 o a l b i t e a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 2 n a 4 h 4 s i o 4 k a o l i n i t e similarly na normalized ca2 vs mg2 plot fig 10b showed that most of the mg2 may derived from silicate weathering and mg2 ca2 molar ratios fall under 1 this can be explained as the excess in calcium contents related to cationic exchanges fig 10c the na cl ratio is used to identify the mechanism for acquiring salinity rock water interaction and saline intrusions sivasubramanian et al 2013 but most of the water samples plotted close to the trend line defined by nacl showing a continuum from precipitation and uncontaminated groundwater fig 10d the groundwater samples having cl anions ratio less than 0 8 and na na cl ratio greater than 0 5 suggest that they are not derived from seawater halim et al 2010 islam 2014 islam et al 2017d according to the result presented in table 2 the average value of cl anions ratio for the groundwater samples is 0 008 and for na na cl ratio is 0 746 indicates there is no seawater influence in the aquifers a bivariate plot between cl corrected na k and ca2 mg2 corrected hco3 so4 2 were generated in fig 11 in general the cation exchange between na from the water and ca2 and mg2 rich ambient groundwater can be explained by following 5 na 1 2 ca2 mg2 x2 na x 1 2 ca2 mg2 according to jankowski et al 1998 if active cation exchange between na and ca2 mg2 was occurred in the aquifer the slope of the plot would be 1 y x the slope obtained for this plot in this study 1 25 indicates that cation exchange is acting as a significant process in most of the samples and probably has strong influence on the water chemistry of aquifers this might be a reflection of the longer groundwater residence time and mature sediments in the study area verma et al 2015 this observation suggests that cation exchange is deduced to be the dominant mechanism in evolution of cations in the groundwater of study area 3 4 aqueous speciation modeling of groundwater aqueous speciation modeling was performed using phreeqc the saturated indices were calculated for the entire set of groundwater samples carbonate minerals such as aragonite calcite and dolomite showed positive si values for few groundwater samples in the study area the mean si values of aragonite calcite dolomite and halite were 0 890 0 724 1 424 and 8 127 respectively table 2 according to freeze and cherry 1979 if si is 0 dissolution is considered as the dominant process for the related mineral and when the si is 0 precipitation of the mineral is likely to be occurring in the system in the studied samples dissolution of the minerals is the dominant process occurring in the system however ph and residence time may create a situation where these dissolved minerals may precipitate and cause an elevated concentration in groundwater kumar 2014 on the other hand halite is highly under saturated indicates that this mineral is deficient in groundwater this means the groundwater is under saturated with na cl and so4 2 and occurs more dissolution which increases concentration kumar 2014 it was found that most of the groundwater samples are under saturated by carbonate minerals i e aragonite calcite and dolomite fig 12a c indeed dissolution of halite is also verified from the parabolic proportional relationships in the plots of na cl against saturation indices of waters with respect to referred minerals fig 12d a plot of calcite saturation index versus dolomite saturation index showed that except 3 samples most of the groundwater samples are close to unsaturated fig 13 in these three samples super saturation of carbonate species may result in the preferential precipitation of secondary calcite or dolomite during their transportation into different environments halim et al 2010 islam et al 2017a on the contrary most of the samples are under saturation with respect to both calcite and dolomite these samples possibly come from an environment where calcite and dolomite are impoverished or where ca2 and mg2 exist in other forms and have not reached equilibrium with the carbonates due to short residence time halim et al 2010 spatial distribution of si values fig 14 showed that the samples collected near the industrial area and polluted rivers are more saturated with aragonite calcite and dolomite where as highly under saturated with halite compared to the other recharge areas 3 5 correlation analysis correlation coefficients are generally used to establish the relationship between two variables it is an approach to demonstrate how well one variable predicts the others bahar and reza 2010 islam et al 2018 the pearson s correlation matrix for the analyzed parameters of the groundwater samples is presented in table 3 it observed that the correlations between ec and tds and other hydro geochemical parameters are significantly positive except ca2 mg2 br no3 po4 3 the correlation between ec and cl was significantly positive r 0 917 and coefficient of determination value indicated that ec could be ascribed to the variable cl concentration in water the significantly positive correlations between na and f cl so4 2 and hco3 are indicated that these ions are derived from the same source of water the correlations among ca2 mg2 k no3 f cl f so4 2 f hco3 cl so4 2 cl hco3 so4 2 hco3 are also positive and significant the strong correlation between chloride and sodium r 0 941 confirms their same origin magnesium is positively correlated with calcium r 0 855 and the presence of magnesium in these waters might be due to the silicate weathering sulfate concentrations are strongly correlated to the presence of sodium r 0 950 which is explained by the dissolution of evaporate minerals and the cation exchange in the clay minerals nitrates haven t correlation with the tds indicating their anthropogenic origin kraiem et al 2014 3 6 regression analysis to develop models relating a given hydrogeochemical parameter to a set of statistically significant independent chemical variables multiple linear regression method was employed the significant multiple linear regression models for predicting ec ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 were presented in table 4 all independent variables in the models had a significant effect from t test for the partial regression coefficients at 5 level of probability on the corresponding dependent variable the prediction of ec from the chosen ionic compositions was fairly good in predicting ec the independent variables for example na hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and ca2 mg2 had a significant effect the multiple r 2 value 0 961 showed that 96 1 of the variability in ec could be attributed to the combined effect of na hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and ca2 mg2 in predicting so4 2 96 4 of the variability could be described to the combined effect of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl no3 in case of no3 79 9 of the variability could be assigned to the combined effect of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl and so4 2 the existence of no3 in groundwater samples is probably more health concerning issue than the other ions the multiple r 2 value 0 799 in the model indicated that the maximum 79 9 observed variability in nitrate could be accounted for by this model a good correlation existed among ec cl and so4 2 either individually or in combination with other ions is very helpful for site specific monitoring of groundwater quality the multiple regression models could predict groundwater quality parameters with 5 significance level in dhaka city 3 7 principal component analysis pca a total of 14 water quality parameters i e ph ec tds na k ca2 mg2 f cl br so4 2 no3 po4 3 and hco3 were analyzed by pca for differentiating the various processes acting on the hydrogeochemistry these parameters were grouped into four major pcs explaining 87 of the total variance in the data set table 5 the selection of variables was solely based on the eigen values 1 the performed kaiser meyer olkin kmo test yielded a value 0 751 suggests that the data is eligible for performing principal component analysis varimax rotation gotelli and ellison 2004 was used to maximize the sum of the variance of the factor coefficients which better explained the possible sources that influenced the water systems bhuiyan et al 2010 2016 positive scores in pca indicate that water samples are affected by the parameters that significantly loaded on a specific component whereas negative scores suggest that water quality is essentially unaffected by those parameters bhuiyan et al 2010 the variances explained by the pcs are 42 506 18 83 15 957 and 9 771 for pc1 pc2 pc3 and pc4 respectively the scree plot is used to identify the number of pcs to be retained to understand the underlying parameters structure fig 15a the first three pcs accounted for more than 75 of the explained variance in the groundwater parameters fig 15b table 6 pc1 is heavily loaded with ph ec tds na f cl so4 2 and hco3 it largely controls the ionic chemistry and represents the natural hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater by groundwater geological interaction it can be explained by the dissolution of rocks and minerals inside the aquifer by chemical weathering nosrati and eeckhaut 2012 na in pc1 may be attributed by silicate albite and orthoclase feldspars weathering processes selvam et al 2016 hco3 derived from carbonate weathering aragonite calcite and dolomite and reverse ion exchange processes or from the bacterial degradation of organic contamination bahar and reza 2010 selvam et al 2016 the origin of cl is attributed from rainfall the dissolution of fluid inclusions and evaporates and also from industrial effluents municipal and domestic sewages fertilizers and septic tanks valdes et al 2007 jiang et al 2009 dissolution of gypsum mineral could increase so4 2 concentration in groundwater yidana 2010 besides extensive groundwater pumping also contribute so4 2 release into groundwater thompson et al 2007 the source of so4 2 in groundwater may also result from other various sources such as atmospheric deposition wayland et al 2003 so4 2 bearing fertilizer and bacterial oxidation of sulphur compounds sidle et al 2000 the positive factor loadings of so4 2 with ph and f ions are corresponded by dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals in the aquifer system selvam et al 2016 exclusion of ca2 in this group is the clear indication of cation exchange reaction occurring between ca2 and na kumar 2014 pc2 is loaded with ca2 and mg2 suggesting the primary weathering processes e g silicate weathering on groundwater chemistry in the case of silicate weathering there will be a uniform increase of ca2 and mg2 kumar 2014 pc3 is loaded with k no3 and po4 3 the weathering byproduct of silicate minerals elango et al 2003 during silicate weathering k ions may fix by clay minerals such as illite mohan et al 2000 this may be the reason for an insignificant factor loading of k in pc1 a strong loading for no3 0 809 and moderate positive loading for po4 3 0 76 indicates the effect of anthropogenic sources like municipal sewages agricultural fertilizers industrial waste etc kumar 2014 no3 is reported in the literature for anthropogenic source of no3 in groundwater kraiem et al 2014 in pc4 br has strong positive factor loadings which are distributed at s21 s23 s28 and s31 s33 samples bromine found in groundwater is in the form of the simple negative monovalent ion bromide davis et al 2004 inorganic compounds of bromide are highly soluble and move slightly faster than water in soils carrying a permanent charge because of anion exclusion davis et al 2004 bromide has proved to be a useful artificial tracer for groundwater winid 2015 water purification for municipalities may use chemicals that react with bromide and dissolved organic compounds which help to form carcinogens ningnoi et al 2013 various processes such as silicate weathering ion exchange mineral dissolution and anthropogenic effects e g leachate from landfills and percolation from industrial and municipal areas are controlling the groundwater chemistry of this region the relationships among the analyzed parameters are also visualized in pc1 vs pc2 and pc1 vs pc3 in fig 15b however the pca plot in fig 16a shows that tds is strongly correlated to ec the relationship among cl so4 2 hco3 na f are presented at pc1vs pc2 plot fig 16a similar groupings of parameters are observed at the plot of pc1 vs pc3 fig 16b where pc3 loadings k no3 and po4 3 for better understanding of pollution distribution factor scores pcs of the samples were interpolated using inverse distance weighted idw method of geostatistics fig 17 these analyses showed that the highest pc1 values have been marked at the eastern part of the study area especially near the samples s29 moderate loadings can be seen around samples s6 s7 s22 s23 and s24 at the south western part of the study area fig 17a these areas have been affected by both chemical weathering and anthropogenic influences the scores of pc2 are very high at sample number s13 s22 s23 and s24 located at the south western part of the study area fig 17b it showed that the samples may be affected by industrial wastewater however cation exchange reaction has significant influence at the respected area pc3 has higher loadings at the central north western south eastern parts of the study area fig 17c indicating the effect of anthropogenic sources like municipal sewages agricultural fertilizers industrial waste etc the highest loadings at pc4 have been noticeable at the samples close to the river supporting the argument of groundwater recharge form polluted river water and moderate pc4 loadings at the central part of the study area fig 17d indicating the natural geochemical processes 3 8 spatial similarities and sampling site grouping the hierarchical cluster analysis ca was performed which is very similar to the pca s results parameters belonging to the same cluster are likely to have originated from a same source bhuiyan et al 2016 r mode ca was applied to groupings in the groundwater datasets which generates 3 main clusters fig 18a cluster 1 consists of ph ec tds na f cl so42 and hco3 and this cluster is similar to pc1 in pca analysis cluster 2 contains k no3 and po4 3 and cluster 3 consists of ca2 mg2 and br fig 18a however br is slightly different from the other cluster members as depicted by its long linkage distance the r mode pca and ca have yielded the following associations in the water data set ec tds na so4 cl f hco3 ph k no3 po4 and ca mg br which are mainly derived from natural and anthropogenic sources these anthropogenic sources are linked to the processes of the municipal waste and industrial effluent polluting river and the river water recharging the aquifer q mode ca has been used to evaluate the spatial similarities and site groupings among the sampling sites where sampling sites belonging to a particular cluster exhibit similar characteristics with respect to the analyzed parameters bhuiyan et al 2011 four major clusters were recognized from all analyzed parameters for the 33 sampling sites fig 18b cluster 1 consists of 16 sampling sites s1 s6 s8 s10 s11 s14 s16 s19 s20 s26 and s32 cluster 2 consists of 8 sampling sites s17 s18 s25 s27 s28 s30 s31 and s33 cluster 3 consists of seven sampling sites s9 s12 s13 and s21 s24 and cluster 4 consists of two sampling sites s7 and s29 thus the sampling sites may have grouped into four clusters the average concentrations of the analyzed water quality parameters in the four categorized groups are presented in table 7 clusters 1 and 2 have the lowest concentrations for most of the parameters except br cluster 3 consists of s9 s12 s13 and s21 s24 has the highest concentrations of ca2 and mg2 signifying silicate weathering in the aquifer system cluster 3 also have moderate concentration of ec tds na cl so4 2 and no3 representing cation exchange reaction in the aquifer system and indicating groundwater recharge by polluted river water and relative position of these samples near the buriganga river is supporting this argument cluster 4 comprises samples s7 and s29 and has the highest concentrations of all analyzed parameters except ca2 mg2 and br the groundwater sample depth of s7 and s29 is 60 96 m and 106 68 m respectively these samples were collected from the relatively shallow aquifer moreover s7 was collected from the tejgaon industrial zone of dhaka city and the analysis showed that groundwater chemistry and shallow aquifer of this area is influence by industrial effluents rich in na cl no3 and so4 2 and leakage through landfill and urban areas furthermore s29 was collected from eastern part of dhaka city named beraid a semi urban area situated in the old brahmaputra floodplain comprises of alluvial silt and clay and marshy clay burgess et al 2011 where surface water has been disrupted as the small natural channels and low lying areas have been filled up with municipal wastes the groundwater in shallow aquifer of this area is mostly contaminated by anthropogenic inputs the results obtained from the analysis of s29 indicates that the groundwater of this area is contaminated moderately due to rapid infiltration of contaminated water in the porous alluvium 4 conclusions integrated approach of hydrochemistry gis and multivariate statistical tools were applied to evaluate the water quality and hydrogeochemical behavior of the aquifers in dhaka city area the results of the studied samples showed that groundwater is heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities and induced by contaminate recharge from the peripheral polluted rivers the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater samples belong to three main types ca2 mg2 hco3 and followed by ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and na k cl so4 2 groundwater of the study area has been affected by rock water interaction and silicate weathering it has been observed that solute content is the major controlling processes of the groundwater system which under saturated with carbonate minerals i e aragonite calcite and dolomite besides cation exchanges acting as a significant process in groundwater chemistry from regression analysis it is found that relation exists between ec cl and so4 2 either individually or in combination with other ions the results of this study showed that hydrogeochemical study coupled with gis and multivariate statistical analyses can elucidate the degrees and sources of groundwater contamination which is more elegant and specific this study illustrated the geochemical characters and influential factors which might be used as a primary step for sustainable aquifer management as shallow groundwater aquifer is influenced by peripheral rivers so it is essential to strengthen the regular monitoring and use of only deep groundwater for drinking purpose in addition it is important to conduct proper groundwater management policy for dhaka city to ensure sustainable water supply for the city dwellers acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge department of environmental sciences jahangirnagar university and chemistry

12284,one of the most important pollutants in the aquifers adjacent to oil facilities is lnapl light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl recovery from the aquifer is one of the fastest and most convenient methods for aquifer cleanup identifying lnapl thickness and fluctuations is very important to determine the lnapl recovering method and maximizing the recovery the feasibility of two artificial intelligence models including gene expression programming gep adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and classical multivariate linear regression mlr techniques are investigated in this study for lnapl level forecasting discharge rate of lnapl and groundwater level fluctuations were used as input attributes for the developed gep anfis and mlr models based on the comparison of three methods it was found that the gep could be successfully utilized in forecasting lnapl level fluctuations in recovery process also the gep models can identify the relationship between dependent and independent variables and provide an equation the identified equation based on gep can be useful for planning the recovery method and algorithms the results indicate that there is a high degree of agreement between the predicted values of the gep based equation and the actual values graphical abstract fx1 abbreviations lnapl light non aqueous phase liquids gep gene expression programming anfis adaptive

linear regression lnapl fluctuation 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of drinking domestic and industrial water worldwide today with the advancement of the industry the quality of groundwater is exposed to pollution one of the water quality contaminants is oil compounds and their leakage into the aquifer which are considered as the most common type of contamination in aquifers adjacent to oil facilities nadim et al 2000 some of petroleum hydrocarbons which are lighter than water infiltrate throughout the unsaturated zone and float on groundwater table known as light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl they form a separate phase and co exist with water in the pore spaces in the aquifer gasoline diesel motor oils and similar materials are examples of lnapls if the lnapl spill is stopped then the lnapl level fluctuations will be affected by fluctuations in the water table surface since no studies have been found to predict lnapl level fluctuations this section will focus on some studies conducted to predict water table fluctuations there are several methods for simulating hydrological processes and water level predictions including mathematical physical and experimental models mathematical models require full knowledge of the geological and geomorphic characteristics of the aquifer while empirical models are not derived from the aquifer physical characteristics but are derived from the analysis of time series data various types of time based models were used in hydrological simulations these models cannot overcome the non stationarity and non linearity of hydrological systems yaseen et al 2015 with the recent advances in computational intelligence in the field of machine learning experimental methods have been developed that are called data driven models ddm these models include artificial intelligence ai computational intelligence ci soft computing sc machine learning ml data mining dm solomatine et al 2009 in recent decades new data based techniques such as artificial intelligence have been used as an alternative technique for modeling hydrological systems emamgholizadeh et al 2014 four subcategories of the most important artificial intelligence models used in hydrological simulations include the machine learning methods fuzzy sets evolutionary computing and wavelet conjunction models yaseen et al 2015 in the machine learning method the data used are divided into two groups of training and testing data the training data are used for model learning and the testing data are used for model validation artificial intelligence has absorbed hydrologists more than other models because of easy implementation and lack of need to the physical properties of hydrological systems coppola et al 2005 different techniques of neural network models were used by the hydrologists to simulate and predict the water level in hydraulic systems coppola et al 2005 2007 nayak et al 2006 cimen and kisi 2009 noori et al 2010 guldal and tongal 2010 adamowski and chan 2011 mpallas et al 2011 yoon et al 2011 karimi et al 2012 kisi et al 2012 danandeh mehr et al 2014 yaseen et al 2016a 2016b 2017 ghorbani et al 2017 tiri et al 2018 determination of the hydraulic parameters azari and samani 2018 determination of the physical and chemical characteristics elzwayie et al 2016 sanikhani et al 2018 zaqoot et al 2018 in recent years the use of evolutionary computational methods has been expanded to predict groundwater levels due to the high speed and precision in implementation these methods include genetic programming gp gene expression programming gep genetic algorithms ga and swarm intelligence algorithms the results of the implementation of these models in predicting the water level indicates their higher accuracy compared to other models yaseen et al 2017 ghorbani et al 2017 aytek and alp 2008 wang et al 2009 karimi 2012 kisi et al 2012 danandeh mehr et al 2014 this study aims to predict the elevation of the lnapl level using new artificial intelligence based methods the height of the lnapl level is directly affected by groundwater fluctuations when the watertable rises the fluid lnapl layer on the watertable will migrate upwards and will form a separate droplet called the residual lnapl also when the watertable falls the lnapl layer floating on the surface of the watertable drains from the pores and moves towards the watertable generally fluctuations in groundwater and lnapl levels will result in the formation of smear zones which leads to the spread of contamination to non contaminated parts of the aquifer and soil an essential component in the implementation of lnapl recovery systems in contaminated areas is the precise prediction of groundwater and lnapl level so knowing their exact height can lead to better management of recovery operations as can be seen from the related literature no study on analysis and forecasting lnapl level fluctuations has been reported in this paper we investigated the feasibility of gep anfis and mlr methods in predicting the elevation of lnapl level using groundwater level and discharge rate of lnapl as inputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 data analysis removing lnapl contamination from aquifer is difficult and costly one of the ways is removing contaminants and transferring them to the surface the first step in planning such methods is to determine the design goals often the cost minimization associated with the remediation system and the maximization of contaminant removal are regarded as the most important design goals the study area in this research is the esmaeilabad village this village is located in the south of tehran and in the northern parts adjacent to the oil facilities fig 1 shows the geographical location of the study area the lnapl spills contaminated the soil and groundwater of this village several wells have been drilled to recover the lnapl one of the goals of this study is to estimate and predict the fluctuations of lnapl level in the wells so that the pumping cost is reduced 2 2 groundwater level correction one of the input data used to predict lnapl level fluctuations is the groundwater level groundwater level fluctuations can be affected by human activities and natural processes resulting from changes in recharge abiye et al 2018 in oil contaminated aquifers the elevation of the observed water level is less than the actual water level so this level must be corrected here we used the eq 1 to correct the groundwater level 5 1 h w z aw ρ n ρ w z an 1 ρ n ρ w z nw where ρn is oil density ρw is water density zaw is the air water interface zan is air oil interface znw is interface water oil and hw is the actual height of the groundwater table 1 summarizes the aquifer and well characteristics fig 2 shows water and lnapl hydrographs for the 10 years and the studied period from the correlation coefficient listed in table 1 and the hydrographs shown in fig 2 it is seen that the lnapl level changes follow the changes in water level thus changes in water level can be effective on the lnapl level elevation also lnapl discharge rate is regarded as other parameter which could have an effect on the lnapl level changes therefore input variables in this study are the water level elevation wl and lnapl discharge q rates and the lnapl level elevation ll is the output variable in this study we used daily data of 6 months from the available data the 150 daily data were used for training and the 30 days were utilized for testing the models table 2 represents the statistical parameters of the applied data where xmean xmax xmin sx and cv denote the mean maximum minimum standard deviation and variation coefficient respectively 2 3 gep model and application gene expression programming gep is a relatively new method first proposed by ferrira 2001a it uses basic principles of genetic algorithm ga and genetic programming evaluation of any knowledge in gep is similar to biological evaluation ozbek et al 2013 ferrira 2001a there are several features that have attracted researchers from various sciences to the use of gep in recent years such as the correlation of a large set of data without any prior knowledge of the relationship between them there is no need for predefined functions with easy implementation providing an explicit formulation of the relationship between input and output variables and the use of formulas with any programming language nazari 2012 fig 3 illustrates the algorithm of gep which starts by choosing the fitness function function set control parameters terminal set linking function and genetic operators in gep algorithm an initial chromosome is randomly composed and a mathematical function is presented this function is given by an expression tree et as illustrated in fig 4 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 kayadelen 2011 the procedure for prediction lnapl level fluctuations in gep is as follows the 1st step is the function set for this problem basic arithmetic operators as well as some of the other basic mathematical functions are applied table 3 shows the functions used in this problem the second step is terminal set to create the chromosomes in the current problem the terminal set includes water level elevation lnapl level elevation and lnapl discharge rates the third step is to choose the fitness function at this step various types of fitness functions can be selected in this study the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient r were used also for a more accurate evaluation of the model the two functions of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and the mean absolute percentage error mape were used separately for this problem 2 mape 1 n i 1 n t i o i i 1 n t i 100 3 rmse i 1 n t i o i 2 n 4 r corr t o cov t i o i σ t σ o 5 nse 1 t 1 n t i o i 2 t 1 n t i t i 2 where t is the observed value t i is the mean of observed value o is the predicted value and n is the total number of data the fourth step is to select the control parameters length of head h 8 and 3 genes per chromosomes were employed which are commonly utilized values in the literature e g ferreira 2001a 2001b ferreira 2006 the fifth step is selecting the linking function here the sub trees are combined by addition the six and final step is to select the genetic operators the optimum gep parameters used per run are reported in table 4 the values in table 4 are the default values of genexpro which also used in previous studies in the current study gepsoft was used to generate the mathematical function in the developed gep model three parameters were used as water level elevation lnapl level elevation and lnapl discharge rates various gep parameters were tried to find the ideal topology 180 data were utilized for the prediction of lnapl level fluctuations whole data set was divided in two parts 150 and 30 data were randomly selected for training and testing the applied models 2 4 anfis model and application the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system technique was originally presented by jang 1993 the anfis also called as adaptive network based fuzzy inference system is a kind of ann that depends on takagi sugeno fuzzy system this method was proposed in the early 1990s jang 1991 jang et al 1993 the anfis uses artificial neural network learning algorithm and fuzzy logic rules to design the relationship between input and output space so it has the benefits of both it uses a set of fuzzy if then rules and can be applied to approximate nonlinear functions abraham 2005 the anfis is a multilayer feed forward network and as mentioned above it uses neural network learning algorithms and fuzzy reasoning to map an input space to an output space various features of anfis enable it to achieve great success such as describing the behavior of a complex system by setting fuzzy if then rules there is no need for prior human expertise with easy implementation quick and accurate learning greater choice of membership functions to use strong generalization abilities and excellent explanation facilities through fuzzy rules al hmouz et al 2012 there are two types of fuzzy inference systems that include the mamdani method mamdani and assilian 1975 and sugeno method takagi and sugeno 1985 in mamdani procedure output membership functions must be from the fuzzy set and in the sugeno method the membership functions of the output are linear or constant in this study the sugeno method was applied for modeling lnapl level fluctuations to present the anfis architecture we assume that the fuzzy inference system under consideration has two inputs x and y and one output z here x and y might be considered as water level and discharge rate of lnapl in t 1 time step while the output z would represent the lnapl level at time t then for a first order takagi sugeno fuzzy model having two if then rules in the common rule set can be written using the following eqs 6 and 7 rule 1 6 if x is a 1 and y is b 1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 rule 2 7 if x is a 2 and y is b 2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 where x and y are the inputs ai and bi are the fuzzy sets fi are the outputs within the fuzzy region specified by the fuzzy rule and pi qi and ri are the design or linear parameters in the then part consequent part of the first order sugeno fuzzy model which are calculated during the training stage the anfis architecture used to implement these two rules is shown in fig 5 circles in the figure indicate fixed nodes while squares indicate adaptive nodes the architecture of anfis consists of five layers fig 5 each layer is explained in detail below layer 1 input nodes the nodes in this layer are adaptive this layer gives the membership degree of the inputs these can be expressed as 8 o i 1 μ a i wl t 1 i 1 2 9 o i 1 μ b i 2 q t 1 i 3 4 where wl and q are the water level and discharge rate of lnapl respectively and ai and bi are the linguistic labels big small etc μ a i wl t 1 and μ b i 2 q t 1 are the node functions for bell shaped membership function μai can be given as 10 μ ai 1 1 wl t 1 c i a i 2 b i or the gaussian membership function by 11 μ ai exp x c i a i 2 where ai bi and ci are the parameters of the membership function layer 2 rule nodes the nodes in this layer are fixed the 2nd layer involves fuzzy operators and uses the and operator to fuzzify the inputs and each node output represents the firing strength of a rule they are labeled with π indicating that they perform as a simple multiplier the output of this layer can be represented as 12 o i 2 w i μ a i wl t 1 μ b i q t 1 i 1 2 layer 3 average nodes the nodes in this layer are also fixed labeled by n the main aim is to compute the ratio of each ith rule s firing strength to the sum of all rule s firing strength consequently w i is taken as the normalized firing strength the outputs of this layer are called normalized firing strengths and can be represented as 13 o i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 consequent nodes these nodes are also adaptive the node function of the fourth layer calculates the contribution of each ith rule s toward the total output and the function defined as 14 o i 4 w i fi w i p i x q i y r i i 1 2 where w i is the output of layer 3 and pi qi and ri are the coefficients of this linear combination and are also the parameter set in the consequent part of the sugeno fuzzy model layer 5 output nodes there is only one single fixed node labeled with this node performs the summation of all incoming signals the overall output of the model is given by al hmouz et al 2012 15 o i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i this architecture of the adaptive network is used to develop the anfis model for the prediction of lnapl level elevation in the present study we used matlab software to establish the anfis models 2 5 mlr model and application regression analysis is a statistical technique for studying and modeling the relationship between variables at first the analyzer guesses that there is a relationship between variables and then collects quantitative information about them and plotting the data on a two dimensional graph if the data are along a line then the relation is linear and their equation will be as follow 16 y ax b where a is the intercept and b is the slope of the line there will be a slight difference between the actual and model values that is called the estimated error this error can be derived from measurement error environmental conditions natural differences and so on therefore the initial equation of the error is as follows 17 y ax b є the above equation is called a linear regression model here x is an independent variable and y is a dependent variable in the regression model the goal is to predict the behavior of the dependent variable with the knowledge of the values of independent variables using the regression line equation if there is only one independent variable the model is called a simple linear regression model and if there are more than one independent variable the model is called the multivariate linear regression model mlr extensive studies in the world have been conducted on the use of the mlr techniques to interpret and predict different phenomena that indicate the capability of these techniques for long term predictions hossain et al 2018 seeboonruang 2015 in the present study we used datafit software to establish the regression models 3 results and discussions in this study the accuracy of gep anfis and mlr models in prediction of lnapl level is compared as stated in the introduction the height of the lnapl level is influenced by the vertical fluctuations of the watertable so that if the surface of the watertable increases the lnapl level will also increase and vice versa therefore in the presence of vertical fluctuations at the lnapl level the development of residual lnapl will increase this reduces the volume of the mobile lnapl and the lnapl thickness and prevents its lateral movement and subsequently affects the sustainability and recoverability of lnapl on the other hand vertical fluctuations will spread the pollution to non polluted areas of the aquifer and soil this will damage the aquifer and its sustainability therefore identifying lnapl level elevation and its fluctuations can be useful in planning related to the operation of the recovery and selecting of the suitable method

12284,one of the most important pollutants in the aquifers adjacent to oil facilities is lnapl light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl recovery from the aquifer is one of the fastest and most convenient methods for aquifer cleanup identifying lnapl thickness and fluctuations is very important to determine the lnapl recovering method and maximizing the recovery the feasibility of two artificial intelligence models including gene expression programming gep adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and classical multivariate linear regression mlr techniques are investigated in this study for lnapl level forecasting discharge rate of lnapl and groundwater level fluctuations were used as input attributes for the developed gep anfis and mlr models based on the comparison of three methods it was found that the gep could be successfully utilized in forecasting lnapl level fluctuations in recovery process also the gep models can identify the relationship between dependent and independent variables and provide an equation the identified equation based on gep can be useful for planning the recovery method and algorithms the results indicate that there is a high degree of agreement

linear regression lnapl fluctuation 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of drinking domestic and industrial water worldwide today with the advancement of the industry the quality of groundwater is exposed to pollution one of the water quality contaminants is oil compounds and their leakage into the aquifer which are considered as the most common type of contamination in aquifers adjacent to oil facilities nadim et al 2000 some of petroleum hydrocarbons which are lighter than water infiltrate throughout the unsaturated zone and float on groundwater table known as light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl they form a separate phase and co exist with water in the pore spaces in the aquifer gasoline diesel motor oils and similar materials are examples of lnapls if the lnapl spill is stopped then the lnapl level fluctuations will be affected by fluctuations in the water table surface since no studies have been found to predict lnapl level fluctuations this section will focus on some studies conducted to predict water table fluctuations there are several methods for simulating hydrological processes and water level predictions including mathematical physical and experimental models mathematical models require full knowledge of the geological and geomorphic characteristics of the aquifer while empirical models are not derived from the aquifer physical characteristics but are derived from the analysis of time series data various types of time based models were used in hydrological simulations these models cannot overcome the non stationarity and non linearity of hydrological systems yaseen et al 2015 with the recent advances in computational intelligence in the field of machine learning experimental methods have been developed that are called data driven models ddm these models include artificial intelligence ai computational intelligence ci soft computing sc machine learning ml data mining dm solomatine et al 2009 in recent decades new data based techniques such as artificial intelligence have been used as an alternative technique for modeling hydrological systems emamgholizadeh et al 2014 four subcategories of the most important artificial intelligence models used in hydrological simulations include the machine learning methods fuzzy sets evolutionary computing and wavelet conjunction models yaseen et al 2015 in the machine learning method the data used are divided into two groups of training and testing data the training data are used for model learning and the testing data are used for model validation artificial intelligence has absorbed hydrologists more than other models because of easy implementation and lack of need to the physical properties of hydrological systems coppola et al 2005 different techniques of neural network models were used by the hydrologists to simulate and predict the water level in hydraulic systems coppola et al 2005 2007 nayak et al 2006 cimen and kisi 2009 noori et al 2010 guldal and tongal 2010 adamowski and chan 2011 mpallas et al 2011 yoon et al 2011 karimi et al 2012 kisi et al 2012 danandeh mehr et al 2014 yaseen et al 2016a 2016b 2017 ghorbani et al 2017 tiri et al 2018 determination of the hydraulic parameters azari and samani 2018 determination of the physical and chemical characteristics elzwayie et al 2016 sanikhani et al 2018 zaqoot et al 2018 in recent years the use of evolutionary computational methods has been expanded to predict groundwater levels due to the high speed and precision in implementation these methods include genetic programming gp gene expression programming gep genetic algorithms ga and swarm intelligence algorithms the results of the implementation of these models in predicting the water level indicates their higher accuracy compared to other models yaseen et al 2017 ghorbani et al 2017 aytek and alp 2008 wang et al 2009 karimi 2012 kisi et al 2012 danandeh mehr et al 2014 this study aims to predict the elevation of the lnapl level using new artificial intelligence based methods the height of the lnapl level is directly affected by groundwater fluctuations when the watertable rises the fluid lnapl layer on the watertable will migrate upwards and will form a separate droplet called the residual lnapl also when the watertable falls the lnapl layer floating on the surface of the watertable drains from the pores and moves towards the watertable generally fluctuations in groundwater and lnapl levels will result in the formation of smear zones which leads to the spread of contamination to non contaminated parts of the aquifer and soil an essential component in the implementation of lnapl recovery systems in contaminated areas is the precise prediction of groundwater and lnapl level so knowing their exact height can lead to better management of recovery operations as can be seen from the related literature no study on analysis and forecasting lnapl level fluctuations has been reported in this paper we investigated the feasibility of gep anfis and mlr methods in predicting the elevation of lnapl level using groundwater level and discharge rate of lnapl as inputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 data analysis removing lnapl contamination from aquifer is difficult and costly one of the ways is removing contaminants and transferring them to the surface the first step in planning such methods is to determine the design goals often the cost minimization associated with the remediation system and the maximization of contaminant removal are regarded as the most important design goals the study area in this research is the esmaeilabad village this village is located in the south of tehran and in the northern parts adjacent to the oil facilities fig 1 shows the geographical location of the study area the lnapl spills contaminated the soil and groundwater of this village several wells have been drilled to recover the lnapl one of the goals of this study is to estimate and predict the fluctuations of lnapl level in the wells so that the pumping cost is reduced 2 2 groundwater level correction one of the input data used to predict lnapl level fluctuations is the groundwater level groundwater level fluctuations can be affected by human activities and natural processes resulting from changes in recharge abiye et al 2018 in oil contaminated aquifers the elevation of the observed water level is less than the actual water level so this level must be corrected here we used the eq 1 to correct the groundwater level 5 1 h w z aw ρ n ρ w z an 1 ρ n ρ w z nw where ρn is oil density ρw is water density zaw is the air water interface zan is air oil interface znw is interface water oil and hw is the actual height of the groundwater table 1 summarizes the aquifer and well characteristics fig 2 shows water and lnapl hydrographs for the 10 years and the studied period from the correlation coefficient listed in table 1 and the hydrographs shown in fig 2 it is seen that the lnapl level changes follow the changes in water level thus changes in water level can be effective on the lnapl level elevation also lnapl discharge rate is regarded as other parameter which could have an effect on the lnapl level changes therefore input variables in this study are the water level elevation wl and lnapl discharge q rates and the lnapl level elevation ll is the output variable in this study we used daily data of 6 months from the available data the 150 daily data were used for training and the 30 days were utilized for testing the models table 2 represents the statistical parameters of the applied data where xmean xmax xmin sx and cv denote the mean maximum minimum standard deviation and variation coefficient respectively 2 3 gep model and application gene expression programming gep is a relatively new method first proposed by ferrira 2001a it uses basic principles of genetic algorithm ga and genetic programming evaluation of any knowledge in gep is similar to biological evaluation ozbek et al 2013 ferrira 2001a there are several features that have attracted researchers from various sciences to the use of gep in recent years such as the correlation of a large set of data without any prior knowledge of the relationship between them there is no need for predefined functions with easy implementation providing an explicit formulation of the relationship between input and output variables and the use of formulas with any programming language nazari 2012 fig 3 illustrates the algorithm of gep which starts by choosing the fitness function function set control parameters terminal set linking function and genetic operators in gep algorithm an initial chromosome is randomly composed and a mathematical function is presented this function is given by an expression tree et as illustrated in fig 4 teodorescu and sherwood 2008 kayadelen 2011 the procedure for prediction lnapl level fluctuations in gep is as follows the 1st step is the function set for this problem basic arithmetic operators as well as some of the other basic mathematical functions are applied table 3 shows the functions used in this problem the second step is terminal set to create the chromosomes in the current problem the terminal set includes water level elevation lnapl level elevation and lnapl discharge rates the third step is to choose the fitness function at this step various types of fitness functions can be selected in this study the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient r were used also for a more accurate evaluation of the model the two functions of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and the mean absolute percentage error mape were used separately for this problem 2 mape 1 n i 1 n t i o i i 1 n t i 100 3 rmse i 1 n t i o i 2 n 4 r corr t o cov t i o i σ t σ o 5 nse 1 t 1 n t i o i 2 t 1 n t i t i 2 where t is the observed value t i is the mean of observed value o is the predicted value and n is the total number of data the fourth step is to select the control parameters length of head h 8 and 3 genes per chromosomes were employed which are commonly utilized values in the literature e g ferreira 2001a 2001b ferreira 2006 the fifth step is selecting the linking function here the sub trees are combined by addition the six and final step is to select the genetic operators the optimum gep parameters used per run are reported in table 4 the values in table 4 are the default values of genexpro which also used in previous studies in the current study gepsoft was used to generate the mathematical function in the developed gep model three parameters were used as water level elevation lnapl level elevation and lnapl discharge rates various gep parameters were tried to find the ideal topology 180 data were utilized for the prediction of lnapl level fluctuations whole data set was divided in two parts 150 and 30 data were randomly selected for training and testing the applied models 2 4 anfis model and application the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system technique was originally presented by jang 1993 the anfis also called as adaptive network based fuzzy inference system is a kind of ann that depends on takagi sugeno fuzzy system this method was proposed in the early 1990s jang 1991 jang et al 1993 the anfis uses artificial neural network learning algorithm and fuzzy logic rules to design the relationship between input and output space so it has the benefits of both it uses a set of fuzzy if then rules and can be applied to approximate nonlinear functions abraham 2005 the anfis is a multilayer feed forward network and as mentioned above it uses neural network learning algorithms and fuzzy reasoning to map an input space to an output space various features of anfis enable it to achieve great success such as describing the behavior of a complex system by setting fuzzy if then rules there is no need for prior human expertise with easy implementation quick and accurate learning greater choice of membership functions to use strong generalization abilities and excellent explanation facilities through fuzzy rules al hmouz et al 2012 there are two types of fuzzy inference systems that include the mamdani method mamdani and assilian 1975 and sugeno method takagi and sugeno 1985 in mamdani procedure output membership functions must be from the fuzzy set and in the sugeno method the membership functions of the output are linear or constant in this study the sugeno method was applied for modeling lnapl level fluctuations to present the anfis architecture we assume that the fuzzy inference system under consideration has two inputs x and y and one output z here x and y might be considered as water level and discharge rate of lnapl in t 1 time step while the output z would represent the lnapl level at time t then for a first order takagi sugeno fuzzy model having two if then rules in the common rule set can be written using the following eqs 6 and 7 rule 1 6 if x is a 1 and y is b 1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 rule 2 7 if x is a 2 and y is b 2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 where x and y are the inputs ai and bi are the fuzzy sets fi are the outputs within the fuzzy region specified by the fuzzy rule and pi qi and ri are the design or linear parameters in the then part consequent part of the first order sugeno fuzzy model which are calculated during the training stage the anfis architecture used to implement these two rules is shown in fig 5 circles in the figure indicate fixed nodes while squares indicate adaptive nodes the architecture of anfis consists of five layers fig 5 each layer is explained in detail below layer 1 input nodes the nodes in this layer are adaptive this layer gives the membership degree of the inputs these can be expressed as 8 o i 1 μ a i wl t 1 i 1 2 9 o i 1 μ b i 2 q t 1 i 3 4 where wl and q are the water level and discharge rate of lnapl respectively and ai and bi are the linguistic labels big small etc μ a i wl t 1 and μ b i 2 q t 1 are the node functions for bell shaped membership function μai can be given as 10 μ ai 1 1 wl t 1 c i a i 2 b i or the gaussian membership function by 11 μ ai exp x c i a i 2 where ai bi and ci are the parameters of the membership function layer 2 rule nodes the nodes in this layer are fixed the 2nd layer involves fuzzy operators and uses the and operator to fuzzify the inputs and each node output represents the firing strength of a rule they are labeled with π indicating that they perform as a simple multiplier the output of this layer can be represented as 12 o i 2 w i μ a i wl t 1 μ b i q t 1 i 1 2 layer 3 average nodes the nodes in this layer are also fixed labeled by n the main aim is to compute the ratio of each ith rule s firing strength to the sum of all rule s firing strength consequently w i is taken as the normalized firing strength the outputs of this layer are called normalized firing strengths and can be represented as 13 o i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 consequent nodes these nodes are also adaptive the node function of the fourth layer calculates the contribution of each ith rule s toward the total output and the function defined as 14 o i 4 w i fi w i p i x q i y r i i 1 2 where w i is the output of layer 3 and pi qi and ri are the coefficients of this linear combination and are also the parameter set in the consequent part of the sugeno fuzzy model layer 5 output nodes there is only one single fixed node labeled with this node performs the summation of all incoming signals the overall output of the model is given by al hmouz et al 2012 15 o i 5 i w i f i i w i f i i w i this architecture of the adaptive network is used to develop the anfis model for the prediction of lnapl level elevation in the present study we used matlab software to establish the anfis models 2 5 mlr model and application regression analysis is a statistical technique for studying and modeling the relationship between variables at first the analyzer guesses that there is a relationship between variables and then collects quantitative information about them and plotting the data on a two dimensional graph if the data are along a line then the relation is linear and their equation will be as follow 16 y ax b where a is the intercept and b is the slope of the line there will be a slight difference between the actual and model values that is called the estimated error this error can be derived from measurement error environmental conditions natural differences and so on therefore the initial equation of the error is as follows 17 y ax b є the above equation is called a linear regression model here x is an independent variable and y is a dependent variable in the regression model the goal is to predict the behavior of the dependent variable with the knowledge of the values of independent variables using the regression line equation if there is only one independent variable the model is called a simple linear regression model and if there are more than one independent variable the model is called the multivariate linear regression model mlr extensive studies in the world have been conducted on the use of the mlr techniques to interpret and predict different phenomena that indicate the capability of these techniques for long term predictions hossain et al 2018 seeboonruang 2015 in the present study we used datafit software to establish the regression models 3 results and discussions in this study the accuracy of gep anfis and mlr models in prediction of lnapl level is compared as stated in the introduction the height of the lnapl level is influenced by the vertical fluctuations of the watertable so that if the surface of the watertable increases the lnapl level will also increase and vice versa therefore in the presence of vertical fluctuations at the lnapl level the development of residual lnapl will increase this reduces the volume of the mobile lnapl and the lnapl thickness and prevents its lateral movement and subsequently affects the sustainability and recoverability of lnapl on the other hand vertical fluctuations will spread the pollution to non polluted areas of the aquifer and soil this will damage the
