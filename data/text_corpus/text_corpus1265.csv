6325,subsurface reservoirs are far more heterogeneous and complex than the simulation models in terms of scale assumptions and description in this work we address the issue of prediction reliability while calibrating imperfect low fidelity reservoir models the main goal is to avoid over confident and inaccurate predictions by including a model for the bias terms i e error model of a predefined form during the history matching process our aim is to obtain unbiased posterior distributions of the physical model parameters and thus improving the prediction capacity of the calibrated low fidelity reservoir models we formulate the parameter estimation problem as a joint estimation of the imperfect model parameters and the error model parameters the structure of the error model and the prior distributions of the error model parameters are evaluated before calibration through analysis of leading sources of the modeling errors we adopt a bayesian framework for solving the inverse problem where we utilize the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda as a practical history matching algorithm we provide two test cases where the impact of typical model errors originating from grid coarsening up scaling and from utilizing an imperfect geological model description is investigated for both cases results from the es mda update with and without accounting for model error are compared in terms of estimated physical model parameters quality of match to historical data and forecasting ability compared to held out data the test results show that calibration of the imperfect physical model without accounting for model errors results in extreme values of the calibrated model parameters and a biased posterior distribution with accounting for modeling errors the posterior distribution of the model parameters is less biased i e nearly unbiased and improved forecasting skills with higher prediction accuracy reliability is observed moreover the consistency between the different runs of the es mda is improved by including the modeling error component although the examples in the paper consider the oil water system with permeabilities being parameters of the physical model the developed methodology is general and can be applied to typical ground water hydrology models keywords model error model bias model discrepancy history matching calibration error model principle component analysis pca bayesian inversion 1 introduction in subsurface reservoir modeling various approximations are introduced at different stages of the modeling process which in turn render most of the models to be imperfect and low fidelity in nature however these imperfect models are generally still useful for understanding the key physical interactions within the subsurface regions of interest the sources of approximations a k a modeling errors include properties up scaling grid coarsening discretization errors imperfect reservoir fluid properties relative permeability reservoir geology description parameterization and approximate representation of the complete complex subsurface fluid flow physics e g black oil model in place of a compositional model or constant rock compressibility assumption in the context of error modeling grid up scaling has been widely studied within the reservoir simulation community in the published literature there exist a number of efficient up scaling techniques durlofsky 2003 aiming to obtain optimal upscaled properties however up scaling errors are not completely eliminated by most of these methods discretization errors also cannot be eliminated ertekin et al 2001 even after selecting an optimal grid size and utilizing adaptive time stepping techniques additionally numerical simulation using an optimal fine grid could be computationally prohibitive especially for tasks that typically requires many simulation runs for example history matching or robust optimization problems various techniques have been proposed to address this computational bottleneck for example reduced order modeling and proxy models among many other techniques c f silva et al 2007 rammay and abdulraheem 2014 cardoso et al 2009 an alternative approach is to utilize an upscaled model instead of the fine scale model for multi query computationally demanding tasks e g uncertainty quantification problems in the context of history matching if the up scaling errors are not modeled during the parameter inference step the posterior distributions of the model parameters is likely to be biased and this bias will subsequently affect the future predictions of the engineering quantities of interest e g oil gas and water rates pressure omre et al 2004 approximated the up scaling and discretization errors by computing samples or realizations of the error data using pairs of fine and coarse scale models the model errors due to up scaling were then estimated using a multiple regression technique and added to the coarse scale model predictions during the history matching process lodoen et al 2005 utilized a similar procedure on a different set of test cases while employing a more accurate up scaling procedure accurate reservoir geology description is another challenging task due to various uncertainties including channel geometry faults shape facies proportion stratigraphic and or structural frameworks it is widely known that unrealistic geological models could be calibrated to match the historical data c f carter et al 2006 refsgaard et al 2012 however these fitted models fail to provide reliable predictions and could ultimately mislead the reservoir development plans c f carter et al 2006 refsgaard et al 2012 although considerable effort is often put into constructing geological models that are as realistic as possible it is very difficult to maintain this geological realism while updating them to match the observed data sun and durlofsky 2017 accounting for model errors during the calibration process has attracted a large body of research c f oliver and alfonzo 2018 dreano et al 2017 josset et al 2015 where various approaches have been developed to account for the model error component during model calibration c f hansen et al 2014 evin et al 2014 reichert and schuwirth 2012 these approaches vary according to the different behavior and complexity of the modeled physical system for example in hydro geophysical systems köpke et al 2017 accounted for the model error component using orthonormal basis generated from an error dictionary which is continuously enriched during the calibration process the models of the bias or error component could be generally classified as either input dependent giudice et al 2013 or output dependent evin et al 2014 input dependent model error formulation represents the error components as a function of the model parameters for example a reservoir model error can vary with permeability realizations or other input model parameters o sullivan and christie 2005 utilized an input dependent formulation for the model error where the authors computed model error realizations using the difference between a fine grid and coarse grid model outputs during the calibration process an interpolation of the error component was performed to estimate a correction term to the coarse grid model predictions lødøen and tjelmeland 2010 used multiple linear regression algorithm to model errors where the residual part for the multiple regression was assumed to depend on the model input parameters the residual terms were modeled using a zero mean gaussian process giudice et al 2013 used an input dependent model error representation to improve uncertainty estimation in urban hydrological models in that application the model error variance was set to be depending on the input of the rainfall term output dependent model error formulation represents the error components as a function of the output of the physical model for example evin et al 2014 utilized an output dependent formulation for the model error heteroscedasticity as a function of the simulated streamflow in a realistic setting where large models are utilized i e millions of input parameters it is hard to relate the model errors to the high dimensional input parameter space and output dependent or input output i o independent forms of the model error were proposed as an alternative approach that might have some advantages over the input dependent error models giudice et al 2013 model error representation can also be classified as either an external bias description ebd or an internal noise description ind giudice et al 2015 ebd was developed using the background of statistical inference in a regression type framework giudice et al 2015 in ebd the model error term is added externally into the forward model approximate or inadequate model output in ind the model error is formulated as an additional term of the state space giudice et al 2015 this approach is also known as state space modelling or stochastic gray box modelling c f moradkhani et al 2012 kristensen et al 2004 giudice et al 2015 concluded that ebd has some advantages over ind in terms of long term predictions in this paper we utilize an ebd and i o independent error model formulation as it is more suitable for large scale models e g subsurface oil and gas reservoir models relying on black box simulators several typical sources of model errors are present in the test cases investigated in this paper including a coarse grid less detailed geological representation i e upscaling of different types of geological features including variogram based and channelized geology discretization errors and slight change in well locations due to grid coarsening the error model formulation presented here assumes that the total modeling errors consists of two components structural component and noise like component we note that the structural component is often neglected in the bias correction approaches developed in hydrological literature c f maier et al 2014 vrugt 2016 white et al 2014 in this study prior to model calibration the structure of the model error is estimated and represented using several basis functions and the magnitude of the noise like component is quantified during history matching the weights of the basis functions are jointly calibrated with the physical model parameters using data observed at well locations the noise like part of the model error is also accounted for during the history matching process to avoid over fitting of the error model we note that the presented formulation is general and can be applied to other sources of modeling errors when dealing with low fidelity physical models the low fidelity models are generally used as efficient surrogate models for computationally demanding tasks c f asher et al 2015 laloy et al 2013 for the bayesian inversion we use a particular type of iterative ensemble smoother es mda emerick and reynolds 2013 the formulation of es mda has some similarities with kalman filtering algorithms sun et al 2016 however es mda assimilates data from different times simultaneously and the same set of data is assimilated multiple times with an inflated data noise covariance matrix which is equivalent to annealing approaches stordal and elsheikh 2015 the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present some background on bayesian inverse modeling followed by the proposed error model formulation following that we present the case studies in section 3 the results of the case studies are discussed in section 4 followed by the conclusions of our work in section 5 2 methodology bayesian inverse modeling is a generic inference framework that is widely adopted for calibration of reservoir models while accounting for different types sources of uncertainties in the bayesian framework the conditional probabilities p m d obs of the model parameters m given the observational data d obs a k a posterior distribution of the model parameters is estimated using bayes rule oliver et al 2008 1 p m d obs p d obs m p m where m is the model parameters vector of size n m d obs is the observations vector of size n d p m is the prior probability of the model parameters and p d obs m is the likelihood function of the data given a specific realization of the model parameters m it is common to assume a gaussian prior 2 p m exp 1 2 m m pr c m 1 m m pr where m pr is an n m dimensional vector of the mean prior model parameters and c m is the covariance matrix of the prior model parameters it is also common to assume that data noise is gaussian so that the likelihood function takes the form 3 p d obs m exp 1 2 d obs d c d 1 d obs d where d is the simulated or predicted data vector using the model parameters m and c d is the error noise covariance matrix which is defined in section 2 1 and 2 2 depending on the utilized history matching procedure using these definitions bayes rule defined in eq 1 could be expanded as following 4 p m d obs exp 1 2 d obs d c d 1 d obs d m m pr c m 1 m m pr several algorithms could be used to generate samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters oliver et al 2008 among those markov chain monte carlo mcmc is an exact method for sampling however mcmc can be computationally expensive due to the large number of iterations needed to reach convergence and the sequential nature of the method ensemble based methods have been widely used for calibrating subsurface flow models due to the computational feasibility and parallel nature of ensemble methods in this study we utilize the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda algorithm for the calibration step emerick and reynolds 2013 es mda belongs to a class of iterative ensemble smoothing techniques that could be used to solve non linear inverse problem iteratively with an inflated noise covariance matrix the es mda algorithm steps are summarized as follows select the number of iterations number of data assimilation n a and the inflation factor α a common choice of the inflation factor is to set it as a constant value for all iterations i e α n a initialize an ensemble of model parameters and perturb the observation data for each ensemble member using 5 d uc j d obs α c d 1 2 z d where the subscript j is the ensemble member index j 1 n e and n e is the ensemble size d uc j is n d dimensional vector of perturbed observation z d is the n d dimensional vector with standard gaussian random variables as its components i e z d n 0 i n d n d update each ensemble member using 6 m j i 1 m j i c md c dd α c d 1 d uc j d j where the superscript i is the iteration index c dd is the model output covariance matrix and c md is the cross covariance matrix of model parameters and model predictions repeat the above steps for all iterations from i 1 to n a 2 1 procedures for history matching of reservoir models in this study two types of history matching procedures are investigated history matching while neglecting model discrepancy i e standard history matching procedure and joint history matching of the model parameters and the parameters of an error bias model in this paper we use the term model discrepancy and model error interchangeably the standard history matching procedure relies on an implicit assumption that the model errors are generally small and could be neglected i e the simulation model is perfect mathematically if an accurate high fidelity model is utilized the observed data is formulated as giudice et al 2013 7 d obs g m true d where g is a nonlinear function representing the accurate high fidelity forward simulation model m true is the true model parameters d is the measurement errors which is usually assumed to follow a normal distribution n 0 c d and c d is the measurement errors covariance matrix in this study uncorrelated measurement errors are considered therefore the matrix c d is a diagonal matrix in standard history matching i e neglecting modeling errors c d in eqs 3 6 is set to the covariance of measurement errors therefore 8 c d c d however as noted in the introduction section several approximations are commonly introduced in the computational model to simplify the simulation process e g black oil model versus compositional flow or to speed up the simulations coarsening of the simulation grid during history matching if the model error caused by these approximations is not accounted for the obtained posterior distribution could be biased in the case of utilizing an approximate low fidelity model the observation data is related to the true model parameters m true as giudice et al 2013 9 d obs g m true d m where m is the model error and g is a nonlinear function representing the imperfect approximate low fidelity simulation model by subtracting eq 7 from 9 we obtain 10 m g m true g m true in the following sub section we present a simple yet general parameterization of the model error term m 2 2 error model formulation in this study ebd and i o independent error model approach is considered as the model errors in our test cases were dominated by structured components these errors are parameterized using smooth basis functions obtained by principle component analysis pca method which is an effective data driven dimension reduction technique shlens 2014 kerschen et al 2005 we rely on simulation output from pairs of models accurate high fidelity versus approximate low fidelity to obtain the basis functions and the prior statistics of the coefficients of the pca basis functions we acknowledge that this limits the applicability of the developed approach to the cases for which an accurate high fidelity model is available however we note that the accurate high fidelity model is only used to estimate the prior model error statistics and is not used during the calibration process this is a notable difference between the presented framework and related studies by josset et al 2015 and köpke et al 2017 in the current setting the prior model error realizations are estimated using 11 mr g m r g m r where r is the index of the prior realizations i e r 1 to n r n r is the total number of realizations used to estimate the model error statistics mr is an n d dimensional vector of model error for realization r all prior model error realizations are assembled into the matrix r n d n r the mean of the model error prior is 12 m 1 n r r 1 n r mr the covariance of the model error prior is oliver et al 2008 13 c e 1 n r 1 m i n r m i n r where i n r is an n r dimensional row vector with all ones as its components in this study pca is used to parametrize the prior model error realizations and the weights of the obtained pca basis vectors are jointly inferred with the model parameters during the history matching process the basis functions are obtained by singular value decomposition svd of the error covariance matrix c e oliver et al 2008 14 c e u σ v where u and v are the orthonormal singular vectors basis functions and σ is a diagonal matrix of the singular values the error model is formulated using the leading l singular vectors as following 15 mr φ β r m where φ r n d l are the first l orthonormal singular vectors basis functions from u and β r r l 1 are the coefficients of error model for realization r the objective of the calibration process is then to find the posterior distribution of reservoir model parameters and the coefficients β of the pca based error model since bayesian inverse modelling require prior statistics of model parameters therefore the prior statistics of the coefficients β should be estimated least square form of eq 15 is used to compute prior realizations of the coefficient vector β as following 16 β r φ φ 1 φ mr m since φ is an orthonormal matrix i e φ φ 1 therefore eq 16 can also be written as 17 β r φ mr m the prior statistic such as the mean and covariance of β realizations are computed using 18 μ β 1 n r r 1 n r β r 19 c β 1 n r 1 r 1 n r β r μ β β r μ β where μ β r l 1 is the mean of β realizations and c β r l l is the covariance of β realizations in this study we only consider the diagonal terms of the matrix c β to generate prior samples of error model coefficients for the history matching purpose in order to avoid over fitting the error model the number of coefficients of the pca based error model l should be limited to a small number therefore the residual of error model cannot be neglected and need to be included in the inversion process the residual of the least square fit is defined as 20 ζ mr mr mr all residual realizations are assembled into matrix ζ r n d n r the covariance of the residual from all error model realizations is then estimated using 21 c t 1 n r 1 ζ ζ where c t is denoted the error model noise covariance for history matching of imperfect models the total error covariance matrix c d in eqs 3 6 contains both the measurement and error model noise components as following 22 c d c d c t for simplicity only the diagonal terms of the matrix c t is considered in this study conceptually c d is the total uncalibrated uncertainty which includes both the measurement noise and the model error noise that is not captured by the truncated pca based error model in hansen et al 2014 modeling errors were considered as uncalibrated uncertainties using gaussian distribution i e accounting for mean and covariance of errors in their approach the model error is accounted for by replacing d obs with d obs m and replacing c d with c d c e however this approach would be inconsistent inefficient for physical systems which exhibit highly complex statistics and correlations of model errors that change significantly not only over the data space but also as a function of the input model parameters köpke et al 2017 3 case studies in this section we present the details of the case studies the dimension of the subsurface reservoir is 7500 ft 7500 ft 20 ft in the x y and z directions respectively incompressible two phase porous media flow of oil and water is considered the initial reservoir pressure is 5000 psi and the reservoir has uniform porosity of 20 the reservoir contains one injector well i1 and three production wells p1 p2 p3 and is simulated using a 2d grid we utilize the matlab reservoir simulation tool box mrst lie 2016 for the forward model simulations corey s power law model is used to represent relative permeabilities parameter values for the corey s model and fluid properties are listed in appendix a the gravitational and capillary pressure effects are neglected the production wells are operated under constant bottom hole pressure constraint of 4500 psi and the injector well is operated under constant injection rate constraint with varying control values as shown in fig 1 a the wells open shut schedule is shown in fig 1 b fig 1 also shows end of historical period i e 2 years in the historical period the flow rates at the production wells and the bottom hole pressure of the injector well are used as the historical data for the calibration process we also note that one of the production wells p3 is only used in prediction phase in order to assess predictions from calibrated models on wells drilled in future development plans 3 1 case 1 coarse scale model in the first case study fine grid high fidelity model uses a 2d grid with 75 75 cells the distributed log permeability fields are modeled as multivariate gaussian with exponential covariance function 23 c σ 2 exp 3 s r a γ where s is the lag distance and r a σ 2 γ are the correlation range variance and exponent respectively which are 35 cells 1 and 1 respectively in this test case the log permeability field ln k is parameterized using pca and only two leading basis functions are retained 24 ln k ln k b 1 n w w b ψ b where ln k is the mean log permeability equal to 4 in this test case b is index of the basis weight w and basis function ψ and n w 2 fig 2 b shows the leading two principal basis functions obtained by singular value decomposition of covariance of log permeability fields eq 23 fig 2 a shows the prior distribution of weights obtained by projecting the log permeability fields into the pca basis functions fig 3 a shows the reference fine scale log permeability field the fine scale reference log permeability field is generated by the leading two pca basis functions and reference basis weights are shown as the red vertical lines in fig 2 the coarse grid low fidelity reservoir models contain only 5 5 grid blocks the coarsened version of the reference fine model is shown in fig 3 b in which harmonic averaging is used to up scale the log permeability field the observed data are generated by the fine scale model using reference log permeability field fig 3 a with the addition of measurement noise of 2 of the reference solution we note that except permeabilities the rest of the static and dynamic properties i e porosity relative permeability viscosity and density well controls and schedule of the coarse scale model are the same as the fine scale model two different procedures of history matching the coarse scale model were considered in the case of neglecting model discrepancy pca basis weights w of the log permeabilities are calibrated i e m j w in eq 6 in the case of joint inversion with error model the estimated parameters is the combined vector of the log permeability pca weights and the error model coefficients i e m j w β in eq 6 prior statistics of the model discrepancy were estimated using eq 11 one hundred fine scale permeability realizations were generated through eq 24 by sampling the prior distribution of the pca basis weights and a corresponding number of coarse scale permeability realizations were obtained using harmonic up scaling forward runs were then performed for both the coarse and fine scale models to obtain the error realizations using eq 11 a smaller number of realizations could be used to evaluate the model discrepancy statistics in that case special care should be taken to select a representative set of prior realizations to cover the respective statistic fig 4 shows the prior statistics of the model discrepancy in the simulated well production data bottom hole pressure of the injector well and flow rates of the producers 3 2 case 2 up scaled imperfect geology model geologists commonly try to build geologically realistic prior models however maintaining the geological realism during the history matching process is quite challenging sun and durlofsky 2017 for example multipoint statistics mps is widely used to represent channelized geological patterns geologically consistent history matching using mps prior is still a subject of active research chen et al 2016 sometimes the predictability of the history matched mps models may not be satisfactory often due to limitation of the available history matching methods in handling this type of non gaussian models chen et al 2016 in this study we do not aim for obtaining calibrated models that are consistent with the channelized geological feature instead we focus on improving predictability of the calibrated coarse models by including the error model for this case the permeability fields are based on a similar test case presented in chen et al 2016 fig 5 a shows the reference fine scale log permeability with channelized features and fig 5 b shows the corresponding up scaled log permeability field in which the channelized features have been lost due to harmonic averaging the reference and prior fine scale channelized log permeability fields are generated using a two facies training image with the direct sampling version of mps mariethoz and caers 2014 the observed data are generated by the fine scale model using reference log permeability field fig 5 a with the addition of measurement noise of 2 similar to the first test case one hundred realizations of the model discrepancy were obtained using eq 11 by running the fine scale simulation using the mps permeability images of size 75 75 grid blocks and the corresponding up scaled permeability field with 5 5 grid blocks fig 6 shows the prior statistics of the model discrepancy in the simulated well production data 4 results and discussion in this section we present history matching results for test case 1 and 2 with and without accounting for the model discrepancy all the ensemble based history matching results are presented for multiple runs five independent ensembles in order to investigate the consistency and reliability of the parameter estimation process each ensemble run consists of 100 ensemble members and the measurement errors are assumed to be 2 of the observation data we utilized the es mda algorithm with eight iterations α 8 for calibration in the case of joint inversion with error model two pca components were retained per each output time series to parametrize the model discrepancy since we have seven output time series the total number of error model parameters is 14 the calibrated models are evaluated using three different forecasting metrics to assess the quality of the estimated parameters and the capacity of the calibrated models in making future predictions the utilized forecasting metrics are coverage probability cp mean continuous ranked probability score crps and mean square error mse cp indicates the fraction of the actual data that lie within the 95 confidence interval of the estimation a value of 0 95 for cp indicates a consistent estimation of uncertainty and values below 0 95 indicate underestimation of uncertainty mean crps quantifies both accuracy and precision hersbach 2000 and higher values of crps indicate a less accurate results mse is widely used as a metric for parameter estimation problems however mse measures the quality of data fitting and is not enough to provide a probabilistic assessment of the estimation and prediction from an ensemble of models in this study we observed that a combination of mse cp and crps provides a good assessment of the quality for the probabilistic forecast skauvold and eidsvik 2018 the mathematical formulations of the three forecasting metrics are listed in appendix b 4 1 case 1 results in this test case the log permeability is calibrated in terms of the pca basis weights i e w 1 w 2 as detailed in the problem description fig 7 shows the posterior distributions of the basis weights for the five runs for both cases of neglecting and accounting for model error the results presented in fig 7 a show that the posterior distribution from the inversion neglecting model error procedure are biased and the estimated basis weights do not capture the reference weights in contrast the posterior distributions obtained by the joint inversion procedure are less biased i e nearly unbiased and successfully cover the true model parameters as shown in fig 7 b fig 8 shows the mean and standard deviation of the posterior ln k for test case 1 in fig 8 a the mean of posterior log permeability field obtained from five different runs are shown for the inversion procedure this posterior mean is clearly different from the coarse scale reference log permeability field shown in fig 3 b due to the bias in the inferred posterior distributions fig 8 b shows the mean posterior log permeability fields obtained by the joint inversion procedure these fields are quite similar to the coarse scale reference log permeability field we also observe that the posterior standard deviations are quite low for the inversion neglecting model error procedure which could be a sign of over fitting the data in contrast for the joint inversion procedure the standard deviations of the posterior fields are much larger due to accounting for the model error and including the error model noise covariance matrix c t in eq 22 figs 9 and 10 show the oil and water production rates of the different production wells and the bottom hole pressure of the injector well the 50th percentile p 50 and 95 confidence interval the shaded region are obtained by combining results from all five runs in part a of these figures the results for the inversion neglecting model discrepancy are presented and the results of the joint inversion with error model are shown in part b for the inversion neglecting model error procedure the results are mixed where the data are matched for some cases and not matched for others for example in fig 9 a the data match is quite good for the wells p1 and p2 however in fig 10 a the data match for well i1 is not as good moreover the predictions for all wells are inaccurate for the inversion neglecting model error procedure furthermore the prediction envelop is really narrow resulting in invisible confidence interval in the plots which shows over confidence in the inaccurate predictions in comparison better matches and predictions are obtained by the joint inversion procedure as shown in figs 9 b and 10 b fig 11 shows the forecasting metrics cp for the estimated log permeabilities and mean crps mse cp for the well data in history matching and prediction periods for individual ensemble e1 e5 and for results from all five ensembles assembled together denoted as all in the figure these metrics provide a good assessment on the consistency reliability and accuracy of forecasting capacity of the calibrated models figs 11 a and b show the coverage probability of reservoir model parameters ln k well data for both the history matching period and the forecasting period both the inversion neglecting model error and the joint inversion results are shown in fig 11 a cp of ln k is zero for each individual ensemble e1 to e5 as well as for all five ensembles combined meaning that none of the ensemble captures the true log permeability using the inversion neglecting model error procedure in fig 11 b cp of ln k is one for e1 to e4 as well as for the combined ensemble that means that four out of five runs managed to enclose the reference log permeabilities completely when using the joint inversion procedure for the inversion neglecting model error procedure the cp lies between 0 06 and 0 11 for the historical data and lies between 0 01 and 0 013 for the validation data prediction as shown in fig 11 a for the joint inversion procedure these values of cp of are increased to be between 0 29 0 31 and 0 77 0 82 respectively as shown in fig 11 b although the value of cp equal to one higher than the correct value of 0 95 for the estimated permeability field when the joint inversion procedure is used clearly indicates that the uncertainty of the permeability field is overestimated the overall results still show reasonable improvement from the joint inversion procedure compared to the standard inversion neglecting model error procedure figs 11 c and d show the mean crps of history matching and prediction periods of the well data for the inversion neglecting model error and the joint inversion procedures respectively fig 11 c shows that the mean crps lies between 117 118 and 466 469 for history matching and prediction periods respectively the results for the inversion neglecting model error is unreliable and inaccurate due to the biased posterior distributions for all the different runs fig 11 d shows that using joint inversion with error model the mean crps lies between 72 73 and 170 187 for history matching and prediction periods of the well data respectively a significant improvement in terms of reliability and accuracy is observed by incorporating the error model in the inversion process fig 11 e and f show the mse of the individual runs and the combined ensemble of all runs with the joint inversion procedure lower mse values are obtained for both the history matching and the prediction periods indicated by subscript h and p respectively in the plot 4 2 case 2 results in this test case log permeability of every grid cell is calibrated using both inversion neglecting model error and joint inversion procedures fig 12 shows prior and posterior distributions obtained by combining realizations from all five runs for both history matching procedures fig 12 a shows that the posterior distribution of ln k is biased where the estimated log permeabilities show extreme values and do not capture the reference log permeabilities fig 12 b shows that by accounting for model error relatively small changes have been made to the physical parameters log permeability in this case and the mean of the posterior distribution of ln k remains smooth after data assimilation fig 13 shows the mean and standard deviation of ln k posterior ensembles as maps in fig 13 a the posterior mean log permeability field obtained from five different runs are shown for the inversion neglecting model error procedure this posterior mean is clearly different from the reference coarse log permeability field as shown in fig 5 b moreover in fig 13 a the mean log permeability field of every ensemble is different from each other which is an indication of convergence of every ensemble to different non unique local peak mode of the biased posterior the mean of log permeability ensemble from the joint inversion procedure is shown in fig 13 b where no extreme features are observed similar to the observation from case 1 the standard deviation is higher for the joint inversion compared to the inversion neglecting model error figs 14 and 15 show the oil and water production rates of the different production wells and the bottom hole pressure of the injector well the 50th percentile p 50 and 95 confidence interval the shaded region are obtained by combining results from all five ensembles in part a of these figures the results for the inversion neglecting model discrepancy are presented and the results of the joint inversion with error model are shown in part b for the inversion neglecting model error procedure only historical data at some wells are matched for example figs 14 a and 15 a show that the data match is good for wells i1 and p1 however the data match of well p2 is not good moreover the future prediction from the estimated model parameters using the inversion neglecting model error procedure is quite poor a good example is the prediction of water production rate of well p1 the models predicted early water breakthrough between year 2 and 3 while the actual water breakthrough is after year 5 because p1 is separated from the injector by a low permeability region see fig 5 a in comparison better matches and predictions are obtained by the joint inversion procedure as shown in figs 14 b and 15 b for individual ensembles as well as all ensembles combined together the prediction from the combined multiple ensembles may seem good for some well data for the case with the inversion neglecting model error procedure for example bhp pressure of well i1 in fig 15 a even though the prediction from each individual ensemble is not good this is often due to the fact that different ensemble converges to different local peaks modes of the biased posterior and the combined prediction from these multiple biased final ensembles happen to enclose the validation data fig 16 shows the forecasting metrics cp for the estimated log permeabilities and mean crps mse cp for the well data in history matching and prediction periods for the individual ensembles and for results from all five ensembles assembled together figs 16 a and b show the coverage probability of reservoir model parameters ln k well data for both the history matching period and the forecast period in fig 16 a cp of ln k is between 0 and 0 12 for ensembles e1 e5 however cp of ln k is 0 6 for the combined ensembles this relatively high coverage from the combined ensemble is due to the overshooting of ln k values and the different final estimation from each individual ensemble as shown in figs 12 a and 13 a respectively with the joint inversion procedure the coverage probability is improved for all three quantities investigated log permeabilities historical data future prediction similarly the mean crps and mse measures also show significant improvement by accounting for model error using the joint inversion procedure 2nd and 3rd row of fig 16 in addition based on all three forecasting measures the results from multiple ensemble runs using the joint inversion procedure are very consistent which indicates the statistical consistency of the proposed procedure 5 conclusions in this paper a generic procedure for history matching of imperfect low fidelity reservoir models has been developed where we formulate the history matching problem as a joint inversion of reservoir model parameters and an error model parameters we used principal component analysis to parameterize the error model where the pca basis function and prior statistics of the pca basis weights were obtained using pairs of accurate and inaccurate models we note that the accurate model is only used for defining the prior model error statistics and during history matching only the imperfect low fidelity model is used we evaluated the proposed history matching procedure on low fidelity models with modeling errors due to aggressive grid coarsening up scaling of the permeability field obtained from two point statistics and low fidelity models where the main source of error is the grid coarsening up scaling of a channelized geology detailed comparison were performed against standard history matching inversion while neglecting model error the obtained results show that the estimated model parameters are biased using standard history matching procedure in the presence of large modeling errors consequently the calibrated low fidelity model predictions are unreliable and generally inaccurate utilizing the developed joint inversion procedure results in significant improvements in terms of the quality of the estimated parameters the matching capacity to historical data and prediction accuracy reliability of the calibrated low fidelity models this is attributed to a reduction and in some cases elimination of the bias in the estimated posterior distribution of the model parameters when we included a flexible error model terms in the inversion process the numerical test cases were assessed using three forecasting metrics and it was observed that the consistency of ensemble based history matching technique was also improved by including the error model terms in the inversion procedure we argue that this observed consistency might be due to the elimination of multiple biased peaks modes in the posterior distribution of the model parameters once the error modeling terms are included in the formulations the proposed framework is generally flexible and could be applied to large scale models as the error model formulation is i o independent and the prior error model parameters could be estimated before the history matching step however for general error modeling an accurate model may be missing or the sources of the modeling errors could be unknown it is also possible that the fine high fidelity model which is assumed to be perfect is also biased in these cases the proposed methodology can only improve the parameter estimation and the prediction up to the fine high fidelity model accuracy addressing the effects of unknown modeling errors without relying on an accurate high fidelity approximate low fidelity model pairs is the subject of our future work conflict of interest none

6325,subsurface reservoirs are far more heterogeneous and complex than the simulation models in terms of scale assumptions and description in this work we address the issue of prediction reliability while calibrating imperfect low fidelity reservoir models the main goal is to avoid over confident and inaccurate predictions by including a model for the bias terms i e error model of a predefined form during the history matching process our aim is to obtain unbiased posterior distributions of the physical model parameters and thus improving the prediction capacity of the calibrated low fidelity reservoir models we formulate the parameter estimation problem as a joint estimation of the imperfect model parameters and the error model parameters the structure of the error model and the prior distributions of the error model parameters are evaluated before calibration through analysis of leading sources of the modeling errors we adopt a bayesian framework for solving the inverse problem where we utilize the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda as a practical history matching algorithm we provide two test cases where the impact of typical model errors originating from grid coarsening up scaling and from utilizing an imperfect geological model description is investigated for both cases results from the es mda update with and without accounting for model error are compared in terms of estimated physical model parameters quality of match to historical data and forecasting ability compared to held out data the test results show that calibration of the imperfect physical model without accounting for model errors results in extreme values of the calibrated model parameters and a biased posterior distribution with accounting for modeling errors the posterior distribution of the model parameters is less biased i e nearly unbiased and improved forecasting skills with higher prediction accuracy reliability is observed moreover the consistency between the different runs of the es mda is improved by including the modeling error component although the examples in the paper consider the oil water system with permeabilities being parameters of the physical model the developed methodology is general and can be applied to typical ground water hydrology models keywords model error model bias model discrepancy history matching calibration error model principle component analysis pca bayesian inversion 1 introduction in subsurface reservoir modeling various approximations are introduced at different stages of the modeling process which in turn render most of the models to be imperfect and low fidelity in nature however these imperfect models are generally still useful for understanding the key physical interactions within the subsurface regions of interest the sources of approximations a k a modeling errors include properties up scaling grid coarsening discretization errors imperfect reservoir fluid properties relative permeability reservoir geology description parameterization and approximate representation of the complete complex subsurface fluid flow physics e g black oil model in place of a compositional model or constant rock compressibility assumption in the context of error modeling grid up scaling has been widely studied within the reservoir simulation community in the published literature there exist a number of efficient up scaling techniques durlofsky 2003 aiming to obtain optimal upscaled properties however up scaling errors are not completely eliminated by most of these methods discretization errors also cannot be eliminated ertekin et al 2001 even after selecting an optimal grid size and utilizing adaptive time stepping techniques additionally numerical simulation using an optimal fine grid could be computationally prohibitive especially for tasks that typically requires many simulation runs for example history matching or robust optimization problems various techniques have been proposed to address this computational bottleneck for example reduced order modeling and proxy models among many other techniques c f silva et al 2007 rammay and abdulraheem 2014 cardoso et al 2009 an alternative approach is to utilize an upscaled model instead of the fine scale model for multi query computationally demanding tasks e g uncertainty quantification problems in the context of history matching if the up scaling errors are not modeled during the parameter inference step the posterior distributions of the model parameters is likely to be biased and this bias will subsequently affect the future predictions of the engineering quantities of interest e g oil gas and water rates pressure omre et al 2004 approximated the up scaling and discretization errors by computing samples or realizations of the error data using pairs of fine and coarse scale models the model errors due to up scaling were then estimated using a multiple regression technique and added to the coarse scale model predictions during the history matching process lodoen et al 2005 utilized a similar procedure on a different set of test cases while employing a more accurate up scaling procedure accurate reservoir geology description is another challenging task due to various uncertainties including channel geometry faults shape facies proportion stratigraphic and or structural frameworks it is widely known that unrealistic geological models could be calibrated to match the historical data c f carter et al 2006 refsgaard et al 2012 however these fitted models fail to provide reliable predictions and could ultimately mislead the reservoir development plans c f carter et al 2006 refsgaard et al 2012 although considerable effort is often put into constructing geological models that are as realistic as possible it is very difficult to maintain this geological realism while updating them to match the observed data sun and durlofsky 2017 accounting for model errors during the calibration process has attracted a large body of research c f oliver and alfonzo 2018 dreano et al 2017 josset et al 2015 where various approaches have been developed to account for the model error component during model calibration c f hansen et al 2014 evin et al 2014 reichert and schuwirth 2012 these approaches vary according to the different behavior and complexity of the modeled physical system for example in hydro geophysical systems köpke et al 2017 accounted for the model error component using orthonormal basis generated from an error dictionary which is continuously enriched during the calibration process the models of the bias or error component could be generally classified as either input dependent giudice et al 2013 or output dependent evin et al 2014 input dependent model error formulation represents the error components as a function of the model parameters for example a reservoir model error can vary with permeability realizations or other input model parameters o sullivan and christie 2005 utilized an input dependent formulation for the model error where the authors computed model error realizations using the difference between a fine grid and coarse grid model outputs during the calibration process an interpolation of the error component was performed to estimate a correction term to the coarse grid model predictions lødøen and tjelmeland 2010 used multiple linear regression algorithm to model errors where the residual part for the multiple regression was assumed to depend on the model input parameters the residual terms were modeled using a zero mean gaussian process giudice et al 2013 used an input dependent model error representation to improve uncertainty estimation in urban hydrological models in that application the model error variance was set to be depending on the input of the rainfall term output dependent model error formulation represents the error components as a function of the output of the physical model for example evin et al 2014 utilized an output dependent formulation for the model error heteroscedasticity as a function of the simulated streamflow in a realistic setting where large models are utilized i e millions of input parameters it is hard to relate the model errors to the high dimensional input parameter space and output dependent or input output i o independent forms of the model error were proposed as an alternative approach that might have some advantages over the input dependent error models giudice et al 2013 model error representation can also be classified as either an external bias description ebd or an internal noise description ind giudice et al 2015 ebd was developed using the background of statistical inference in a regression type framework giudice et al 2015 in ebd the model error term is added externally into the forward model approximate or inadequate model output in ind the model error is formulated as an additional term of the state space giudice et al 2015 this approach is also known as state space modelling or stochastic gray box modelling c f moradkhani et al 2012 kristensen et al 2004 giudice et al 2015 concluded that ebd has some advantages over ind in terms of long term predictions in this paper we utilize an ebd and i o independent error model formulation as it is more suitable for large scale models e g subsurface oil and gas reservoir models relying on black box simulators several typical sources of model errors are present in the test cases investigated in this paper including a coarse grid less detailed geological representation i e upscaling of different types of geological features including variogram based and channelized geology discretization errors and slight change in well locations due to grid coarsening the error model formulation presented here assumes that the total modeling errors consists of two components structural component and noise like component we note that the structural component is often neglected in the bias correction approaches developed in hydrological literature c f maier et al 2014 vrugt 2016 white et al 2014 in this study prior to model calibration the structure of the model error is estimated and represented using several basis functions and the magnitude of the noise like component is quantified during history matching the weights of the basis functions are jointly calibrated with the physical model parameters using data observed at well locations the noise like part of the model error is also accounted for during the history matching process to avoid over fitting of the error model we note that the presented formulation is general and can be applied to other sources of modeling errors when dealing with low fidelity physical models the low fidelity models are generally used as efficient surrogate models for computationally demanding tasks c f asher et al 2015 laloy et al 2013 for the bayesian inversion we use a particular type of iterative ensemble smoother es mda emerick and reynolds 2013 the formulation of es mda has some similarities with kalman filtering algorithms sun et al 2016 however es mda assimilates data from different times simultaneously and the same set of data is assimilated multiple times with an inflated data noise covariance matrix which is equivalent to annealing approaches stordal and elsheikh 2015 the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present some background on bayesian inverse modeling followed by the proposed error model formulation following that we present the case studies in section 3 the results of the case studies are discussed in section 4 followed by the conclusions of our work in section 5 2 methodology bayesian inverse modeling is a generic inference framework that is widely adopted for calibration of reservoir models while accounting for different types sources of uncertainties in the bayesian framework the conditional probabilities p m d obs of the model parameters m given the observational data d obs a k a posterior distribution of the model parameters is estimated using bayes rule oliver et al 2008 1 p m d obs p d obs m p m where m is the model parameters vector of size n m d obs is the observations vector of size n d p m is the prior probability of the model parameters and p d obs m is the likelihood function of the data given a specific realization of the model parameters m it is common to assume a gaussian prior 2 p m exp 1 2 m m pr c m 1 m m pr where m pr is an n m dimensional vector of the mean prior model parameters and c m is the covariance matrix of the prior model parameters it is also common to assume that data noise is gaussian so that the likelihood function takes the form 3 p d obs m exp 1 2 d obs d c d 1 d obs d where d is the simulated or predicted data vector using the model parameters m and c d is the error noise covariance matrix which is defined in section 2 1 and 2 2 depending on the utilized history matching procedure using these definitions bayes rule defined in eq 1 could be expanded as following 4 p m d obs exp 1 2 d obs d c d 1 d obs d m m pr c m 1 m m pr several algorithms could be used to generate samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters oliver et al 2008 among those markov chain monte carlo mcmc is an exact method for sampling however mcmc can be computationally expensive due to the large number of iterations needed to reach convergence and the sequential nature of the method ensemble based methods have been widely used for calibrating subsurface flow models due to the computational feasibility and parallel nature of ensemble methods in this study we utilize the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda algorithm for the calibration step emerick and reynolds 2013 es mda belongs to a class of iterative ensemble smoothing techniques that could be used to solve non linear inverse problem iteratively with an inflated noise covariance matrix the es mda algorithm steps are summarized as follows select the number of iterations number of data assimilation n a and the inflation factor α a common choice of the inflation factor is to set it as a constant value for all iterations i e α n a initialize an ensemble of model parameters and perturb the observation data for each ensemble member using 5 d uc j d obs α c d 1 2 z d where the subscript j is the ensemble member index j 1 n e and n e is the ensemble size d uc j is n d dimensional vector of perturbed observation z d is the n d dimensional vector with standard gaussian random variables as its components i e z d n 0 i n d n d update each ensemble member using 6 m j i 1 m j i c md c dd α c d 1 d uc j d j where the superscript i is the iteration index c dd is the model output covariance matrix and c md is the cross covariance matrix of model parameters and model predictions repeat the above steps for all iterations from i 1 to n a 2 1 procedures for history matching of reservoir models in this study two types of history matching procedures are investigated history matching while neglecting model discrepancy i e standard history matching procedure and joint history matching of the model parameters and the parameters of an error bias model in this paper we use the term model discrepancy and model error interchangeably the standard history matching procedure relies on an implicit assumption that the model errors are generally small and could be neglected i e the simulation model is perfect mathematically if an accurate high fidelity model is utilized the observed data is formulated as giudice et al 2013 7 d obs g m true d where g is a nonlinear function representing the accurate high fidelity forward simulation model m true is the true model parameters d is the measurement errors which is usually assumed to follow a normal distribution n 0 c d and c d is the measurement errors covariance matrix in this study uncorrelated measurement errors are considered therefore the matrix c d is a diagonal matrix in standard history matching i e neglecting modeling errors c d in eqs 3 6 is set to the covariance of measurement errors therefore 8 c d c d however as noted in the introduction section several approximations are commonly introduced in the computational model to simplify the simulation process e g black oil model versus compositional flow or to speed up the simulations coarsening of the simulation grid during history matching if the model error caused by these approximations is not accounted for the obtained posterior distribution could be biased in the case of utilizing an approximate low fidelity model the observation data is related to the true model parameters m true as giudice et al 2013 9 d obs g m true d m where m is the model error and g is a nonlinear function representing the imperfect approximate low fidelity simulation model by subtracting eq 7 from 9 we obtain 10 m g m true g m true in the following sub section we present a simple yet general parameterization of the model error term m 2 2 error model formulation in this study ebd and i o independent error model approach is considered as the model errors in our test cases were dominated by structured components these errors are parameterized using smooth basis functions obtained by principle component analysis pca method which is an effective data driven dimension reduction technique shlens 2014 kerschen et al 2005 we rely on simulation output from pairs of models accurate high fidelity versus approximate low fidelity to obtain the basis functions and the prior statistics of the coefficients of the pca basis functions we acknowledge that this limits the applicability of the developed approach to the cases for which an accurate high fidelity model is available however we note that the accurate high fidelity model is only used to estimate the prior model error statistics and is not used during the calibration process this is a notable difference between the presented framework and related studies by josset et al 2015 and köpke et al 2017 in the current setting the prior model error realizations are estimated using 11 mr g m r g m r where r is the index of the prior realizations i e r 1 to n r n r is the total number of realizations used to estimate the model error statistics mr is an n d dimensional vector of model error for realization r all prior model error realizations are assembled into the matrix r n d n r the mean of the model error prior is 12 m 1 n r r 1 n r mr the covariance of the model error prior is oliver et al 2008 13 c e 1 n r 1 m i n r m i n r where i n r is an n r dimensional row vector with all ones as its components in this study pca is used to parametrize the prior model error realizations and the weights of the obtained pca basis vectors are jointly inferred with the model parameters during the history matching process the basis functions are obtained by singular value decomposition svd of the error covariance matrix c e oliver et al 2008 14 c e u σ v where u and v are the orthonormal singular vectors basis functions and σ is a diagonal matrix of the singular values the error model is formulated using the leading l singular vectors as following 15 mr φ β r m where φ r n d l are the first l orthonormal singular vectors basis functions from u and β r r l 1 are the coefficients of error model for realization r the objective of the calibration process is then to find the posterior distribution of reservoir model parameters and the coefficients β of the pca based error model since bayesian inverse modelling require prior statistics of model parameters therefore the prior statistics of the coefficients β should be estimated least square form of eq 15 is used to compute prior realizations of the coefficient vector β as following 16 β r φ φ 1 φ mr m since φ is an orthonormal matrix i e φ φ 1 therefore eq 16 can also be written as 17 β r φ mr m the prior statistic such as the mean and covariance of β realizations are computed using 18 μ β 1 n r r 1 n r β r 19 c β 1 n r 1 r 1 n r β r μ β β r μ β where μ β r l 1 is the mean of β realizations and c β r l l is the covariance of β realizations in this study we only consider the diagonal terms of the matrix c β to generate prior samples of error model coefficients for the history matching purpose in order to avoid over fitting the error model the number of coefficients of the pca based error model l should be limited to a small number therefore the residual of error model cannot be neglected and need to be included in the inversion process the residual of the least square fit is defined as 20 ζ mr mr mr all residual realizations are assembled into matrix ζ r n d n r the covariance of the residual from all error model realizations is then estimated using 21 c t 1 n r 1 ζ ζ where c t is denoted the error model noise covariance for history matching of imperfect models the total error covariance matrix c d in eqs 3 6 contains both the measurement and error model noise components as following 22 c d c d c t for simplicity only the diagonal terms of the matrix c t is considered in this study conceptually c d is the total uncalibrated uncertainty which includes both the measurement noise and the model error noise that is not captured by the truncated pca based error model in hansen et al 2014 modeling errors were considered as uncalibrated uncertainties using gaussian distribution i e accounting for mean and covariance of errors in their approach the model error is accounted for by replacing d obs with d obs m and replacing c d with c d c e however this approach would be inconsistent inefficient for physical systems which exhibit highly complex statistics and correlations of model errors that change significantly not only over the data space but also as a function of the input model parameters köpke et al 2017 3 case studies in this section we present the details of the case studies the dimension of the subsurface reservoir is 7500 ft 7500 ft 20 ft in the x y and z directions respectively incompressible two phase porous media flow of oil and water is considered the initial reservoir pressure is 5000 psi and the reservoir has uniform porosity of 20 the reservoir contains one injector well i1 and three production wells p1 p2 p3 and is simulated using a 2d grid we utilize the matlab reservoir simulation tool box mrst lie 2016 for the forward model simulations corey s power law model is used to represent relative permeabilities parameter values for the corey s model and fluid properties are listed in appendix a the gravitational and capillary pressure effects are neglected the production wells are operated under constant bottom hole pressure constraint of 4500 psi and the injector well is operated under constant injection rate constraint with varying control values as shown in fig 1 a the wells open shut schedule is shown in fig 1 b fig 1 also shows end of historical period i e 2 years in the historical period the flow rates at the production wells and the bottom hole pressure of the injector well are used as the historical data for the calibration process we also note that one of the production wells p3 is only used in prediction phase in order to assess predictions from calibrated models on wells drilled in future development plans 3 1 case 1 coarse scale model in the first case study fine grid high fidelity model uses a 2d grid with 75 75 cells the distributed log permeability fields are modeled as multivariate gaussian with exponential covariance function 23 c σ 2 exp 3 s r a γ where s is the lag distance and r a σ 2 γ are the correlation range variance and exponent respectively which are 35 cells 1 and 1 respectively in this test case the log permeability field ln k is parameterized using pca and only two leading basis functions are retained 24 ln k ln k b 1 n w w b ψ b where ln k is the mean log permeability equal to 4 in this test case b is index of the basis weight w and basis function ψ and n w 2 fig 2 b shows the leading two principal basis functions obtained by singular value decomposition of covariance of log permeability fields eq 23 fig 2 a shows the prior distribution of weights obtained by projecting the log permeability fields into the pca basis functions fig 3 a shows the reference fine scale log permeability field the fine scale reference log permeability field is generated by the leading two pca basis functions and reference basis weights are shown as the red vertical lines in fig 2 the coarse grid low fidelity reservoir models contain only 5 5 grid blocks the coarsened version of the reference fine model is shown in fig 3 b in which harmonic averaging is used to up scale the log permeability field the observed data are generated by the fine scale model using reference log permeability field fig 3 a with the addition of measurement noise of 2 of the reference solution we note that except permeabilities the rest of the static and dynamic properties i e porosity relative permeability viscosity and density well controls and schedule of the coarse scale model are the same as the fine scale model two different procedures of history matching the coarse scale model were considered in the case of neglecting model discrepancy pca basis weights w of the log permeabilities are calibrated i e m j w in eq 6 in the case of joint inversion with error model the estimated parameters is the combined vector of the log permeability pca weights and the error model coefficients i e m j w β in eq 6 prior statistics of the model discrepancy were estimated using eq 11 one hundred fine scale permeability realizations were generated through eq 24 by sampling the prior distribution of the pca basis weights and a corresponding number of coarse scale permeability realizations were obtained using harmonic up scaling forward runs were then performed for both the coarse and fine scale models to obtain the error realizations using eq 11 a smaller number of realizations could be used to evaluate the model discrepancy statistics in that case special care should be taken to select a representative set of prior realizations to cover the respective statistic fig 4 shows the prior statistics of the model discrepancy in the simulated well production data bottom hole pressure of the injector well and flow rates of the producers 3 2 case 2 up scaled imperfect geology model geologists commonly try to build geologically realistic prior models however maintaining the geological realism during the history matching process is quite challenging sun and durlofsky 2017 for example multipoint statistics mps is widely used to represent channelized geological patterns geologically consistent history matching using mps prior is still a subject of active research chen et al 2016 sometimes the predictability of the history matched mps models may not be satisfactory often due to limitation of the available history matching methods in handling this type of non gaussian models chen et al 2016 in this study we do not aim for obtaining calibrated models that are consistent with the channelized geological feature instead we focus on improving predictability of the calibrated coarse models by including the error model for this case the permeability fields are based on a similar test case presented in chen et al 2016 fig 5 a shows the reference fine scale log permeability with channelized features and fig 5 b shows the corresponding up scaled log permeability field in which the channelized features have been lost due to harmonic averaging the reference and prior fine scale channelized log permeability fields are generated using a two facies training image with the direct sampling version of mps mariethoz and caers 2014 the observed data are generated by the fine scale model using reference log permeability field fig 5 a with the addition of measurement noise of 2 similar to the first test case one hundred realizations of the model discrepancy were obtained using eq 11 by running the fine scale simulation using the mps permeability images of size 75 75 grid blocks and the corresponding up scaled permeability field with 5 5 grid blocks fig 6 shows the prior statistics of the model discrepancy in the simulated well production data 4 results and discussion in this section we present history matching results for test case 1 and 2 with and without accounting for the model discrepancy all the ensemble based history matching results are presented for multiple runs five independent ensembles in order to investigate the consistency and reliability of the parameter estimation process each ensemble run consists of 100 ensemble members and the measurement errors are assumed to be 2 of the observation data we utilized the es mda algorithm with eight iterations α 8 for calibration in the case of joint inversion with error model two pca components were retained per each output time series to parametrize the model discrepancy since we have seven output time series the total number of error model parameters is 14 the calibrated models are evaluated using three different forecasting metrics to assess the quality of the estimated parameters and the capacity of the calibrated models in making future predictions the utilized forecasting metrics are coverage probability cp mean continuous ranked probability score crps and mean square error mse cp indicates the fraction of the actual data that lie within the 95 confidence interval of the estimation a value of 0 95 for cp indicates a consistent estimation of uncertainty and values below 0 95 indicate underestimation of uncertainty mean crps quantifies both accuracy and precision hersbach 2000 and higher values of crps indicate a less accurate results mse is widely used as a metric for parameter estimation problems however mse measures the quality of data fitting and is not enough to provide a probabilistic assessment of the estimation and prediction from an ensemble of models in this study we observed that a combination of mse cp and crps provides a good assessment of the quality for the probabilistic forecast skauvold and eidsvik 2018 the mathematical formulations of the three forecasting metrics are listed in appendix b 4 1 case 1 results in this test case the log permeability is calibrated in terms of the pca basis weights i e w 1 w 2 as detailed in the problem description fig 7 shows the posterior distributions of the basis weights for the five runs for both cases of neglecting and accounting for model error the results presented in fig 7 a show that the posterior distribution from the inversion neglecting model error procedure are biased and the estimated basis weights do not capture the reference weights in contrast the posterior distributions obtained by the joint inversion procedure are less biased i e nearly unbiased and successfully cover the true model parameters as shown in fig 7 b fig 8 shows the mean and standard deviation of the posterior ln k for test case 1 in fig 8 a the mean of posterior log permeability field obtained from five different runs are shown for the inversion procedure this posterior mean is clearly different from the coarse scale reference log permeability field shown in fig 3 b due to the bias in the inferred posterior distributions fig 8 b shows the mean posterior log permeability fields obtained by the joint inversion procedure these fields are quite similar to the coarse scale reference log permeability field we also observe that the posterior standard deviations are quite low for the inversion neglecting model error procedure which could be a sign of over fitting the data in contrast for the joint inversion procedure the standard deviations of the posterior fields are much larger due to accounting for the model error and including the error model noise covariance matrix c t in eq 22 figs 9 and 10 show the oil and water production rates of the different production wells and the bottom hole pressure of the injector well the 50th percentile p 50 and 95 confidence interval the shaded region are obtained by combining results from all five runs in part a of these figures the results for the inversion neglecting model discrepancy are presented and the results of the joint inversion with error model are shown in part b for the inversion neglecting model error procedure the results are mixed where the data are matched for some cases and not matched for others for example in fig 9 a the data match is quite good for the wells p1 and p2 however in fig 10 a the data match for well i1 is not as good moreover the predictions for all wells are inaccurate for the inversion neglecting model error procedure furthermore the prediction envelop is really narrow resulting in invisible confidence interval in the plots which shows over confidence in the inaccurate predictions in comparison better matches and predictions are obtained by the joint inversion procedure as shown in figs 9 b and 10 b fig 11 shows the forecasting metrics cp for the estimated log permeabilities and mean crps mse cp for the well data in history matching and prediction periods for individual ensemble e1 e5 and for results from all five ensembles assembled together denoted as all in the figure these metrics provide a good assessment on the consistency reliability and accuracy of forecasting capacity of the calibrated models figs 11 a and b show the coverage probability of reservoir model parameters ln k well data for both the history matching period and the forecasting period both the inversion neglecting model error and the joint inversion results are shown in fig 11 a cp of ln k is zero for each individual ensemble e1 to e5 as well as for all five ensembles combined meaning that none of the ensemble captures the true log permeability using the inversion neglecting model error procedure in fig 11 b cp of ln k is one for e1 to e4 as well as for the combined ensemble that means that four out of five runs managed to enclose the reference log permeabilities completely when using the joint inversion procedure for the inversion neglecting model error procedure the cp lies between 0 06 and 0 11 for the historical data and lies between 0 01 and 0 013 for the validation data prediction as shown in fig 11 a for the joint inversion procedure these values of cp of are increased to be between 0 29 0 31 and 0 77 0 82 respectively as shown in fig 11 b although the value of cp equal to one higher than the correct value of 0 95 for the estimated permeability field when the joint inversion procedure is used clearly indicates that the uncertainty of the permeability field is overestimated the overall results still show reasonable improvement from the joint inversion procedure compared to the standard inversion neglecting model error procedure figs 11 c and d show the mean crps of history matching and prediction periods of the well data for the inversion neglecting model error and the joint inversion procedures respectively fig 11 c shows that the mean crps lies between 117 118 and 466 469 for history matching and prediction periods respectively the results for the inversion neglecting model error is unreliable and inaccurate due to the biased posterior distributions for all the different runs fig 11 d shows that using joint inversion with error model the mean crps lies between 72 73 and 170 187 for history matching and prediction periods of the well data respectively a significant improvement in terms of reliability and accuracy is observed by incorporating the error model in the inversion process fig 11 e and f show the mse of the individual runs and the combined ensemble of all runs with the joint inversion procedure lower mse values are obtained for both the history matching and the prediction periods indicated by subscript h and p respectively in the plot 4 2 case 2 results in this test case log permeability of every grid cell is calibrated using both inversion neglecting model error and joint inversion procedures fig 12 shows prior and posterior distributions obtained by combining realizations from all five runs for both history matching procedures fig 12 a shows that the posterior distribution of ln k is biased where the estimated log permeabilities show extreme values and do not capture the reference log permeabilities fig 12 b shows that by accounting for model error relatively small changes have been made to the physical parameters log permeability in this case and the mean of the posterior distribution of ln k remains smooth after data assimilation fig 13 shows the mean and standard deviation of ln k posterior ensembles as maps in fig 13 a the posterior mean log permeability field obtained from five different runs are shown for the inversion neglecting model error procedure this posterior mean is clearly different from the reference coarse log permeability field as shown in fig 5 b moreover in fig 13 a the mean log permeability field of every ensemble is different from each other which is an indication of convergence of every ensemble to different non unique local peak mode of the biased posterior the mean of log permeability ensemble from the joint inversion procedure is shown in fig 13 b where no extreme features are observed similar to the observation from case 1 the standard deviation is higher for the joint inversion compared to the inversion neglecting model error figs 14 and 15 show the oil and water production rates of the different production wells and the bottom hole pressure of the injector well the 50th percentile p 50 and 95 confidence interval the shaded region are obtained by combining results from all five ensembles in part a of these figures the results for the inversion neglecting model discrepancy are presented and the results of the joint inversion with error model are shown in part b for the inversion neglecting model error procedure only historical data at some wells are matched for example figs 14 a and 15 a show that the data match is good for wells i1 and p1 however the data match of well p2 is not good moreover the future prediction from the estimated model parameters using the inversion neglecting model error procedure is quite poor a good example is the prediction of water production rate of well p1 the models predicted early water breakthrough between year 2 and 3 while the actual water breakthrough is after year 5 because p1 is separated from the injector by a low permeability region see fig 5 a in comparison better matches and predictions are obtained by the joint inversion procedure as shown in figs 14 b and 15 b for individual ensembles as well as all ensembles combined together the prediction from the combined multiple ensembles may seem good for some well data for the case with the inversion neglecting model error procedure for example bhp pressure of well i1 in fig 15 a even though the prediction from each individual ensemble is not good this is often due to the fact that different ensemble converges to different local peaks modes of the biased posterior and the combined prediction from these multiple biased final ensembles happen to enclose the validation data fig 16 shows the forecasting metrics cp for the estimated log permeabilities and mean crps mse cp for the well data in history matching and prediction periods for the individual ensembles and for results from all five ensembles assembled together figs 16 a and b show the coverage probability of reservoir model parameters ln k well data for both the history matching period and the forecast period in fig 16 a cp of ln k is between 0 and 0 12 for ensembles e1 e5 however cp of ln k is 0 6 for the combined ensembles this relatively high coverage from the combined ensemble is due to the overshooting of ln k values and the different final estimation from each individual ensemble as shown in figs 12 a and 13 a respectively with the joint inversion procedure the coverage probability is improved for all three quantities investigated log permeabilities historical data future prediction similarly the mean crps and mse measures also show significant improvement by accounting for model error using the joint inversion procedure 2nd and 3rd row of fig 16 in addition based on all three forecasting measures the results from multiple ensemble runs using the joint inversion procedure are very consistent which indicates the statistical consistency of the proposed procedure 5 conclusions in this paper a generic procedure for history matching of imperfect low fidelity reservoir models has been developed where we formulate the history matching problem as a joint inversion of reservoir model parameters and an error model parameters we used principal component analysis to parameterize the error model where the pca basis function and prior statistics of the pca basis weights were obtained using pairs of accurate and inaccurate models we note that the accurate model is only used for defining the prior model error statistics and during history matching only the imperfect low fidelity model is used we evaluated the proposed history matching procedure on low fidelity models with modeling errors due to aggressive grid coarsening up scaling of the permeability field obtained from two point statistics and low fidelity models where the main source of error is the grid coarsening up scaling of a channelized geology detailed comparison were performed against standard history matching inversion while neglecting model error the obtained results show that the estimated model parameters are biased using standard history matching procedure in the presence of large modeling errors consequently the calibrated low fidelity model predictions are unreliable and generally inaccurate utilizing the developed joint inversion procedure results in significant improvements in terms of the quality of the estimated parameters the matching capacity to historical data and prediction accuracy reliability of the calibrated low fidelity models this is attributed to a reduction and in some cases elimination of the bias in the estimated posterior distribution of the model parameters when we included a flexible error model terms in the inversion process the numerical test cases were assessed using three forecasting metrics and it was observed that the consistency of ensemble based history matching technique was also improved by including the error model terms in the inversion procedure we argue that this observed consistency might be due to the elimination of multiple biased peaks modes in the posterior distribution of the model parameters once the error modeling terms are included in the formulations the proposed framework is generally flexible and could be applied to large scale models as the error model formulation is i o independent and the prior error model parameters could be estimated before the history matching step however for general error modeling an accurate model may be missing or the sources of the modeling errors could be unknown it is also possible that the fine high fidelity model which is assumed to be perfect is also biased in these cases the proposed methodology can only improve the parameter estimation and the prediction up to the fine high fidelity model accuracy addressing the effects of unknown modeling errors without relying on an accurate high fidelity approximate low fidelity model pairs is the subject of our future work conflict of interest none

6326,the impact of crucial geographic and climatic factors on the input source errors of integrated multi satellite precipitation estimates is an important but still unclear issue for both algorithm developers and data users this study primarily focused on the impacts of the twelve input sources used in the latest global satellite mapping of precipitation for global precipitation measurement gpm gsmap for different climatic regions elevations and seasons over mainland china our evaluation results show that the error features of the input sources from several passive microwave and infrared sensors are related to the accuracy of gpm gsmap precipitation estimates the input sources show larger hits misses and false biases in the semi arid and arid regions for which the false bias was particularly significant as for the seasonality the input data sources exhibit a better performance in summer and have relatively lower hits and higher biases in winter we also found that precipitation retrievals of the input sources are affected by topography in different extents in terms of passive microwave sensors the conical scanning imagers generally outperform the cross track scanning sounders but the sounders based precipitation estimates have relatively better detection capability as one of the core sensors for gpm the microwave imager gmi reveals inadequacies in representing areal rainfall patterns and has relatively large biases especially in the winter and spring seasons suggesting that the current gmi algorithm might need to be further improved keywords gpm gsmap climate elevation season mainland china 1 introduction obtaining high precision precipitation estimates over large spatial extents in real time still remains a fundamental scientific challenge in the hydrometeorological community primarily due to the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity of precipitation hou et al 2014 yong et al 2015 chen et al 2019 rain gauge networks and ground based radars are two primarily data sources for precisely measuring precipitation kidd and huffman 2011 kidd et al 2017 rain gauges can provide directly captured precipitation at specific sites but such information is not continuous in space tang et al 2016 hence a variety of interpolation methods are applied in processing the point based rainfall for obtaining continuous spatial precipitation fields tapiador et al 2012 some systematic and random errors are inevitably introduced by spatial interpolation especially over those areas where the gauge observing networks are sparse ma et al 2015 yong et al 2016b with regard to ground based radar it can provide high resolution and nearly continuous precipitation estimates over large areas within ranges of approximately 250 km of the radar guo et al 2015 however ground radars still have major shortcomings 1 the data samples can be impacted by non meteorological scatters in urban environments e g buildings towers and low level surveillance can be limited in mountainous regions 2 radar networks are relatively expensive to purchase operate and maintain which limits their availability in many countries of the world 3 precipitation retrievals from radar data while having improved over the years are still subject to random errors range dependent systematic errors and so on dinku et al 2002 yang et al 2006 tang et al 2016 in summary it is difficult to quickly and comprehensively obtain accurate precipitation estimates over many continental domains by relying on rain gauge networks or radar networks alone the development of techniques and retrieval algorithms using satellite based instruments has led to the capability of measuring precipitation across the entire globe based on the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm a large number of quasi global satellite precipitation products with different input sources and retrieval algorithms have been released to the public over the past decades such as the trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 as a successor to trmm the global precipitation measurement gpm core observatory satellite has been launched on february 28 2014 which was deployed by a joint effort between nasa and jaxa this core satellite carries a dual frequency precipitation radar dpr at ku band 13 6 ghz and ka band 35 5 ghz frequencies and also carries a conical scanning multichannel gpm microwave imager gmi with a frequency range between 10 and 183 ghz dpr and gmi are used together to develop a new calibration standard for the other microwave sensors in low earth orbit which further extends the capacity of gpm to measure light and solid precipitation the current operational satellite precipitation products for gpm mainly include the gpm gsmap of jaxa and the imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement product of nasa the development of the gsmap product seeks to meet the primary objective of jaxa s gpm mission to produce a high precision high resolution global precipitation map using satellite data https sharaku eorc jaxa jp gsmap index htm to satisfy the diverse user needs for latency and accuracy the gsmap developers produce eight sets of products such as global satellite mapping of precipitation in near real time gsmap nrt global satellite mapping of precipitation microwave ir combined product gsmap mvk global satellite mapping of precipitation gauge calibrated rainfall product gsmap gauge and so on recently the gsmap precipitation products have been widely investigated and analyzed at local regional and even global scales kubota et al 2009 dinku et al 2010 andermann et al 2011 qin et al 2014 chen et al 2016 prakash et al 2016a b takido et al 2016 yong et al 2016b tan et al 2018 guo et al 2017 hur et al 2018 deng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 analysis of the error structure and characteristics of satellite precipitation products is helpful for data developers to diagnose the underlying problems in the retrieval algorithms and further improve the quality of precipitation estimates shen et al 2010 2014 xie and xiong 2011 furthermore it has been found that several crucial geographic and climatic factors can significantly affect the retrieval accuracy of satellite precipitation kubota et al 2009 dinku et al 2010 andermann et al 2011 using global scale analyses and regional case studies kubota et al 2009 found that gsmap exhibits poor performance in detecting light rainfall during the warm season and heavy rainfall for all seasons dinku et al 2010 indicated that gsmap overestimates rainfall occurrences and it produces overestimated rainfall amounts over arid regions compared to humid regions andermann et al 2011 revealed that the accuracy of gsmap precipitation varies as a function of orography and errors magnify during the monsoon seasons takido et al 2016 showed that both probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far of gsmap gauge and gsmap mvk have a clear linear relationship with log transformed elevation data especially during the cool season guo et al 2017 also found that gsmap significantly overestimates warm season precipitation over northern central asia and its retrieval errors generally follow an elevation dependent feature in space the aforementioned studies primarily focused on error assessment of the combined satellite precipitation product but did not comprehensively analyze the impacts of the errors associated with the input data sources even though several current works have provided some identification and quantification of error sources for tmpa gsmap and imerg e g tan et al 2016 gebregiorgis et al 2017 2018 zhu et al 2018 a systematic study investigating the geographic and climatic dependence of error sources from the input microwave and infrared sensors is still lacking in this study twelve microwave and infrared sensor based precipitation estimates that are used as inputs in the latest version 7 gpm gsmap system are statistically investigated across different climatic regions over mainland china our aim is not just to analyze the error structure and feature of these diverse sensor inputs but also to identify the impact of climate elevation and seasonality on the retrieval errors this paper is organized into four parts in the next section we describe the study area the datasets and methods used a presentation of the results and discussion follows in section 3 summarizing remarks and conclusions finalize the paper in section 4 2 study area datasets and methodology 2 1 study area mainland china located within 73 135 e and 18 53 n has multiple types of climatic characteristics and complex topography for its vast territory fig 1 a shows the spatial distribution of average annual precipitation aap during the period of 1961 2000 aap generally decreases from southeast to northwest in mainland china based on the spatial structure of aap mainland china can be separated into four parts i e humid semi humid semi arid and arid regions fig 1a the humid region dominated by the subtropical monsoon includes the pearl river basin the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river and huaihe river basin where the aap exceeds 800 mm yr the semi humid region covers the yellow river basin and the eastern tibetan plateau with the aap value of 400 800 mm yr which is controlled by the monsoon in middle latitudes the semi arid region with aap of 200 400 mm yr comprises the tianshan mountains and the middle part of the tibetan plateau with a rather complex topography last the arid region consists of the residual parts mainly including the tarim basin and the western tibetan plateau and its aap is less than 200 mm yr 2 2 ground reference precipitation mpa in our study the gridded hourly merged precipitation analysis mpa dataset developed by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration was used as the reference data which combines gauge observations from over 30 000 automatic weather stations with cmorph at an hourly 0 1 0 1 latitude longitude resolution the probability density function pdf matching and optimal interpolation oi methods are employed for generating this merged mpa dataset first the automatic weather station data are processed into a gridded gauge precipitation dataset with 0 1 o 0 1 o resolution then the cmorph estimates are adjusted using pdf matching with the gauged precipitation dataset finally the oi method is employed to correct the gauge adjusted cmorph estimates producing the final mpa product an evaluation shows that the merged mpa product effectively integrates the advantages of both gauge observations and satellite retrievals in that it outperforms other operational ground based precipitation products over mainland china shen et al 2013 as shown in fig 1c automatic weather stations used in mpa are mainly concentrated in the humid and semi humid regions while relatively sparse gauges are distributed within the semi arid and arid regions to ensure the robustness of results we only selected those gridded precipitation data that contain at least one gauge for each 0 1 0 1 grid cell it is worth noting that only liquid rainfall events are investigated in our study as the automatic weather stations used for generating the mpa product are suited for liquid water measurement in practice there exists a flag field of gauge numbers in the mpa datasets which denotes the numbers of gauges for liquid water observation within one grid cell in this study we use this flag field to strictly match the satellite estimates and liquid rainfall events captured by gauges so as to exclude snowfall events 2 3 satellite precipitation gpm gsmap the latest gpm based gsmap suite mainly includes three products i e gsmap nrt gsmap mvk and gsmap gauge the gsmap nrt available at a 4 h delay after observation is a near real time precipitation product the gsmap mvk is a reanalysis version of gsmap nrt which is still a purely satellite derived product available with a three day delay the gsmap gauge is a gauge adjusted product differing from both gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk the above three gsmap products have the same spatiotemporal resolution 0 1 0 1 1 hourly covering the latitude band 60 n s additionally the newest dpr data were first employed in the version 7 gsmap system to provide a calibration standard for passive microwave retrievals so as to improve the accuracy of combined precipitation estimates in this study the gpm based version 7 gsmap mvk without gauge adjustment hereafter refer to as gpm gsmap is used for investigating the impact of the details of input data source errors on combined satellite precipitation products we selected an overlapping time span of four complete years between gpm gsmap and mpa from april 2014 to march 2018 as our study period the input sources of gpm gsmap estimates are derived from the infrared ir observations and six types of passive microwave pmw instruments including the gmi tmi amsr2 ssmis amsu a and mhs sensors table 1 altogether there are twelve input sources for gpm gsmap estimates which are composed of seven conical scanning pwm imagers four cross track scanning pwm sounders and one ir input table 1 in the gpm gsmap system the retrievals for the pwm imagers and sounders employ microwave imager algorithm mwi and microwave sounder algorithm mws respectively as for the ir input it includes the purely ir based retrievals and the morphing based estimates using propagation vectors derived from ir observations fig 2 exhibits the spatial distribution of sampling frequency for these twelve input sources it is clear that there exists significantly different pattern of sampling frequencies for the gpm gsmap inputs the usage of geo ir data is more frequent than that of pwm sensors its scanning proportion accounts for over 40 of total scans in contrast the ssmis sensor onboard dmsp f19 satellite has the lowest scanning frequency less than 1 likely due to the short sampling time from march 2015 to february 2016 relative to the other sensors table 1 2 4 methodology in this study we extend the approach of imerg leveraging ancillary variables which was proposed by tan et al 2016 to identify individual sources of errors in gpm gsmap the twelve sensor inputs and their corresponding retrieval errors can be linked by the satellite information flag in the gpm gsmap system more information about ancillary variables of constellation based sensors are presented in the gpm gsmap data format description for product version 7 available on https sharaku eorc jaxa jp gsmap index htm additionally seven metrics including hit fraction miss fraction false fraction correct negative true hit ratio thr true miss ratio tmr and true false ratio tfr were used to investigate the detection capability for each input source the evaluation also utilizes five statistical indices namely total bias hit bias miss bias false bias and correct negative bias to quantify the error and bias for the individual input sources the hit fraction indicates how often the satellite correctly identifies precipitation while the miss fraction is the fraction of missed rainfall events relative to all rainfall events the false fraction gives the fraction between false alarm events and all rainfall events comparisons made for precipitation events observed by twelve input sources at the same time would equitably describe and compare their detection capability however the orbits of the different satellites do not permit this idea situation hence we employ three additional indices i e thr tmr and tfr to further analyze the detection capability for each input source the thr denotes the ratio of rainfall event occurrences that are correctly identified by the satellite during the temporal step of gpm gsmap while the tmr gives the ratio of rainfall event occurrences that are not detected by the satellite the tfr is the ratio of rainfall event occurrences detected by the satellite but not observed by the ground gauge as in many previous studies yong et al 2016a tan et al 2016 tan et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 here we selected 0 1 mm h as a threshold to determine an instance to be raining or not raining during a time step of 1 h the detailed mathematical formulas and ideal scores for the aforementioned metrics are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 general analysis first twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates are identified and their error characteristics are comprehensively investigated over mainland china fig 3 shows the fractions of four rainfall events i e hit miss false and correct negative for all input sources in gpm gsmap apparently the ir has the maximum sample size of about 52 6 corresponding to the percentage of its sampling frequency in fig 2 a majority of the pmw sources fall between 1 9 and 6 4 except for the ssmis onboard dmsp f19 satellite and tmi with relatively lower sample sizes of 0 5 and 1 4 respectively that is because the tmi and ssmis onboard dmsp f19 stopped running in april 2015 and february 2016 respectively refer to zhu et al 2018 http www wmo sat info oscar satellites view 66 as for fractions of events the hit fractions of sounders and ir range from 4 2 to 4 9 which are evidently larger than those of imagers with percentage between 3 2 and 4 1 among which the ssmis on dmsp f19 satellite has the lowest hit fractions of 3 2 while the amsu a mhs onboard noaa 19 and noaa 18 satellites have the largest hit fractions of 4 9 and 4 7 respectively on the other hand for miss fractions sounders seem to be generally lower than imagers both amsu a mhs onboard metop a and metop b satellites have the smallest miss fraction of 3 2 it is worthwhile to note that tmi has the highest values of both hit and miss fractions among all the imagers this is because the spatial coverage of tmi is limited to the tropical and subtropical regions within the latitude band 38 n s which have a large number of short lived precipitation events it is further confirmed that the missed precipitation events mainly concentrated on the band of 20 30 n over mainland china refer to the relationship plots between miss fractions and latitudes in supplementary material fig s2 as for false fractions the imagers have lower values ranging from 1 6 to 2 4 relative to the sounders between 3 9 and 4 3 in general the average false fraction of imagers is approximately one half of that mean value of sounders in terms of extremes gmi and ssmis onboard dmsp f18 satellite have lowest false fractions of 1 6 and 1 7 respectively while ir has highest false fraction of 4 6 note that the latitudinal profiles of fractions for four rainfall events are presented in the supplementary materials see figs s1 s4 to provide readers more detail information generally speaking sounders and ir have relatively higher hit and false fractions and lower miss fractions whereas imagers have lower hit and false fractions but higher miss fractions it implies that sounders and ir are biased toward higher values in rain rates around the threshold of 0 1 mm h tan et al 2016 on the other hand the miss fractions of imagers are higher than their false fractions meaning that imagers tend to underestimate rain rate occurrences conversely sounders and ir are prone to overestimate rainfall events due to their lower miss fractions and higher false ones fig 4 shows the true ratios of hit miss and false events for each input source of gpm gsmap estimates for thrs imagers fall between 40 and 50 though sounders and ir fall between 50 and 60 while surprisingly gmi has the lowest thr of 42 3 on the other hand for tmrs sounders seem lower than imagers suggesting that sounders have better rainfall detection capabilities as for tfrs imagers values ranging from 1 8 to 2 5 are apparently superior to sounders and ir from 4 2 to 5 0 among all the input sources gmi has the best tfr metric of 1 8 while ir has the worst one of 5 0 compared to imagers sounders and ir have higher tfrs which is consistent with the above conclusion regarding fig 3 in that sounders and ir overestimate the rain rate around the threshold of 0 1 mm h fig 5 displays the total bias and four error components i e hit miss false and correct negative for twelve input sources of gpm gsmap over mainland china it can be seen that the imagers generally have lower total bias less than 35 and error components than the sounders and ir except for miss bias in particular the total biases of the ssmis onboard dmsp f19 satellite and the amsr2 onboard gcom w1 satellite are only 1 5 and 5 2 respectively while the amsu a mhs sensors have the largest biases exceeding 50 it is found that the imagers have relatively larger miss biases with negative values that partially counteract the other positive error components for hit bias most imagers are apparently superior to sounders except for gmi of 50 4 this suggests that gmi and sounders in gpm gsmap may overestimate precipitation for hit events for miss bias similar to tmr imagers and ir have poorer performance than sounders the worst input sources come from the gmi the amsr2 onboard gcom w1 satellite and the ssmis onboard dmsp f19 satellite with miss biases of 30 0 30 1 31 5 respectively for false bias imagers evidently perform better than sounders and ir the mean false bias of imagers only accounts for approximately one third of sounders and ir in summary as a core gpm microwave imager gmi does not perform as well as expected but with higher hit bias 50 4 and miss bias 30 0 over mainland china nevertheless another type of imager ssmis exhibits rather better error and bias except for the ssmis sensor onboard dmsp f19 satellite surprisingly we find the ir input seems to be superior to gmi and sounders with regard to the hit or total biases which could be attributed to the morphing technique employed in the gpm gsmap system moreover our assessment shows that the total biases and error components of most sensors for gpm gsmap over the whole mainland china are significantly lower than those over the tibetan plateau when compared to the results of zhu et al 2018 this is mainly because of the impact of complex topography on the precipitation structure and associated challenges with retrievals from space 3 2 comparisons of different climatic regions next we divided the whole mainland china into four climatic regions namely the humid semi humid semi arid and arid regions fig 1a and examined the individual error sources in these regions there are a large number of effective sample sizes for twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates over every climatic region which can provide large enough samples to ensure the robustness of the evaluation the detailed sample sizes of all sensor inputs for different climatic regions are provided in the supplementary material see fig s5 fig 6 shows three indices of true event ratios thr tmr and tfr for each input source of gpm gsmap estimates over four climate regions one can see that all the input sources exhibit relatively better detection capability in the humid and semi humid regions with higher thrs and lower tmrs in contrast these input sources perform relatively worse in terms of detection capability in semi arid and arid regions despite having lower tfrs in terms of different sensors the sounders generally perform better than imagers in detecting rainfall events over four climate regions however the sounders tend to yield false precipitation with their tfrs reaching values approximately twice those of the imagers it is noted that the gmi does not identify rainfall events in the semi arid or arid regions any better as it was designed to do fig 7 depicts the three components of bias hit miss and false for each input source of gpm gsmap over the four climatic regions overall the components of bias for most input sources gradually increase with aridity of all the sensors the amsr2 imager onboard gcom w1 satellite generally exhibits the best performance over four climatic regions as for the seven imagers tmi has the largest hit and false biases in the arid region meaning that tmi seriously overestimates rainfall amounts in these arid regions ushio et al 2009 pointed out that evaluating the error sources is critical for improving the key algorithms of gsmap such as the climate precipitation center morphing kalman filter cmorph kf our analysis further highlights the need for considering the error dependence on different climatic regions when upgrading these algorithms in gpm gsmap in the future for imagers the total errors mainly came from the hit and miss errors in the humid or semi humid regions while the hit and false errors are the major error components in the semi arid or arid regions additionally it is apparent that the retrieval errors of both sounders and ir are dominated by the false errors in the arid region on the basis of these findings we recommend that future efforts of algorithm developers focus on reducing the false precipitation retrieved by the satellite sensors over arid regions though fig 7 expresses the main error sources of twelve input sources over every climatic region it couldn t reflect the bias contribution of every climatic region the results of bias contribution in fig 8 indicate that the hit miss and false errors for all the input sources primarily originate from the precipitation estimates in humid and semi humid regions the pattern of each plot in fig 8 seems to be opposite to that in fig 7 this could be attributed to the following two major reasons 1 there are less rainfall events and lighter precipitation amounts in semi arid and arid regions than in humid and semi humid regions the relative bias of satellite retrievals against ground observations is prone to become rather large for light rainfall events 2 the sparse ground gauges distributed in semi arid and arid regions lead to relatively lower sample sizes see fig s5 in the supplementary material which are likely to increase the uncertainty of the comparison between satellite retrievals and ground observations 3 3 topographic influence fig 9 shows the variations of detection capability indices thr tmr and tfr for twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates by elevation over mainland china as can be seen both thr and tmr for the input sources of gpm gsmap estimates seem to be rather stable in the regions where the elevation is below 1000 m indicating that satellite sensors have the best detection capability over flat plains and small hills in general the thrs of all the input sources have a clear decreasing tendency with increasing elevation in contrast the tmrs have a gradually increasing tendency with elevation moreover tmr and thr of each input source are almost symmetrical specially one can see that the variations of both thr and tmr fluctuate between 3000 m and 4000 m and then rapidly drop starting from 4000 m given that there are few gauges distributed in these high elevation regions see supplementary material in fig s6 the sparse sample sizes increase the uncertainty of the evaluations which is the most likely cause for the evident variations of both tmr and thr over high altitudes additionally another reason might be that sensors onboard satellites find difficulties in detecting low level orographic rainfall events that often occur at elevations higher than 3000 m elevations such as the tibetan plateau and tianshan mountains guo et al 2007 2017 relative to other inputs the new gmi sensor with an extended frequency range 10 183 ghz displays a stable performance for high elevations as expected fig 9a as for the biases of three error components in fig 10 the hit and false biases of the input sources have a tendency to increase with elevation while the miss biases have a negative increasing trend with elevation same as the variations in fig 9 the fluctuations for the hit miss and false biases also appear over high altitudes above 3000 m it is worthwhile to point out that the false biases of sounders are evidently higher than those of imagers the former is approximately twice as large as the latter furthermore the fluctuations of sounders with elevation changes seems to be more serious than those of imagers implying that sounders have a stronger topographic dependency relative to imagers apparently the impact of topography on the performance of different input sources is diverse the bias contributions of three error components for different elevations are computed for each input source the plots in fig 11 clearly indicate that the bias contributions of three error components for all the input sources are close to zero when the elevation reaches around 2000 m it is because most gauges and observed rainfall events are distributed in the regions less than 2000 m refer to fig 1 and supplementary material in fig s6 this further confirms the above analyses that the sparse sample sizes at high altitudes could increase the uncertainty of the evaluation 3 4 seasonal impact to analyze the seasonality of the detection capability of the sensors the monthly distributions of thrs tmrs and tfrs for each input source of gpm gsmap estimates during the 4 year study period are shown in fig 12 as can be seen both thrs and tmrs for all input sources seem to perform better in summer months this suggests that the satellite sensors are more responsive to the medium and heavy rainfall events than the light ones which is consistent with the results of zhu et al 2018 in general sounders exhibit relatively higher thrs than imagers during both summer and winter the sounders and ir inputs have similar monthly distributions of thr and tmr fig 12i l regarding the imagers gmi and amsr2 have stable performance with the similar thr and tmr values around 50 during summer months while the thrs of tmi and the ssmis suite are higher than the tmrs in summer similar to the topographic analysis in the above section the hit miss and false biases are also computed here to reveal the error characteristics of the input sources at monthly scale fig 13 overall the pwm sensors have relatively lower biases in summer and higher ones in winter while ir input looks more stable and smoother across time fig 13l the authors argue that such a phenomenon is closely related to the interference of precipitation sized ice particles in the winter atmosphere or ice cover over land surfaces to the pwm retrievals while the ir input with the morphing technique is directly inferred from cloud top temperature so as to alleviate the impact of seasonal variation on retrieval results also ir is less affected by the problem of distinguishing between precipitation and frozen surface which is a particular issue for microwave sensors in addition we also find the false biases of sounders amsu a mhs sensors in winter are remarkably higher than those of imagers so it can be concluded that the false alarm of winter rainfall is a defect with the sounders as for imagers it is interesting that the hit bias of gmi mainly occurs in the winter and spring seasons even though the gpm microwave sensor was designed to improve the observations of light rainfall therefore we recommend that the gpm developers pay more attention to the retrieval algorithm for gmi particularly in winter and spring fig 14 depicts the contribution to seasonal rainfall biases for the input sources to gpm gsmap estimates over mainland china similar to the topographic analysis the monthly variations of bias contribution for three error components i e hbc mbc and fbc were computed from fig 14 it can be seen that the most significant hit bias of gmi primarily comes from the spring and summer months see fig 5 it implies that gmi seriously overestimates the spring and summer rainfall for the imagers of ssmis their negative hit biases see fig 5 are mainly caused by the underestimation in summer furthermore for the ssmis on dmsp f19 satellite its hit and miss errors primarily appear in january as for sounders they have similar seasonal distribution of bias contribution with significantly higher hbc and fbc values in october which is the dominant month for their corresponding hit and false biases as shown in fig 5 also we find that the total bias of ir is mainly a result of the hit and false biases in spring and summer months in summary all input sources display better performance during summer among the imagers the ssmis onboard dmsp f18 satellite exhibits the best performance during all months relative to other sensors even during the winter and spring conversely the gmi exhibits poor detection capability and has relatively larger biases especially during the spring and winter seasons additionally sounders exhibit an obvious feature of seasonality dependency relative to the imagers with larger hit and false biases in winter 4 conclusion the main objective of this study is to quantify the error characteristics of the twelve input sources used in the latest gpm gsmap precipitation estimates over mainland china these errors are examined as a function of climatic region elevation and seasonality the major conclusions are given as follows 1 of the pmw sensors imagers are generally superior to sounders over mainland china especially regarding detectability with hits and false precipitation relative to other pmw inputs the sounders of amsu a mhs exhibit the poorest performance with the largest total biases exceeding 50 and with a serious dependence of the errors on elevation on the other hand both sounders and infrared inputs tend to overestimate the rainfall at the low rain rate of around 0 1 mm h as compared to the imagers gmi overestimates the precipitation with a total bias and hit bias of 34 3 and 50 4 respectively compared with other imagers the ssmis sensors have relatively lower total error ranging from 1 5 to 16 2 and hit biases between 5 and 7 specifically the ssmis onboard the dmsp f18 satellite exhibits the best performance with the lowest hit bias of 2 4 2 based on our results over four different climatic regions we find the hit miss and false biases for almost all input sources increase with aridity in particular all the input sources have significant false precipitation errors in arid regions additionally the main sources of total errors for the input sensors are diverse in different climatic regions considering the hit miss and false biases altogether the amsr2 sensor onboard the gcom w1 satellite seems to be the most optimal sensor for the four climatic regions unexpectedly tmi has the poorest performance among the imagers with false biases over 350 in arid regions 3 in addition the errors of the twelve input sources depend on topography it is found that all twelve input sources display an evident fluctuation of the error when the elevation reaches approximately 3000 m we speculate that this phenomenon is probably caused by sparse gauges in these mountainous areas which might increase the uncertainty of the evaluation relative to the imagers sounders have a stronger dependence of the error on topography 4 as for the seasonality the twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates generally exhibit better performance in summer relative to imagers sounders exhibit a stronger dependence of the error on seasonality with larger hit and false biases in winter among the imagers the ssmis onboard the dmsp f19 satellite displays the poorest performance in winter as one of the core sensors for gpm the gmi shows unsatisfactory detection capability and has relatively large hit and miss biases especially during the spring and winter seasons this implies that the gmi algorithm in the gpm gsmap system may need to be further improved although this multi channel gpm microwave imager has been upgraded relative to the tmi in trmm among the twelve input sources the ssmis on dmsp f18 demonstrates the best performance for all seasons even during the winter months our evaluation revealed the dependence of the input data source errors to gpm gsmap estimates on climate topography and seasonality we expect the findings of this study can provide algorithm developers with some valuable insights to further improve the gpm based satellite precipitation retrievals and advance the usefulness of satellite precipitation estimates in operational hydrological and meteorological applications however our conclusions are based on the reference gridded precipitation mpa which integrated both gauge observations and satellite information despite that we only selected those grid cells containing at least one gauge but the ground reference is not purely gauge derived precipitation which might cause some potential uncertainties in the assessments future research will focus on identifying the error sources of gpm estimates by analyzing the multiple influence factors

6326,the impact of crucial geographic and climatic factors on the input source errors of integrated multi satellite precipitation estimates is an important but still unclear issue for both algorithm developers and data users this study primarily focused on the impacts of the twelve input sources used in the latest global satellite mapping of precipitation for global precipitation measurement gpm gsmap for different climatic regions elevations and seasons over mainland china our evaluation results show that the error features of the input sources from several passive microwave and infrared sensors are related to the accuracy of gpm gsmap precipitation estimates the input sources show larger hits misses and false biases in the semi arid and arid regions for which the false bias was particularly significant as for the seasonality the input data sources exhibit a better performance in summer and have relatively lower hits and higher biases in winter we also found that precipitation retrievals of the input sources are affected by topography in different extents in terms of passive microwave sensors the conical scanning imagers generally outperform the cross track scanning sounders but the sounders based precipitation estimates have relatively better detection capability as one of the core sensors for gpm the microwave imager gmi reveals inadequacies in representing areal rainfall patterns and has relatively large biases especially in the winter and spring seasons suggesting that the current gmi algorithm might need to be further improved keywords gpm gsmap climate elevation season mainland china 1 introduction obtaining high precision precipitation estimates over large spatial extents in real time still remains a fundamental scientific challenge in the hydrometeorological community primarily due to the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity of precipitation hou et al 2014 yong et al 2015 chen et al 2019 rain gauge networks and ground based radars are two primarily data sources for precisely measuring precipitation kidd and huffman 2011 kidd et al 2017 rain gauges can provide directly captured precipitation at specific sites but such information is not continuous in space tang et al 2016 hence a variety of interpolation methods are applied in processing the point based rainfall for obtaining continuous spatial precipitation fields tapiador et al 2012 some systematic and random errors are inevitably introduced by spatial interpolation especially over those areas where the gauge observing networks are sparse ma et al 2015 yong et al 2016b with regard to ground based radar it can provide high resolution and nearly continuous precipitation estimates over large areas within ranges of approximately 250 km of the radar guo et al 2015 however ground radars still have major shortcomings 1 the data samples can be impacted by non meteorological scatters in urban environments e g buildings towers and low level surveillance can be limited in mountainous regions 2 radar networks are relatively expensive to purchase operate and maintain which limits their availability in many countries of the world 3 precipitation retrievals from radar data while having improved over the years are still subject to random errors range dependent systematic errors and so on dinku et al 2002 yang et al 2006 tang et al 2016 in summary it is difficult to quickly and comprehensively obtain accurate precipitation estimates over many continental domains by relying on rain gauge networks or radar networks alone the development of techniques and retrieval algorithms using satellite based instruments has led to the capability of measuring precipitation across the entire globe based on the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm a large number of quasi global satellite precipitation products with different input sources and retrieval algorithms have been released to the public over the past decades such as the trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 as a successor to trmm the global precipitation measurement gpm core observatory satellite has been launched on february 28 2014 which was deployed by a joint effort between nasa and jaxa this core satellite carries a dual frequency precipitation radar dpr at ku band 13 6 ghz and ka band 35 5 ghz frequencies and also carries a conical scanning multichannel gpm microwave imager gmi with a frequency range between 10 and 183 ghz dpr and gmi are used together to develop a new calibration standard for the other microwave sensors in low earth orbit which further extends the capacity of gpm to measure light and solid precipitation the current operational satellite precipitation products for gpm mainly include the gpm gsmap of jaxa and the imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement product of nasa the development of the gsmap product seeks to meet the primary objective of jaxa s gpm mission to produce a high precision high resolution global precipitation map using satellite data https sharaku eorc jaxa jp gsmap index htm to satisfy the diverse user needs for latency and accuracy the gsmap developers produce eight sets of products such as global satellite mapping of precipitation in near real time gsmap nrt global satellite mapping of precipitation microwave ir combined product gsmap mvk global satellite mapping of precipitation gauge calibrated rainfall product gsmap gauge and so on recently the gsmap precipitation products have been widely investigated and analyzed at local regional and even global scales kubota et al 2009 dinku et al 2010 andermann et al 2011 qin et al 2014 chen et al 2016 prakash et al 2016a b takido et al 2016 yong et al 2016b tan et al 2018 guo et al 2017 hur et al 2018 deng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 analysis of the error structure and characteristics of satellite precipitation products is helpful for data developers to diagnose the underlying problems in the retrieval algorithms and further improve the quality of precipitation estimates shen et al 2010 2014 xie and xiong 2011 furthermore it has been found that several crucial geographic and climatic factors can significantly affect the retrieval accuracy of satellite precipitation kubota et al 2009 dinku et al 2010 andermann et al 2011 using global scale analyses and regional case studies kubota et al 2009 found that gsmap exhibits poor performance in detecting light rainfall during the warm season and heavy rainfall for all seasons dinku et al 2010 indicated that gsmap overestimates rainfall occurrences and it produces overestimated rainfall amounts over arid regions compared to humid regions andermann et al 2011 revealed that the accuracy of gsmap precipitation varies as a function of orography and errors magnify during the monsoon seasons takido et al 2016 showed that both probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far of gsmap gauge and gsmap mvk have a clear linear relationship with log transformed elevation data especially during the cool season guo et al 2017 also found that gsmap significantly overestimates warm season precipitation over northern central asia and its retrieval errors generally follow an elevation dependent feature in space the aforementioned studies primarily focused on error assessment of the combined satellite precipitation product but did not comprehensively analyze the impacts of the errors associated with the input data sources even though several current works have provided some identification and quantification of error sources for tmpa gsmap and imerg e g tan et al 2016 gebregiorgis et al 2017 2018 zhu et al 2018 a systematic study investigating the geographic and climatic dependence of error sources from the input microwave and infrared sensors is still lacking in this study twelve microwave and infrared sensor based precipitation estimates that are used as inputs in the latest version 7 gpm gsmap system are statistically investigated across different climatic regions over mainland china our aim is not just to analyze the error structure and feature of these diverse sensor inputs but also to identify the impact of climate elevation and seasonality on the retrieval errors this paper is organized into four parts in the next section we describe the study area the datasets and methods used a presentation of the results and discussion follows in section 3 summarizing remarks and conclusions finalize the paper in section 4 2 study area datasets and methodology 2 1 study area mainland china located within 73 135 e and 18 53 n has multiple types of climatic characteristics and complex topography for its vast territory fig 1 a shows the spatial distribution of average annual precipitation aap during the period of 1961 2000 aap generally decreases from southeast to northwest in mainland china based on the spatial structure of aap mainland china can be separated into four parts i e humid semi humid semi arid and arid regions fig 1a the humid region dominated by the subtropical monsoon includes the pearl river basin the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river and huaihe river basin where the aap exceeds 800 mm yr the semi humid region covers the yellow river basin and the eastern tibetan plateau with the aap value of 400 800 mm yr which is controlled by the monsoon in middle latitudes the semi arid region with aap of 200 400 mm yr comprises the tianshan mountains and the middle part of the tibetan plateau with a rather complex topography last the arid region consists of the residual parts mainly including the tarim basin and the western tibetan plateau and its aap is less than 200 mm yr 2 2 ground reference precipitation mpa in our study the gridded hourly merged precipitation analysis mpa dataset developed by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration was used as the reference data which combines gauge observations from over 30 000 automatic weather stations with cmorph at an hourly 0 1 0 1 latitude longitude resolution the probability density function pdf matching and optimal interpolation oi methods are employed for generating this merged mpa dataset first the automatic weather station data are processed into a gridded gauge precipitation dataset with 0 1 o 0 1 o resolution then the cmorph estimates are adjusted using pdf matching with the gauged precipitation dataset finally the oi method is employed to correct the gauge adjusted cmorph estimates producing the final mpa product an evaluation shows that the merged mpa product effectively integrates the advantages of both gauge observations and satellite retrievals in that it outperforms other operational ground based precipitation products over mainland china shen et al 2013 as shown in fig 1c automatic weather stations used in mpa are mainly concentrated in the humid and semi humid regions while relatively sparse gauges are distributed within the semi arid and arid regions to ensure the robustness of results we only selected those gridded precipitation data that contain at least one gauge for each 0 1 0 1 grid cell it is worth noting that only liquid rainfall events are investigated in our study as the automatic weather stations used for generating the mpa product are suited for liquid water measurement in practice there exists a flag field of gauge numbers in the mpa datasets which denotes the numbers of gauges for liquid water observation within one grid cell in this study we use this flag field to strictly match the satellite estimates and liquid rainfall events captured by gauges so as to exclude snowfall events 2 3 satellite precipitation gpm gsmap the latest gpm based gsmap suite mainly includes three products i e gsmap nrt gsmap mvk and gsmap gauge the gsmap nrt available at a 4 h delay after observation is a near real time precipitation product the gsmap mvk is a reanalysis version of gsmap nrt which is still a purely satellite derived product available with a three day delay the gsmap gauge is a gauge adjusted product differing from both gsmap nrt and gsmap mvk the above three gsmap products have the same spatiotemporal resolution 0 1 0 1 1 hourly covering the latitude band 60 n s additionally the newest dpr data were first employed in the version 7 gsmap system to provide a calibration standard for passive microwave retrievals so as to improve the accuracy of combined precipitation estimates in this study the gpm based version 7 gsmap mvk without gauge adjustment hereafter refer to as gpm gsmap is used for investigating the impact of the details of input data source errors on combined satellite precipitation products we selected an overlapping time span of four complete years between gpm gsmap and mpa from april 2014 to march 2018 as our study period the input sources of gpm gsmap estimates are derived from the infrared ir observations and six types of passive microwave pmw instruments including the gmi tmi amsr2 ssmis amsu a and mhs sensors table 1 altogether there are twelve input sources for gpm gsmap estimates which are composed of seven conical scanning pwm imagers four cross track scanning pwm sounders and one ir input table 1 in the gpm gsmap system the retrievals for the pwm imagers and sounders employ microwave imager algorithm mwi and microwave sounder algorithm mws respectively as for the ir input it includes the purely ir based retrievals and the morphing based estimates using propagation vectors derived from ir observations fig 2 exhibits the spatial distribution of sampling frequency for these twelve input sources it is clear that there exists significantly different pattern of sampling frequencies for the gpm gsmap inputs the usage of geo ir data is more frequent than that of pwm sensors its scanning proportion accounts for over 40 of total scans in contrast the ssmis sensor onboard dmsp f19 satellite has the lowest scanning frequency less than 1 likely due to the short sampling time from march 2015 to february 2016 relative to the other sensors table 1 2 4 methodology in this study we extend the approach of imerg leveraging ancillary variables which was proposed by tan et al 2016 to identify individual sources of errors in gpm gsmap the twelve sensor inputs and their corresponding retrieval errors can be linked by the satellite information flag in the gpm gsmap system more information about ancillary variables of constellation based sensors are presented in the gpm gsmap data format description for product version 7 available on https sharaku eorc jaxa jp gsmap index htm additionally seven metrics including hit fraction miss fraction false fraction correct negative true hit ratio thr true miss ratio tmr and true false ratio tfr were used to investigate the detection capability for each input source the evaluation also utilizes five statistical indices namely total bias hit bias miss bias false bias and correct negative bias to quantify the error and bias for the individual input sources the hit fraction indicates how often the satellite correctly identifies precipitation while the miss fraction is the fraction of missed rainfall events relative to all rainfall events the false fraction gives the fraction between false alarm events and all rainfall events comparisons made for precipitation events observed by twelve input sources at the same time would equitably describe and compare their detection capability however the orbits of the different satellites do not permit this idea situation hence we employ three additional indices i e thr tmr and tfr to further analyze the detection capability for each input source the thr denotes the ratio of rainfall event occurrences that are correctly identified by the satellite during the temporal step of gpm gsmap while the tmr gives the ratio of rainfall event occurrences that are not detected by the satellite the tfr is the ratio of rainfall event occurrences detected by the satellite but not observed by the ground gauge as in many previous studies yong et al 2016a tan et al 2016 tan et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 here we selected 0 1 mm h as a threshold to determine an instance to be raining or not raining during a time step of 1 h the detailed mathematical formulas and ideal scores for the aforementioned metrics are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 general analysis first twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates are identified and their error characteristics are comprehensively investigated over mainland china fig 3 shows the fractions of four rainfall events i e hit miss false and correct negative for all input sources in gpm gsmap apparently the ir has the maximum sample size of about 52 6 corresponding to the percentage of its sampling frequency in fig 2 a majority of the pmw sources fall between 1 9 and 6 4 except for the ssmis onboard dmsp f19 satellite and tmi with relatively lower sample sizes of 0 5 and 1 4 respectively that is because the tmi and ssmis onboard dmsp f19 stopped running in april 2015 and february 2016 respectively refer to zhu et al 2018 http www wmo sat info oscar satellites view 66 as for fractions of events the hit fractions of sounders and ir range from 4 2 to 4 9 which are evidently larger than those of imagers with percentage between 3 2 and 4 1 among which the ssmis on dmsp f19 satellite has the lowest hit fractions of 3 2 while the amsu a mhs onboard noaa 19 and noaa 18 satellites have the largest hit fractions of 4 9 and 4 7 respectively on the other hand for miss fractions sounders seem to be generally lower than imagers both amsu a mhs onboard metop a and metop b satellites have the smallest miss fraction of 3 2 it is worthwhile to note that tmi has the highest values of both hit and miss fractions among all the imagers this is because the spatial coverage of tmi is limited to the tropical and subtropical regions within the latitude band 38 n s which have a large number of short lived precipitation events it is further confirmed that the missed precipitation events mainly concentrated on the band of 20 30 n over mainland china refer to the relationship plots between miss fractions and latitudes in supplementary material fig s2 as for false fractions the imagers have lower values ranging from 1 6 to 2 4 relative to the sounders between 3 9 and 4 3 in general the average false fraction of imagers is approximately one half of that mean value of sounders in terms of extremes gmi and ssmis onboard dmsp f18 satellite have lowest false fractions of 1 6 and 1 7 respectively while ir has highest false fraction of 4 6 note that the latitudinal profiles of fractions for four rainfall events are presented in the supplementary materials see figs s1 s4 to provide readers more detail information generally speaking sounders and ir have relatively higher hit and false fractions and lower miss fractions whereas imagers have lower hit and false fractions but higher miss fractions it implies that sounders and ir are biased toward higher values in rain rates around the threshold of 0 1 mm h tan et al 2016 on the other hand the miss fractions of imagers are higher than their false fractions meaning that imagers tend to underestimate rain rate occurrences conversely sounders and ir are prone to overestimate rainfall events due to their lower miss fractions and higher false ones fig 4 shows the true ratios of hit miss and false events for each input source of gpm gsmap estimates for thrs imagers fall between 40 and 50 though sounders and ir fall between 50 and 60 while surprisingly gmi has the lowest thr of 42 3 on the other hand for tmrs sounders seem lower than imagers suggesting that sounders have better rainfall detection capabilities as for tfrs imagers values ranging from 1 8 to 2 5 are apparently superior to sounders and ir from 4 2 to 5 0 among all the input sources gmi has the best tfr metric of 1 8 while ir has the worst one of 5 0 compared to imagers sounders and ir have higher tfrs which is consistent with the above conclusion regarding fig 3 in that sounders and ir overestimate the rain rate around the threshold of 0 1 mm h fig 5 displays the total bias and four error components i e hit miss false and correct negative for twelve input sources of gpm gsmap over mainland china it can be seen that the imagers generally have lower total bias less than 35 and error components than the sounders and ir except for miss bias in particular the total biases of the ssmis onboard dmsp f19 satellite and the amsr2 onboard gcom w1 satellite are only 1 5 and 5 2 respectively while the amsu a mhs sensors have the largest biases exceeding 50 it is found that the imagers have relatively larger miss biases with negative values that partially counteract the other positive error components for hit bias most imagers are apparently superior to sounders except for gmi of 50 4 this suggests that gmi and sounders in gpm gsmap may overestimate precipitation for hit events for miss bias similar to tmr imagers and ir have poorer performance than sounders the worst input sources come from the gmi the amsr2 onboard gcom w1 satellite and the ssmis onboard dmsp f19 satellite with miss biases of 30 0 30 1 31 5 respectively for false bias imagers evidently perform better than sounders and ir the mean false bias of imagers only accounts for approximately one third of sounders and ir in summary as a core gpm microwave imager gmi does not perform as well as expected but with higher hit bias 50 4 and miss bias 30 0 over mainland china nevertheless another type of imager ssmis exhibits rather better error and bias except for the ssmis sensor onboard dmsp f19 satellite surprisingly we find the ir input seems to be superior to gmi and sounders with regard to the hit or total biases which could be attributed to the morphing technique employed in the gpm gsmap system moreover our assessment shows that the total biases and error components of most sensors for gpm gsmap over the whole mainland china are significantly lower than those over the tibetan plateau when compared to the results of zhu et al 2018 this is mainly because of the impact of complex topography on the precipitation structure and associated challenges with retrievals from space 3 2 comparisons of different climatic regions next we divided the whole mainland china into four climatic regions namely the humid semi humid semi arid and arid regions fig 1a and examined the individual error sources in these regions there are a large number of effective sample sizes for twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates over every climatic region which can provide large enough samples to ensure the robustness of the evaluation the detailed sample sizes of all sensor inputs for different climatic regions are provided in the supplementary material see fig s5 fig 6 shows three indices of true event ratios thr tmr and tfr for each input source of gpm gsmap estimates over four climate regions one can see that all the input sources exhibit relatively better detection capability in the humid and semi humid regions with higher thrs and lower tmrs in contrast these input sources perform relatively worse in terms of detection capability in semi arid and arid regions despite having lower tfrs in terms of different sensors the sounders generally perform better than imagers in detecting rainfall events over four climate regions however the sounders tend to yield false precipitation with their tfrs reaching values approximately twice those of the imagers it is noted that the gmi does not identify rainfall events in the semi arid or arid regions any better as it was designed to do fig 7 depicts the three components of bias hit miss and false for each input source of gpm gsmap over the four climatic regions overall the components of bias for most input sources gradually increase with aridity of all the sensors the amsr2 imager onboard gcom w1 satellite generally exhibits the best performance over four climatic regions as for the seven imagers tmi has the largest hit and false biases in the arid region meaning that tmi seriously overestimates rainfall amounts in these arid regions ushio et al 2009 pointed out that evaluating the error sources is critical for improving the key algorithms of gsmap such as the climate precipitation center morphing kalman filter cmorph kf our analysis further highlights the need for considering the error dependence on different climatic regions when upgrading these algorithms in gpm gsmap in the future for imagers the total errors mainly came from the hit and miss errors in the humid or semi humid regions while the hit and false errors are the major error components in the semi arid or arid regions additionally it is apparent that the retrieval errors of both sounders and ir are dominated by the false errors in the arid region on the basis of these findings we recommend that future efforts of algorithm developers focus on reducing the false precipitation retrieved by the satellite sensors over arid regions though fig 7 expresses the main error sources of twelve input sources over every climatic region it couldn t reflect the bias contribution of every climatic region the results of bias contribution in fig 8 indicate that the hit miss and false errors for all the input sources primarily originate from the precipitation estimates in humid and semi humid regions the pattern of each plot in fig 8 seems to be opposite to that in fig 7 this could be attributed to the following two major reasons 1 there are less rainfall events and lighter precipitation amounts in semi arid and arid regions than in humid and semi humid regions the relative bias of satellite retrievals against ground observations is prone to become rather large for light rainfall events 2 the sparse ground gauges distributed in semi arid and arid regions lead to relatively lower sample sizes see fig s5 in the supplementary material which are likely to increase the uncertainty of the comparison between satellite retrievals and ground observations 3 3 topographic influence fig 9 shows the variations of detection capability indices thr tmr and tfr for twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates by elevation over mainland china as can be seen both thr and tmr for the input sources of gpm gsmap estimates seem to be rather stable in the regions where the elevation is below 1000 m indicating that satellite sensors have the best detection capability over flat plains and small hills in general the thrs of all the input sources have a clear decreasing tendency with increasing elevation in contrast the tmrs have a gradually increasing tendency with elevation moreover tmr and thr of each input source are almost symmetrical specially one can see that the variations of both thr and tmr fluctuate between 3000 m and 4000 m and then rapidly drop starting from 4000 m given that there are few gauges distributed in these high elevation regions see supplementary material in fig s6 the sparse sample sizes increase the uncertainty of the evaluations which is the most likely cause for the evident variations of both tmr and thr over high altitudes additionally another reason might be that sensors onboard satellites find difficulties in detecting low level orographic rainfall events that often occur at elevations higher than 3000 m elevations such as the tibetan plateau and tianshan mountains guo et al 2007 2017 relative to other inputs the new gmi sensor with an extended frequency range 10 183 ghz displays a stable performance for high elevations as expected fig 9a as for the biases of three error components in fig 10 the hit and false biases of the input sources have a tendency to increase with elevation while the miss biases have a negative increasing trend with elevation same as the variations in fig 9 the fluctuations for the hit miss and false biases also appear over high altitudes above 3000 m it is worthwhile to point out that the false biases of sounders are evidently higher than those of imagers the former is approximately twice as large as the latter furthermore the fluctuations of sounders with elevation changes seems to be more serious than those of imagers implying that sounders have a stronger topographic dependency relative to imagers apparently the impact of topography on the performance of different input sources is diverse the bias contributions of three error components for different elevations are computed for each input source the plots in fig 11 clearly indicate that the bias contributions of three error components for all the input sources are close to zero when the elevation reaches around 2000 m it is because most gauges and observed rainfall events are distributed in the regions less than 2000 m refer to fig 1 and supplementary material in fig s6 this further confirms the above analyses that the sparse sample sizes at high altitudes could increase the uncertainty of the evaluation 3 4 seasonal impact to analyze the seasonality of the detection capability of the sensors the monthly distributions of thrs tmrs and tfrs for each input source of gpm gsmap estimates during the 4 year study period are shown in fig 12 as can be seen both thrs and tmrs for all input sources seem to perform better in summer months this suggests that the satellite sensors are more responsive to the medium and heavy rainfall events than the light ones which is consistent with the results of zhu et al 2018 in general sounders exhibit relatively higher thrs than imagers during both summer and winter the sounders and ir inputs have similar monthly distributions of thr and tmr fig 12i l regarding the imagers gmi and amsr2 have stable performance with the similar thr and tmr values around 50 during summer months while the thrs of tmi and the ssmis suite are higher than the tmrs in summer similar to the topographic analysis in the above section the hit miss and false biases are also computed here to reveal the error characteristics of the input sources at monthly scale fig 13 overall the pwm sensors have relatively lower biases in summer and higher ones in winter while ir input looks more stable and smoother across time fig 13l the authors argue that such a phenomenon is closely related to the interference of precipitation sized ice particles in the winter atmosphere or ice cover over land surfaces to the pwm retrievals while the ir input with the morphing technique is directly inferred from cloud top temperature so as to alleviate the impact of seasonal variation on retrieval results also ir is less affected by the problem of distinguishing between precipitation and frozen surface which is a particular issue for microwave sensors in addition we also find the false biases of sounders amsu a mhs sensors in winter are remarkably higher than those of imagers so it can be concluded that the false alarm of winter rainfall is a defect with the sounders as for imagers it is interesting that the hit bias of gmi mainly occurs in the winter and spring seasons even though the gpm microwave sensor was designed to improve the observations of light rainfall therefore we recommend that the gpm developers pay more attention to the retrieval algorithm for gmi particularly in winter and spring fig 14 depicts the contribution to seasonal rainfall biases for the input sources to gpm gsmap estimates over mainland china similar to the topographic analysis the monthly variations of bias contribution for three error components i e hbc mbc and fbc were computed from fig 14 it can be seen that the most significant hit bias of gmi primarily comes from the spring and summer months see fig 5 it implies that gmi seriously overestimates the spring and summer rainfall for the imagers of ssmis their negative hit biases see fig 5 are mainly caused by the underestimation in summer furthermore for the ssmis on dmsp f19 satellite its hit and miss errors primarily appear in january as for sounders they have similar seasonal distribution of bias contribution with significantly higher hbc and fbc values in october which is the dominant month for their corresponding hit and false biases as shown in fig 5 also we find that the total bias of ir is mainly a result of the hit and false biases in spring and summer months in summary all input sources display better performance during summer among the imagers the ssmis onboard dmsp f18 satellite exhibits the best performance during all months relative to other sensors even during the winter and spring conversely the gmi exhibits poor detection capability and has relatively larger biases especially during the spring and winter seasons additionally sounders exhibit an obvious feature of seasonality dependency relative to the imagers with larger hit and false biases in winter 4 conclusion the main objective of this study is to quantify the error characteristics of the twelve input sources used in the latest gpm gsmap precipitation estimates over mainland china these errors are examined as a function of climatic region elevation and seasonality the major conclusions are given as follows 1 of the pmw sensors imagers are generally superior to sounders over mainland china especially regarding detectability with hits and false precipitation relative to other pmw inputs the sounders of amsu a mhs exhibit the poorest performance with the largest total biases exceeding 50 and with a serious dependence of the errors on elevation on the other hand both sounders and infrared inputs tend to overestimate the rainfall at the low rain rate of around 0 1 mm h as compared to the imagers gmi overestimates the precipitation with a total bias and hit bias of 34 3 and 50 4 respectively compared with other imagers the ssmis sensors have relatively lower total error ranging from 1 5 to 16 2 and hit biases between 5 and 7 specifically the ssmis onboard the dmsp f18 satellite exhibits the best performance with the lowest hit bias of 2 4 2 based on our results over four different climatic regions we find the hit miss and false biases for almost all input sources increase with aridity in particular all the input sources have significant false precipitation errors in arid regions additionally the main sources of total errors for the input sensors are diverse in different climatic regions considering the hit miss and false biases altogether the amsr2 sensor onboard the gcom w1 satellite seems to be the most optimal sensor for the four climatic regions unexpectedly tmi has the poorest performance among the imagers with false biases over 350 in arid regions 3 in addition the errors of the twelve input sources depend on topography it is found that all twelve input sources display an evident fluctuation of the error when the elevation reaches approximately 3000 m we speculate that this phenomenon is probably caused by sparse gauges in these mountainous areas which might increase the uncertainty of the evaluation relative to the imagers sounders have a stronger dependence of the error on topography 4 as for the seasonality the twelve input sources of gpm gsmap estimates generally exhibit better performance in summer relative to imagers sounders exhibit a stronger dependence of the error on seasonality with larger hit and false biases in winter among the imagers the ssmis onboard the dmsp f19 satellite displays the poorest performance in winter as one of the core sensors for gpm the gmi shows unsatisfactory detection capability and has relatively large hit and miss biases especially during the spring and winter seasons this implies that the gmi algorithm in the gpm gsmap system may need to be further improved although this multi channel gpm microwave imager has been upgraded relative to the tmi in trmm among the twelve input sources the ssmis on dmsp f18 demonstrates the best performance for all seasons even during the winter months our evaluation revealed the dependence of the input data source errors to gpm gsmap estimates on climate topography and seasonality we expect the findings of this study can provide algorithm developers with some valuable insights to further improve the gpm based satellite precipitation retrievals and advance the usefulness of satellite precipitation estimates in operational hydrological and meteorological applications however our conclusions are based on the reference gridded precipitation mpa which integrated both gauge observations and satellite information despite that we only selected those grid cells containing at least one gauge but the ground reference is not purely gauge derived precipitation which might cause some potential uncertainties in the assessments future research will focus on identifying the error sources of gpm estimates by analyzing the multiple influence factors

6327,the determination of area averaged evapotranspiration et over a heterogeneous land surface at the satellite pixel scale model grid scale 103 104 m is crucial to the evaluation of the remote sensing et products and development of the parameterization schemes of general hydro meteorological models the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater flux matrix of multi site eddy covariance ec and large aperture scintillometers lass provided an unprecedented opportunity to establish an aggregation scheme for determining area averaged surface fluxes based on the hiwater flux matrix datasets and high resolution land cover map a new flux aggregation method was developed by using footprint analysis and multiple linear regression the area averaged sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the multi site ec flux measurements using the developed method were compared with the las measured fluxes the results showed that the new method produced reasonable estimates of sensible heat flux with a mean absolute percentage error mape value of around 20 30 the new aggregation method also significantly outperformed other methods being applied commonly such as the rather simple area weighted method the daily et of various land cover types and the area averaged et over the key area of the populus euphratica forest reserve in the ejina oasis were separately estimated using the established disaggregation and aggregation schemes of the new method the area averaged et over this key area ranged between 1 and 5 mm d 1 for the 68 days growing period in 2014 results of this study can be used for the evaluation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models keywords evapotranspiration multi site ec flux measurements aggregation footprint analysis high resolution land cover map ejina oasis 1 introduction many inland river basins in arid and semiarid regions are suffering from the collapse of water system and ecology because of water scarcity rapid population growth and economic development and overexploitation of water resources cheng et al 2014 li et al 2018a these inland river basins are thus confronting great challenges in terms of water resource management particularly coordinating water uses between economic development and ecosystem restoration cheng 2002 cheng et al 2014 hochmuth et al 2015 land surface evapotranspiration et is not only a key component in the basin scale water balance but also is essential in the surface energy balance et transfers a large amount of water from the soil and vegetation into the atmosphere anderson et al 2012 accurate quantification of the et over large areas is vital to the management of water resources particularly in areas of water scarcity allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2012 wang et al 2003 the heihe river basin hrb is a typical inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china and covers an area of approximately 1 432 000 km2 li et al 2013 the landscape of the basin changes from glaciers and alpine biomes in upstream area to steppes and agricultural ecosystems in the midstream area to riparian ecosystems surrounded by vast areas of desert in the downstream area li et al 2018a because of dramatic increase in water consumption in the up and midstream areas the amount of water entering the downstream areas decreased significantly from the 1950s to 2000 leading to the drying up of two terminal lakes the sogo nuur and gaxun nuur and the death of riparian populus euphratica forests cheng et al 2014 yu and wang 2012 zhong et al 2002 to restore the deteriorated ecosystems an ecological water diversion project ewdp was implemented in 2000 since the water reallocation the dried up sogo nuur has been recharged with water since 2002 niu et al 2011 xi et al 2007 xiao et al 2016 consequently the populus euphratica forests and desert shrubland have also been restored to some degree hu et al 2015 nian et al 2017 si et al 2005b xi et al 2013 however the area of cropland in the ejina oasis has also expanded extensively resulting in the overextraction of groundwater and illegal use of surface water hu et al 2015 to allocate the limited water resources reasonably for ecosystem rehabilitation and not illegal reclamation of new cropland accurate estimation of et in the oasis ecosystem is fundamentally important cheng et al 2014 currently methods commonly used for acquiring et include ground based observation remote sensing based estimation and land surface process model simulation since the 1970s the remote sensing based approaches for et estimation have become an effective way to estimate et at a regional scale allen et al 2007 anderson et al 1997 bastiaanssen et al 1998 liu et al 2016 norman et al 2000 su 2002 nevertheless given the uncertainties in input parameters and parameterization schemes the performance of relevant remote sensing models must be evaluated using ground measurements to provide accurate et estimate wang et al 2003 however there may be a bias in directly comparing et estimates with in situ flux observations due to their spatial scale mismatch and spatial heterogeneity at the satellite sub pixel scale jia et al 2012 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2017b for general hydro meteorological models grid resolution of approximately 104 m the development and validation of the parameterization schemes is usually based on measurements performed over homogeneous land surfaces at the scale of 10 103 m while the assumption of homogeneity is often violated at the scale of model grid resolution beyrich et al 2006 beyrich and mengelkamp 2006 chehbouni et al 2000a methods are therefore required to quantify fluxes at the scale of a satellite pixel and a model grid 103 104 m for the validation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models until now the eddy covariance ec method is the most widely accepted technique for directly measuring surface fluxes on the scale of 100 103 m aubinet et al 1999 baldocchi et al 2001 in heterogeneous landscapes a network of ec systems ecs is often deployed over a variety of representative surface types ezzahar et al 2009b furthermore the multi site tower flux measurements can provide meaningful area averaged fluxes if special flux aggregation schemes are applied andré et al 1986 beyrich et al 2006 mahrt et al 2001 the large aperture scintillometer las is another promising technique for providing path averaged fluxes on a much larger scale of 1 5 km particularly in heterogeneous landscapes that would be impracticable to monitor using ec beyrich et al 2012 bruin et al 1995 chehbouni et al 2000b ezzahar et al 2009b meijninger et al 2006 meijninger et al 2002 ward 2017 in recent decades a large number of international field experiments have been conducted in heterogeneous landscapes in different geographical and climatic regions of the earth such as hapex mobilhy andré et al 1986 fife sellers et al 1988 hapex sahel goutorbe et al 1994 boreas sellers et al 1995 nopex halldin et al 1998 litfass 2003 mengelkamp et al 2006 and hiwater li et al 2013 in these experiments the turbulent fluxes at the satellite pixel scale model grid scale determined from multi site flux measurements using various flux aggregation methods were compared with those from scintillometers and aircraft observations as well as remote sensing models the results of these studies showed that the combination of flux measurements from multi site ec and areal fluxes from scintillometers and aircraft observations can provide reasonable area averaged fluxes beyrich et al 2006 liu et al 2016 mahrt et al 2001 meijninger et al 2006 the commonly used flux aggregation methods include the arithmetic average method shuttleworth 1991 and the area weighted method chehbouni et al 2000a mahrt et al 2001 liu et al 2016 and li et al 2018b recently reported that the arithmetic average and area weighted methods can provide accurate average et estimates at homogeneous observation sites but cannot achieve satisfactory et results over heterogeneous land surfaces footprint analysis is an essential approach for interpreting the flux tower measurements over a heterogeneous land surface horst and weil 1992 kljun et al 2015 schmid 2002 the development of footprint models provides diagnostic tools to quantify the representativeness of flux measurements for the selected sites kim et al 2006 kim et al 2018 sutherland et al 2014 besides footprint climatology accumulations of footprints over days in conjunction with a satellite based land cover map is a practical approach to characterize the spatial variation of landscapes within the footprint area chen et al 2008 chen et al 2012 kim et al 2018 sutherland et al 2014 through using footprint analysis substantial effort has been made to relate the aircraft flux measurements to land covers within its footprint area hutjes et al 2010 kirby et al 2008 ogunjemiyo et al 2003 among these works a method to disaggregate aircraft flux measurements from a landscape into the component fluxes from various land cover classes making up that landscape was proposed by using footprint analysis and multiple linear regression hutjes et al 2010 according to its theoretical framework xu et al 2017a developed and tested its disaggregation scheme for the tower flux measurements based on observations from 17 sets of ecs and four paths of lass in an oasis agricultural landscape the results demonstrated that the disaggregation scheme developed for tower flux measurements is feasible to disentangle ec observed fluxes over a heterogeneous area into individual fluxes from various land cover classes within that area and the ec disaggregated individual fluxes can be aggregated again to larger areas the developed schemes achieve to aggregate multi site ec flux observations to the satellite pixel model grid scale compared with the simple arithmetic average and area weighted methods the developed method not only has a better database but also has a solid grounding in physics and mathematics in determining area averaged fluxes over a heterogeneous surface the primary objective of this study was to estimate area averaged et over an oasis riparian forest landscape with footprint analysis and high resolution land cover map based on the flux observations from multi site ec and las and land cover map deriving from high resolution remote sensing data this study 1 analyzed the spatial representativeness of the ec and las flux measurements 2 evaluated the area averaged sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix measurements with the las flux observations and 3 estimated the daily et of each land cover class and the area averaged et in a riparian forest ecosystem 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and site description the ejina oasis is located within about 97 09 36 102 58 48 e and 37 52 12 43 39 00 n fig 1 a it is a typical desert surrounded oasis in an extremely arid region with precipitation of less than 50 mm per year and potential evaporation measured by pan of approximately 3755 mm per year 1990 2010 li et al 2013 the water resources of the oasis depend greatly on the surface water from the heihe river and the groundwater li et al 2018a the natural vegetation distributed along the oasis riverside is dominated by the populus euphratica p euphratica forest and the associated tamarix chinensis t chinensis shrub their natural growth relies on regular flood irrigation of the river water and sufficient water supply of the groundwater the p euphratica tree in this oasis usually leafs out in early may and its leaf area increases rapidly within a week and reaches a maximum value from july through august while in september the leaves go through senescence and subsequent fall stage yu 2013 for the t chinensis the leaves sprout starting at late april go into senescent stage in mid september and wither gradually the dominant agricultural crop in this oasis is the hami melon a type of muskmelon originally from xinjiang china which usually starts planting in mid june local farmers usually use plastic mulch on the plowed crop field to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil evaporation the hami melon grows rapidly by early july reaches its maximum height of 0 4 m within one month and is harvested at the end of september the crop field is relatively wet because of regular irrigations with groundwater there are usually three rounds of heavy irrigation over the field during the crop growing period starting on 17 july 2 august and 18 august in 2014 and each round of irrigation lasts for about a week the irrigated water is mainly evaporated into the atmosphere from the soil and plant and thus it is important to accurately estimate water losses in terms of et the region from erdaoqiao bridge 2 to qidaoqiao bridge 7 in the oasis is known as the core area of the p euphratica forest reserve a key area in this reserve approximately 11 7 5 km2 centered at about 101 09 00 e 41 59 24 n was selected for the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater li et al 2013 hrb downstream investigation fig 1b the intensive observation area of the hiwater was located in the sidaoqiao bridge 4 p euphratica forest reserve fig 1c an area of 3 3 km2 with land covers mostly the t chinensis shrub 38 the p euphratica forest 13 and barren land 39 as well as small areas of cropland 7 and grass 3 five observation sites were set up according to the dominant land cover types each site was equipped with an ec system and an automatic weather station aws to observe the exchange process of surface energy flux in addition two paths of lass las e and las w were installed parallel to measure the area averaged sensible heat fluxes over a riparian forest landscape spatial distribution of the ec and las sites is presented in fig 1c details of the ec and las systems in the flux matrix are given in tables 1 and

2014 at each observation station three soil heat flux plates were placed below the four component radiometer sensor and buried at 0 06 m depth to measure soil heat flux the canopy transpiration of p euphratica was measured by using three groups of thermal dissipation sap flow probes tdps fig 1c nine representative trees in the vicinity of the sl mf and pf were selected with diameters ranging between 33 8 and 51 cm at breast height qiao et al 2015 in june 2014 five 6 m deep groundwater monitoring wells were dug nearby the observation stations as shown by the numbers from 1 to 5 in fig 1c each of these wells was equipped with a hobo water level logger u20 001 04 onset usa for monitoring the long term variation in shallow groundwater depth at this observation area 2 2 data processing and quality control all observations described above during the period from mid may to october 2014 were selected for the following analysis ten minute aws data were averaged to half hour periods ec and las raw data were processed to ensure the high quality flux evaluation detailed below 2 2 1 ec flux data processing and quality control the 10 hz raw ec data were processed using the eddypro

al 1997 quality check for the every 30 min turbulent fluxes was performed using a flagging scheme with three different levels 0 1 and 2 mauder and foken 2015 further details on ec data processing can be found in wang et al 2015 and xu et al 2013 the flux data of flags 0 and 1 were used in the latter analysis flux data of flag 2 were discarded and the 30 min flux data within 1 h of precipitation were also rejected to calculate the cumulative daily et the missing data in the 30 min latent heat flux series were interpolated using a simple gap filling method of a regression between the latent heat flux and net radiation for the five ec systems used in the data analysis the systematic errors have been tried to reduce to a minimum with a pre observation intercomparison and careful maintenance during the observation period xu et al 2013 the energy balance closure ratio ebr for the ec flux matrix data was evaluated using the surface energy balance components ebr h l e r n g 0 foken et al 2010 where h and le are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively rn is the net radiation and g 0 is the surface soil heat flux the surface heat flux g 0 was calculated from the soil heat flux measurements at a depth of 0 06 m using the method proposed by liebethal et al 2005 and xu et al 2017c for the five ec sites in the intensive observation area the average ebr was 1 03 the lowest ebr 0 84 appeared in the bl the ebr values in the mf and cl were 1 06 and 1 12 respectively for the sl and pf the ebr was 1 08 inadequate spatial sampling of soil heat flux measurements in these sites may contribute to the energy imbalance as the spatial variation in the soil heat flux is significant under sparse or clumped vegetation covered sites agam et al 2012 furthermore the impact of wave phase difference in each surface energy balance component may be another reason contributing to the ebr larger than 1 gao et al 2010 2 2 2 las flux data processing and quality control the las system provided a measurement of the structure parameter for the refractive index of air c n 2 with an output period of 1 min initially the c n 2 data were checked rejecting the saturated cases when c

then the c n 2 was related to the structure parameter for temperature c t 2 wesely 1976 finally the sensible heat fluxes were iteratively calculated from the c t 2 based on the monin obukhov similarity theory most andreas 1988 kooijmans and hartogensis 2016 and the sign of the sensible heat flux directions was assigned by the gradient calculated from the two level air temperature measurements at heights of 10 and 28 m the parameters required in the las data processing such as the effective roughness length z 0 and zero plane displacement d were calculated according to eq 11 of chehbouni et al 2000b the estimated values of z 0 and d were 0 39 m and 2 78 m for las e 0 27 m and 2 07 m for las w the meteorological inputs including wind speed air temperature and pressure were obtained from the aws observations made at sl other required inputs such as air density and the bowen ratio were directly acquired from the ec measurements made at pf as for the ec systems quality control for the flux data from the two paths of lass was also performed the sensible heat flux from las e and las w was compared with that from the nearer ecs the las observed fluxes agreed well with the ec flux measurements made at pf and mf these findings are consistent with other studies in complex environments such as the litfass region germany beyrich et al 2002 meijninger et al 2006 the heihe river basin china liu et al 2011 the haihe river basin china jia et al 2012 and a suburban area of swindon uk ward et al 2015 in this study the sensible heat fluxes from las e and las w on six

detection and ranging data for the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve were acquired by an airborne lidar system lms q680i riegl austria on 29 july 2014 a high resolution land cover classification map see fig 1b derived from the lidar data was provided by su et al 2017 and had an overall accuracy of 95 and a kappa coefficient of 0 91 this key reserve area approximately 87 6 km2 has land cover that is 4 p euphratica 14 t chinensis 20 cropland and 62 barren land the lidar based land cover map was collected to support the aggregation of area averaged et over the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve in the oasis using the definiens ecognition software munich germany www ecognition com a 0 61 m resolution land cover map for the sidaoqiao intensive observation area was obtained from the quickbird imagery on 25 july 2012 with an overall accuracy of 84 and a kappa coefficient of 0 79 xu et al 2015 the producer s accuracy for p euphratica 85 and t chinensis 77 in this map was lower as compared to that of other land cover types 90 to obtain accurate land cover map the patches that misclassified on the map were distinguished and modified based on the field surveys the modified map is shown in fig 1c the quickbird based land cover map was used in footprint analysis of the ec and las sites for fluxes disaggregation and aggregation 2 2 4 remote sensing based evapotranspiration products the landsat based et products at a resolution of 30 m for the growing season in 2014 were provided by zhou et al 2017 the daily et was estimated based on the landsat images and the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land m sebal model for days without landsat images the daily et was interpolated using the reference evaporative fraction and reference et the estimated et was validated using ground observations from five sets of ec systems and was found to have a root mean square error rmse of 1 2 mm d 1 on satellite overpass days the remotely sensed daily et products at a resolution of 1 km for the growing season in 2014 were collected the et was estimated by using land surface temperatures from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and a dual temperature difference dtd model song et al 2018 the modis based dtd model implements the two source energy balance model tseb scheme song et al 2016a song et al 2016b the modis et was validated using measurements from several paths of lass and produced a rmse of 1 2 mm d 1 with the observations from both las e and las w for the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve 11 7 5 km2 the spatial averages of et from 25 july to 30 september obtained with m sebal and dtd models were 2 55 mm d 1 and 2 54 mm d 1 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 flux aggregation method it is generally accepted that the average flux in small scale patchy landscapes is an area weighted sum of the surface fluxes from individual landscape elements according to this concept the average flux for a specific area from a patchy landscape thus equals the area weighted sum of the surface fluxes from individual land cover classes within this area hutjes et al 2010 1 f k 1 n a k f k where f is the total flux of any scalar e g sensible and latent heat flux in our case for a specific area from a landscape a k is the fractional coverage of an individual land cover class k within this area f k is the specific flux from the individual land cover class k and n is the number of land cover classes distinguished in the patchy landscape there are two critical assumptions under eq 1 a the spatial organization of the patches constituting the landscape is irrelevant b the flux variability within each land cover class k is much smaller than the variability between different land cover classes the observed flux f obs x obs y obs z m can be closely related to the surface fluxes from upwind points f 0 x y 0 using the footprint function horst and weil 1992 leclerc and foken 2014 2 f obs x obs y obs z m 0 f 0 x y 0 f x obs x y obs y z m d x d y where x obs yobs are the coordinates of observation site z m is the effective observation height z m z d here z is the height of sensor d the zero plane displacement the footprint function f describes the contribution of the surface flux from upwind positions to the total flux according to hutjes et al 2010 eq 2 can be discretized for a uniform grid over a landscape as in a high resolution land cover classification map and it becomes 3 f obs k 1 n f k i 1 n j 1 m f ij δ x δ y where each pixel δ x δ y of the map is assumed to be homogeneous uniquely classified as belonging to land cover class k here the relative weight of land cover class k in the footprint ϕ fp k is defined 4 ϕ fp k i 1 n j 1 m f ij δ x δ y then the multi linear model for the measured flux is established 5 f obs k 1 n f k ϕ fp k under the assumption that each land cover class k in a specific area from a patchy landscape is with constant flux source strength f k the flux for a landscape area f is an area weighted aggregation of its various land cover classes as in eq 1 in the case when the specific area is spatially large and each land cover class is variable in the physical property e g size of the structure frequently irrigated or not the second assumption of eq 1 should be seriously considered before the surface heat fluxes aggregation the key point of the aggregation process is to obtain the flux values of each specific land covers according to eq 5 the observed flux f obs is a footprint weighted aggregation of specific flux from various land cover classes f k within the footprint area based on multi site tower flux measurements f obs m multiple linear regression equations with n unknown coefficients f k can be formulated through overlaying the tower flux footprints with a high resolution land cover map ϕ fp k the calculation of flux footprint will be described in the following section only when m n the regression coefficients estimates of disaggregated flux can be determined by the multiple linear regression method using the robustfit algorithm from the matlab statistical toolbox through minimizing the squared residuals and the standard error of each coefficient estimate also can be quantified however in most heterogeneous areas over the globe the flux tower is generally scarce over a limited spatial area m n and the acquisition of a high resolution land cover map is quite difficult in such circumstances the use of the multiple linear regression method is rather limited here the determination of f k is a process of disaggregating flux in a heterogeneous footprint area into individual land cover classes when getting the estimates of f k the area averaged flux at a landscape scale can be aggregated by eq 1 for each path of las the measured flux can be disaggregated into fluxes from individual land covers with footprint analysis eq 5 the las flux measurements can be taken as a reference to check the aggregation algorithm 3 2 footprint models the kljun s flux footprint prediction ffp model kljun et al 2015 is used for calculating the half hourly flux footprint of the ec measurements as it is not only ease of use but also is effective for a broad range of boundary layer conditions and for sufaces from smooth to rough kljun et al 2015 besides its footprint estimates agreed well with the calculations of the backward lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion model lpdm b kljun et al 2002 and other most commonly used footprint models such as the model of hsieh et al 2000 and kormann and meixner 2001 the footprint function f x y z m can be expressed in terms of a crosswind integrated footprint function f y x z m and a gaussian crosswind dispersion function d y horst and weil 1992 kljun et al 2015 used a novel scaling approach and an improved version of the footprint parameterization of kljun et al 2004 for the derivation of f y and d y for details on the paramerization of ffp and relevant parameters the reader is referred to kljun et al 2015 6 f x y z m f y x z m d y f y 1 2 π σ y exp y 2 2 σ y 2 the half hourly flux footprint of the las measurements f las was calculated by integrating the point footprint function f x y z m with the bell shaped path weighting function w x of the las meijninger et al 2002 the analytical footprint function proposed by horst and weil 1992 has been widely implemented in the scintillometer footprint analysis studies regarding suburban and complex environments e g ezzahar et al 2009b meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 the las footprint function is expressed as 7 f las x 2 x 1 w x f x x y y z ef d x where x 1 x 2 are the positions of las transmitter and receiver x y are the locations of points along the las path x y are the coordinates of each upwind point z ef is the effective height of las measurements defined as z ef z las d z las is the observation height of las for the calcuation of the daily averaged flux footprint of ec measurements the flux weighted footprint climatology was applied liu et al 2016 the expression equation of the flux weighted footprint climatology f c x y z m is 8 f c x y z m i n f i x y z m flux i i n flux i where i denotes the time step e g 30 min n is the total number of 30 min periods within the selected time frame flux i is the ec observed flux at the i time step the latent heat flux in this case and f i x y z m represents a corresponding half hourly footprint result that calculated with the ffp model the required inputs in the flux footprint calculation including measurement height wind direction wind speed at the measurement height friction velocity obukhov length and standard deviation of lateral velocity fluctuations were directly obtained from the corresponding ec measurements other parameters such as the roughness length and zero plane displacement were still estimated following the work of chehbouni et al 2000b for the calculation of ec footprints with ffp the values of the boundary layer height h for strongly stable conditions were obtained as the eq b4 in kljun et al 2015 while for unstable conditions h was set to 1500 m in this case the flux contribution of the source area was set to 90 for ec measurements at ss cl and bl while for flux measurements at mf pf and las 80 of the source area was set to limit the extent of footprint kim et al 2018 the normalized half hourly flux footprints of each ec and las were then estimated and the normalized daily averaged flux footprints of each ec were calculated by eq 8 these footprint results were separately superimposed on a land cover map to determine the relative contribution of each land cover class in the footprint to the total flux measured by ec and las 3 3 data processing flow for aggregation of area averaged evapotranspiration et the hiwater flux matrix in the ejina oasis with five ec sites and two paths of lass in a 3 3 km2 area provided a large number of flux measurements during the intensive observation period in 2014 high resolution satellite images and airborne remote sensing data were also acquired during this period and they were used for land cover classification the hiwater flux matrix dataset and high resolution land cover classification map provided a unique opportunity to establish an aggregation scheme for determining area averaged surface fluxes with footprint analysis and multiple linear regression the data processing flow of the aggregation of area averaged et mainly includes three steps in fig 2 firstly the half hourly flux footprints of five ec sites were overlaid with a 0 61 m land cover map to determine the relative weight of each land cover class in the footprint ϕ fp k eq 4 then according to eq 5 five multiple linear regression equations with four unknown coefficients f k were formulated based on the half hourly measurements of sensible heat flux from the five sets of ecs a multiple linear regression analysis was then performed to determine the regression coefficients which provided an estimate of the disaggregated sensible heat fluxes for four land cover classes p euphratica t chinensis cropland and barren land secondly every half hourly ec disaggregated sensible heat fluxes for all land cover classes were aggregated to area averages representative of the las source areas according to the relative weight of each land cover class in the las footprint eq 5 next the ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes were compared with the las measured fluxes to evaluate the aggregation results finally with the disaggregation and aggregation schemes that proposed and evaluated in the last two steps the daily et of various land cover classes and the area averaged et over the study area were estimated specifically speaking as in eq 5 based on the daily et measured by ec at five sites five multiple linear regression equations with four unknown coefficients were still formulated through overlaying the daily averaged flux footprints of all ec sites with the quickbird based land cover map the regression coefficients the disaggregated et values of four land covers were also determined by performing a multiple linear regression analysis finally the daily et of the barren land t chinensis p euphratica and cropland was estimated next with the support of the lidar based land cover map the ec disaggregated daily et of all land cover types was aggregated to an area average according to eq 1 hereafter the aggregated area averaged et was compared to the remote sensing et products 4 results and discussion 4 1 the characteristics of surface heat and water vapor fluxes over an oasis riparian forest ecosystem fig 3 depicts the diurnal variations in the net radiation latent and sensible heat flux and the bowen ratio β h le over five typical underlying surfaces in the ejina oasis during selected six clear days in august 2014 in fig 3 the net radiation at the cropland station cl was the lowest due to its higher albedo 0 27 as compared to that of the barrenland station bl 0 20 plastic mulch is usually used on the crop fields however this mulch would enforce the surface reflection and thus affect net radiation budget for cropland nevertheless the cl still showed higher latent heat flux with a maximum value up to 600 w m 2 and lower sensible heat flux below 70 w m 2 than other three vegetated surfaces because of its higher vegetation coverage and flood irrigation a phenomenon known as the oasis effect was observed in the cropland the latent heat flux was quite large and even exceeded the net radiation during the midday whilst the sensible heat flux was much small and became negative in the midafternoons 10 to 100 w m 2 as the energy from warm air was used in evapotranspiration ward 2017 this special phenomenon was distinctly observed in a desert oasis agroecosystem on clear days in summer wang 1999 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 the cropland thus exhibited a lower bowen ratio ranging between 0 3 and 0 4 fig 3d flux exchange characteristics for other three vegetation covered stations were comparatively small fig 3 the net radiation at the mixed forest station mf was relatively higher than that of the shrubland station sl mainly attributed to its lower albedo 0 15 compared to that of the sl 0 18 at the mf and sl the latent heat flux reached a maximum of 500 w m 2 in the afternoon while the sensible heat flux had a peak value of about 150 w m 2 their bowen ratio in the daytime was 0 26 on average in comparison with the mf the populus forest station pf showed a higher bowen ratio with an average value of 0 41 at the pf the sensible and latent heat flux had a maximum value of approximately 200 and 400 w m 2 respectively the net radiation at the pf with albedo of 0 16 was close to that of the bl but for the bl the latent heat flux was small maximum around 100 w m 2 and the sensible heat flux was the main term of its surface energy budget with maximum values exceeding 200 w m 2 fig 3c also illustrates the diurnal variation in the sensible heat flux derived from two paths of lass the sensible heat flux from the lass exhibited smoother diurnal cycles than that from the ecs as a result of its greater spatial averaging lagouarde et al 2006 furthermore differences in the sensible heat flux between las e and las w were observed particularly when wind direction became northwesterly fig 3e for las e the sensible heat flux reached a maximum approximately 150 w m 2 while for las w it had a maximum value of 100 w m 2 4 2 representativeness of the ec and las flux measurements footprint analyses for the five ec sites and two paths of lass in the intensive observation area were performed the spatial representativeness of the flux measurements from ec and las is presented in fig 4 the size and position of the source areas of the five sets ec measurements were significantly different due to differences in effective observation height and variations in wind speed and direction during a period from 4 to 9 august 2014 the source area of the las measurements was distributed along the optical path and its position changed with wind direction compared with ec the flux measurements from las are representative of a much larger and heterogeneous area the relative weight of all land cover classes in the ec and las footprint 70 flux contribution is listed in table 3 for cl and bl the dominant surface types in their source areas were cropland and barren land respectively for other three ec sites the relative contribution of vegetation within their footprint areas was changed slightly with variations of wind direction at the sl the relative contribution of t chinensis to the measured flux ranged from 0 92 to 0 62 and the barren land was from 0 08 to 0 38 when winds were southeasterly on 4 6 august the total contributions of p euphratica and t chinensis within the mf and pf footprint areas were 0 74 and 0 53 respectively while when the wind directions became northwesterly on 7 9 august their contributions to the measured flux were 0 81 for mf and 0 47 for pf during the period of 4 9 august the relative weight of vegetation in the las e footprint was about 0 6 while in the las w footprint it varied from 0 6 to 0 8 when wind directions became northwesterly this finding might to some extent explain the differences and variations in the measured fluxes between las e and las w it also indicates that a large proportion of vegetation contained in the las source area causes low sensible heat flux as more available energy is partitioned into latent heat flux than sensible heat flux similar findings have been reported at other stations in the arid area liu et al 2011 and semi arid area ezzahar et al 2009a as well as in urban environments ward et al 2015 the ec flux matrix measurements are representative of the dominant land cover types in the study area the las provides path averaged flux measurements representative of a relatively large and heterogeneous area the averaged flux that determined by weighting the upwind surface flux with flux footprint will be representative of the target area 4 3 assessment of the sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix the sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix measurements using the method described in section 3 1 were compared to the las flux observations as shown in fig 5 the variations of ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes with time were generally consistent with that of the las flux observations in comparison with the flux measurements from las e and las w fig 5a and b the ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes were higher by 27 w m 2 on average fig 6 presents a scatter plot of the 30 min ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes versus las flux measurements with different statistics listed in table 4 for las e fig 6a the sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix agreed well with those from the las with a high correlation and a low mbe value r2 0 85 mbe 14 w m 2 the rmse and mape values were 25 w m 2 and 22 respectively for las w fig 6b the ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes were slightly larger than the las flux observations a slope of 1 32 r2 0 78 with relatively higher rmse and mape values rmse 35 w m 2 mape 36 the flux uncertainties of las introduced by the choice of different similarity functions in its data processing have some influence on the comparison in this study the impact of choice of similarity functions can alter the sensible heat flux by about 10 11 data not shown this is similar to the results in a suburban area in swindon 13 14 ward et al 2014 and within the 10 15 range given by beyrich et al 2012 when calculating the sensible heat flux using the similarity functions of bruin et al 1993 the mape values for las e and las w would decrease by 8 and the rmse values would decrease by approximately 5 w m 2 for both las e and las w the correlation between ec aggregated and las observed fluxes was relatively high but slightly less satisfactory was the overestimation of aggregated fluxes at the noon time for these selected days part of the reason for this is methodological rather than having a physical basis hutjes et al 2010 the mean standard errors of the disaggregated flux estimates in the multiple linear regression varied between 30 and 60 w m 2 and their large uncertainties might lead to some bias towards the aggregated fluxes however this methodological bias might not fully explain the variations in the regression slope 1 16 and 1 32 a physical reason might be that the respective surface types and their specific flux were not as homogeneous as a priori assumed hutjes et al 2010 another reason might be attributed to the energy imbalance in the ec flux measurements such as for bl ebr 0 84 the energy from large eddies or secondary circulations induced by surface heterogeneity may not be capture by a single ec site but may be measured through the las foken 2008 foken et al 2010 xu et al 2017c the present flux aggregation method was also applied in a relatively homogeneous area of the midstream oasis of the hrb including a flux matrix with 17 ec sites and four paths of lass las1 las2 las3 and las4 see fig 1 of xu et al 2017a the ec and las1 data on five clear days in august 2012 were selected for detailed analysis note that the ec and las data were processed identically in these two study areas for las1 fig 5c the variations of ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes with time were in good agreement with that of the las observations as shown in fig 6c the aggregated sensible heat fluxes have a relatively higher correlation with the las1 observed fluxes r2 0 90 yielding a lower rmse rmse 10 w m 2 compared to that of las e and las w table 4 in comparison with the las observations the simple area weighted aggregation method showed larger rmse and mape values than the present aggregation method even for a relatively homogeneous landscape such as near the path of las1 table 4 while for a heterogeneous landscape the values of mbe rmse and mape would be much larger the mbe and rmse values increased by 66 81 and 62 78 w m 2 respectively and there was an increase of 60 94 in the mape the present aggregation method performs reasonably well in the integration of area averaged fluxes over a heterogeneous landscape its scheme for disaggregating heterogeneous fluxes into individual land cover types is effective and practical for use in a complex oasis landscape and its aggregation scheme has a feasible ability to upscale multi site tower flux measurements to an area average representative of a scintillometer source area 4 4 determination of area averaged evapotranspiration et the disaggregation scheme as evaluated in section 4 3 was applied to obtain the daily et of each land cover class barren land t chinensis p euphratica and cropland in the study area fig 7 gives the temporal variation in daily et of four land cover classes during the period from 25 july to 30 september 2014 the daily et of each land cover class varied significantly during the 68 days growing period mainly related to the meteorological conditions and plant growth statuses the et increased greatly with rapid plant growth and then declined gradually as the plant began to go through leaf senescence scarce precipitation 0 6 mm has seldom contribution to the plant growth in this oasis because it often evaporates completely before infiltrating into the soil in the extremely arid region chen et al 2003 the daily et of barren land was about 2 mm during the plant growth period while the p euphratica t chinensis and cropland showed much larger et values the daily et was almost the same for the t chinensis and cropland by august with values ranging between 3 and 8 mm the maximum et values of the t chinensis shrubland measured using the bowen ratio energy balance method was about 7 mm d 1 si et al 2005a differences in et over the t chinensis shrublands in this oasis are attributed to the climatic and hydrological conditions the vegetation structure parameters and the measurement methods the et of the p euphratica was a little higher with values in the range of 6 12 mm d 1 this value is within the range of reference et of the p euphratica forest in this oasis 10 mm d 1 hou et al 2010 in the ejina oasis more than 90 of transpired water from the p euphratica trees originates from the groundwater of depth between 2 and 2 5 m zhu et al 2009 the average groundwater depth at the study area in 2014 ranged between 2 and 3 m during the growing season within the optimal depth 3 5 m for the survival of the p euphratica jin et al 2011 si et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 this finding showed that the groundwater table at this area was high enough to provide sufficient water for the natural growth of the p euphratica forest fig 8 illustrates the temporal variation in the area averaged daily et over the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve and the observations of groundwater depth at the intensive observation area there was significant variation in the area averaged et aggregated from the ec flux matrix measurements with values ranging from 1 to 5 mm d 1 the day to day fluctuations in area averaged et over this key area was closely associated with variations in meteorological conditions and the plant growth statuses the daily et reached its maximum in july and mid august and then gradually declined as the plant began to undergo senescence the shallow groundwater table at this area gradually decreased during the plant growing period until the groundwater was replenished by surface water from the heihe river in mid september the result indicated that a gradual decline in the groundwater table occurred in response to the riparian vegetation uptake of groundwater through evapotranspiration this result agrees with other findings in the ejina oasis reported by wang et al 2014 during this 68 days the total et was approximately 171 mm at the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve in this oasis the ec aggregated et over this key area was compared to the remote sensing et products as shown in fig 8 the spatial averages of remotely sensed et showed a similar decline trend to the aggregation results during these 68 days the spatial average differences between the aggregated et and landsat modis et were rather small compared with the ec aggregated et values the landsat et in july and august generally gave relatively higher estimates and then had lower values in september by contrast the modis et showed significantly opposite differences 5 conclusions for the surfaces covered with the t chinensis shrubland mixed forest sparse p euphratica forest and cropland in the ejina oasis the latent heat flux is the main term of the surface energy budget during the plant growing period and a special phenomenon known as oasis effect was observed at the cropland the observed differences in the partitioning of available energy between different surface types in the oasis are closely related to the vegetation coverage in comparison with the las flux observations the new flux aggregation method for determining area averaged flux gave reasonable estimates of the sensible heat flux with an mape value of around 20 30 compared with the rather simple area weighted method the new aggregation method performs reasonably well in the integration of area averaged fluxes over a heterogeneous landscape the combination of its disaggregation and aggregation schemes has the ability to upscale multi site tower flux measurements to a larger area such as the scintillometer source area or an oasis landscape the daily et of various land cover classes in the ejina oasis was successfully estimated from the ec flux matrix using the established disaggregation scheme temporal trend was distinctly revealed by the long duration of et estimates during the period of 25 july 30 september 2014 the p euphratica exhibited higher et values 6 12 mm d 1 as the groundwater supplied sufficient water for its natural growth the daily et of the t chinensis and cropland ranged from 3 to 8 mm et from barren land was about 2 mm d 1 the area averaged et over the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve ranged between 1 and 5 mm d 1 for the 68 days growing period in 2014 the new flux aggregation method can be considered a simple and reliable technique for estimating area averaged et over a heterogeneous landscape after further evaluation with directly observed et its et estimates can be feasibly used for the validation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models furthermore this work will be extended to the water balance study of the whole heihe river basin which is essential for hydrological modeling and basin water resources management 6 data availability the meteorological data and the flux

6327,the determination of area averaged evapotranspiration et over a heterogeneous land surface at the satellite pixel scale model grid scale 103 104 m is crucial to the evaluation of the remote sensing et products and development of the parameterization schemes of general hydro meteorological models the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater flux matrix of multi site eddy covariance ec and large aperture scintillometers lass provided an unprecedented opportunity to establish an aggregation scheme for determining area averaged surface fluxes based on the hiwater flux matrix datasets and high resolution land cover map a new flux aggregation method was developed by using footprint analysis and multiple linear regression the area averaged sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the multi site ec flux measurements using the developed method were compared with the las measured fluxes the results showed that the new method produced reasonable estimates of

high resolution land cover map ejina oasis 1 introduction many inland river basins in arid and semiarid regions are suffering from the collapse of water system and ecology because of water scarcity rapid population growth and economic development and overexploitation of water resources cheng et al 2014 li et al 2018a these inland river basins are thus confronting great challenges in terms of water resource management particularly coordinating water uses between economic development and ecosystem restoration cheng 2002 cheng et al 2014 hochmuth et al 2015 land surface evapotranspiration et is not only a key component in the basin scale water balance but also is essential in the surface energy balance et transfers a large amount of water from the soil and vegetation into the atmosphere anderson et al 2012 accurate quantification of the et over large areas is vital to the management of water resources particularly in areas of water scarcity allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2012 wang et al 2003 the heihe river basin hrb is a typical inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china and covers an area of approximately 1 432 000 km2 li et al 2013 the landscape of the basin changes from glaciers and alpine biomes in upstream area to steppes and agricultural ecosystems in the midstream area to riparian ecosystems surrounded by vast areas of desert in the downstream area li et al 2018a because of dramatic increase in water consumption in the up and midstream areas the amount of water entering the downstream areas decreased significantly from the 1950s to 2000 leading to the drying up of two terminal lakes the sogo nuur and gaxun nuur and the death of riparian populus euphratica forests cheng et al 2014 yu and wang 2012 zhong et al 2002 to restore the deteriorated ecosystems an ecological water diversion project ewdp was implemented in 2000 since the water reallocation the dried up sogo nuur has been recharged with water since 2002 niu et al 2011 xi et al 2007 xiao et al 2016 consequently the populus euphratica forests and desert shrubland have also been restored to some degree hu et al 2015 nian et al 2017 si et al 2005b xi et al 2013 however the area of cropland in the ejina oasis has also expanded extensively resulting in the overextraction of groundwater and illegal use of surface water hu et al 2015 to allocate the limited water resources reasonably for ecosystem rehabilitation and not illegal reclamation of new cropland accurate estimation of et in the oasis ecosystem is fundamentally important cheng et al 2014 currently methods commonly used for acquiring et include ground based observation remote sensing based estimation and land surface process model simulation since the 1970s the remote sensing based approaches for et estimation have become an effective way to estimate et at a regional scale allen et al 2007 anderson et al 1997 bastiaanssen et al 1998 liu et al 2016 norman et al 2000 su 2002 nevertheless given the uncertainties in input parameters and parameterization schemes the performance of relevant remote sensing models must be evaluated using ground measurements to provide accurate et estimate wang et al 2003 however there may be a bias in directly comparing et estimates with in situ flux observations due to their spatial scale mismatch and spatial heterogeneity at the satellite sub pixel scale jia et al 2012 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2017b for general hydro meteorological models grid resolution of approximately 104 m the development and validation of the parameterization schemes is usually based on measurements performed over homogeneous land surfaces at the scale of 10 103 m while the assumption of homogeneity is often violated at the scale of model grid resolution beyrich et al 2006 beyrich and mengelkamp 2006 chehbouni et al 2000a methods are therefore required to quantify fluxes at the scale of a satellite pixel and a model grid 103 104 m for the validation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models until now the eddy covariance ec method is the most widely accepted technique for directly measuring surface fluxes on the scale of 100 103 m aubinet et al 1999 baldocchi et al 2001 in heterogeneous landscapes a network of ec systems ecs is often deployed over a variety of representative surface types ezzahar et al 2009b furthermore the multi site tower flux measurements can provide meaningful area averaged fluxes if special flux aggregation schemes are applied andré et al 1986 beyrich et al 2006 mahrt et al 2001 the large aperture scintillometer las is another promising technique for providing path averaged fluxes on a much larger scale of 1 5 km particularly in heterogeneous landscapes that would be impracticable to monitor using ec beyrich et al 2012 bruin et al 1995 chehbouni et al 2000b ezzahar et al 2009b meijninger et al 2006 meijninger et al 2002 ward 2017 in recent decades a large number of international field experiments have been conducted in heterogeneous landscapes in different geographical and climatic regions of the earth such as hapex mobilhy andré et al 1986 fife sellers et al 1988 hapex sahel goutorbe et al 1994 boreas sellers et al 1995 nopex halldin et al 1998 litfass 2003 mengelkamp et al 2006 and hiwater li et al 2013 in these experiments the turbulent fluxes at the satellite pixel scale model grid scale determined from multi site flux measurements using various flux aggregation methods were compared with those from scintillometers and aircraft observations as well as remote sensing models the results of these studies showed that the combination of flux measurements from multi site ec and areal fluxes from scintillometers and aircraft observations can provide reasonable area averaged fluxes beyrich et al 2006 liu et al 2016 mahrt et al 2001 meijninger et al 2006 the commonly used flux aggregation methods include the arithmetic average method shuttleworth 1991 and the area weighted method chehbouni et al 2000a mahrt et al 2001 liu et al 2016 and li et al 2018b recently reported that the arithmetic average and area weighted methods can provide accurate average et estimates at homogeneous observation sites but cannot achieve satisfactory et results over heterogeneous land surfaces footprint analysis is an essential approach for interpreting the flux tower measurements over a heterogeneous land surface horst and weil 1992 kljun et al 2015 schmid 2002 the development of footprint models provides diagnostic tools to quantify the representativeness of flux measurements for the selected sites kim et al 2006 kim et al 2018 sutherland et al 2014 besides footprint climatology accumulations of footprints over days in conjunction with a satellite based land cover map is a practical approach to characterize the spatial variation of landscapes within the footprint area chen et al 2008 chen et al 2012 kim et al 2018 sutherland et al 2014 through using footprint analysis substantial effort has been made to relate the aircraft flux measurements to land covers within its footprint area hutjes et al 2010 kirby et al 2008 ogunjemiyo et al 2003 among these works a method to disaggregate aircraft flux measurements from a landscape into the component fluxes from various land cover classes making up that landscape was proposed by using footprint analysis and multiple linear regression hutjes et al 2010 according to its theoretical framework xu et al 2017a developed and tested its disaggregation scheme for the tower flux measurements based on observations from 17 sets of ecs and four paths of lass in an oasis agricultural landscape the results demonstrated that the disaggregation scheme developed for tower flux measurements is feasible to disentangle ec observed fluxes over a heterogeneous area into individual fluxes from various land cover classes within that area and the ec disaggregated individual fluxes can be aggregated again to larger areas the developed schemes achieve to aggregate multi site ec flux observations to the satellite pixel model grid scale compared with the simple arithmetic average and area weighted methods the developed method not only has a better database but also has a solid grounding in physics and mathematics in determining area averaged fluxes over a heterogeneous surface the primary objective of this study was to estimate area averaged et over an oasis riparian forest landscape with footprint analysis and high resolution land cover map based on the flux observations from multi site ec and las and land cover map deriving from high resolution remote sensing data this study 1 analyzed the spatial representativeness of the ec and las flux measurements 2 evaluated the area averaged sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix measurements with the las flux observations and 3 estimated the daily et of each land cover class and the area averaged et in a riparian forest ecosystem 2 study

arid region with precipitation of less than 50 mm per year and potential evaporation measured by pan of approximately 3755 mm per year 1990 2010 li et al 2013 the water resources of the oasis depend greatly on the surface water from the heihe river and the groundwater li et al 2018a the natural vegetation distributed along the oasis riverside is dominated by the populus euphratica p euphratica forest and the associated tamarix chinensis t chinensis shrub their natural growth relies on regular flood irrigation of the river water and sufficient water supply of the groundwater the p euphratica tree in this oasis usually leafs out in early may and its leaf area increases rapidly within a week and reaches a maximum value from july through august while in september the leaves go through senescence and subsequent fall stage yu 2013 for the t chinensis the leaves sprout starting at late april go into senescent stage in mid september and wither gradually the dominant agricultural crop in this oasis is the hami melon a type of muskmelon originally from xinjiang china which usually starts planting in mid june local farmers usually use plastic mulch on the plowed crop field to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil evaporation the hami melon grows rapidly by early july reaches its maximum height of 0 4 m within one month and is harvested at the end of september the crop field is relatively wet because of regular irrigations with groundwater there are usually three rounds of heavy irrigation over the field during the crop growing period starting on 17 july 2 august and 18 august in 2014 and each round of irrigation lasts for about a week the irrigated water is mainly evaporated into the atmosphere from the soil and plant and thus it is important to accurately estimate water losses in terms of et the region from erdaoqiao bridge 2 to qidaoqiao bridge 7 in the oasis is known as the core area of the p euphratica forest reserve a key area in this reserve approximately 11 7 5 km2 centered at about 101 09 00 e 41 59 24 n was selected for the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater li et al 2013 hrb downstream investigation fig 1b the intensive observation area of the hiwater was located in the sidaoqiao bridge 4 p euphratica forest reserve fig 1c an area of 3 3 km2 with land covers mostly the t chinensis shrub 38 the p euphratica forest 13 and barren land 39 as well as small areas of cropland 7 and grass 3 five observation sites were set up according to the dominant land cover types each site was equipped with an ec system and an automatic weather station aws to observe the exchange process of surface energy flux in addition two paths of lass las e and las w were installed parallel to measure the area averaged sensible heat fluxes over a riparian forest landscape spatial distribution of the ec and las sites is presented in fig 1c details of the ec and las systems in the flux matrix are given in tables 1 and

2014 at each observation station three soil heat flux plates were placed below the four component radiometer sensor and buried at 0 06 m depth to measure soil heat flux the canopy transpiration of p euphratica was measured by using three groups of thermal dissipation sap flow probes tdps fig 1c nine representative trees in the vicinity of the sl mf and pf were selected with diameters ranging between 33 8 and 51 cm at breast height qiao et al 2015 in june 2014 five 6 m deep groundwater monitoring wells were dug nearby the observation stations as shown by the numbers from 1 to 5 in fig 1c each of these wells was equipped with a hobo water level logger u20 001 04 onset usa for monitoring the long term variation in shallow groundwater depth at this observation area 2 2 data processing and quality control all observations described above during the period from mid may to october 2014 were selected for the following analysis ten minute aws data were averaged to half hour periods ec and las raw data were processed to ensure the high quality flux evaluation detailed below 2 2 1 ec flux data processing and quality control the 10 hz raw ec data were processed using the eddypro software lincoln nebraska usa advanced processing included corrections for coordinate rotation 2 d rotation webb pearman leuning wpl webb et al 1980 spectral losses moncrieff et al 2005 moncrieff et al 1997 quality check for the every 30 min turbulent fluxes was performed using a flagging scheme with three different levels 0 1 and 2 mauder and foken 2015 further details on ec data processing can be found in wang et al 2015 and xu et al 2013 the flux data of flags 0 and 1 were used in the latter analysis flux data of flag 2 were discarded and the 30 min flux data within 1 h of precipitation were also rejected to calculate the cumulative daily et the missing data in the 30 min latent heat flux series were interpolated using a simple gap filling method of a regression between the latent heat flux and net radiation for the five ec systems used in the data analysis the systematic errors have been tried to reduce to a minimum with a pre observation intercomparison and careful maintenance during the observation period xu et al 2013 the energy balance closure ratio ebr for the ec flux matrix data was evaluated using the surface energy balance components ebr h l e r n g 0 foken et al 2010 where h and le are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively rn is the net radiation and g 0 is the surface soil heat flux the surface heat flux g 0 was calculated from the soil heat flux measurements at a depth of 0 06 m using the method proposed by liebethal et al 2005 and xu et al 2017c for the five ec sites in the intensive observation area the average ebr was 1 03 the lowest ebr 0 84 appeared in the bl the ebr values in the mf and cl were 1 06 and 1 12 respectively for the sl and pf the ebr was 1 08 inadequate spatial sampling of soil heat flux measurements in these sites may contribute to the energy imbalance as the spatial variation in the soil heat flux is significant under sparse or clumped vegetation covered sites agam et al 2012 furthermore the impact of wave phase difference in each surface energy balance component may be another reason contributing to the ebr larger than 1 gao et al 2010 2 2 2 las flux data processing and quality control the las system provided a measurement of the structure parameter for the refractive index of air c n 2 with an output period of 1 min initially the c n 2 data were checked rejecting the saturated cases when c n 2 0 193 r 8 3 λ 1 3 d 5 3 ochs and wilson 1993 where r is the path length m d the optical aperture m and λ the wavelength nm those data that passed the screening were averaged to half hour periods then the c n 2 was related to the structure parameter for temperature c t 2 wesely 1976 finally the sensible heat fluxes were iteratively calculated from the c t 2 based on the monin obukhov similarity theory most andreas 1988 kooijmans and hartogensis 2016 and the sign of the sensible heat flux directions was assigned by the gradient calculated from the two level air temperature measurements at heights of 10 and 28 m the parameters required in the las data processing such as the effective roughness length z 0 and zero plane displacement d were calculated according to eq 11 of chehbouni et al 2000b the estimated values of z 0 and d were 0 39 m and 2 78 m for las e 0 27 m and 2 07 m for las w the meteorological inputs including wind speed air temperature and pressure were obtained from the aws observations made at sl other required inputs such as air density and the bowen ratio were directly acquired from the ec measurements made at pf as for the ec systems quality control for the flux data from the two paths of lass was also performed the sensible heat flux from las e and las w was compared with that from the nearer ecs the las observed fluxes agreed well with the ec flux measurements made at pf and mf these findings are consistent with other studies in complex environments such as the litfass region germany beyrich et al 2002 meijninger et al 2006 the heihe river basin china liu et al 2011 the haihe river basin china jia et al 2012 and a suburban area of swindon uk ward et al 2015 in this study the sensible heat fluxes from las e and las w on six clear days 4 9 august 2014 were selected for assessing the estimates of sensible heat flux from the flux aggregation method the las flux measurements under unstable conditions 8 30 17 30 bst beijing standard time the time difference between local time and bst is 1 h 16 min were actually used in this assessment 2 2 3 high resolution land cover map derived from remote sensing images lidar light detection and ranging data for the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve were acquired by an airborne lidar system lms q680i riegl austria on 29 july 2014 a high resolution land cover classification map see fig 1b derived from the lidar data was provided by su et al 2017 and had an overall accuracy of 95 and a kappa coefficient of 0 91 this key reserve area approximately 87 6 km2 has land cover that is 4 p euphratica 14 t chinensis 20 cropland and 62 barren land the lidar based land cover map was collected to support the aggregation of area averaged et over the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve in the oasis using the definiens ecognition software munich germany www ecognition com a 0 61 m resolution land cover map for the sidaoqiao intensive observation area was obtained from the quickbird imagery on 25 july 2012 with an overall accuracy of 84 and a kappa coefficient of 0 79 xu et al 2015 the producer s accuracy for p euphratica 85 and t chinensis 77 in this map was lower as compared to that of other land cover types 90 to obtain accurate land cover map the patches that misclassified on the map were distinguished and modified based on the field surveys the modified map is shown in fig 1c the quickbird based land cover map was used in footprint analysis of the ec and las sites for fluxes disaggregation and aggregation 2 2 4 remote sensing based evapotranspiration products the landsat based et products at a resolution of 30 m for the growing season in 2014 were provided by zhou et al 2017 the daily et was estimated based on the landsat images and the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land m sebal model for days without landsat images the daily et was interpolated using the reference evaporative fraction and reference et the estimated et was validated using ground observations from five sets of ec systems and was found to have a root mean square error rmse of 1 2 mm d 1 on satellite overpass days the remotely sensed daily et products at a resolution of 1 km for the growing season in 2014 were collected the et was estimated by using land surface temperatures from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and a dual temperature difference dtd model song et al 2018 the modis based dtd model implements the two source energy balance model tseb scheme song et al 2016a song et al 2016b the modis et was validated using measurements from several paths of lass and produced a rmse of 1 2 mm d 1 with the observations from both las e and las w for the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve 11 7 5 km2 the spatial averages of et from 25 july to 30 september obtained with m sebal and dtd models were 2 55 mm d 1 and 2 54 mm d 1 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 flux aggregation method it is generally accepted that the average flux in small scale patchy landscapes is an area weighted sum of the surface fluxes from individual landscape elements according to this concept the average flux for a specific area from a patchy landscape thus equals the area weighted sum of the surface fluxes from individual land cover classes within this area hutjes et al 2010 1 f k 1 n a k f k where f is the total flux of any scalar e g sensible and latent heat flux in our case for a specific area from a landscape a k is the fractional coverage of an individual land cover class k within this area f k is the specific flux from the individual land cover class k and n is the number of land cover classes distinguished in the patchy landscape there are two critical assumptions under eq 1 a the spatial organization of the patches constituting the landscape is irrelevant b the flux variability within each land cover class k is much smaller than the variability between different land cover classes the observed flux f obs x obs y obs z m can be closely related to the surface fluxes from upwind points f 0 x y 0 using the footprint function horst and weil 1992 leclerc and foken 2014 2 f obs x obs y obs z m 0 f 0 x y 0 f x obs x y obs y z m d x d y where x obs yobs are the coordinates of observation site z m is the effective observation height z m z d here z is the height of sensor d the zero plane displacement the footprint function f describes the contribution of the surface flux from upwind positions to the total flux according to hutjes et al 2010 eq 2 can be discretized for a uniform grid over a landscape as in a high resolution land cover classification map and it becomes 3 f obs k 1 n f k i 1 n j 1 m f ij δ x δ y where each pixel δ x δ y of the map is assumed to be homogeneous uniquely classified as belonging to land cover class k here the relative weight of land cover class k in the footprint ϕ fp k is defined 4 ϕ fp k i 1 n j 1 m f ij δ x δ y then the multi linear model for the measured flux is established 5 f obs k 1 n f k ϕ fp k under the assumption that each land cover class k in a specific area from a patchy landscape is with constant flux source strength f k the flux for a landscape area f is an area weighted aggregation of its various land cover classes as in eq 1 in the case when the specific area is spatially large and each land cover class is variable in the physical property e g size of the structure frequently irrigated or not the second assumption of eq 1 should be seriously considered before the surface heat fluxes aggregation the key point of the aggregation process is to obtain the flux values of each specific land covers according to eq 5 the observed flux f obs is a footprint weighted aggregation of specific flux from various land cover classes f k within the footprint area based on multi site tower flux measurements f obs m multiple linear regression equations with n unknown coefficients f k can be formulated through overlaying the tower flux footprints with a high resolution land cover map ϕ fp k the calculation of flux footprint will be described in the following section only when m n the regression coefficients estimates of disaggregated flux can be determined by the multiple linear regression method using the robustfit algorithm from the matlab statistical toolbox through minimizing the squared residuals and the standard error of each coefficient estimate also can be quantified however in most heterogeneous areas over the globe the flux tower is generally scarce over a limited spatial area m n and the acquisition of a high resolution land cover map is quite difficult in such circumstances the use of the multiple linear regression method is rather limited here the determination of f k is a process of disaggregating flux in a heterogeneous footprint area into individual land cover classes when getting the estimates of f k the area averaged flux at a landscape scale can be aggregated by eq 1 for each path of las the measured flux can be disaggregated into fluxes from individual land covers with footprint analysis eq 5 the las flux measurements can be taken as a reference to check the aggregation algorithm 3 2 footprint models the kljun s flux footprint prediction ffp model kljun et al 2015 is used for calculating the half hourly flux footprint of the ec measurements as it is not only ease of use but also is effective for a broad range of boundary layer conditions and for sufaces from smooth to rough kljun et al 2015 besides its footprint estimates agreed well with the calculations of the backward lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion model lpdm b kljun et al 2002 and other most commonly used footprint models such as the model of hsieh et al 2000 and kormann and meixner 2001 the footprint function f x y z m can be expressed in terms of a crosswind integrated footprint function f y x z m and a gaussian crosswind dispersion function d y horst and weil 1992 kljun et al 2015 used a novel scaling approach and an improved version of the footprint parameterization of kljun et al 2004 for the derivation of f y and d y for details on the paramerization of ffp and relevant parameters the reader is referred to kljun et al 2015 6 f x y z m f y x z m d y f y 1 2 π σ y exp y 2 2 σ y 2 the half hourly flux footprint of the las measurements f las was calculated by integrating the point footprint function f x y z m with the bell shaped path weighting function w x of the las meijninger et al 2002 the analytical footprint function proposed by horst and weil 1992 has been widely implemented in the scintillometer footprint analysis studies regarding suburban and complex environments e g ezzahar et al 2009b meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 the las footprint function is expressed as 7 f las x 2 x 1 w x f x x y y z ef d x where x 1 x 2 are the positions of las transmitter and receiver x y are the locations of points along the las path x y are the coordinates of each upwind point z ef is the effective height of las measurements defined as z ef z las d z las is the observation height of las for the calcuation of the daily averaged flux footprint of ec measurements the flux weighted footprint climatology was applied liu et al 2016 the expression equation of the flux weighted footprint climatology f c x y z m is 8 f c x y z m i n f i x y z m flux i i n flux i where i denotes the time step e g 30 min n is the total number of 30 min periods within the selected time frame flux i is the ec observed flux at the i time step the latent heat flux in this case and f i x y z m represents a corresponding half hourly footprint result that calculated with the ffp model the required inputs in the flux footprint calculation including measurement height wind direction wind speed at the measurement height friction velocity obukhov length and standard deviation of lateral velocity fluctuations were directly obtained from the corresponding ec measurements other parameters such as the roughness length and zero plane displacement were still estimated following the work of chehbouni et al 2000b for the calculation of ec footprints with ffp the values of the boundary layer height h for strongly stable conditions were obtained as the eq b4 in kljun et al 2015 while for unstable conditions h was set to 1500 m in this case the flux contribution of the source area was set to 90 for ec measurements at ss cl and bl while for flux measurements at mf pf and las 80 of the source area was set to limit the extent of footprint kim et al 2018 the normalized half hourly flux footprints of each ec and las were then estimated and the normalized daily averaged flux footprints of each ec were calculated by eq 8 these footprint results were separately superimposed on a land cover map to determine the relative contribution of each land cover class in the footprint to the total flux measured by ec and las 3 3 data processing flow for aggregation of area averaged evapotranspiration et the hiwater flux matrix in the ejina oasis with five ec sites and two paths of lass in a 3 3 km2 area provided a large number of flux measurements during the intensive observation period in 2014 high resolution satellite images and airborne remote sensing data were also acquired during this period and they were used for land cover classification the hiwater flux matrix dataset and high resolution land cover classification map provided a unique opportunity to establish an aggregation scheme for determining area averaged surface fluxes with footprint analysis and multiple linear regression the data processing flow of the aggregation of area averaged et mainly includes three steps in fig 2 firstly the half hourly flux footprints of five ec sites were overlaid with a 0 61 m land cover map to determine the relative weight of each land cover class in the footprint ϕ fp k eq 4 then according to eq 5 five multiple linear regression equations with four unknown coefficients f k were formulated based on the half hourly measurements of sensible heat flux from the five sets of ecs a multiple linear regression analysis was then performed to determine the regression coefficients which provided an estimate of the disaggregated sensible heat fluxes for four land cover classes p euphratica t chinensis cropland and barren land secondly every half hourly ec disaggregated sensible heat fluxes for all land cover classes were aggregated to area averages representative of the las source areas according to the relative weight of each land cover class in the las footprint eq 5 next the ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes were compared with the las measured fluxes to evaluate the aggregation results finally with the disaggregation and aggregation schemes that proposed and evaluated in the last two steps the daily et of various land cover classes and the area averaged et over the study area were estimated specifically speaking as in eq 5 based on the daily et measured by ec at five sites five multiple linear regression equations with four unknown coefficients were still formulated through overlaying the daily averaged flux footprints of all ec sites with the quickbird based land cover map the regression coefficients the disaggregated et values of four land covers were also determined by performing a multiple linear regression analysis finally the daily et of the barren land t chinensis p euphratica and cropland was estimated next with the support of the lidar based land cover map the ec disaggregated daily et of all land cover types was aggregated to an area average according to eq 1 hereafter the aggregated area averaged et was compared to the remote sensing et products 4 results and discussion 4 1 the characteristics of surface heat and water vapor fluxes over an oasis riparian forest ecosystem fig 3 depicts the diurnal variations in the net radiation latent and sensible heat flux and the bowen ratio β h le over five typical underlying surfaces in the ejina oasis during selected six clear days in august 2014 in fig 3 the net radiation at the cropland station cl was the lowest due to its higher albedo 0 27 as compared to that of the barrenland station bl 0 20 plastic mulch is usually used on the crop fields however this mulch would enforce the surface reflection and thus affect net radiation budget for cropland nevertheless the cl still showed higher latent heat flux with a maximum value up to 600 w m 2 and lower sensible heat flux below 70 w m 2 than other three vegetated surfaces because of its higher vegetation coverage and flood irrigation a phenomenon known as the oasis effect was observed in the cropland the latent heat flux was quite large and even exceeded the net radiation during the midday whilst the sensible heat flux was much small and became negative in the midafternoons 10 to 100 w m 2 as the energy from warm air was used in evapotranspiration ward 2017 this special phenomenon was distinctly observed in a desert oasis agroecosystem on clear days in summer wang 1999 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 the cropland thus exhibited a lower bowen ratio ranging between 0 3 and 0 4 fig 3d flux exchange characteristics for other three vegetation covered stations were comparatively small fig 3 the net radiation at the mixed forest station mf was relatively higher than that of the shrubland station sl mainly attributed to its lower albedo 0 15 compared to that of the sl 0 18 at the mf and sl the latent heat flux reached a maximum of 500 w m 2 in the afternoon while the sensible heat flux had a peak value of about 150 w m 2 their bowen ratio in the daytime was 0 26 on average in comparison with the mf the populus forest station pf showed a higher bowen ratio with an average value of 0 41 at the pf the sensible and latent heat flux had a maximum value of approximately 200 and 400 w m 2 respectively the net radiation at the pf with albedo of 0 16 was close to that of the bl but for the bl the latent heat flux was small maximum around 100 w m 2 and the sensible heat flux was the main term of its surface energy budget with maximum values exceeding 200 w m 2 fig 3c also illustrates the diurnal variation in the sensible heat flux derived from two paths of lass the sensible heat flux from the lass exhibited smoother diurnal cycles than that from the ecs as a result of its greater spatial averaging lagouarde et al 2006 furthermore differences in the sensible heat flux between las e and las w were observed particularly when wind direction became northwesterly fig 3e for las e the sensible heat flux reached a maximum approximately 150 w m 2 while for las w it had a maximum value of 100 w m 2 4 2 representativeness of the ec and las flux measurements footprint analyses for the five ec sites and two paths of lass in the intensive observation area were performed the spatial representativeness of the flux measurements from ec and las is presented in fig 4 the size and position of the source areas of the five sets ec measurements were significantly different due to differences in effective observation height and variations in wind speed and direction during a period from 4 to 9 august 2014 the source area of the las measurements was distributed along the optical path and its position changed with wind direction compared with ec the flux measurements from las are representative of a much larger and heterogeneous area the relative weight of all land cover classes in the ec and las footprint 70 flux contribution is listed in table 3 for cl and bl the dominant surface types in their source areas were cropland and barren land respectively for other three ec sites the relative contribution of vegetation within their footprint areas was changed slightly with variations of wind direction at the sl the relative contribution of t chinensis to the measured flux ranged from 0 92 to 0 62 and the barren land was from 0 08 to 0 38 when winds were southeasterly on 4 6 august the total contributions of p euphratica and t chinensis within the mf and pf footprint areas were 0 74 and 0 53 respectively while when the wind directions became northwesterly on 7 9 august their contributions to the measured flux were 0 81 for mf and 0 47 for pf during the period of 4 9 august the relative weight of vegetation in the las e footprint was about 0 6 while in the las w footprint it varied from 0 6 to 0 8 when wind directions became northwesterly this finding might to some extent explain the differences and variations in the measured fluxes between las e and las w it also indicates that a large proportion of vegetation contained in the las source area causes low sensible heat flux as more available energy is partitioned into latent heat flux than sensible heat flux similar findings have been reported at other stations in the arid area liu et al 2011 and semi arid area ezzahar et al 2009a as well as in urban environments ward et al 2015 the ec flux matrix measurements are representative of the dominant land cover types in the study area the las provides path averaged flux measurements representative of a relatively large and heterogeneous area the averaged flux that determined by weighting the upwind surface flux with flux footprint will be representative of the target area 4 3 assessment of the sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix the sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix measurements using the method described in section 3 1 were compared to the las flux observations as shown in fig 5 the variations of ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes with time were generally consistent with that of the las flux observations in comparison with the flux measurements from las e and las w fig 5a and b the ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes were higher by 27 w m 2 on average fig 6 presents a scatter plot of the 30 min ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes versus las flux measurements with different statistics listed in table 4 for las e fig 6a the sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the ec flux matrix agreed well with those from the las with a high correlation and a low mbe value r2 0 85 mbe 14 w m 2 the rmse and mape values were 25 w m 2 and 22 respectively for las w fig 6b the ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes were slightly larger than the las flux observations a slope of 1 32 r2 0 78 with relatively higher rmse and mape values rmse 35 w m 2 mape 36 the flux uncertainties of las introduced by the choice of different similarity functions in its data processing have some influence on the comparison in this study the impact of choice of similarity functions can alter the sensible heat flux by about 10 11 data not shown this is similar to the results in a suburban area in swindon 13 14 ward et al 2014 and within the 10 15 range given by beyrich et al 2012 when calculating the sensible heat flux using the similarity functions of bruin et al 1993 the mape values for las e and las w would decrease by 8 and the rmse values would decrease by approximately 5 w m 2 for both las e and las w the correlation between ec aggregated and las observed fluxes was relatively high but slightly less satisfactory was the overestimation of aggregated fluxes at the noon time for these selected days part of the reason for this is methodological rather than having a physical basis hutjes et al 2010 the mean standard errors of the disaggregated flux estimates in the multiple linear regression varied between 30 and 60 w m 2 and their large uncertainties might lead to some bias towards the aggregated fluxes however this methodological bias might not fully explain the variations in the regression slope 1 16 and 1 32 a physical reason might be that the respective surface types and their specific flux were not as homogeneous as a priori assumed hutjes et al 2010 another reason might be attributed to the energy imbalance in the ec flux measurements such as for bl ebr 0 84 the energy from large eddies or secondary circulations induced by surface heterogeneity may not be capture by a single ec site but may be measured through the las foken 2008 foken et al 2010 xu et al 2017c the present flux aggregation method was also applied in a relatively homogeneous area of the midstream oasis of the hrb including a flux matrix with 17 ec sites and four paths of lass las1 las2 las3 and las4 see fig 1 of xu et al 2017a the ec and las1 data on five clear days in august 2012 were selected for detailed analysis note that the ec and las data were processed identically in these two study areas for las1 fig 5c the variations of ec aggregated sensible heat fluxes with time were in good agreement with that of the las observations as shown in fig 6c the aggregated sensible heat fluxes have a relatively higher correlation with the las1 observed fluxes r2 0 90 yielding a lower rmse rmse 10 w m 2 compared to that of las e and las w table 4 in comparison with the las observations the simple area weighted aggregation method showed larger rmse and mape values than the present aggregation method even for a relatively homogeneous landscape such as near the path of las1 table 4 while for a heterogeneous landscape the values of mbe rmse and mape would be much larger the mbe and rmse values increased by 66 81 and 62 78 w m 2 respectively and there was an increase of 60 94 in the mape the present aggregation method performs reasonably well in the integration of area averaged fluxes over a heterogeneous landscape its scheme for disaggregating heterogeneous fluxes into individual land cover types is effective and practical for use in a complex oasis landscape and its aggregation scheme has a feasible ability to upscale multi site tower flux measurements to an area average representative of a scintillometer source area 4 4 determination of area averaged evapotranspiration et the disaggregation scheme as evaluated in section 4 3 was applied to obtain the daily et of each land cover class barren land t chinensis p euphratica and cropland in the study area fig 7 gives the temporal variation in daily et of four land cover classes during the period from 25 july to 30 september 2014 the daily et of each land cover class varied significantly during the 68 days growing period mainly related to the meteorological conditions and plant growth statuses the et increased greatly with rapid plant growth and then declined gradually as the plant began to go through leaf senescence scarce precipitation 0 6 mm has seldom contribution to the plant growth in this oasis because it often evaporates completely before infiltrating into the soil in the extremely arid region chen et al 2003 the daily et of barren land was about 2 mm during the plant growth period while the p euphratica t chinensis and cropland showed much larger et values the daily et was almost the same for the t chinensis and cropland by august with values ranging between 3 and 8 mm the maximum et values of the t chinensis shrubland measured using the bowen ratio energy balance method was about 7 mm d 1 si et al 2005a differences in et over the t chinensis shrublands in this oasis are attributed to the climatic and hydrological conditions the vegetation structure parameters and the measurement methods the et of the p euphratica was a little higher with values in the range of 6 12 mm d 1 this value is within the range of reference et of the p euphratica forest in this oasis 10 mm d 1 hou et al 2010 in the ejina oasis more than 90 of transpired water from the p euphratica trees originates from the groundwater of depth between 2 and 2 5 m zhu et al 2009 the average groundwater depth at the study area in 2014 ranged between 2 and 3 m during the growing season within the optimal depth 3 5 m for the survival of the p euphratica jin et al 2011 si et al 2014 zhou et al 2010 this finding showed that the groundwater table at this area was high enough to provide sufficient water for the natural growth of the p euphratica forest fig 8 illustrates the temporal variation in the area averaged daily et over the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve and the observations of groundwater depth at the intensive observation area there was significant variation in the area averaged et aggregated from the ec flux matrix measurements with values ranging from 1 to 5 mm d 1 the day to day fluctuations in area averaged et over this key area was closely associated with variations in meteorological conditions and the plant growth statuses the daily et reached its maximum in july and mid august and then gradually declined as the plant began to undergo senescence the shallow groundwater table at this area gradually decreased during the plant growing period until the groundwater was replenished by surface water from the heihe river in mid september the result indicated that a gradual decline in the groundwater table occurred in response to the riparian vegetation uptake of groundwater through evapotranspiration this result agrees with other findings in the ejina oasis reported by wang et al 2014 during this 68 days the total et was approximately 171 mm at the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve in this oasis the ec aggregated et over this key area was compared to the remote sensing et products as shown in fig 8 the spatial averages of remotely sensed et showed a similar decline trend to the aggregation results during these 68 days the spatial average differences between the aggregated et and landsat modis et were rather small compared with the ec aggregated et values the landsat et in july and august generally gave relatively higher estimates and then had lower values in september by contrast the modis et showed significantly opposite differences 5 conclusions for the surfaces covered with the t chinensis shrubland mixed forest sparse p euphratica forest and cropland in the ejina oasis the latent heat flux is the main term of the surface energy budget during the plant growing period and a special phenomenon known as oasis effect was observed at the cropland the observed differences in the partitioning of available energy between different surface types in the oasis are closely related to the vegetation coverage in comparison with the las flux observations the new flux aggregation method for determining area averaged flux gave reasonable estimates of the sensible heat flux with an mape value of around 20 30 compared with the rather simple area weighted method the new aggregation method performs reasonably well in the integration of area averaged fluxes over a heterogeneous landscape the combination of its disaggregation and aggregation schemes has the ability to upscale multi site tower flux measurements to a larger area such as the scintillometer source area or an oasis landscape the daily et of various land cover classes in the ejina oasis was successfully estimated from the ec flux matrix using the established disaggregation scheme temporal trend was distinctly revealed by the long duration of et estimates during the period of 25 july 30 september 2014 the p euphratica exhibited higher et values 6 12 mm d 1 as the groundwater supplied sufficient water for its natural growth the daily et of the t chinensis and cropland ranged from 3 to 8 mm et from barren land was about 2 mm d 1 the area averaged et over the key area of the p euphratica forest reserve ranged between 1 and 5 mm d 1 for the 68 days growing period in 2014 the new flux aggregation method can be considered a simple and reliable technique for estimating area averaged et over a heterogeneous landscape after further evaluation with directly observed et its et estimates can be feasibly used for the validation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models furthermore this work will be extended to the water balance study of the whole heihe river basin which is essential for hydrological modeling and basin water resources management 6 data availability the meteorological data and the flux

6328,an autonomous low cost us 750 and open source rainfall sampler has been developed for hydrogen and oxygen isotope research able to sample daily and monthly for up to 60 days of rainfall over a three month period the sampler is designed to use modern fabrication methods such as 3d printing and laser cutting to minimise the need for machined and injection molded components the sampler can use either paraffin oil or a submerged inlet tube also known as tube dip in samplers to prevent evaporation with the use of the inlet tube method facilitated by 3d printed bottle caps an experiment was performed to identify the most suitable plastic for these caps with acetone treated abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene being most suitable followed by petg polyethylene terephthalate glycol untreated abs and pla polylactic acid in addition the effectiveness of both paraffin oil and the inlet tube method for preventing evaporation was quantified with paraffin identified as being the most effective at present during a 90 day outdoor experiment the 18o 16o vs 2h 1h ratios of some water samples evolved along a local evaporation line with increased isotopic enrichment of samples correlating to water loss a coupled hydrologic isotopic model was applied to these data and successfully predicted the change in isotope ratios based on the amount of water lost from each sample this modelling approach combined with daily and monthly sample collection and quantification of evaporation rates within the sheltered environment of the sampler allows for back calculation of the original volume and isotopic composition of daily and monthly rainfall samples the rainfall sampler thus facilitates cost and time effective remote monitoring of the isotopic composition of precipitation to support an array of earth system research keywords precipitation oxygen isotopes hydrogen isotopes 3d printing rainfall sampler isotopic modelling 1 introduction the natural variation of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water in the hydrological cycle is tied to numerous climatic and meteorological variables craig 1961 craig and gordon 1965 dansgaard 1954 gat 2010 gibson et al 2016 gibson et al 2008 this variation forms a key dataset for many branches of research including climate and meteorological research water resource management forensic and ecological source identification and spatial and temporal mapping of changes and fluxes in meteoric water bowen and revenaugh 2003 bowen et al 2005 gibson and reid 2014 mattey et al 2008 steinman et al 2010 treble et al 2005 tyler et al 2015 tyler et al 2007 at the centre of the water cycle is precipitation the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip has underpinned knowledge on monthly and annual scale variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation since 1961 rozanski et al 1993 however several applications demand rainfall sampling at higher spatial and temporal resolution often from remote locations placing significant demand upon time and financial resources in addition the isotopes of water 3h 2h 1h and 18o 17o 16o fractionate as water molecules undergo phase change and diffusion in response to evaporation residual liquid water becomes relatively enriched in the heavy isotopes as a function of both the climate and the evaporative history of the water evaporation of collected samples presents a challenge to sampling rainfall requiring dedicated systems that minimise evaporation and accompanying isotopic alteration therefore there is a need for an adaptable precipitation sampler which preserves the integrity of oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios 3h 1h 2h 1h 18o 16o and 17o 16o 1 1 previous designs there has been no shortage of rainfall sampler designs over the last few decades with many designs developed for acid rain research in the 1970s raynor and mcneil 1978 laquer 1990 identified over 70 reports of sequential rainfall samplers focused on recording variations of rainfall over the course of a rainfall event using a variety of techniques while some aspects of a sequential rainfall sampler may form a useful design basis for a daily monthly sampler many rely on mains power require manual preparation are not suited to long term on off operation and often segment rainfall by volume rather than time few of these older samplers feature designs that are well suited to modern low cost fabrication techniques there are however some novel innovations as well as commonalities amongst many of these samplers one of the most robust and simplest sequential sampler designs is the sampler of kennedy et al 1979 consisting of a series of interlinked bottles as each bottle is filled the overflow is diverted to the next sample bottle mixing of samples is prevented by the use of a narrow inlet tube to the base of each sample bottle ronneau et al 1978 developed an entirely mechanical sampler for remote areas driven solely by gravity and using tipping latching sample containers on a circular platter a resistance based rainfall detector was used by asman 1980 whereas gray et al 1974 used a loud speaker which when struck by a raindrop would generate an electronic pulse that would trigger the sampler s mechanism gatz et al 1971 developed a sampler able to collect up to 70 samples 500 1000 ml from 70 mm of rainfall at 1 1 2 m and 91 kg this probably represents the heavyweight class of sequential samplers closely challenged by the raynor and mcneil 1978 sampler at 1 5 1 5 0 64 m both of which were designed as permanent installations a more recent sequential sampler design is the 96 vial sampler of coplen 2010 2015 that incorporates a novel teflon coated cover to prevent evaporation from inactive sample vials in terms of commonality between existing sampler designs many make use of a tipping bucket system to quantify the rainfall amount as many of these samplers segment rainfall by volume a tipping bucket sensor provides an effective way to prevent overflows circular rotating platters are also very common taking advantage of mechanical and electronic simplicity and robustness two more recent designs break with these common design elements akkoyunlu et al 2013 developed a sampler that quantifies rainfall using matlab controlled solenoids located beneath the collector funnel separated by a tube with a volume of 5 ml rainfall was then gravimetrically segmented to 21 individual sample bottles however unlike some older systems that rely on sample bottles filling to enable the next bottle in the sequence the sample bottles were instead capped with solenoids as each solenoid closed water was diverted down the inlet tube to the next bottle until all bottles were filled hartmann et al 2018 developed an arduino based battery powered field auto sampler that uses a cartesian based control system to fill a grid of gas tight sample vials like the design of akkoyunlu et al 2013 an inlet tube with a known volume 12 ml holds the sample prior to storage a peristaltic pump then transfers the sample via piston flow to the sample vials a pair of cannulas pierce the vial cap for sample injection and pressure equalisation and the sealing nature of the rubber vial cap prevents exchange with the atmosphere this device has been used for sampling of cave waters the evaporation prevention mechanism is of significant interest to rainfall sampling however it is unclear at this stage how this system could be adapted to rainfall collection as the thin diameters of the auto sampler cannula will likely face problems with the detritus usually collected in rainfall sampler funnels in addition to the above the 3700c compact and 6712 fullsize samplers teledyne isco usa represent commercial sampler designs that have been adapted for sequential rainfall sampling rücker et al 2019 these samplers utilise the common design element of a circular array with up to 24 sample bottles combined with a peristaltic pump for filling samples there is also ongoing development focused on in field analysis where mobile labs are established at the site of interest with analyses of samples undertaken in near real time berman et al 2009 von freyberg et al 2017 these systems are typically expensive require on site power and regular attendance making them unsuitable at this stage for use in remote locations with limited infrastructure while there are many examples of sequential rainfall samplers in the literature there are relatively few that are designed for discrete daily monthly sampling possibly due to the added complexity required unlike sequential samplers daily monthly samplers have to prevent evaporation of samples for long time periods require accurate timekeeping must be sufficiently robust and must store sufficient samples to operate for months in the field samplers designed for remote sites also need to be small enough to be transported and installed as well as having the means to maintain power supply for the period of deployment of the samplers mentioned above only the auto sampler of hartmann et al 2018 and the sequential sampler of coplen 2010 have most of the components required for daily monthly sampling of rainfall in remote sites however in the case of hartmann et al 2018 there would be significant modifications required to adapt it for rainfall sampling including attachment of a catchment funnel rainfall sensor a water reservoir that the auto sampler can sample and that can be emptied when rainfall has occurred and a filter system to deal with the detritus collected in rainfall catchment funnels the design of coplen 2010 would require less modification with the main changes being to the control software and the inclusion of an evaporation prevention system for the main reservoir where water is stored prior to being transferred to the sample vials the design of akkoyunlu et al 2013 has potential as a monthly sampling system as control of 14 solenoids is manageable with low power electronics such as the open source arduino platform 1 2 fabrication methods and materials design and construction of bespoke equipment such as precipitation samplers can be challenging due to the absence of off the shelf components that can be easily incorporated even parts as simple as a uv stabilised funnel of a suitable size can prove difficult for example asman 1980 made use of a square funnel due to the difficulty of fabricating a large cylindrical funnel injection moulding complex machining and custom electronics are not feasible manufacturing techniques for low volume production as they typically have high initial costs fortunately in the last decade several developments in manufacturing have emerged that enable low volume complex designs to be manufactured at low cost berman 2012 rayna and striukova 2016 two in particular are heavily used in our sampler 3d printing or fused filament fabrication enables the fabrication of complicated plastic components though typically of fairly small size when combined with computer numerical control cnc laser cutting larger designs of considerable complexity can be manufactured more importantly once a design is complete it can easily be fabricated by anyone else with a 3d printer laser cutting or cnc milling capability low cost extensible microprocessor based electronics such as the arduino system provide accurate timing motor control data logging and support for multiple sensors e g hund et al 2016 in the same way that the manufacturing designs can be published and fabricated the program that controls the arduino can be shared 1 3 methods of preventing evaporation with respect to evaporation prevention two methods have demonstrated effectiveness paraffin oil or the submerged inlet tube system of gröning et al 2012 michelsen et al 2018 terzer et al 2016 the oil method prevents evaporation by the addition of a 5 mm layer of paraffin oil to the sample which forms a barrier between the sample and the air the inlet tube system uses a narrow typically 4 mm diameter inlet tube that passes to the bottom of the sample container once the first portion of rainfall enters the sample container the base of the inlet tube is submerged and evaporation can only occur through the small surface area exposed in the inlet tube pressure is equalised through a second tube that vents the container but is sufficiently long and thin to minimise diffusion with the exterior atmosphere the sample container and vent tube are then protected from sunlight to minimise heating and corresponding pressure changes within the sample container given the simplicity and effectiveness of the paraffin oil technique it might be expected to be the preferred collection method however as analysis of the samples is often complicated by the presence of oil in the sample iaea 2014 in many situations the inlet tube method is preferred the choice of sampling bottle must also be considered as isotopes may exchange or permeate through the sample bottle material spangenberg 2012 investigated multiple plastics for their suitability for storing waters for stable isotope analysis namely high and low density polyethylene hdpe ldpe polypropylene polycarbonate polyethylene terephthalate pet perfluoroalkoxy teflon and glass over a timeframe of 659 days significant variations of 5 for δ2h and 2 for δ18o were observed for polycarbonate and pet the recommended materials for use in sample bottles used for stable isotope investigations are glass hdpe or teflon with a preference for thicker walled containers unfortunately there is little overlap between the common laboratory plastics tested by spangenberg 2012 and the plastics commonly used in 3d printing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs polylactic acid pla and polyethylene terephthalate glycol modified petg 1 4 objectives there is a clear need for an autonomous rainfall isotope sampler that can be deployed for long time periods in remote locations given that no design has thus far been able to prevent losses and fractionation due to evaporation there is also need to be able to evaluate and potentially correct for the effects of evaporation on samples this paper presents the development of a low cost us 750 autonomous battery powered sampler using novel construction methods and open source electronics design files are available from https github com mjankor mars rainfall sampler aspects of the design of the sampler are considered with tests quantifying the amount of water lost due to surface wetting along the flow path and the ability of the sampler to divide the flow accurately between daily and monthly samples in addition to discussing the design of the rainfall sampler we also present results investigating the effectiveness of 3d printing bottle caps using abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene petg polyethylene terephthalate glycol pla polylactic acid and acetone treated abs for preserving the integrity of stable isotope ratios in water samples a coupled hydrologic isotopic model was applied to the bottle caps experiment data to predict the change in the isotopic composition of the water based on the water lost from each sample based on the results from the isotopic modelling we describe how a hydrologic isotopic model taking advantage of the differing rates of evaporation from daily and monthly samples can be used to back calculate the original volume and isotopic composition of rainfall samples 2 design principles the many varied designs of rainfall sampler from the last few decades show a few commonalities but no de facto design standard therefore rather than rework an existing design we established several design principles that were used as the basis for development usage the sampler should be easily deployed in remote environments as major cities often have gnip stations and generally have personnel available for event or daily sampling there is little benefit in designing a sampler that is reliant upon significant infrastructure cost samplers will be deployed in remote or uncontrolled environments where there is potential for vandalism weather damage and other mishaps minimising costs means that the loss of a sampler is less of a burden on research budgets or that more samplers can be deployed for better spatial resolution and redundancy outer casing needs to be weatherproof and robust over the timeframe of years it should also prevent wildlife from occupying the sampler and should protect the electronics and interior components from sunlight and excessive heat in addition the sampler should be entirely self contained without any external components such as batteries or cables which can be easily damaged battery powered the sampler must operate without an external power source for a long period of time when combined with solar panels a sampler should be able to operate indefinitely easy to construct as the intent is to provide a design for others to replicate it is beneficial that the construction of the sampler is straightforward this is also an important feature for a field sampler where repairs and maintenance may need to be carried out at remote locations with minimal equipment sampling capabilities capturing both daily and monthly precipitation provides some redundancy in case of failure of some components and allows for quality control by comparing the mass balance of daily and monthly samples flexibility the sampler must be suitable for differing rainfall conditions this is rarely a challenging problem with rainfall samplers as the collection funnel can be changed to increase or reduce the amount of rainfall collected however funnels with specific diameters are sometimes difficult to purchase therefore the design process included the development of multiple funnel options in addition regions with very variable rainfall should be considered requiring a method to prevent overflow from large events the ability to quantify rainfall quantifying the amount of rain is important partly as an explanatory variable for the isotopic composition of rainfall and more importantly to prevent overflows during heavy events and to avoid changing sample bottles on days of no rain preservation of isotope ratios the rainfall sampler is designed to accommodate both the paraffin oil and inlet tube methods to prevent evaporation though it is noted that the inlet tube method has analytical and operational benefits oil is an option regardless of the sampler design however the inlet tube method requires significant space to store the vent tubes and attaching both the inlet tube and vent tube to sample bottles can be complicated or expensive 2 1 design based on the above criteria a low cost automated rainfall sampler was designed for remote field deployment which for simplicity is named mars the choice of outer casing was an early priority in the design process the sampler needed to be large enough to contain multiple sample bottles as well as the sampling mechanism electronics battery and a rainfall collection funnel fortunately a cheap common off the shelf solution was identified 200 l plastic drums typically used for transporting food and chemicals are extremely common and recycled ones can be purchased for very low cost these drums are typically blue hdpe plastic around 4 mm thick and are uv resistant they have a diameter of 58 cm and a height of 93 cm and are typically completely sealed with just two inlet ports for filling and emptying the entire drum is not used for the sampler the top half of the drum is used as a lid that can be easily removed to provide access to the daily sample bottle area the lower third of the drum is used to provide a protected enclosure below the main sampler where monthly sample bottles are placed it should be noted that the lower shell is not designed to be water proof and it is expected that some water will make its way into that space as the seal between upper and lower shells is not watertight there is a drain in the lower shell to prevent water building up in that space the outer shell has had its height reduced as much as possible to minimise the wind effect on rainfall sampling bureau of meteorology 2007 to reduce the chance of it being blown over and to make it easy to transport at the centre of the mars sampler forming the top of the lower shell is a 12 mm plywood baseplate this baseplate holds the electronics battery and provides a firm fixing point for the mechanical system fig 1 positioned about 6 cm above the main baseplate is a rotating platter of 12 mm plywood sitting on a 30 cm turntable bearing this platter has a support frame on it designed to hold 60 225 ml hdpe bottles 48 4 mm diameter 161 mm in two rings of 33 and 27 bottles a central plastic tower sits at the centre of the baseplate and holds the tipping bucket mechanism and a water switch that can divert water from the tipping bucket outflows to either the inner or outer ring of daily sample bottles and between first second or third of the monthly samples one benefit to using a rotating platter is that there is a dead spot in the centre which provides an ideal location to place the vent tubes used for the inlet tube evaporation prevention method the platter s rotation is controlled by a ring gear driven by a stepper motor three 8 mm silicone tubes run from the water switch down the central tower and through the baseplate to 3 monthly sampling bottles 2 l hdpe these bottles also use the inlet tube method with the vent tubes stored inside the lower compartment on the baseplate are a cabinet for the electronics the motor for rotating the main platter a small 12 v 2 1 ah sealed lead acid battery and the support for the platter bearing in addition are two drains in case of overflow of the daily bottles and guides with encapsulated nuts around the outer rim used to guide and secure both top and bottom shells in place the drains are a holdover from an earlier design and should rarely be needed in the current design the electronics are controlled by an arduino nano 3 x duinotech nano v3 0 on a breakout board the breakout board keeps the need for soldering to a minimum with jumper cables used to connect most of the components two stepping motors are used one driving the platter and the other controlling the water switch on the tower a reed sensor determines when the tipping bucket is activated and a microswitch on the tower is used to reset the water switch the position of the main platter is not reset electronically as it is much quicker to disengage the motor and rotate the platter by hand to the starting position a real time clock and an sd card reader keep time and a log for each sample changeover date the arduino platform also means that mars can be easily reprogrammed for different roles such as time or volume based sequential sampling of rainfall events attached to the outer shell is a 3d printed funnel positioned 30 cm above the top of the sampler while it could be positioned closer to the outer shell 30 cm was chosen to prevent splashes from the casing bouncing into the funnel the top half of this funnel is designed to be easily replaced so that different sized funnels can be used there are vents situated around the exterior of the funnel when combined with the drains in the lower shell these vent warm air from the sampler replenished with cooler air from near ground level thus preventing greenhouse style warming in the sampler all vents and drains are designed so that mesh can be applied to exclude insects the tipping bucket design is unique due to the way that it separates the flow path for monthly and daily sample collection fig 2 tipping buckets have been used before to divide rainfall into multiple samples with alternating tips of the bucket passing water through different flow paths e g gatz et al 1971 while such a design is ideal for volumetric based segmentation in a rainfall event it introduces potential systematic uncertainties any difference in tipping volume between the buckets would result in a bias towards either daily or monthly samples in addition most tipping buckets are designed to tip for each 0 2 mm of rainfall if a series of small rainfall events occurs then on a day with rainfall of 0 2 mm all of the rain may go into the daily sample and none into the monthly on a day of 1 4 mm of rainfall 0 8 mm may go to daily and 0 6 mm into the monthly to avoid this issue and taking advantage of the ability to fabricate complex structures with 3d printing our tipping bucket splits the flow for each bucket with half the water from each bucket tip going to daily and half going to monthly samples the tipping bucket is designed to tip with a volume of 4 ml resulting in a tip every 0 2 mm of rainfall with a 159 6 mm diameter funnel the success of this mechanism to divide water equally is dependent on the rainfall sampler being vertically aligned thus a level bubble is built into the design of the tipping bucket fabrication is achieved predominantly using 3d printed components while some of the bottle support structure ring gear and central tower uses laser cut 6 mm acrylic plastic to build the design requires a few basic tools jigsaw drill screwdriver soldering iron as well as a 3d printer able to print abs with a build volume of 200 200 180 all 3d printed parts were printed using a wanhao i3 plus 3d printer components that form the water flowpath were printed with 0 2 mm layer thickness and sanded with 1500 grit sandpaper to smooth the layered structure of the printed surface 3d printing was able to resolve a significant problem in the design of the bottle caps modifying existing bottle caps to include an inlet tube and a vent tube is complicated and space on and above a platter of daily sample bottles is limited using 3d printing we were able to fabricate lids featuring a small funnel to capture incoming water an inlet tube holder that clamped the outside of the inlet tube and a curved vent pipe attachment so that vent tube could be routed horizontally towards the centre of the platter fig 3 by clamping the outside of the inlet tube the smallest diameter along the water flow path was the 4 mm diameter of the inlet tube thereby minimising the chance of blockages 3 design and material tests experimental methods 3 1 quantification of water loss from surface wetting in order to quantify the amount of water lost through wetting of surfaces along the flow path various quantities 12 20 40 60 100 ml of water were dripped into the sampler at a rate of 1 ml s wetting the entire funnel and top surface of the filter representing rainfall events from 0 6 to 5 mm of rainfall the amount of water collected in the bottles were subsequently weighed this experiment was repeated 3 times 3 2 quantification of water loss through bottle caps the use of 3d printed plastics along the water flow path was not considered problematic with regard to preservation of water isotope ratio integrity as water would only be in contact with those plastics briefly however the use of 3d printed plastics for bottle closures was a concern to test which plastics were most effective at preserving the initial water isotope ratio bottle caps were fabricated using three different types of plastic the plastics used were blue pla grey abs and white petg from 3dfillies https 3dfillies com in addition grey abs modified with acetone treatment was also tested where acetone is used to partially dissolve and smooth the abs plastic surface potentially improving the sealing between printed layers garg et al 2016 singh et al 2017 acetone treated parts were placed in a 4 l tin lined with acetone soaked paper towels for 30 min at 20 c then allowed to dry overnight in order to test the effectiveness of different plastic caps and to validate the use of the inlet tube system an experiment was conducted using 33 225 ml hdpe bottles each with 40 ml of recent rainfall equivalent to 4 mm of rain using a 159 6 mm diameter funnel divided between monthly and daily samples for each plastic sealed bottle caps were fabricated using the same design as used in the sampler but with the inlet and outlet holes sealed unsealed bottle caps of the same design were also fabricated in all 4 plastics and combined with the inlet tube and vent tube to replicate the system used in the sampler the inlet and vent tube consisted of 4 mm ø internal ldpe tubing with a 1 mm wall thickness triplicates of each design were fabricated for each plastic giving a total of 24 bottle caps table 1 triplicate bottles using the oil method of evaporation prevention were also prepared with 5 mm of paraffin oil sealing each 40 ml water sample as a control 6 bottles were prepared sealed with wadded polypropylene caps each bottle was weighed when empty then again once the 40 ml of sample was added using an ohaus adventurer ar3130 three decimal point balance each lid was also weighed to assess whether any water had been absorbed or condensed onto the lid over the course of the experiment for the oil bottles each empty bottle was weighed then weighed again with oil and then again once the sample was added each bottle and lid was then weighed again at the end of the 3 months to determine any loss of water each water sample was filtered through a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone syinge filter directly into 2 ml vials for analysis paraffin oil samples were left undisturbed for several hours then a syringe needle was pushed through the side of the bottle well below the paraffin water interface to extract the sample oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were conducted with an l2130 i picarro cavity ring down spectrometer picarro inc santa clara ca usa with a precision against an in house qa standard of 0 05 for δ18o and 0 4 for δ2h each batch of 10 samples was preceded by calibration with 2 in house standards and a quality check against a 3rd in house standard with a final quality check at the end of the sample run each sample and standard were injected 7 times with the first 3 injections discarded to prevent memory effects and the remaining 4 injection results assessed for any residual trend chemcorrect picarro inc was used to validate that

regression was derived for average daily temperature n 38 r2 0 94 and relative humidity n 37 r2 0 88 based on the correlation with kent town being nearest fig 4 one outlier was removed from the correlation ave rh 21 11 2017 as it seemed to be a local effect at the kent town station and was not representative of local conditions or those at the west terrace station the daily average temperature over the course of the experiment was 25 3 c with a range from 16 0 c to 37 c relative humidity ranged from 15 to 81 with an average of 41 7 interpolated pan evaporation estimates for both weather stations were an average of 7 7 mm day for a total of 695 mm over the timeframe of the experiment fig 4 4 2 quantification of water loss from surface wetting the average loss of water due to surface wetting was 1 9 ml 0 53 σ split fairly evenly between the 159 6 mm diameter funnel 0 6 ml tipping bucket and chute 0 6 ml and the water switch and pipework 0 7 ml this means that for a single event assuming no re evaporation of raindrops from the sampler surfaces during the event 90 of rainfall for a 1 mm event is collected rising to 98 for a 5 mm event there is also the potential for up to 4 ml of rainfall 0 2 mm of rainfall with a 159 6 mm diameter funnel to sit within the tipping bucket if insufficient rain falls to tip the bucket the ratio for daily vs monthly rainfall captured was evenly split 336 3 ml for daily 338 1 ml for monthly demonstrating that the tipping bucket is able to divide the flow accurately with 1 variation 4 3 volumetric variation in samples significant differences in water loss were observed between the different techniques and plastics fig 5 table 1 the hdpe control bottles with wadded caps only lost 0 3 0 1 ml of their water over the three months followed by the paraffin oil bottles with a loss of 0 9 0 35 ml with the exception of the sealed abs and pla capped bottles both sealed and unsealed bottles demonstrated consistent differences between plastic types with the inlet tube bottles typically losing 2 0 8 ml of mass relative to the sealed plastics sealed petg and acetone treated abs lost 1 6 0 6 ml and 1 1 0 4 ml respectively while their corresponding inlet tube variants lost 3 5 1 4 ml and 3 1 1 2 ml the sealed abs exhibited an average water loss of 3 5 while the abs inlet tube bottles lost 4 1 6 ml of water the pla sealed bottles lost 3 7 1 5 ml via the sealed lids and 7 5 2 9 ml for the inlet tube lids compared to most of the alternative plastics the paraffin oil and the control all of which had a standard deviation of 0 35 the sealed abs lids exhibited a standard deviation of 0 8 and pla had standard deviations of 1 8 for the sealed and 1 for the inlet tube lids these results suggest that either the fabrication method did not produce pla or abs caps of consistent quality or the caps did not seal the bottles adequately as the inlet tube method is identical for all samples then it would be expected to contribute a similar amount to the water loss for each sample for both triplicates of pla two samples were similar with the third varying by a significant amount assessing just the two similar samples for each set gives a 7 2 73 ml loss for the inlet tube method and 4 8 1 9 ml loss for the sealed cap approximately matching the 2 difference between inlet tube and sealed caps observed in the other plastics likewise the sealed abs appears to be indicative of variation in bottle cap fabrication or the sealing between the caps and the bottles 4 4 isotopic variation in samples changes in the δ18o and δ2h of the water samples correlated strongly with the water loss for each sample and a linear regression between δ18o vs δ2h exhibited a local evaporation line with a slope of 2 5 fig 5 three potential outliers were noted petg04 acet02 and hdpe06 with δ2h values falling approximately 0 75 below the evaporation line these outliers are suspected to have occurred due to an analytical error and are excluded from subsequent modelling and analysis unfortunately these samples were not able to be re analysed excluding these outliers enrichment relative to the average original water composition ranged from an average of 0 14 δ18o and 0 3 δ2h for the paraffin oil samples up to 2 63 δ18o and 6 3 δ2h for the pla inlet tube bottles of the three remaining plastics the inlet tube samples were enriched by an average of 1 21 δ18o and 2 7 δ2h for petg 1 30 δ18o and 3 1 δ2h for abs and 1 10 δ18o and 2 3 δ2h for acetone treated abs sealed caps underwent less enrichment ranging from an average of 0 33 δ18o and 0 44 δ2h for the acetone treated lids to 0 41 δ18o and 0 8 δ2h for petg the sealed untreated abs lids suffered greater enrichment in line with their large and variable water loss 4 5 isotope modelling calibration of the modelled to observed isotope values was achieved through adjustment of the δa value as described in section 3 3 the modelled evaporation line was aligned to the observed evaporation line by applying a 14 increase in equilibrium isotopic separation εeq between δa and δp differences between modelled and observed δ18o for all samples except the three potential outliers ranged from 0 19 to 0 09 δ18o with an average of 0 06 and a σ of 0 07 δ18o differences between modelled and observed δ2h ranged from 0 7 to 0 5 δ2h with an average of 0 12 and a σ of 0 27 δ2h for the 3 outliers the differences in δ18o ranged from 0 06 to 0 16 δ18o and 0 9 to 1 3 δ2h fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 general usage notes experiments designed to test the validity of the mars rainfall sampler indicate that the device has the potential to perform remote automated sampling of rainfall with retention of the primary isotope signature of daily and monthly rainfall as is the case for manually operated rainfall samplers the mars sampler has limits with respect to the minimum amount of rainfall that can be reliably collected both due to water loss due to wetting of surfaces along the flow path and due to evaporative loss through the bottle lids as a result we recommend that the sampler is suitable for daily rainfall collections greater than 10 ml equivalent to 1 mm of rainfall with a 159 6 mm funnel diameter or 0 25 mm of rainfall with a 319 2 mm wide funnel 5 2 evaporation and isotope fractionation the oxygen and hydrogen isotope enrichment along a well defined local evaporation line fig 5 suggests that the primary method of water loss is evaporation with a small amount occurring through the paraffin oil a larger amount through the plastic lids dependent upon plastic type degree of sealing and fabrication consistency and an additional 2 through the tubing most likely through the inlet tube with its 14 cm distance from water surface to atmosphere instead of the 150 cm long vent tube a very small amount of water is also lost either across the plastic walls or through the wadded caps in the control bottles an important result is that there appears to be no fractionation effect that is unique to only one of the isotopologues with the use of untested plastics there was a concern that one of the plastics could preferentially exchange with either deuterium or oxygen e g spangenberg 2012 however our results suggest that this is not the case modelling of the isotopic fractionation of the samples based on the amount of water loss can simulate this evaporative isotopic enrichment in δ18o and δ2h to a precision of 0 07 δ18o and 0 27 δ2h σ1 both the inlet tube and paraffin oil method of preventing evaporation were able to significantly decrease evaporation for the 40 ml samples used in the experiment average evaporation occurred at approximately 0 02 of the pan evaporation rate however both methods still result in some water loss and isotopic enrichment of samples this is especially true for small sample volumes all plastics were substantially less effective than the paraffin oil method at preventing water loss the inlet tube method subtracting estimated losses through the plastics typically resulted in 0 8 ml loss over the 3 months compared to 0 35 ml for the paraffin oil samples this is in contrast to the results from gröning et al 2012 who observed that their sampler outperformed a paraffin oil based sampler over the course of a year the differences between our observations and those of gröning et al 2012 likely arise predominantly as a result of differences in the size and shape of the sampling bottles used the effectiveness of paraffin oil to prevent evaporation depends on the ratio of surface area to volume of the sample and quantification of the rate of water loss through paraffin oil requires consideration of the bottle shape in contrast the primary water loss from the inlet tube method is determined by the diameter and length of the inlet and vent tubes therefore under conditions where the paraffin oil surface area is small then paraffin may outperform the inlet tube method however if the bottle diameter was doubled the surface area of the paraffin oil would be increased fourfold and paraffin may then be outperformed by the inlet tube method as noted in section 1 3 the method of sample analysis must be considered before deployment as paraffin oil contamination can compromise laser spectroscopy based stable isotope analysis iaea 2014 acetone treated abs was the most effective plastic at preventing evaporation followed closely by petg three of the plastics used inlet tube and sealed pla and sealed abs had greater variation of water loss than the other plastics raising concerns about the degree of sealing and the fabrication consistency all the lids had very consistent weights with a typical range of 0 05 g a visual inspection also revealed no significant defects such as delaminated layers or holes in any of the lids however the nature of 3d printed components many layers of plastic fused together means that there is potential for tortuous pathways through the plastic layers resulting in incomplete sealing mccullough and yadavalli 2013 leakage through 3d printed components can be prevented through configuration of printer settings or through post processing of prints applying a slight over extrusion during printing can fill any minor voids and pathways while decreasing dimensional accuracy post processing with acetone treatment to the prints can dissolve filament across and between the layers and improve sealing mccullough and yadavalli 2013 another potential source of leakage is the seal of the lid against the bottle the lids do not include a rubber washer or similar seal instead relying on compression and deformation of the rim of the bottle against the plastic cap to seal one option is to include a sealing washer or wadding in each cap washer seals were not tested here as the sampler requires perfectly fitted washers to be effective placing delicate seals may be an option for a single experiment but is not practical when changing out 60 sample bottles in the field a potentially better solution that will be tested in the future is the printing of seals using tpu thermoplastic polyurethane or a similar flexible filament using this technique means that the seals can be designed specifically for the caps with suitable cutouts for the inlet tube and vent tube with the ongoing development of multi material 3d printers the entire cap could be printed in a single process in the short term our results indicate that acetone treated abs is the most appropriate material for bottle lids more importantly as there is a lot of variability in 3d printers and the software used to prepare prints we recommend that each lid be tested to ensure consistent evaporation a variation of the methodology employed in this paper mass loss over time can be used to ensure lid fabrication consistency 5 3 potential of mass balance closure modelling a distinct advantage of the mars sampler is that both daily and monthly rainfall are captured at the same time this potentially allows for the calculation of the original isotopic composition using a modelling approach based on the difference in evaporation rates of monthly and daily rainfall assuming the volume of rainfall collected by the sampler is split evenly between daily and monthly samples eq 7 7 v i monthly n 1 m v i n daily where v is the volume of the sample the superscript represents the sample type either a daily or monthly sample m is the total number of daily samples collected the subscript describes initial i or final f volume and sample number n each sample may then undergo some minor evaporation while awaiting collection from the sampler the initial sample volume for a daily sample s is therefore related to the final volume by eq 8 8 v i n daily v f n daily d 1 t e d n daily e is the daily volumetric loss from evaporation for each sample type d is the day and t is the total number of days a sample is exposed to evaporation the combined volume of all daily samples n is therefore 9 n 1 m v i n daily n 1 m v f n daily d 1 t e d n daily n 1 m v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t e d n daily and the integrated monthly sample is related to the initial monthly sample by eq 10 10 v i monthly v f monthly d 1 t e d monthly from eq 7 to 10 it can be seen that 11 v f monthly d 1 t e d monthly n 1 m v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t e d n daily we relate daily evaporation rates outside the sampler to evaporation rates within the sampler using a coefficient similar to relating pet to class a pan evaporation such that 12 e d n daily e d n external k daily 13 e d monthly e d external k monthly where eexternal is an evaporative measure either from meteorological records or calculated using the penman equation penman 1948 or similar and k is a coefficient defining a proportional evaporation rate for each sample type there should be two values of k one representing the evaporation rate of the daily bottles kdaily and a second for the monthly bottles kmonthly these coefficients are expected to be similar but not necessarily identical due to the differences between monthly and daily sample bottles rearranging eq 11 and substituting eq 12 and 13 gives eq 14 14 v f monthly n 1 m v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t e d n external k daily d 1 t e d external k monthly for each of eq 7 14 a parallel series of equations can be written for the isotopic mass balance resulting in eq 15 15 δ f monthly v f monthly n 1 m δ f n daily v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t δ e d n daily e d n external k daily d 1 t δ e d monthly e d external k monthly where δ describes the isotopic composition of the sample or evaporative flux the isotopic composition of evaporative fluxes are defined by the e subscript and are calculated using the model of craig and gordon 1965 from eqs 14 and 15 kdaily and kmonthly can be solved as the isotopic fractionation of evaporation is partly determined by the isotopic composition of the sample a numerical solution should be used with isotopic fractionation calculated at daily or shorter timesteps the original volume and isotopic composition for the integrated monthly sample can then be derived from the initial volume and isotopic composition of the daily samples one benefit of applying this modelling technique is that it lowers the ideal sampling requirement from elimination of evaporation from the sample bottle to minimisation and quantification of evaporation from the sample bottle this latter objective is substantially easier to achieve with both paraffin oil and inlet tube methods fulfilling that requirement even under relatively intense evaporation conditions during an australian summer with water losses of up to 9 modelling of the isotopic change due to evaporation was able to achieve a precision of 0 07 δ18o and 0 27 δ2h σ1 6 conclusion we have developed an autonomous daily and monthly rainfall sampler mars able to be deployed and left unattended for up to 3 months between visits capable of collecting and storing up to 60 daily rainfall samples as well as integrated monthly samples the sampler can also be reprogrammed for sequential sampling of rainfall events either on a time or amount basis this sampler makes significant use of modern fabrication techniques and open source technology to minimise costs and complexity we have quantified the effectiveness of various plastics commonly used in 3d printing petg pla abs and acetone treated abs at preventing evaporation with acetone treated abs being most suitable and pla being least suitable the inlet tube method of preventing evaporation from the sample bottles was compared with the use of paraffin oil and it was noted that the type of sampling bottle the amount of water and environmental conditions are significant factors in the relative effectiveness of these methods in our experiments paraffin oil outperformed the inlet tube method in contrast to previous research gröning et al 2012 as neither technique can fully prevent evaporation a modelling approach was developed which takes advantage of the combined monthly and daily sample collection our automated rainfall sampler augmented by a mass balance modelling

6328,an autonomous low cost us 750 and open source rainfall sampler has been developed for hydrogen and oxygen isotope research able to sample daily and monthly for up to 60 days of rainfall over a three month period the sampler is designed to use modern fabrication methods such as 3d printing and laser cutting to minimise the need for machined and injection molded components the sampler can use either paraffin oil or a submerged inlet tube also known as tube dip in samplers to prevent evaporation with the use of the inlet tube method facilitated by 3d printed bottle caps an experiment was performed to identify the most suitable plastic for these caps with acetone treated abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene being most suitable followed by petg polyethylene terephthalate glycol untreated abs and pla polylactic acid in addition the effectiveness of both paraffin oil and the inlet tube method for preventing evaporation was quantified with paraffin identified as being the most effective at present during a 90 day outdoor experiment the 18o 16o vs 2h 1h ratios of some water samples evolved along a local evaporation line with increased isotopic enrichment of samples correlating to water loss a coupled hydrologic isotopic model was applied to these data and successfully predicted the change in isotope ratios based on the amount of water lost from each sample this modelling approach combined with daily and monthly sample collection and quantification of evaporation rates within the sheltered environment of the sampler allows for back calculation of the original volume and isotopic composition of daily and monthly rainfall samples the rainfall sampler thus facilitates cost and time effective remote monitoring of the isotopic composition of precipitation to support an array of earth system research keywords precipitation oxygen isotopes hydrogen isotopes 3d printing rainfall sampler isotopic modelling 1 introduction the natural variation of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of water in the hydrological cycle is tied to numerous climatic and meteorological variables craig 1961 craig and gordon 1965 dansgaard 1954 gat 2010 gibson et al 2016 gibson et al 2008 this variation forms a key dataset for many branches of research including climate and meteorological research water resource management forensic and ecological source identification and spatial and temporal mapping of changes and fluxes in meteoric water bowen and revenaugh 2003 bowen et al 2005 gibson and reid 2014 mattey et al 2008 steinman et al 2010 treble et al 2005 tyler et al 2015 tyler et al 2007 at the centre of the water cycle is precipitation the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip has underpinned knowledge on monthly and annual scale variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation since 1961 rozanski et al 1993 however several applications demand rainfall sampling at higher spatial and temporal resolution often from remote locations placing significant demand upon time and financial resources in addition the isotopes of water 3h 2h 1h and 18o 17o 16o fractionate as water molecules undergo phase change and diffusion in response to evaporation residual liquid water becomes relatively enriched in the heavy isotopes as a function of both the climate and the evaporative history of the water evaporation of collected samples presents a challenge to sampling rainfall requiring dedicated systems that minimise evaporation and accompanying isotopic alteration therefore there is a need for an adaptable precipitation sampler which preserves the integrity of oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios 3h 1h 2h 1h 18o 16o and 17o 16o 1 1 previous designs there has been no shortage of rainfall sampler designs over the last few decades with many designs developed for acid rain research in the 1970s raynor and mcneil 1978 laquer 1990 identified over 70 reports of sequential rainfall samplers focused on recording variations of rainfall over the course of a rainfall event using a variety of techniques while some aspects of a sequential rainfall sampler may form a useful design basis for a daily monthly sampler many rely on mains power require manual preparation are not suited to long term on off operation and often segment rainfall by volume rather than time few of these older samplers feature designs that are well suited to modern low cost fabrication techniques there are however some novel innovations as well as commonalities amongst many of these samplers one of the most robust and simplest sequential sampler designs is the sampler of kennedy et al 1979 consisting of a series of interlinked bottles as each bottle is filled the overflow is diverted to the next sample bottle mixing of samples is prevented by the use of a narrow inlet tube to the base of each sample bottle ronneau et al 1978 developed an entirely mechanical sampler for remote areas driven solely by gravity and using tipping latching sample containers on a circular platter a resistance based rainfall detector was used by asman 1980 whereas gray et al 1974 used a loud speaker which when struck by a raindrop would generate an electronic pulse that would trigger the sampler s mechanism gatz et al 1971 developed a sampler able to collect up to 70 samples 500 1000 ml from 70 mm of rainfall at 1 1 2 m and 91 kg this probably represents the heavyweight class of sequential samplers closely challenged by the raynor and mcneil 1978 sampler at 1 5 1 5 0 64 m both of which were designed as permanent installations a more recent sequential sampler design is the 96 vial sampler of coplen 2010 2015 that incorporates a novel teflon coated cover to prevent evaporation from inactive sample vials in terms of commonality between existing sampler designs many make use of a tipping bucket system to quantify the rainfall amount as many of these samplers segment rainfall by volume a tipping bucket sensor provides an effective way to prevent overflows circular rotating platters are also very common taking advantage of mechanical and electronic simplicity and robustness two more recent designs break with these common design elements akkoyunlu et al 2013 developed a sampler that quantifies rainfall using matlab controlled solenoids located beneath the collector funnel separated by a tube with a volume of 5 ml rainfall was then gravimetrically segmented to 21 individual sample bottles however unlike some older systems that rely on sample bottles filling to enable the next bottle in the sequence the sample bottles were instead capped with solenoids as each solenoid closed water was diverted down the inlet tube to the next bottle until all bottles were filled hartmann et al 2018 developed an arduino based battery powered field auto sampler that uses a cartesian based control system to fill a grid of gas tight sample vials like the design of akkoyunlu et al 2013 an inlet tube with a known volume 12 ml holds the sample prior to storage a peristaltic pump then transfers the sample via piston flow to the sample vials a pair of cannulas pierce the vial cap for sample injection and pressure equalisation and the sealing nature of the rubber vial cap prevents exchange with the atmosphere this device has been used for sampling of cave waters the evaporation prevention mechanism is of significant interest to rainfall sampling however it is unclear at this stage how this system could be adapted to rainfall collection as the thin diameters of the auto sampler cannula will likely face problems with the detritus usually collected in rainfall sampler funnels in addition to the above the 3700c compact and 6712 fullsize samplers teledyne isco usa represent commercial sampler designs that have been adapted for sequential rainfall sampling rücker et al 2019 these samplers utilise the common design element of a circular array with up to 24 sample bottles combined with a peristaltic pump for filling samples there is also ongoing development focused on in field analysis where mobile labs are established at the site of interest with analyses of samples undertaken in near real time berman et al 2009 von freyberg et al 2017 these systems are typically expensive require on site power and regular attendance making them unsuitable at this stage for use in remote locations with limited infrastructure while there are many examples of sequential rainfall samplers in the literature there are relatively few that are designed for discrete daily monthly sampling possibly due to the added complexity required unlike sequential samplers daily monthly samplers have to prevent evaporation of samples for long time periods require accurate timekeeping must be sufficiently robust and must store sufficient samples to operate for months in the field samplers designed for remote sites also need to be small enough to be transported and installed as well as having the means to maintain power supply for the period of deployment of the samplers mentioned above only the auto sampler of hartmann et al 2018 and the sequential sampler of coplen 2010 have most of the components required for daily monthly sampling of rainfall in remote sites however in the case of hartmann et al 2018 there would be significant modifications required to adapt it for rainfall sampling including attachment of a catchment funnel rainfall sensor a water reservoir that the auto sampler can sample and that can be emptied when rainfall has occurred and a filter system to deal with the detritus collected in rainfall catchment funnels the design of coplen 2010 would require less modification with the main changes being to the control software and the inclusion of an evaporation prevention system for the main reservoir where water is stored prior to being transferred to the sample vials the design of akkoyunlu et al 2013 has potential as a monthly sampling system as control of 14 solenoids is manageable with low power electronics such as the open source arduino platform 1 2 fabrication methods and materials design and construction of bespoke equipment such as precipitation samplers can be challenging due to the absence of off the shelf components that can be easily incorporated even parts as simple as a uv stabilised funnel of a suitable size can prove difficult for example asman 1980 made use of a square funnel due to the difficulty of fabricating a large cylindrical funnel injection moulding complex machining and custom electronics are not feasible manufacturing techniques for low volume production as they typically have high initial costs fortunately in the last decade several developments in manufacturing have emerged that enable low volume complex designs to be manufactured at low cost berman 2012 rayna and striukova 2016 two in particular are heavily used in our sampler 3d printing or fused filament fabrication enables the fabrication of complicated plastic components though typically of fairly small size when combined with computer numerical control cnc laser cutting larger designs of considerable complexity can be manufactured more importantly once a design is complete it can easily be fabricated by anyone else with a 3d printer laser cutting or cnc milling capability low cost extensible microprocessor based electronics such as the arduino system provide accurate timing motor control data logging and support for multiple sensors e g hund et al 2016 in the same way that the manufacturing designs can be published and fabricated the program that controls the arduino can be shared 1 3 methods of preventing evaporation with respect to evaporation prevention two methods have demonstrated effectiveness paraffin oil or the submerged inlet tube system of gröning et al 2012 michelsen et al 2018 terzer et al 2016 the oil method prevents evaporation by the addition of a 5 mm layer of paraffin oil to the sample which forms a barrier between the sample and the air the inlet tube system uses a narrow typically 4 mm diameter inlet tube that passes to the bottom of the sample container once the first portion of rainfall enters the sample container the base of the inlet tube is submerged and evaporation can only occur through the small surface area exposed in the inlet tube pressure is equalised through a second tube that vents the container but is sufficiently long and thin to minimise diffusion with the exterior atmosphere the sample container and vent tube are then protected from sunlight to minimise heating and corresponding pressure changes within the sample container given the simplicity and effectiveness of the paraffin oil technique it might be expected to be the preferred collection method however as analysis of the samples is often complicated by the presence of oil in the sample iaea 2014 in many situations the inlet tube method is preferred the choice of sampling bottle must also be considered as isotopes may exchange or permeate through the sample bottle material spangenberg 2012 investigated multiple plastics for their suitability for storing waters for stable isotope analysis namely high and low density polyethylene hdpe ldpe polypropylene polycarbonate polyethylene terephthalate pet perfluoroalkoxy teflon and glass over a timeframe of 659 days significant variations of 5 for δ2h and 2 for δ18o were observed for polycarbonate and pet the recommended materials for use in sample bottles used for stable isotope investigations are glass hdpe or teflon with a preference for thicker walled containers unfortunately there is little overlap between the common laboratory plastics tested by spangenberg 2012 and the plastics commonly used in 3d printing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs polylactic acid pla and polyethylene terephthalate glycol modified petg 1 4 objectives there is a clear need for an autonomous rainfall isotope sampler that can be deployed for long time periods in remote locations given that no design has thus far been able to prevent losses and fractionation due to evaporation there is also need to be able to evaluate and potentially correct for the effects of evaporation on samples this paper presents the development of a low cost us 750 autonomous battery powered sampler using novel construction methods and open source electronics design files are available from https github com mjankor mars rainfall sampler aspects of the design of the sampler are considered with tests quantifying the amount of water lost due to surface wetting along the flow path and the ability of the sampler to divide the flow accurately between daily and monthly samples in addition to discussing the design of the rainfall sampler we also present results investigating the effectiveness of 3d printing bottle caps using abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene petg polyethylene terephthalate glycol pla polylactic acid and acetone treated abs for preserving the integrity of stable isotope ratios in water samples a coupled hydrologic isotopic model was applied to the bottle caps experiment data to predict the change in the isotopic composition of the water based on the water lost from each sample based on the results from the isotopic modelling we describe how a hydrologic isotopic model taking advantage of the differing rates of evaporation from daily and monthly samples can be used to back calculate the original volume and isotopic composition of rainfall samples 2 design principles the many varied designs of rainfall sampler from the last few decades show a few commonalities but no de facto design standard therefore rather than rework an existing design we established several design principles that were used as the basis for development usage the sampler should be easily deployed in remote environments as major cities often have gnip stations and generally have personnel available for event or daily sampling there is little benefit in designing a sampler that is reliant upon significant infrastructure cost samplers will be deployed in remote or uncontrolled environments where there is potential for vandalism weather damage and other mishaps minimising costs means that the loss of a sampler is less of a burden on research budgets or that more samplers can be deployed for better spatial resolution and redundancy outer casing needs to be weatherproof and robust over the timeframe of years it should also prevent wildlife from occupying the sampler and should protect the electronics and interior components from sunlight and excessive heat in addition the sampler should be entirely self contained without any external components such as batteries or cables which can be easily damaged battery powered the sampler must operate without an external power source for a long period of time when combined with solar panels a sampler should be able to operate indefinitely easy to construct as the intent is to provide a design for others to replicate it is beneficial that the construction of the sampler is straightforward this is also an important feature for a field sampler where repairs and maintenance may need to be carried out at remote locations with minimal equipment sampling capabilities capturing both daily and monthly precipitation provides some redundancy in case of failure of some components and allows for quality control by comparing the mass balance of daily and monthly samples flexibility the sampler must be suitable for differing rainfall conditions this is rarely a challenging problem with rainfall samplers as the collection funnel can be changed to increase or reduce the amount of rainfall collected however funnels with specific diameters are sometimes difficult to purchase therefore the design process included the development of multiple funnel options in addition regions with very variable rainfall should be considered requiring a method to prevent overflow from large events the ability to quantify rainfall quantifying the amount of rain is important partly as an explanatory variable for the isotopic composition of rainfall and more importantly to prevent overflows during heavy events and to avoid changing sample bottles on days of no rain preservation of isotope ratios the rainfall sampler is designed to accommodate both the paraffin oil and inlet tube methods to prevent evaporation though it is noted that the inlet tube method has analytical and operational benefits oil is an option regardless of the sampler design however the inlet tube method requires significant space to store the vent tubes and attaching both the inlet tube and vent tube to sample bottles can be complicated or expensive 2 1 design based on the above criteria a low cost automated rainfall sampler was designed for remote field deployment which for simplicity is named mars the choice of outer casing was an early priority in the design process the sampler needed to be large enough to contain multiple sample bottles as well as the sampling mechanism electronics battery and a rainfall collection funnel fortunately a cheap common off the shelf solution was identified 200 l plastic drums typically used for transporting food and chemicals are extremely common and recycled ones can be purchased for very low cost these drums are typically blue hdpe plastic around 4 mm thick and are uv resistant they have a diameter of 58 cm and a height of 93 cm and are typically completely sealed with just two inlet ports for filling and emptying the entire drum is not used for the sampler the top half of the drum is used as a lid that can be easily removed to provide access to the daily sample bottle area the lower third of the drum is used to provide a protected enclosure below the main sampler where monthly sample bottles are placed it should be noted that the lower shell is not designed to be water proof and it is expected that some water will make its way into that space as the seal between upper and lower shells is not watertight there is a drain in the lower shell to prevent water building up in that space the outer shell has had its height reduced as much as possible to minimise the wind effect on rainfall sampling bureau of meteorology 2007 to reduce the chance of it being blown over and to make it easy to transport at the centre of the mars sampler forming the top of the lower shell is a 12 mm plywood baseplate this baseplate holds the electronics battery and provides a firm fixing point for the mechanical system fig 1 positioned about 6 cm above the main baseplate is a rotating platter of 12 mm plywood sitting on a 30 cm turntable bearing this platter has a support frame on it designed to hold 60 225 ml hdpe bottles 48 4 mm diameter 161 mm in two rings of 33 and 27 bottles a central plastic tower sits at the centre of the baseplate and holds the tipping bucket mechanism and a water switch that can divert water from the tipping bucket outflows to either the inner or outer ring of daily sample bottles and between first second or third of the monthly samples one benefit to using a rotating platter is that there is a dead spot in the centre which provides an ideal location to place the vent tubes used for the inlet tube evaporation prevention method the platter s rotation is controlled by a ring gear driven by a stepper motor three 8 mm silicone tubes run from the water switch down the central tower and through the baseplate to 3 monthly sampling bottles 2 l hdpe these bottles also use the inlet tube method with the vent tubes stored inside the lower compartment on the baseplate are a cabinet for the electronics the motor for rotating the main platter a small 12 v 2 1 ah sealed lead acid battery and the support for the platter bearing in addition are two drains in case of overflow of the daily bottles and guides with encapsulated nuts around the outer rim used to guide and secure both top and bottom shells in place the drains are a holdover from an earlier design and should rarely be needed in the current design the electronics are controlled by an arduino nano 3 x duinotech nano v3 0 on a breakout board the breakout board keeps the need for soldering to a minimum with jumper cables used to connect most of the components two stepping motors are used one driving the platter and the other controlling the water switch on the tower a reed sensor determines when the tipping bucket is activated and a microswitch on the tower is used to reset the water switch the position of the main platter is not reset electronically as it is much quicker to disengage the motor and rotate the platter by hand to the starting position a real time clock and an sd card reader keep time and a log for each sample changeover date the arduino platform also means that mars can be easily reprogrammed for different roles such as time or volume based sequential sampling of rainfall events attached to the outer shell is a 3d printed funnel positioned 30 cm above the top of the sampler while it could be positioned closer to the outer shell 30 cm was chosen to prevent splashes from the casing bouncing into the funnel the top half of this funnel is designed to be easily replaced so that different sized funnels can be used there are vents situated around the exterior of the funnel when combined with the drains in the lower shell these vent warm air from the sampler replenished with cooler air from near ground level thus preventing greenhouse style warming in the sampler all vents and drains are designed so that mesh can be applied to exclude insects the tipping bucket design is unique due to the way that it separates the flow path for monthly and daily sample collection fig 2 tipping buckets have been used before to divide rainfall into multiple samples with alternating tips of the bucket passing water through different flow paths e g gatz et al 1971 while such a design is ideal for volumetric based segmentation in a rainfall event it introduces potential systematic uncertainties any difference in tipping volume between the buckets would result in a bias towards either daily or monthly samples in addition most tipping buckets are designed to tip for each 0 2 mm of rainfall if a series of small rainfall events occurs then on a day with rainfall of 0 2 mm all of the rain may go into the daily sample and none into the monthly on a day of 1 4 mm of rainfall 0 8 mm may go to daily and 0 6 mm into the monthly to avoid this issue and taking advantage of the ability to fabricate complex structures with 3d printing our tipping bucket splits the flow for each bucket with half the water from each bucket tip going to daily and half going to monthly samples the tipping bucket is designed to tip with a volume of 4 ml resulting in a tip every 0 2 mm of rainfall with a 159 6 mm diameter funnel the success of this mechanism to divide water equally is dependent on the rainfall sampler being vertically aligned thus a level bubble is built into the design of the tipping bucket fabrication is achieved predominantly using 3d printed components while some of the bottle support structure ring gear and central tower uses laser cut 6 mm acrylic plastic to build the design requires a few basic tools jigsaw drill screwdriver soldering iron as well as a 3d printer able to print abs with a build volume of 200 200 180 all 3d printed parts were printed using a wanhao i3 plus 3d printer components that form the water flowpath were printed with 0 2 mm layer thickness and sanded with 1500 grit sandpaper to smooth the layered structure of the printed surface 3d printing was able to resolve a significant problem in the design of the bottle caps modifying existing bottle caps to include an inlet tube and a vent tube is complicated and space on and above a platter of daily sample bottles is limited using 3d printing we were able to fabricate lids featuring a small funnel to capture incoming water an inlet tube holder that clamped the outside of the inlet tube and a curved vent pipe attachment so that vent tube could be routed horizontally towards the centre of the platter fig 3 by clamping the outside of the inlet tube the smallest diameter along the water flow path was the 4 mm diameter of the inlet tube thereby minimising the chance of blockages 3 design and material tests experimental methods 3 1 quantification of water loss from surface wetting in order to quantify the amount of water lost through wetting of surfaces along the flow path various quantities 12 20 40 60 100 ml of water were dripped into the sampler at a rate of 1 ml s wetting the entire funnel and top surface of the filter representing rainfall events from 0 6 to 5 mm of rainfall the amount of water collected in the bottles were subsequently weighed this experiment was repeated 3 times 3 2 quantification of water loss through bottle caps the use of 3d printed plastics along the water flow path was not considered problematic with regard to preservation of water isotope ratio integrity as water would only be in contact with those plastics briefly however the use of 3d printed plastics for bottle closures was a concern to test which plastics were most effective at preserving the initial water isotope ratio bottle caps were fabricated using three different types of plastic the plastics used were blue pla grey abs and white petg from 3dfillies https 3dfillies com in addition grey abs modified with acetone treatment was also tested where acetone is used to partially dissolve and smooth the abs plastic surface potentially improving the sealing between printed layers garg et al 2016 singh et al 2017 acetone treated parts were placed in a 4 l tin lined with acetone soaked paper towels for 30 min at 20 c then allowed to dry overnight in order to test the effectiveness of different plastic caps and to validate the use of the inlet tube system an experiment was conducted using 33 225 ml hdpe bottles each with 40 ml of recent rainfall equivalent to 4 mm of rain using a 159 6 mm diameter funnel divided between monthly and daily samples for each plastic sealed bottle caps were fabricated using the same design as used in the sampler but with the inlet and outlet holes sealed unsealed bottle caps of the same design were also fabricated in all 4 plastics and combined with the inlet tube and vent tube to replicate the system used in the sampler the inlet and vent tube consisted of 4 mm ø internal ldpe tubing with a 1 mm wall thickness triplicates of each design were fabricated for each plastic giving a total of 24 bottle caps table 1 triplicate bottles using the oil method of evaporation prevention were also prepared with 5 mm of paraffin oil sealing each 40 ml water sample as a control 6 bottles were prepared sealed with wadded polypropylene caps each bottle was weighed when empty then again once the 40 ml of sample was added using an ohaus adventurer ar3130 three decimal point balance each lid was also weighed to assess whether any water had been absorbed or condensed onto the lid over the course of the experiment for the oil bottles each empty bottle was weighed then weighed again with oil and then again once the sample was added each bottle and lid was then weighed again at the end of the 3 months to determine any loss of water each water sample was filtered through a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone syinge filter directly into 2 ml vials for analysis paraffin oil samples were left undisturbed for several hours then a syringe needle was pushed through the side of the bottle well below the paraffin water interface to extract the sample oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were conducted with an l2130 i picarro cavity ring down spectrometer picarro inc santa clara ca usa with a precision against an in house qa standard of 0 05 for δ18o and 0 4 for δ2h each batch of 10 samples was preceded by calibration with 2 in house standards and a quality check against a 3rd in house standard with a final quality check at the end of the sample run each sample and standard were injected 7 times with the first 3 injections discarded to prevent memory effects and the remaining 4 injection results assessed for any residual trend chemcorrect picarro inc was used to validate that

regression was derived for average daily temperature n 38 r2 0 94 and relative humidity n 37 r2 0 88 based on the correlation with kent town being nearest fig 4 one outlier was removed from the correlation ave rh 21 11 2017 as it seemed to be a local effect at the kent town station and was not representative of local conditions or those at the west terrace station the daily average temperature over the course of the experiment was 25 3 c with a range from 16 0 c to 37 c relative humidity ranged from 15 to 81 with an average of 41 7 interpolated pan evaporation estimates for both weather stations were an average of 7 7 mm day for a total of 695 mm over the timeframe of the experiment fig 4 4 2 quantification of water loss from surface wetting the average loss of water due to surface wetting was 1 9 ml 0 53 σ split fairly evenly between the 159 6 mm diameter funnel 0 6 ml tipping bucket and chute 0 6 ml and the water switch and pipework 0 7 ml this means that for a single event assuming no re evaporation of raindrops from the sampler surfaces during the event 90 of rainfall for a 1 mm event is collected rising to 98 for a 5 mm event there is also the potential for up to 4 ml of rainfall 0 2 mm of rainfall with a 159 6 mm diameter funnel to sit within the tipping bucket if insufficient rain falls to tip the bucket the ratio for daily vs monthly rainfall captured was evenly split 336 3 ml for daily 338 1 ml for monthly demonstrating that the tipping bucket is able to divide the flow accurately with 1 variation 4 3 volumetric variation in samples significant differences in water loss were observed between the different techniques and plastics fig 5 table 1 the hdpe control bottles with wadded caps only lost 0 3 0 1 ml of their water over the three months followed by the paraffin oil bottles with a loss of 0 9 0 35 ml with the exception of the sealed abs and pla capped bottles both sealed and unsealed bottles demonstrated consistent differences between plastic types with the inlet tube bottles typically losing 2 0 8 ml of mass relative to the sealed plastics sealed petg and acetone treated abs lost 1 6 0 6 ml and 1 1 0 4 ml respectively while their corresponding inlet tube variants lost 3 5 1 4 ml and 3 1 1 2 ml the sealed abs exhibited an average water loss of 3 5 while the abs inlet tube bottles lost 4 1 6 ml of water the pla sealed bottles lost 3 7 1 5 ml via the sealed lids and 7 5 2 9 ml for the inlet tube lids compared to most of the alternative plastics the paraffin oil and the control all of which had a standard deviation of 0 35 the sealed abs lids exhibited a standard deviation of 0 8 and pla had standard deviations of 1 8 for the sealed and 1 for the inlet tube lids these results suggest that either the fabrication method did not produce pla or abs caps of consistent quality or the caps did not seal the bottles adequately as the inlet tube method is identical for all samples then it would be expected to contribute a similar amount to the water loss for each sample for both triplicates of pla two samples were similar with the third varying by a significant amount assessing just the two similar samples for each set gives a 7 2 73 ml loss for the inlet tube method and 4 8 1 9 ml loss for the sealed cap approximately matching the 2 difference between inlet tube and sealed caps observed in the other plastics likewise the sealed abs appears to be indicative of variation in bottle cap fabrication or the sealing between the caps and the bottles 4 4 isotopic variation in samples changes in the δ18o and δ2h of the water samples correlated strongly with the water loss for each sample and a linear regression between δ18o vs δ2h exhibited a local evaporation line with a slope of 2 5 fig 5 three potential outliers were noted petg04 acet02 and hdpe06 with δ2h values falling approximately 0 75 below the evaporation line these outliers are suspected to have occurred due to an analytical error and are excluded from subsequent modelling and analysis unfortunately these samples were not able to be re analysed excluding these outliers enrichment relative to the average original water composition ranged from an average of 0 14 δ18o and 0 3 δ2h for the paraffin oil samples up to 2 63 δ18o and 6 3 δ2h for the pla inlet tube bottles of the three remaining plastics the inlet tube samples were enriched by an average of 1 21 δ18o and 2 7 δ2h for petg 1 30 δ18o and 3 1 δ2h for abs and 1 10 δ18o and 2 3 δ2h for acetone treated abs sealed caps underwent less enrichment ranging from an average of 0 33 δ18o and 0 44 δ2h for the acetone treated lids to 0 41 δ18o and 0 8 δ2h for petg the sealed untreated abs lids suffered greater enrichment in line with their large and variable water loss 4 5 isotope modelling calibration of the modelled to observed isotope values was achieved through adjustment of the δa value as described in section 3 3 the modelled evaporation line was aligned to the observed evaporation line by applying a 14 increase in equilibrium isotopic separation εeq between δa and δp differences between modelled and observed δ18o for all samples except the three potential outliers ranged from 0 19 to 0 09 δ18o with an average of 0 06 and a σ of 0 07 δ18o differences between modelled and observed δ2h ranged from 0 7 to 0 5 δ2h with an average of 0 12 and a σ of 0 27 δ2h for the 3 outliers the differences in δ18o ranged from 0 06 to 0 16 δ18o and 0 9 to 1 3 δ2h fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 general usage notes experiments designed to test the validity of the mars rainfall sampler indicate that the device has the potential to perform remote automated sampling of rainfall with retention of the primary isotope signature of daily and monthly rainfall as is the case for manually operated rainfall samplers the mars sampler has limits with respect to the minimum amount of rainfall that can be reliably collected both due to water loss due to wetting of surfaces along the flow path and due to evaporative loss through the bottle lids as a result we recommend that the sampler is suitable for daily rainfall collections greater than 10 ml equivalent to 1 mm of rainfall with a 159 6 mm funnel diameter or 0 25 mm of rainfall with a 319 2 mm wide funnel 5 2 evaporation and isotope fractionation the oxygen and hydrogen isotope enrichment along a well defined local evaporation line fig 5 suggests that the primary method of water loss is evaporation with a small amount occurring through the paraffin oil a larger amount through the plastic lids dependent upon plastic type degree of sealing and fabrication consistency and an additional 2 through the tubing most likely through the inlet tube with its 14 cm distance from water surface to atmosphere instead of the 150 cm long vent tube a very small amount of water is also lost either across the plastic walls or through the wadded caps in the control bottles an important result is that there appears to be no fractionation effect that is unique to only one of the isotopologues with the use of untested plastics there was a concern that one of the plastics could preferentially exchange with either deuterium or oxygen e g spangenberg 2012 however our results suggest that this is not the case modelling of the isotopic fractionation of the samples based on the amount of water loss can simulate this evaporative isotopic enrichment in δ18o and δ2h to a precision of 0 07 δ18o and 0 27 δ2h σ1 both the inlet tube and paraffin oil method of preventing evaporation were able to significantly decrease evaporation for the 40 ml samples used in the experiment average evaporation occurred at approximately 0 02 of the pan evaporation rate however both methods still result in some water loss and isotopic enrichment of samples this is especially true for small sample volumes all plastics were substantially less effective than the paraffin oil method at preventing water loss the inlet tube method subtracting estimated losses through the plastics typically resulted in 0 8 ml loss over the 3 months compared to 0 35 ml for the paraffin oil samples this is in contrast to the results from gröning et al 2012 who observed that their sampler outperformed a paraffin oil based sampler over the course of a year the differences between our observations and those of gröning et al 2012 likely arise predominantly as a result of differences in the size and shape of the sampling bottles used the effectiveness of paraffin oil to prevent evaporation depends on the ratio of surface area to volume of the sample and quantification of the rate of water loss through paraffin oil requires consideration of the bottle shape in contrast the primary water loss from the inlet tube method is determined by the diameter and length of the inlet and vent tubes therefore under conditions where the paraffin oil surface area is small then paraffin may outperform the inlet tube method however if the bottle diameter was doubled the surface area of the paraffin oil would be increased fourfold and paraffin may then be outperformed by the inlet tube method as noted in section 1 3 the method of sample analysis must be considered before deployment as paraffin oil contamination can compromise laser spectroscopy based stable isotope analysis iaea 2014 acetone treated abs was the most effective plastic at preventing evaporation followed closely by petg three of the plastics used inlet tube and sealed pla and sealed abs had greater variation of water loss than the other plastics raising concerns about the degree of sealing and the fabrication consistency all the lids had very consistent weights with a typical range of 0 05 g a visual inspection also revealed no significant defects such as delaminated layers or holes in any of the lids however the nature of 3d printed components many layers of plastic fused together means that there is potential for tortuous pathways through the plastic layers resulting in incomplete sealing mccullough and yadavalli 2013 leakage through 3d printed components can be prevented through configuration of printer settings or through post processing of prints applying a slight over extrusion during printing can fill any minor voids and pathways while decreasing dimensional accuracy post processing with acetone treatment to the prints can dissolve filament across and between the layers and improve sealing mccullough and yadavalli 2013 another potential source of leakage is the seal of the lid against the bottle the lids do not include a rubber washer or similar seal instead relying on compression and deformation of the rim of the bottle against the plastic cap to seal one option is to include a sealing washer or wadding in each cap washer seals were not tested here as the sampler requires perfectly fitted washers to be effective placing delicate seals may be an option for a single experiment but is not practical when changing out 60 sample bottles in the field a potentially better solution that will be tested in the future is the printing of seals using tpu thermoplastic polyurethane or a similar flexible filament using this technique means that the seals can be designed specifically for the caps with suitable cutouts for the inlet tube and vent tube with the ongoing development of multi material 3d printers the entire cap could be printed in a single process in the short term our results indicate that acetone treated abs is the most appropriate material for bottle lids more importantly as there is a lot of variability in 3d printers and the software used to prepare prints we recommend that each lid be tested to ensure consistent evaporation a variation of the methodology employed in this paper mass loss over time can be used to ensure lid fabrication consistency 5 3 potential of mass balance closure modelling a distinct advantage of the mars sampler is that both daily and monthly rainfall are captured at the same time this potentially allows for the calculation of the original isotopic composition using a modelling approach based on the difference in evaporation rates of monthly and daily rainfall assuming the volume of rainfall collected by the sampler is split evenly between daily and monthly samples eq 7 7 v i monthly n 1 m v i n daily where v is the volume of the sample the superscript represents the sample type either a daily or monthly sample m is the total number of daily samples collected the subscript describes initial i or final f volume and sample number n each sample may then undergo some minor evaporation while awaiting collection from the sampler the initial sample volume for a daily sample s is therefore related to the final volume by eq 8 8 v i n daily v f n daily d 1 t e d n daily e is the daily volumetric loss from evaporation for each sample type d is the day and t is the total number of days a sample is exposed to evaporation the combined volume of all daily samples n is therefore 9 n 1 m v i n daily n 1 m v f n daily d 1 t e d n daily n 1 m v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t e d n daily and the integrated monthly sample is related to the initial monthly sample by eq 10 10 v i monthly v f monthly d 1 t e d monthly from eq 7 to 10 it can be seen that 11 v f monthly d 1 t e d monthly n 1 m v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t e d n daily we relate daily evaporation rates outside the sampler to evaporation rates within the sampler using a coefficient similar to relating pet to class a pan evaporation such that 12 e d n daily e d n external k daily 13 e d monthly e d external k monthly where eexternal is an evaporative measure either from meteorological records or calculated using the penman equation penman 1948 or similar and k is a coefficient defining a proportional evaporation rate for each sample type there should be two values of k one representing the evaporation rate of the daily bottles kdaily and a second for the monthly bottles kmonthly these coefficients are expected to be similar but not necessarily identical due to the differences between monthly and daily sample bottles rearranging eq 11 and substituting eq 12 and 13 gives eq 14 14 v f monthly n 1 m v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t e d n external k daily d 1 t e d external k monthly for each of eq 7 14 a parallel series of equations can be written for the isotopic mass balance resulting in eq 15 15 δ f monthly v f monthly n 1 m δ f n daily v f n daily n 1 m d 1 t δ e d n daily e d n external k daily d 1 t δ e d monthly e d external k monthly where δ describes the isotopic composition of the sample or evaporative flux the isotopic composition of evaporative fluxes are defined by the e subscript and are calculated using the model of craig and gordon 1965 from eqs 14 and 15 kdaily and kmonthly can be solved as the isotopic fractionation of evaporation is partly determined by the isotopic composition of the sample a numerical solution should be used with isotopic fractionation calculated at daily or shorter timesteps the original volume and isotopic composition for the integrated monthly sample can then be derived from the initial volume and isotopic composition of the daily samples one benefit of applying this modelling technique is that it lowers the ideal sampling requirement from elimination of evaporation from the sample bottle to minimisation and quantification of evaporation from the sample bottle this latter objective is substantially easier to achieve with both paraffin oil and inlet tube methods fulfilling that requirement even under relatively intense evaporation conditions during an australian summer with water losses of up to 9 modelling of the isotopic change due to evaporation was able to achieve a precision of 0 07 δ18o and 0 27 δ2h σ1 6 conclusion we have developed an autonomous daily and monthly rainfall sampler mars able to be deployed and left unattended for up to 3 months between visits capable of collecting and storing up to 60 daily rainfall samples as well as integrated monthly samples the sampler can also be reprogrammed for sequential sampling of rainfall events either on a time or amount basis this sampler makes significant use of modern fabrication techniques and open source technology to minimise costs and complexity we have quantified the effectiveness of various plastics commonly used in 3d printing petg pla abs and acetone treated abs at preventing evaporation with acetone treated abs being most suitable and pla being least suitable the inlet tube method of preventing evaporation from the sample bottles was compared with the use of paraffin oil and it was noted that the type of sampling bottle the amount of water and environmental conditions are significant factors in the relative effectiveness of these methods in our experiments paraffin oil outperformed the inlet tube method in contrast to previous research gröning et al 2012 as neither technique can fully prevent evaporation a modelling approach was developed which takes advantage of the combined monthly and daily sample collection our automated rainfall sampler augmented by a mass balance modelling approach to quantify minor evaporation effects provides a low cost us 750 and effective means of sampling precipitation for isotope analysis with potential applications that span a range of earth

6329,the soil carbon c reservoir involves soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks the influence of soil erosion processes on soil organic carbon soc migration has been investigated in the literature but the influence on soil inorganic carbon sic remains uncertain variations in the proportion of soc and sic in eroded sediment can influence c cycling so we conducted a detailed laboratory study to investigate the selective transport of soc and sic in eroded sediment in treatments with different raindrop sizes and inflow rates we used the boosted regression trees brt models to estimate the soc and sic contents according to the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter h d the maximum shear stress τ max the runoff rate the stream power ω the sediment concentration sc the soil loss rate slr and various particle related factors including d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of non dispersed sediment the brt model explained 42 1 and 56 1 of the variation in the soc and sic contents in the sediment respectively the relative importance of particle related factors was approximately 50 demonstrating that the particle size distribution psd of sediment was a crucial factor for both soc and sic transport the soc content was sensitive to the presence of fine particles while the sic content was largely determined by coarse particles because smaller particles with a higher specific surface area tended to adsorb more soc whereas coarser particles contained more carbonates in the form of binding agents in sediment under intensive rainfall on steep slopes the soc tended to be depleted while the sic was slightly enriched our study demonstrates that both sic and soc were selectively transported by water erosion and fills gaps in this field of research moreover this work implies that the psd of the sediment provides important information about the variation in soc and sic and should be considered when modelling the global c cycle keywords soil organic carbon soil inorganic carbon particle size distribution erosion processes 1 introduction soil is the largest terrestrial carbon c pool and includes soil organic carbon soc and soil inorganic carbon sic soc has attracted considerable attention mainly because soc accounts for most of the carbon content in most regions around the world and has a potentially rapid response to changes in the environment fang et al 2001 rasmussen 2006 wang et al 2012 in contrast to soc sic has been frequently disregarded because its formation processes are slow and it has very slow exchange with atmospheric co2 zamanian et al 2016 however in arid and semi arid regions i e approximately one third of earth s land surface the sic stock is 2 10 times greater than the soc stock schlesinger 1982 mi et al 2008 tan et al 2014 and the sic accumulation rates are higher than those of soc wang et al 2015 temperature and precipitation were the main climatic factors influencing sic formation and accumulation zamanian et al 2016 for example the sic accumulation rates increase with increasing temperature gocke and kuzyakov 2011 precipitation affects carbonate dissolution and reprecipitation and the former induces co2 uptake while the latter releases a flux of co2 to the soil surface walvoord et al 2005 moreover in the context of global climate change soils in arid and semi arid ecosystems seem to be a sink for atmospheric co2 in organic or inorganic forms with increasing precipitation because of vegetation growth however this stored c can be released if the rainfall decreases stone 2008 schlesinger 2017 han et al 2018 thus it is necessary to consider both soc and sic when estimating the global c dynamics soil erosion is a key pathway that governs the global c cycle lal and pimentel 2008 quinton et al 2010 doetterl et al 2016 berhe et al 2018 and it involves three major mechanisms 1 the replacement of soc at eroding sites and the decrease in soc available for decomposition 2 the deep burial of c and inhibited decomposition upon burial and 3 the enhanced decomposition of soc associated with soil breakdown during detachment and transport processes van oost et al 2007 aggregate breakdown exposes the previously encapsulated soc within aggregates to microbial activities which accelerates soc mineralization and co2 release six et al 2002 polyakov and lal 2008 six and paustian 2014 the soc content of soil aggregates and primary particles in different size classes is heterogeneous hu and kuhn 2014 macro aggregates generally contain more soc than micro aggregates due to aggregate hierarchy tisdall and oades 1982 oades and waters 1991 while fine primary particles are prone to enrichment in soc because their specific surface area is larger than that of coarse primary particles rodrı guez et al 2004 nadeu et al 2011 soc enriched sediment commonly composed of silt and clay sized particles derived from particle size selectivity may be deposited and experience deep burial which inhibits soc decomposition stallard 1998 yoo et al 2005 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2014b doetterl et al 2016 liu et al 2017 in contrast to soc few studies have focused on the effect of erosion on sic soil erosion promotes sic dissolution by increasing the exposure of sic to the percolating water front which increases the depth of sic accumulation and decreases the total amount of sic through the promotion of sic dissolution zamanian et al 2016 the net effect of soil erosion as a c source or sink largely depends on the disruptive level of aggregates and the degree of sediment selectivity which are influenced by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dominant erosion processes schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sediment can become enriched in soc during interrill erosion which results from the selective transport of silt and clay sized particles schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 koiter et al 2017 less selectivity was found in rill erosion because large aggregates and particles were also transported due to the large transport capacity of rill flow proffitt and rose 1991 schiettecatte et al 2008 wang and shi 2015 similarly high intensity rainfall events lead to less selective detachment and sorting of labile soc fractions than low intensity rainfall events jacinthe et al 2004 doetterl et al 2016 aggregate stripping by raindrop impact results in the enrichment of soc because the outer layers of the soil aggregates contain more soc than the inner core ghadiri and rose 1991 however this trend does not always occur and it may depend upon aggregate stability versus the adverse effect of erosive forces schiettecatte et al 2008 raindrop size flow depth and their complex interactions may influence aggregate disintegration and the subsequent transport and deposition processes the amount of energy of raindrop and overland flow applied to the eroding bed varies with the raindrop size and flow depth interactions palmer 1963 kinnell 2013 for raindrops falling into the flow the energy change of the flow and that of the impacting raindrop itself have been both directly measured and indirectly calculated ferreira and singer 1985 bradford et al 1987 hartley and alonso 1991 gao et al 2003 josserand and zaleski 2003 raindrop energy is enhanced by a thin flow covering the soil surface by increasing the raindrop mass until it reaches a critical depth moss and green 1983 ferreira and singer 1985 gao et al 2003 when the flow depth is larger than the critical flow depth the water layer absorbs a proportion of the raindrop energy by causing splash and wave action leading to a decrease in the raindrop induced particle detachment efficiency with increasing flow depth palmer 1963 the interactive effect between raindrops and flow palmer 1963 moss and green 1983 hartley and alonso 1991 gao et al 2003 nouhou bako et al 2016 and the particle size selectivity during erosion processes slattery and burt 1997 martínez mena et al 1999 wang and shi 2015 have been investigated thus we can further investigate the c migration associated with particle size selectivity along with the variation in erosive forces influenced by the raindrop size and flow depth previous studies have demonstrated that the effect of soil erosion on soc migration was associated with aggregate breakdown and sediment size selectivity schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 but its influence on sic remains uncertain sic transport may differ from soc transport during erosion processes mainly because of the differences in size density and shape of organic particles and mineral particles lithogenic carbonate commonly occurs in the coarse size fraction while pedogenic carbonate usually precipitates in the silt and clay size fractions kraimer and monger 2009 the density of mineral particles 0 9 1 3 mg m 3 is larger than that of organic particles 2 6 2 75 mg m 3 brady and weil 2001 as a result organic particles require less energy to be transported than mineral particles in the same size class we hypothesized that the selective transport of sic occurs during the erosion processes and that the proportion of soc and sic in the erosional and depositional sites would vary increases in soc lead to increased dissolution and reprecipitation of carbonates in soil bronick and lal 2005 and sic can suppress the mineralization of soc clough and skjemstad 2000 as a result variations in the proportion of soc and sic caused by soil erosion could alter the c cycling accordingly the objectives of our study were to 1 identify the distribution of soc and sic in different size classes of eroded sediment under the influence of different raindrop sizes and inflow rates and 2 investigate the effect of aggregate breakdown and sediment size selectivity on soc and sic transport during erosion processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and preparation the soil we used in this study is derived from loess which is distributed widely on the semi arid loess plateau tsunekawa et al 2014 the soil was collected from yangling in shaanxi province china and the sampling field has been cultivated with corn and wheat for many years the sampling depth was 20 cm which represents the plough layer the physical and chemical properties of the selected soil are illustrated in table 1 the sampled soil was air dried and un decomposed plant residuals were removed then the samples were crushed and passed through a 10 0 mm sieve and filled into soil flumes that were 100 0 cm long 16 5 cm wide and 25 0 cm deep fig 1 we vertically divided the flume into five layers by using a marker drawing inside the flume the weight of the soil samples for each layer can be calculated based on the bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 table 1 soils were gently compacted in each layer to diminish aggregate breakdown and to obtain the desired bulk density each soil layer was raked lightly before the next layer was packed to diminish the discontinuity between layers we packed the soil in five successive 5 cm thick layers rather than packing the soil in only one layer in order to guarantee the homogeneity of the soil the final layer of soil was levelled within limits imposed by the aggregates to ensure uniform initial surface conditions and to simulate the ploughing process and the preparation of a seed bed the prepared soil was pre saturated for more than 10 h before all experiments additionally we used a new soil for each experiment rather than using the same soil that was kept in the same flume for a series of experiments 2 2 rainfall simulation and water scouring experiments the rainfall simulation and water scouring experiments were carried out in the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau the chosen rainfall intensity was 90 mm h 1 which was the typical intensity of storms in the study area where more than 50 of the soil erosion amount was caused mainly by a few heavy rain or rainstorm events cai et al 1998 in all experiments we maintained the same rainfall intensity but changed the raindrop size using a rainfall simulator hanging 4 m above the soil bed fig 1 rainfall intensity is usually positively correlated with raindrop size cerdá 1997 yakubu et al 2016 raindrops smaller than 1 mm were not considered in this study because 90 mm h 1 is a very high intensity for which large raindrops are expected the size of raindrops was controlled by a series of interchangeable hypodermic needles or polyethylene tubes attached to hypodermic needles specifically 25 gauge needles 0 25 mm i d 0 51 mm o d and polyethylene tubes 0 80 mm i d 1 90 mm o d attached to 22 gauge needles 0 41 mm i d 0 71 mm o d were used to produce raindrop sizes of 1 34 mm and 4 04 mm respectively and the corresponding fall velocities were 2 81 m s 1 and 7 10 m s 1 we used a precipitation monitor that was designed based on the particle imaging transient visual measurement technology to measure the specific raindrop size and the corresponding fall velocity guo et al 2015 simultaneously inflow water was provided by a peristaltic pump for scouring furthermore 0 65 l min 1 1 l min 1 and 2 l min 1 inflows were selected based on the results of the pre experiments the pre saturated soil flume was adjusted to a slope of 15 because lands with slopes between 10 and 20 are widely used for agriculture in china the water was first filled into a sink installed at the upstream part of the flume and then it was passed through a baffle and entered a stilling bay before entering the experimental area all of these operations were performed to ensure that the inflow water had a uniform depth across the width of the flume filtered water was used for all experiments and three replicates were conducted for each trial 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 runoff and sediment measurements runoff and sediment were sampled at 1 min intervals or 2 min intervals during the entire experiment depending on the amount of sediment during each period of sampling 200 ml of runoff plus sediment was first collected in a beaker to analyse the sediment size distribution meanwhile the rest of the runoff and sediment in that sampling period was collected in a bucket to measure the volume of runoff and the amount of sediment it is worth noting that the runoff rate was calculated by the runoff volume in the beaker plus the volume in the bucket the sediment concentration sc was calculated according to the runoff and sediment in the bucket neglecting the portion in the beaker the sc accelerated quickly in the following seconds following the collection in the beaker thus this value could be profoundly overestimated if the portion in the beaker was considered 2 3 2 measurements of flow velocity and rill development during the rainfall simulation and water scouring experiments we used a dye tracer kmno4 method to measure the maximum flow velocity at 1 min intervals for rill development we focused on the flow velocity in rills longer than 50 cm because there is much uncertainty in the measure of flow velocity in shorter rills the mean flow velocity was obtained by multiplying a correction factor α which was between 0 2 and 0 8 planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 investigated the effects of sediment load on α on steep slopes and at high sediment loads and found that α decreased with increasing sediment load and was between 0 233 and 0 682 with a mean value of 0 466 considering that our experiments were conducted on steep slopes and involved a high sc we chose an α value of 0 466 for sheet flow and 0 8 for rill flow meanwhile the rills features e g length width and depth were continuously measured by a millimetre scale ruler at 10 cm intervals during the erosion event the rill dimensions and the corresponding time were recorded 2 3 3 measurements of particle aggregate size and associated carbon content the runoff and sediment collected in beakers were immediately transported to the laboratory to analyse the particle size distribution psd of the sediment by a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk each sample was analysed twice to obtain the psd of the sediment with and without dispersion non dispersed sediment contained aggregates and primary particles e g clay slit and sand while fully dispersed sediment contained only primary particles the samples were first analysed by the malvern mastersizer 2000 without the dispersion treatment to obtain the non dispersed psd of the sediment afterward the samples were treated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic matter dispersed in sodium hexametaphosphate and then subjected to ultrasonic dispersion to obtain their dispersed psd the non dispersed and dispersed psd values of the original un eroded soil were measured by the same method used to measure the psd of the sediment table 2 for the treatments with the 1 34 mm raindrops and 4 04 mm raindrops under the 1 l min 1 inflow the sediments collected in buckets at 1 3 8 and 14 min were gently wet sieved by hand on a column of seven sieves with mesh sizes of 2 1 0 5 0 25 0 15 0 075 and 0 053 mm the different fractions of sediment were oven dried at 40 c and weighed and then the total carbon content and organic carbon content were analysed by an elemental analyser elementar vario pyro cube germany the inorganic carbon content was derived from the difference between the total carbon content and the organic carbon content additionally the contents of organic carbon and inorganic carbon were measured in the sediment samples collected at 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 and 14 min in all treatments the organic and inorganic carbon contents of the original soil were measured using the same procedure as that for the sediment 2 4 data calculation and statistical analysis 2 4 1 indices of particle size distribution we used d50 d 4 3 and d 3 2 to represent the psd d50 is known as the median diameter and is the value of the particle size diameter at the 50 mark in the cumulative distribution d 4 3 is the volume weighted mean or mass moment mean diameter and reflects the size of the particles that constitute the bulk of the sample volume therefore d 4 3 is the most sensitive to the presence of coarse particles in the size distribution d 3 2 is the surface weighted mean or surface area moment mean diameter and is closely related to the specific surface area so this index is the most sensitive to the presence of fine particles in the size distribution alderliesten 1991 malvern instruments 2015 d 4 3 and d 3 2 can be calculated by 1 d m n v i d i m v i d i n where v i is the relative volume in class i with a mean class diameter of d i 2 4 2 flow depth the flow depth in our experiments is very shallow because of the steep slopes to measure flow depth accurately we assumed that the flow was uniform and that the mean flow depth h m can be calculated by 2 h q v w t where q m3 is the runoff volume during t s v is the mean flow velocity m s 1 and w is the flume width for sheet erosion and is the main rill width after rill development m to reduce the uncertainty arising from velocity measurement we only included the flow depth in rills longer than 50 cm when the rill was initiated 2 4 3 energy associated with runoff the overland flow hydraulic characteristics such as stream power and flow shear stress are important for determining the erosion process stream power refers to the runoff energy per unit area some or all of which may be available to detach and transport soil particles and aggregates from the erosion surface bagnold 1966 teixeira and misra 1997 stream power is a better predictor of sediment transport capacity than shear stress mahmoodabadi et al 2014 and is closely related to the soc concentration liu et al 2017 stream power ω w m 2 can be calculated by 3 ω ρ l g s q w where ρ l is the water density 103 kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 s is the sine of the slope q is the discharge rate m3 s 1 and w is the width of the flume or rill m similar to the calculation of flow depth we focused only on the stream power in rills longer than 50 cm and here w was the average rill width 2 4 4 energy associated with raindrop size and flow depth shear stress applied on the soil surface mostly determines the erosion rate an algebraic fitted relationship among raindrop size water depth and maximum shear stress at the soil surface has been established by numerical simulations hartley and alonso 1991 nouhou bako et al 2016 the dimensionless maximum shear stress τ max largely depends on the raindrop radius r m the water depth h m and three dimensionless parameters the reynolds number re the froude number fr and the weber number we which represent the relative influence of viscous surface tension and gravitational forces hartley and alonso 1991 for raindrops the value of re is between 6500 and 23 000 hartley and julien 1992 we ranges from 50 to 12 000 and fr ranges from 800 to 1400 for natural rainfall nouhou bako et al 2016 τ max can be calculated by 4 τ max 2 85 ρ l v 0 2 h r 1 2 6 re 0 55 c 1 where c1 is between 0 and 1 which indicates the relatively weak effect of gravity and surface tension forces and their interaction with water depth and is defined by 5 c 1 1 e x p 1 6 θ h r 6 θ f r we 0 5 f r we 0 5 where θ reflects the effect on the boundary shear stress field which is associated with fr and we and θ is small if either fr or we are small re fr and we can be calculated by 7 re ρ l v 0 r μ l 8 fr v 0 2 2 r g 9 we ρ l v 0 2 r γ where ρ l is the density of water 103 kg m 3 v 0 is the fall velocity of raindrops m s 1 μ l is the water viscosity 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 and γ is the surface tension 0 02 kg s 2 2 4 5 statistical analysis and model evaluation we used boosted regression trees brt to predict the carbon content in sediment based on the selected predictors including the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter h d the maximum shear stress τ max the runoff rate the stream power ω the sc the soil loss rate slr and various particle related factors including d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of the non dispersed sediment brt is a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques that establishes large numbers of relatively simple decision trees and uses the boosting method to optimize predictive performance elith et al 2008 the compromise between model complexity and predictive performance in brt can resolve the problem of multicollinearity and fit complicated response functions efficiently while preventing overfitting elith et al 2008 bhatt et al 2013 dormann et al 2013 the brt analysis was run in the program r using the gbm package three vital parameters of the brt learning rate tree complexity and bag fraction were set to 0 001 5 and 0 5 respectively by using the rules of thumb proposed by elith et al 2008 the optimal number of trees was identified by 10 fold cross validation which was implemented in the gbm package in the procedure of 10 fold cross validation the available data are randomly divided into 10 subsets there are 10 training datasets each comprising 9 subsets for training and a corresponding omitted subset for testing thus 10 brt models are established simultaneously and the predictive performance of the models is tested as trees are added the number of trees with the lowest prediction error is recorded as the optimal number of trees once the predictive performance declines with increasing numbers of trees elith et al 2008 moreover brt can calculate the relative importance and partial dependence of each predictor elith et al 2008 the relative importance is measured based on formulae developed by friedman 2001 implemented in the gbm package and is based on the frequency of the predictor being selected and how much the selected predictor can improve the model buston and elith 2011 the relative importance can assess the contribution of each predictor to the final model and is scaled so that the sum adds up to 100 thus more important predictors have higher values elith et al 2008 the partial dependence of each predictor is achieved by partial dependence functions friedman 2001 indicating the influence of a predictor on the response after accounting for the average effects of the remaining predictors in the model elith et al 2008 in our study the sample sizes for soc and sic were 110 and 106 respectively after omitting all rows with any missing values we used 80 of the data sampling without replacement to train the brt model and 20 of the data was used for quasi out of sample model testing the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the model performance r 2 is the most common criterion for model evaluation and it indicates the proportionate amount of variation in the response variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model this value can be calculated by 10 r 2 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the mae is an average of the absolute errors between the predicted and observed values the mae describes the difference between the observed and predicted values and can be calculated by 11 mae i 1 n p i o i n the rmse refers to the difference in the observed and predicted values in the appropriate units indicating the goodness of fit of the model and it can be calculated by 12 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where oi is the observed value pi is the predicted value with i 1 to n data points and o is the mean of the observed values 3 results 3 1 erosion processes and sediment size the erosional responses to the different raindrop sizes and inflow rates are illustrated in table 3 the sc and slr from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact were larger than those from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact despite the larger inflow rates table 3 indicating that the influence of raindrop size on sc and slr outweighed the influence of flow in this study the non dispersed median particle size d50 of sediment fluctuated with time fig 2 the d50 with rainfall alone was the smallest while the d50 with inflow alone was the largest among all treatments fig 2d and e demonstrating that aggregates were more likely to be broken down by raindrops rather than by flow because the stress applied by raindrop impacts was much larger than that by flow loch and donnollan 1983 the d50 with rainfall and inflow applied together was smaller than that with flow alone but larger than that with rainfall alone fig 2f the d50 under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was usually smaller than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact when maintaining the same inflow rate fig 2 indicating that larger raindrop energy caused by the larger raindrops induced more severe aggregate breakdown wang et al 2014a the difference in d50 under the 4 04 and 1 34 mm raindrop impacts increased with the increase in inflow rates fig 2 probably because more raindrop energy was dissipated in deeper flows and a greater proportion of energy was dissipated from 1 34 mm raindrops than from 4 04 mm raindrops for the 4 04 and 1 34 mm raindrops under the 1 l min 1 inflow we further compared the difference in psd before and after dispersion fig 3 the particle size of the sediment decreased after dispersion fig 3a indicating that sediment contained aggregates consistent with the findings of slattery and burt 1997 and martínez mena et al 1999 the relative proportion of the non dispersed and dispersed particle sizes indicates how the different fractions are transported during erosion processes a value of 1 suggests that these fractions are fully disaggregated by raindrop impact and or runoff and are transported as primary particles a value less than 1 for the finer fractions suggests that the content of these fractions increases after being dispersed in the laboratory and indicates they often form aggregates and are transported as aggregates rather than as primary particles and a value greater than 1 for the coarser fractions suggests the content of these fractions decreases after being dispersed in the laboratory because most of these coarser fractions were composed of finer fractions and it is difficult to identify how these coarser fractions are transported martínez mena et al 1999 particles in the range of 0 002 0 05 mm were transported as primary particles while particles 0 002 mm were more likely transported as primary particles under 4 04 mm raindrop impact than those under 1 34 mm raindrop impact fig 3b the enrichment ratio er is defined as the ratio of the dispersed psd of sediment to that of the original soil which reflects the degree to which a given size class has been removed from or enriched in the transported sediment slattery and burt 1997 particles 0 002 and 0 05 mm were enriched in the sediment while particles in the range of 0 002 0 05 mm were depleted in the sediment fig 3c 3 2 carbon content 3 2 1 carbon content in sediment associated with raindrop sizes and inflow rates the contents of soc and sic in sediment fluctuated with time but their variation with time did not reach significance from a statistical standpoint therefore we only presented the contents of soc and sic in sediment under different treatments and each treatment can be considered to have ten replicates fig 4 the soc content in the sediment was significantly less than the sic content p 0 05 because the sic was the main binding agent of the aggregates of the tested soil and the aggregate breakdown induced by raindrop impact and runoff enhanced the proportion of transportable particles containing sic at a given inflow rate the soc and sic contents in the sediment differed significantly under the different sized raindrop impacts treatments except for the 0 65 and 1 l min 1 inflows respectively p 0 05 fig 4 the exceptions for 0 65 and 1 l min 1 inflows are difficult to explain because many factors would influence the soc and sic contents in the sediment such as particle selectivity and the dissolution of c in the runoff we cannot deduce whether 0 65 l min 1 and 1 l min 1 are thresholds or only a deviation so we focused on the general trend a remarkable difference in the soc content in the sediment among various inflow rates was found under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact and no raindrop impact treatments p 0 05 while the difference was not significant under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact treatment fig 4a partly because the soc release associated with aggregate breakdown caused by 4 04 mm raindrops was already pronounced and the different inflow rates did not change the result fig 4a shows that the soc content in the sediment in treatments with inflow alone was generally larger than that in the treatments with rainfall and inflow applied together fig 4b illustrates that the differences in the sic content in sediment with and without raindrop impact at various flow rates were significant p 0 05 and the sic content in the treatment with the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was the highest among the other treatments according to the er of the soc and sic the soc was depleted in the sediment while the sic was slightly enriched in the sediment probably because of the effects of particle selective transport processes fig 5 3 2 2 carbon content of different sized aggregates in sediment we further compared the differences in the soc and sic contents in various sized aggregates in the sediment from the 4 04 and 1 34 mm raindrop impacts under the 1 l min 1 inflow and in the original soil fig 6 aggregates in the size between 0 075 and 0 15 mm seemed to contain the most soc and sic relative to the other aggregate sizes in both the sediment and the original soil the difference in the soc content in different sized aggregates in the original soil was not significant while that in the sediment was significant p 0 05 indicating that soc sorting by erosion exists fig 6a the differences in soc content among the original soil the sediment resulting from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact treatment and the sediment resulting from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact treatment were significant only for aggregates in the size between 0 075 and 0 25 mm p 0 05 fig 6a in contrast the sic contents in variously sized aggregates changed significantly both in the original soil and in the exported sediment p 0 05 fig 6b thus these changes were more pronounced than those in the soc content fig 6b indicates that for the same aggregate size class the sic content varied remarkably among the original soil the sediment resulting from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact treatment and the sediment resulting from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact treatment except for aggregates smaller than 0 053 mm the sic content under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was often larger than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact even in the same aggregate size class additionally aggregates smaller than 0 053 mm accounted for most of the sediment while aggregates in the range between 1 and 2 mm accounted for most of the original soil fig 6c d and e 3 3 determinants of carbon content in sediment we investigated the correlations between the soc and sic in sediment and the possible predictors including the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter h d the maximum shear stress τ max the runoff rate the stream power ω the sc the slr and the particle related factors d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of non dispersed sediment fig 7 fig 7 indicates that some of the variables showed a good correlation with soc and sic but also showed correlations among themselves leading to problems of multicollinearity in a multiple regression model which would inflate the variance of regression parameters and lead to the misidentification of relevant predictors in a statistical model dormann et al 2013 to avoid multicollinearity we used brt to estimate the soc and sic contents according to the possible predictors the r 2 mae and rmse values for the brt model for soc were 0 42 0 29 and 0 35 respectively fig 8 a the r 2 mae and rmse values for the brt model for sic were 0 56 0 53 and 0 80 respectively fig 8b the relative importance of the variables estimated by the brt model implied that the sc was the most important variable for the prediction of soc fig 9 while the runoff rate was the most important variable for the prediction of sic fig 10 the relative importance of the particle related variables d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of non dispersed sediment was approximately 50 for both soc and sic notably we focused on non dispersed psd rather than on dispersed psd in the brt models because the sediment contained aggregates and the non dispersed psd governed the actual sediment transport slattery and burt 1997 partial dependence plots for the five most influential predictors in the brt models are illustrated in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 indicates that soc decreased with increasing runoff rate and slr after accounting for the average effects of the other variables in the brt model in contrast sic increased increasing runoff rate and slr fig 10 soc markedly increased with increasing clay content while sic markedly increased with increasing sand content figs 9 and 10 4 discussion the net effect of transport on eroded c depends on the physico chemical characteristics of the soil the amount and nature of the eroded c and the erosion mechanisms and factors related to the erosion mechanisms such as rainfall intensity and surface roughness schiettecatte et al 2008 hu and kuhn 2014 doetterl et al 2016 liu et al 2017 in this study we used the same soil to investigate the influence of different raindrop sizes and inflow rates on the variations in eroded c which mainly arose from the different aggregate breakdowns and their selective transport figs 2 and 3 the sediment size from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact was larger than that from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact under the same inflow rate for water scouring fig 2 demonstrating that the influence of larger raindrops on disintegrating aggregates outweighed their influence on transporting them in this study which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2014a in contrast sediment is expected to contain more large particles if raindrops have little effect on aggregate breakdown whereas raindrops enhance the erosive power of overland flow by increasing its turbulence bradford et al 1987 the brt models we established explained 42 1 and 56 1 of the variations in the soc and sic contents in the sediment respectively the importance ranking of the determinants for soc differed from that for sic figs 9 and 10 indicating that different major factors controlled the different types of c during erosion processes identifying these differences is crucial for better understanding the response of c migration to erosion according to figs 9 and 10 the psd was crucial for both soc and sic transport particles 0 002 and 0 05 mm were enriched in the sediment fig 3c particles 0 002 mm were preferentially removed by runoff because of their low settling velocity asadi et al 2007 moreover particles 0 002 mm usually formed aggregates and heavy particles including large aggregates and coarse primary particles were rather transported by rolling down the steep slopes due to the large gravitational and inertial forces in the direction of the slopes shi et al 2012 the enrichment of 0 05 mm particles fig 3c was also due to the large gravitational and inertial forces of these coarse particles in the direction of the steep slopes particles in the range of 0 002 0 05 mm are easily dispersed miller and baharuddin 1987 and tended to be depleted in sediment fig 3 because they were neither suspended in runoff nor rolled down the slope the reason for the influence of psd on the content of soc and sic in sediment is that the c content in different sized aggregates particles is heterogeneous fig 6 which is consistent with the results of polyakov and lal 2008 and hu and kuhn 2014 for aggregates in the same size class the stability of aggregates under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was stronger than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact because the aggregates that survived the 4 04 mm raindrop impact experienced larger erosive forces than those that survived the 1 34 mm raindrop impact we speculate that more binding agents may exist in the aggregates that survived the 4 04 mm raindrop impact consequently the sic content in sediment under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was significantly larger than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact p 0 05 fig 6 because sic is the major binding agent in aggregates in soils in arid and semi arid environments bronick and lal 2005 which was the type of soil used in this study fig 6 also shows that the sediment contained large amounts of aggregates smaller than 0 053 mm which largely covers the contribution of other sized aggregates to c content and determines the soc and sic contents in sediment the clay content and d 3 2 were important for the soc content fig 9 indicating that the soc content was sensitive to the existence of fine particles as has been shown by previous studies schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 li et al 2016 koiter et al 2017 liu et al 2017 sand content was the most critical particle related factor for the sic content fig 10 implying that the sic content was largely determined by coarse particles based on table 2 and fig 3b the proportion of the sand sized fraction in both the source soil and exported sediment decreased after dispersion indicating that these fractions mainly occurred as aggregates in our study the source soil was derived from loess which was mostly aggregated by carbonate liu et al 1978 carbonates may increase macroaggregate stability but decrease microaggregate stability at low soc concentrations boix fayos et al 2001 the particulate carbonate is mainly composed of calcite and has particle sizes ranging from 0 02 to 0 06 mm accounting for 0 5 2 5 of the soil the remaining silt sized fractions are mainly composed of quartz and feldspar and the clay sized fractions are mainly composed of illite and chlorite liu et al 1978 accordingly the positive correlation between soc content and clay content was due to the higher specific surface area of smaller particles adsorbing soc and the positive correlation between sic content and sand content was because more carbonates were present in the coarser particles in the form of a binding agent moreover the soc content declined with increasing sc and slr fig 9 which was consistent with the results of schiettecatte et al 2008 the soc content in the sediment decreased when the amount of sediment increased because the proportion of fine particles decreased in contrast there is little information about the factors influencing sic during erosion processes in previous studies the slr played a vital role in the sic content fig 10 and the sic content increased with increasing slr probably because the proportion of coarse particles in the sediment increased as slr increased these results emphasize the considerable role of the psd on soc and sic migration soc was slightly depleted in the sediment in this study fig 5 this result differs from those of many previous studies that demonstrated that soc is usually enriched in sediment schiettecatte et al 2008 li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 our result is probably because of the low soc content in the original soil and the large runoff carrying capacity that exists on steep slopes leading to the enrichment of coarse particles that contain little soc in the sediment thus soc tended to be slightly depleted while sic was slightly enriched in the sediment under intensive rainfall on these steep slopes fig 5 the psd and the proportion of soc and sic in erosional and depositional sites consequently varied furthermore sic can suppress the mineralization of soc clough and skjemstad 2000 while increases in soc lead to increased dissolution and reprecipitation of carbonates in soil bronick and lal 2005 accordingly the selective transport processes may not only currently influence c migration but may also influence the future changes in c additionally variations in sic in sediment were investigated in our study in order to fill gaps in this field of research and to establish a foundation for further research note that the r 2 of the brt models for soc and sic were relatively low i e 0 42 and 0 56 respectively partly because of the dissolution of c in the runoff and the randomness of the collapse of the rill sidewalls or collisions between entrained aggregates and the rill bed after rill development during the erosion process our results highlight the complexity of predicting the changes in the contents of soc and sic even so our study demonstrates that the psd of the sediment provides important information about the variation in the soc and sic which should be considered when modelling the global c cycle however the low accuracy of flow velocity measured by the dye method is the limitation of our study because the correction factor for obtaining mean flow velocity is influenced by many parameters planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 which shows spatiotemporal changes and consequently increases difficulty to determine the exact correction factor new methods developed recently such as a solute centroid method zhuang et al 2018 would be used in the future research for improving the accuracy of measuring mean flow velocity additionally quantitative control of the soil surface roughness can make the experiment more standardized 5 conclusions dynamic changes in the contents of soc and sic contents in sediment during the erosion processes were investigated the difference in soc and sic contents in sediment among treatments with various raindrop sizes and inflow rates was significant p 0 05 we used brt to estimate soc and sic according to the h d τ max runoff rate ω sc slr and the particle related factors d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of the non dispersed sediment the brt models explained 42 1 and 56 1 of the variations in the soc and sic contents in the sediment respectively the importance ranking of the determinants for soc differed from that for sic indicating that different major factors controlled the different types of c during the erosion processes the relative importance of the particle related factors was approximately 50 demonstrating that psd was a crucial factor for both soc and sic transport the reason for the influence of psd on the soc and sic contents in the sediment is that the c content varies among different sized aggregates particles is heterogeneous the soc content was sensitive to the presence of fine particles while the sic content was largely determined by coarse particles because smaller particles with higher specific surface areas tend to adsorb more soc whereas coarser particles tend to contain more carbonates in the form of binding agents with increasing slr and sc the soc content decreased while the sic content increased because the proportion of fine particles containing more soc decreased and the proportion of coarse particles containing more sic increased in the sediment under intensive rainfall on steep slopes soc tended to be slightly depleted while sic was slightly enriched thereby changing the proportions of soc and sic in erosional and depositional sites in summary we identified the importance ranking of the determinants for the soc and sic contents and demonstrated that the psd of eroded sediment was a crucial factor for the soc and sic contents in this study thus the effect of psd should be considered when modelling the global c cycle these results provide useful information about the factors influencing sic during erosion processes filling gaps in this field of research and

6329,the soil carbon c reservoir involves soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks the influence of soil erosion processes on soil organic carbon soc migration has been investigated in the literature but the influence on soil inorganic carbon sic remains uncertain variations in the proportion of soc and sic in eroded sediment can influence c cycling so we conducted a detailed laboratory study to investigate the selective transport of soc and sic in eroded sediment in treatments with different raindrop sizes and inflow rates we used the boosted regression trees brt models to estimate the soc and sic contents according to the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter h d the maximum shear stress τ max the runoff rate the stream power ω the sediment concentration sc the soil loss rate slr and various particle related factors including d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of non dispersed sediment the brt model explained 42 1 and 56 1 of the variation in the soc and sic contents in the sediment respectively the relative importance of particle related factors was approximately 50 demonstrating that the particle size distribution psd of sediment was a crucial factor for both soc and sic transport the soc content was sensitive to the presence of fine particles while the sic content was largely determined by coarse particles because smaller particles with a higher specific surface area tended to adsorb more soc whereas coarser particles contained more carbonates in the form of binding agents in sediment under intensive rainfall on steep slopes the soc tended to be depleted while the sic was slightly enriched our study demonstrates that both sic and soc were selectively transported by water erosion and fills gaps in this field of research moreover this work implies that the psd of the sediment provides important information about the variation in soc and sic and should be considered when modelling the global c cycle keywords soil organic carbon soil inorganic carbon particle size distribution erosion processes 1 introduction soil is the largest terrestrial carbon c pool and includes soil organic carbon soc and soil inorganic carbon sic soc has attracted considerable attention mainly because soc accounts for most of the carbon content in most regions around the world and has a potentially rapid response to changes in the environment fang et al 2001 rasmussen 2006 wang et al 2012 in contrast to soc sic has been frequently disregarded because its formation processes are slow and it has very slow exchange with atmospheric co2 zamanian et al 2016 however in arid and semi arid regions i e approximately one third of earth s land surface the sic stock is 2 10 times greater than the soc stock schlesinger 1982 mi et al 2008 tan et al 2014 and the sic accumulation rates are higher than those of soc wang et al 2015 temperature and precipitation were the main climatic factors influencing sic formation and accumulation zamanian et al 2016 for example the sic accumulation rates increase with increasing temperature gocke and kuzyakov 2011 precipitation affects carbonate dissolution and reprecipitation and the former induces co2 uptake while the latter releases a flux of co2 to the soil surface walvoord et al 2005 moreover in the context of global climate change soils in arid and semi arid ecosystems seem to be a sink for atmospheric co2 in organic or inorganic forms with increasing precipitation because of vegetation growth however this stored c can be released if the rainfall decreases stone 2008 schlesinger 2017 han et al 2018 thus it is necessary to consider both soc and sic when estimating the global c dynamics soil erosion is a key pathway that governs the global c cycle lal and pimentel 2008 quinton et al 2010 doetterl et al 2016 berhe et al 2018 and it involves three major mechanisms 1 the replacement of soc at eroding sites and the decrease in soc available for decomposition 2 the deep burial of c and inhibited decomposition upon burial and 3 the enhanced decomposition of soc associated with soil breakdown during detachment and transport processes van oost et al 2007 aggregate breakdown exposes the previously encapsulated soc within aggregates to microbial activities which accelerates soc mineralization and co2 release six et al 2002 polyakov and lal 2008 six and paustian 2014 the soc content of soil aggregates and primary particles in different size classes is heterogeneous hu and kuhn 2014 macro aggregates generally contain more soc than micro aggregates due to aggregate hierarchy tisdall and oades 1982 oades and waters 1991 while fine primary particles are prone to enrichment in soc because their specific surface area is larger than that of coarse primary particles rodrı guez et al 2004 nadeu et al 2011 soc enriched sediment commonly composed of silt and clay sized particles derived from particle size selectivity may be deposited and experience deep burial which inhibits soc decomposition stallard 1998 yoo et al 2005 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2014b doetterl et al 2016 liu et al 2017 in contrast to soc few studies have focused on the effect of erosion on sic soil erosion promotes sic dissolution by increasing the exposure of sic to the percolating water front which increases the depth of sic accumulation and decreases the total amount of sic through the promotion of sic dissolution zamanian et al 2016 the net effect of soil erosion as a c source or sink largely depends on the disruptive level of aggregates and the degree of sediment selectivity which are influenced by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dominant erosion processes schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sediment can become enriched in soc during interrill erosion which results from the selective transport of silt and clay sized particles schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 koiter et al 2017 less selectivity was found in rill erosion because large aggregates and particles were also transported due to the large transport capacity of rill flow proffitt and rose 1991 schiettecatte et al 2008 wang and shi 2015 similarly high intensity rainfall events lead to less selective detachment and sorting of labile soc fractions than low intensity rainfall events jacinthe et al 2004 doetterl et al 2016 aggregate stripping by raindrop impact results in the enrichment of soc because the outer layers of the soil aggregates contain more soc than the inner core ghadiri and rose 1991 however this trend does not always occur and it may depend upon aggregate stability versus the adverse effect of erosive forces schiettecatte et al 2008 raindrop size flow depth and their complex interactions may influence aggregate disintegration and the subsequent transport and deposition processes the amount of energy of raindrop and overland flow applied to the eroding bed varies with the raindrop size and flow depth interactions palmer 1963 kinnell 2013 for raindrops falling into the flow the energy change of the flow and that of the impacting raindrop itself have been both directly measured and indirectly calculated ferreira and singer 1985 bradford et al 1987 hartley and alonso 1991 gao et al 2003 josserand and zaleski 2003 raindrop energy is enhanced by a thin flow covering the soil surface by increasing the raindrop mass until it reaches a critical depth moss and green 1983 ferreira and singer 1985 gao et al 2003 when the flow depth is larger than the critical flow depth the water layer absorbs a proportion of the raindrop energy by causing splash and wave action leading to a decrease in the raindrop induced particle detachment efficiency with increasing flow depth palmer 1963 the interactive effect between raindrops and flow palmer 1963 moss and green 1983 hartley and alonso 1991 gao et al 2003 nouhou bako et al 2016 and the particle size selectivity during erosion processes slattery and burt 1997 martínez mena et al 1999 wang and shi 2015 have been investigated thus we can further investigate the c migration associated with particle size selectivity along with the variation in erosive forces influenced by the raindrop size and flow depth previous studies have demonstrated that the effect of soil erosion on soc migration was associated with aggregate breakdown and sediment size selectivity schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 but its influence on sic remains uncertain sic transport may differ from soc transport during erosion processes mainly because of the differences in size density and shape of organic particles and mineral particles lithogenic carbonate commonly occurs in the coarse size fraction while pedogenic carbonate usually precipitates in the silt and clay size fractions kraimer and monger 2009 the density of mineral particles 0 9 1 3 mg m 3 is larger than that of organic particles 2 6 2 75 mg m 3 brady and weil 2001 as a result organic particles require less energy to be transported than mineral particles in the same size class we hypothesized that the selective transport of sic occurs during the erosion processes and that the proportion of soc and sic in the erosional and depositional sites would vary increases in soc lead to increased dissolution and reprecipitation of carbonates in soil bronick and lal 2005 and sic can suppress the mineralization of soc clough and skjemstad 2000 as a result variations in the proportion of soc and sic caused by soil erosion could alter the c cycling accordingly the objectives of our study were to 1 identify the distribution of soc and sic in different size classes of eroded sediment under the influence of different raindrop sizes and inflow rates and 2 investigate the effect of aggregate breakdown and sediment size selectivity on soc and sic transport during erosion processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and preparation the soil we used in this study is derived from loess which is distributed widely on the semi arid loess plateau tsunekawa et al 2014 the soil was collected from yangling in shaanxi province china and the sampling field has been cultivated with corn and wheat for many years the sampling depth was 20 cm which represents the plough layer the physical and chemical properties of the selected soil are illustrated in table 1 the sampled soil was air dried and un decomposed plant residuals were removed then the samples were crushed and passed through a 10 0 mm sieve and filled into soil flumes that were 100 0 cm long 16 5 cm wide and 25 0 cm deep fig 1 we vertically divided the flume into five layers by using a marker drawing inside the flume the weight of the soil samples for each layer can be calculated based on the bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 table 1 soils were gently compacted in each layer to diminish aggregate breakdown and to obtain the desired bulk density each soil layer was raked lightly before the next layer was packed to diminish the discontinuity between layers we packed the soil in five successive 5 cm thick layers rather than packing the soil in only one layer in order to guarantee the homogeneity of the soil the final layer of soil was levelled within limits imposed by the aggregates to ensure uniform initial surface conditions and to simulate the ploughing process and the preparation of a seed bed the prepared soil was pre saturated for more than 10 h before all experiments additionally we used a new soil for each experiment rather than using the same soil that was kept in the same flume for a series of experiments 2 2 rainfall simulation and water scouring experiments the rainfall simulation and water scouring experiments were carried out in the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau the chosen rainfall intensity was 90 mm h 1 which was the typical intensity of storms in the study area where more than 50 of the soil erosion amount was caused mainly by a few heavy rain or rainstorm events cai et al 1998 in all experiments we maintained the same rainfall intensity but changed the raindrop size using a rainfall simulator hanging 4 m above the soil bed fig 1 rainfall intensity is usually positively correlated with raindrop size cerdá 1997 yakubu et al 2016 raindrops smaller than 1 mm were not considered in this study because 90 mm h 1 is a very high intensity for which large raindrops are expected the size of raindrops was controlled by a series of interchangeable hypodermic needles or polyethylene tubes attached to hypodermic needles specifically 25 gauge needles 0 25 mm i d 0 51 mm o d and polyethylene tubes 0 80 mm i d 1 90 mm o d attached to 22 gauge needles 0 41 mm i d 0 71 mm o d were used to produce raindrop sizes of 1 34 mm and 4 04 mm respectively and the corresponding fall velocities were 2 81 m s 1 and 7 10 m s 1 we used a precipitation monitor that was designed based on the particle imaging transient visual measurement technology to measure the specific raindrop size and the corresponding fall velocity guo et al 2015 simultaneously inflow water was provided by a peristaltic pump for scouring furthermore 0 65 l min 1 1 l min 1 and 2 l min 1 inflows were selected based on the results of the pre experiments the pre saturated soil flume was adjusted to a slope of 15 because lands with slopes between 10 and 20 are widely used for agriculture in china the water was first filled into a sink installed at the upstream part of the flume and then it was passed through a baffle and entered a stilling bay before entering the experimental area all of these operations were performed to ensure that the inflow water had a uniform depth across the width of the flume filtered water was used for all experiments and three replicates were conducted for each trial 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 runoff and sediment measurements runoff and sediment were sampled at 1 min intervals or 2 min intervals during the entire experiment depending on the amount of sediment during each period of sampling 200 ml of runoff plus sediment was first collected in a beaker to analyse the sediment size distribution meanwhile the rest of the runoff and sediment in that sampling period was collected in a bucket to measure the volume of runoff and the amount of sediment it is worth noting that the runoff rate was calculated by the runoff volume in the beaker plus the volume in the bucket the sediment concentration sc was calculated according to the runoff and sediment in the bucket neglecting the portion in the beaker the sc accelerated quickly in the following seconds following the collection in the beaker thus this value could be profoundly overestimated if the portion in the beaker was considered 2 3 2 measurements of flow velocity and rill development during the rainfall simulation and water scouring experiments we used a dye tracer kmno4 method to measure the maximum flow velocity at 1 min intervals for rill development we focused on the flow velocity in rills longer than 50 cm because there is much uncertainty in the measure of flow velocity in shorter rills the mean flow velocity was obtained by multiplying a correction factor α which was between 0 2 and 0 8 planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 investigated the effects of sediment load on α on steep slopes and at high sediment loads and found that α decreased with increasing sediment load and was between 0 233 and 0 682 with a mean value of 0 466 considering that our experiments were conducted on steep slopes and involved a high sc we chose an α value of 0 466 for sheet flow and 0 8 for rill flow meanwhile the rills features e g length width and depth were continuously measured by a millimetre scale ruler at 10 cm intervals during the erosion event the rill dimensions and the corresponding time were recorded 2 3 3 measurements of particle aggregate size and associated carbon content the runoff and sediment collected in beakers were immediately transported to the laboratory to analyse the particle size distribution psd of the sediment by a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk each sample was analysed twice to obtain the psd of the sediment with and without dispersion non dispersed sediment contained aggregates and primary particles e g clay slit and sand while fully dispersed sediment contained only primary particles the samples were first analysed by the malvern mastersizer 2000 without the dispersion treatment to obtain the non dispersed psd of the sediment afterward the samples were treated with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic matter dispersed in sodium hexametaphosphate and then subjected to ultrasonic dispersion to obtain their dispersed psd the non dispersed and dispersed psd values of the original un eroded soil were measured by the same method used to measure the psd of the sediment table 2 for the treatments with the 1 34 mm raindrops and 4 04 mm raindrops under the 1 l min 1 inflow the sediments collected in buckets at 1 3 8 and 14 min were gently wet sieved by hand on a column of seven sieves with mesh sizes of 2 1 0 5 0 25 0 15 0 075 and 0 053 mm the different fractions of sediment were oven dried at 40 c and weighed and then the total carbon content and organic carbon content were analysed by an elemental analyser elementar vario pyro cube germany the inorganic carbon content was derived from the difference between the total carbon content and the organic carbon content additionally the contents of organic carbon and inorganic carbon were measured in the sediment samples collected at 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 and 14 min in all treatments the organic and inorganic carbon contents of the original soil were measured using the same procedure as that for the sediment 2 4 data calculation and statistical analysis 2 4 1 indices of particle size distribution we used d50 d 4 3 and d 3 2 to represent the psd d50 is known as the median diameter and is the value of the particle size diameter at the 50 mark in the cumulative distribution d 4 3 is the volume weighted mean or mass moment mean diameter and reflects the size of the particles that constitute the bulk of the sample volume therefore d 4 3 is the most sensitive to the presence of coarse particles in the size distribution d 3 2 is the surface weighted mean or surface area moment mean diameter and is closely related to the specific surface area so this index is the most sensitive to the presence of fine particles in the size distribution alderliesten 1991 malvern instruments 2015 d 4 3 and d 3 2 can be calculated by 1 d m n v i d i m v i d i n where v i is the relative volume in class i with a mean class diameter of d i 2 4 2 flow depth the flow depth in our experiments is very shallow because of the steep slopes to measure flow depth accurately we assumed that the flow was uniform and that the mean flow depth h m can be calculated by 2 h q v w t where q m3 is the runoff volume during t s v is the mean flow velocity m s 1 and w is the flume width for sheet erosion and is the main rill width after rill development m to reduce the uncertainty arising from velocity measurement we only included the flow depth in rills longer than 50 cm when the rill was initiated 2 4 3 energy associated with runoff the overland flow hydraulic characteristics such as stream power and flow shear stress are important for determining the erosion process stream power refers to the runoff energy per unit area some or all of which may be available to detach and transport soil particles and aggregates from the erosion surface bagnold 1966 teixeira and misra 1997 stream power is a better predictor of sediment transport capacity than shear stress mahmoodabadi et al 2014 and is closely related to the soc concentration liu et al 2017 stream power ω w m 2 can be calculated by 3 ω ρ l g s q w where ρ l is the water density 103 kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 s is the sine of the slope q is the discharge rate m3 s 1 and w is the width of the flume or rill m similar to the calculation of flow depth we focused only on the stream power in rills longer than 50 cm and here w was the average rill width 2 4 4 energy associated with raindrop size and flow depth shear stress applied on the soil surface mostly determines the erosion rate an algebraic fitted relationship among raindrop size water depth and maximum shear stress at the soil surface has been established by numerical simulations hartley and alonso 1991 nouhou bako et al 2016 the dimensionless maximum shear stress τ max largely depends on the raindrop radius r m the water depth h m and three dimensionless parameters the reynolds number re the froude number fr and the weber number we which represent the relative influence of viscous surface tension and gravitational forces hartley and alonso 1991 for raindrops the value of re is between 6500 and 23 000 hartley and julien 1992 we ranges from 50 to 12 000 and fr ranges from 800 to 1400 for natural rainfall nouhou bako et al 2016 τ max can be calculated by 4 τ max 2 85 ρ l v 0 2 h r 1 2 6 re 0 55 c 1 where c1 is between 0 and 1 which indicates the relatively weak effect of gravity and surface tension forces and their interaction with water depth and is defined by 5 c 1 1 e x p 1 6 θ h r 6 θ f r we 0 5 f r we 0 5 where θ reflects the effect on the boundary shear stress field which is associated with fr and we and θ is small if either fr or we are small re fr and we can be calculated by 7 re ρ l v 0 r μ l 8 fr v 0 2 2 r g 9 we ρ l v 0 2 r γ where ρ l is the density of water 103 kg m 3 v 0 is the fall velocity of raindrops m s 1 μ l is the water viscosity 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 and γ is the surface tension 0 02 kg s 2 2 4 5 statistical analysis and model evaluation we used boosted regression trees brt to predict the carbon content in sediment based on the selected predictors including the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter h d the maximum shear stress τ max the runoff rate the stream power ω the sc the soil loss rate slr and various particle related factors including d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of the non dispersed sediment brt is a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques that establishes large numbers of relatively simple decision trees and uses the boosting method to optimize predictive performance elith et al 2008 the compromise between model complexity and predictive performance in brt can resolve the problem of multicollinearity and fit complicated response functions efficiently while preventing overfitting elith et al 2008 bhatt et al 2013 dormann et al 2013 the brt analysis was run in the program r using the gbm package three vital parameters of the brt learning rate tree complexity and bag fraction were set to 0 001 5 and 0 5 respectively by using the rules of thumb proposed by elith et al 2008 the optimal number of trees was identified by 10 fold cross validation which was implemented in the gbm package in the procedure of 10 fold cross validation the available data are randomly divided into 10 subsets there are 10 training datasets each comprising 9 subsets for training and a corresponding omitted subset for testing thus 10 brt models are established simultaneously and the predictive performance of the models is tested as trees are added the number of trees with the lowest prediction error is recorded as the optimal number of trees once the predictive performance declines with increasing numbers of trees elith et al 2008 moreover brt can calculate the relative importance and partial dependence of each predictor elith et al 2008 the relative importance is measured based on formulae developed by friedman 2001 implemented in the gbm package and is based on the frequency of the predictor being selected and how much the selected predictor can improve the model buston and elith 2011 the relative importance can assess the contribution of each predictor to the final model and is scaled so that the sum adds up to 100 thus more important predictors have higher values elith et al 2008 the partial dependence of each predictor is achieved by partial dependence functions friedman 2001 indicating the influence of a predictor on the response after accounting for the average effects of the remaining predictors in the model elith et al 2008 in our study the sample sizes for soc and sic were 110 and 106 respectively after omitting all rows with any missing values we used 80 of the data sampling without replacement to train the brt model and 20 of the data was used for quasi out of sample model testing the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the model performance r 2 is the most common criterion for model evaluation and it indicates the proportionate amount of variation in the response variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model this value can be calculated by 10 r 2 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the mae is an average of the absolute errors between the predicted and observed values the mae describes the difference between the observed and predicted values and can be calculated by 11 mae i 1 n p i o i n the rmse refers to the difference in the observed and predicted values in the appropriate units indicating the goodness of fit of the model and it can be calculated by 12 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where oi is the observed value pi is the predicted value with i 1 to n data points and o is the mean of the observed values 3 results 3 1 erosion processes and sediment size the erosional responses to the different raindrop sizes and inflow rates are illustrated in table 3 the sc and slr from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact were larger than those from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact despite the larger inflow rates table 3 indicating that the influence of raindrop size on sc and slr outweighed the influence of flow in this study the non dispersed median particle size d50 of sediment fluctuated with time fig 2 the d50 with rainfall alone was the smallest while the d50 with inflow alone was the largest among all treatments fig 2d and e demonstrating that aggregates were more likely to be broken down by raindrops rather than by flow because the stress applied by raindrop impacts was much larger than that by flow loch and donnollan 1983 the d50 with rainfall and inflow applied together was smaller than that with flow alone but larger than that with rainfall alone fig 2f the d50 under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was usually smaller than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact when maintaining the same inflow rate fig 2 indicating that larger raindrop energy caused by the larger raindrops induced more severe aggregate breakdown wang et al 2014a the difference in d50 under the 4 04 and 1 34 mm raindrop impacts increased with the increase in inflow rates fig 2 probably because more raindrop energy was dissipated in deeper flows and a greater proportion of energy was dissipated from 1 34 mm raindrops than from 4 04 mm raindrops for the 4 04 and 1 34 mm raindrops under the 1 l min 1 inflow we further compared the difference in psd before and after dispersion fig 3 the particle size of the sediment decreased after dispersion fig 3a indicating that sediment contained aggregates consistent with the findings of slattery and burt 1997 and martínez mena et al 1999 the relative proportion of the non dispersed and dispersed particle sizes indicates how the different fractions are transported during erosion processes a value of 1 suggests that these fractions are fully disaggregated by raindrop impact and or runoff and are transported as primary particles a value less than 1 for the finer fractions suggests that the content of these fractions increases after being dispersed in the laboratory and indicates they often form aggregates and are transported as aggregates rather than as primary particles and a value greater than 1 for the coarser fractions suggests the content of these fractions decreases after being dispersed in the laboratory because most of these coarser fractions were composed of finer fractions and it is difficult to identify how these coarser fractions are transported martínez mena et al 1999 particles in the range of 0 002 0 05 mm were transported as primary particles while particles 0 002 mm were more likely transported as primary particles under 4 04 mm raindrop impact than those under 1 34 mm raindrop impact fig 3b the enrichment ratio er is defined as the ratio of the dispersed psd of sediment to that of the original soil which reflects the degree to which a given size class has been removed from or enriched in the transported sediment slattery and burt 1997 particles 0 002 and 0 05 mm were enriched in the sediment while particles in the range of 0 002 0 05 mm were depleted in the sediment fig 3c 3 2 carbon content 3 2 1 carbon content in sediment associated with raindrop sizes and inflow rates the contents of soc and sic in sediment fluctuated with time but their variation with time did not reach significance from a statistical standpoint therefore we only presented the contents of soc and sic in sediment under different treatments and each treatment can be considered to have ten replicates fig 4 the soc content in the sediment was significantly less than the sic content p 0 05 because the sic was the main binding agent of the aggregates of the tested soil and the aggregate breakdown induced by raindrop impact and runoff enhanced the proportion of transportable particles containing sic at a given inflow rate the soc and sic contents in the sediment differed significantly under the different sized raindrop impacts treatments except for the 0 65 and 1 l min 1 inflows respectively p 0 05 fig 4 the exceptions for 0 65 and 1 l min 1 inflows are difficult to explain because many factors would influence the soc and sic contents in the sediment such as particle selectivity and the dissolution of c in the runoff we cannot deduce whether 0 65 l min 1 and 1 l min 1 are thresholds or only a deviation so we focused on the general trend a remarkable difference in the soc content in the sediment among various inflow rates was found under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact and no raindrop impact treatments p 0 05 while the difference was not significant under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact treatment fig 4a partly because the soc release associated with aggregate breakdown caused by 4 04 mm raindrops was already pronounced and the different inflow rates did not change the result fig 4a shows that the soc content in the sediment in treatments with inflow alone was generally larger than that in the treatments with rainfall and inflow applied together fig 4b illustrates that the differences in the sic content in sediment with and without raindrop impact at various flow rates were significant p 0 05 and the sic content in the treatment with the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was the highest among the other treatments according to the er of the soc and sic the soc was depleted in the sediment while the sic was slightly enriched in the sediment probably because of the effects of particle selective transport processes fig 5 3 2 2 carbon content of different sized aggregates in sediment we further compared the differences in the soc and sic contents in various sized aggregates in the sediment from the 4 04 and 1 34 mm raindrop impacts under the 1 l min 1 inflow and in the original soil fig 6 aggregates in the size between 0 075 and 0 15 mm seemed to contain the most soc and sic relative to the other aggregate sizes in both the sediment and the original soil the difference in the soc content in different sized aggregates in the original soil was not significant while that in the sediment was significant p 0 05 indicating that soc sorting by erosion exists fig 6a the differences in soc content among the original soil the sediment resulting from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact treatment and the sediment resulting from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact treatment were significant only for aggregates in the size between 0 075 and 0 25 mm p 0 05 fig 6a in contrast the sic contents in variously sized aggregates changed significantly both in the original soil and in the exported sediment p 0 05 fig 6b thus these changes were more pronounced than those in the soc content fig 6b indicates that for the same aggregate size class the sic content varied remarkably among the original soil the sediment resulting from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact treatment and the sediment resulting from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact treatment except for aggregates smaller than 0 053 mm the sic content under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was often larger than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact even in the same aggregate size class additionally aggregates smaller than 0 053 mm accounted for most of the sediment while aggregates in the range between 1 and 2 mm accounted for most of the original soil fig 6c d and e 3 3 determinants of carbon content in sediment we investigated the correlations between the soc and sic in sediment and the possible predictors including the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter h d the maximum shear stress τ max the runoff rate the stream power ω the sc the slr and the particle related factors d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of non dispersed sediment fig 7 fig 7 indicates that some of the variables showed a good correlation with soc and sic but also showed correlations among themselves leading to problems of multicollinearity in a multiple regression model which would inflate the variance of regression parameters and lead to the misidentification of relevant predictors in a statistical model dormann et al 2013 to avoid multicollinearity we used brt to estimate the soc and sic contents according to the possible predictors the r 2 mae and rmse values for the brt model for soc were 0 42 0 29 and 0 35 respectively fig 8 a the r 2 mae and rmse values for the brt model for sic were 0 56 0 53 and 0 80 respectively fig 8b the relative importance of the variables estimated by the brt model implied that the sc was the most important variable for the prediction of soc fig 9 while the runoff rate was the most important variable for the prediction of sic fig 10 the relative importance of the particle related variables d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of non dispersed sediment was approximately 50 for both soc and sic notably we focused on non dispersed psd rather than on dispersed psd in the brt models because the sediment contained aggregates and the non dispersed psd governed the actual sediment transport slattery and burt 1997 partial dependence plots for the five most influential predictors in the brt models are illustrated in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 indicates that soc decreased with increasing runoff rate and slr after accounting for the average effects of the other variables in the brt model in contrast sic increased increasing runoff rate and slr fig 10 soc markedly increased with increasing clay content while sic markedly increased with increasing sand content figs 9 and 10 4 discussion the net effect of transport on eroded c depends on the physico chemical characteristics of the soil the amount and nature of the eroded c and the erosion mechanisms and factors related to the erosion mechanisms such as rainfall intensity and surface roughness schiettecatte et al 2008 hu and kuhn 2014 doetterl et al 2016 liu et al 2017 in this study we used the same soil to investigate the influence of different raindrop sizes and inflow rates on the variations in eroded c which mainly arose from the different aggregate breakdowns and their selective transport figs 2 and 3 the sediment size from the 1 34 mm raindrop impact was larger than that from the 4 04 mm raindrop impact under the same inflow rate for water scouring fig 2 demonstrating that the influence of larger raindrops on disintegrating aggregates outweighed their influence on transporting them in this study which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2014a in contrast sediment is expected to contain more large particles if raindrops have little effect on aggregate breakdown whereas raindrops enhance the erosive power of overland flow by increasing its turbulence bradford et al 1987 the brt models we established explained 42 1 and 56 1 of the variations in the soc and sic contents in the sediment respectively the importance ranking of the determinants for soc differed from that for sic figs 9 and 10 indicating that different major factors controlled the different types of c during erosion processes identifying these differences is crucial for better understanding the response of c migration to erosion according to figs 9 and 10 the psd was crucial for both soc and sic transport particles 0 002 and 0 05 mm were enriched in the sediment fig 3c particles 0 002 mm were preferentially removed by runoff because of their low settling velocity asadi et al 2007 moreover particles 0 002 mm usually formed aggregates and heavy particles including large aggregates and coarse primary particles were rather transported by rolling down the steep slopes due to the large gravitational and inertial forces in the direction of the slopes shi et al 2012 the enrichment of 0 05 mm particles fig 3c was also due to the large gravitational and inertial forces of these coarse particles in the direction of the steep slopes particles in the range of 0 002 0 05 mm are easily dispersed miller and baharuddin 1987 and tended to be depleted in sediment fig 3 because they were neither suspended in runoff nor rolled down the slope the reason for the influence of psd on the content of soc and sic in sediment is that the c content in different sized aggregates particles is heterogeneous fig 6 which is consistent with the results of polyakov and lal 2008 and hu and kuhn 2014 for aggregates in the same size class the stability of aggregates under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was stronger than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact because the aggregates that survived the 4 04 mm raindrop impact experienced larger erosive forces than those that survived the 1 34 mm raindrop impact we speculate that more binding agents may exist in the aggregates that survived the 4 04 mm raindrop impact consequently the sic content in sediment under the 4 04 mm raindrop impact was significantly larger than that under the 1 34 mm raindrop impact p 0 05 fig 6 because sic is the major binding agent in aggregates in soils in arid and semi arid environments bronick and lal 2005 which was the type of soil used in this study fig 6 also shows that the sediment contained large amounts of aggregates smaller than 0 053 mm which largely covers the contribution of other sized aggregates to c content and determines the soc and sic contents in sediment the clay content and d 3 2 were important for the soc content fig 9 indicating that the soc content was sensitive to the existence of fine particles as has been shown by previous studies schiettecatte et al 2008 wang et al 2010 li et al 2016 koiter et al 2017 liu et al 2017 sand content was the most critical particle related factor for the sic content fig 10 implying that the sic content was largely determined by coarse particles based on table 2 and fig 3b the proportion of the sand sized fraction in both the source soil and exported sediment decreased after dispersion indicating that these fractions mainly occurred as aggregates in our study the source soil was derived from loess which was mostly aggregated by carbonate liu et al 1978 carbonates may increase macroaggregate stability but decrease microaggregate stability at low soc concentrations boix fayos et al 2001 the particulate carbonate is mainly composed of calcite and has particle sizes ranging from 0 02 to 0 06 mm accounting for 0 5 2 5 of the soil the remaining silt sized fractions are mainly composed of quartz and feldspar and the clay sized fractions are mainly composed of illite and chlorite liu et al 1978 accordingly the positive correlation between soc content and clay content was due to the higher specific surface area of smaller particles adsorbing soc and the positive correlation between sic content and sand content was because more carbonates were present in the coarser particles in the form of a binding agent moreover the soc content declined with increasing sc and slr fig 9 which was consistent with the results of schiettecatte et al 2008 the soc content in the sediment decreased when the amount of sediment increased because the proportion of fine particles decreased in contrast there is little information about the factors influencing sic during erosion processes in previous studies the slr played a vital role in the sic content fig 10 and the sic content increased with increasing slr probably because the proportion of coarse particles in the sediment increased as slr increased these results emphasize the considerable role of the psd on soc and sic migration soc was slightly depleted in the sediment in this study fig 5 this result differs from those of many previous studies that demonstrated that soc is usually enriched in sediment schiettecatte et al 2008 li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 our result is probably because of the low soc content in the original soil and the large runoff carrying capacity that exists on steep slopes leading to the enrichment of coarse particles that contain little soc in the sediment thus soc tended to be slightly depleted while sic was slightly enriched in the sediment under intensive rainfall on these steep slopes fig 5 the psd and the proportion of soc and sic in erosional and depositional sites consequently varied furthermore sic can suppress the mineralization of soc clough and skjemstad 2000 while increases in soc lead to increased dissolution and reprecipitation of carbonates in soil bronick and lal 2005 accordingly the selective transport processes may not only currently influence c migration but may also influence the future changes in c additionally variations in sic in sediment were investigated in our study in order to fill gaps in this field of research and to establish a foundation for further research note that the r 2 of the brt models for soc and sic were relatively low i e 0 42 and 0 56 respectively partly because of the dissolution of c in the runoff and the randomness of the collapse of the rill sidewalls or collisions between entrained aggregates and the rill bed after rill development during the erosion process our results highlight the complexity of predicting the changes in the contents of soc and sic even so our study demonstrates that the psd of the sediment provides important information about the variation in the soc and sic which should be considered when modelling the global c cycle however the low accuracy of flow velocity measured by the dye method is the limitation of our study because the correction factor for obtaining mean flow velocity is influenced by many parameters planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 which shows spatiotemporal changes and consequently increases difficulty to determine the exact correction factor new methods developed recently such as a solute centroid method zhuang et al 2018 would be used in the future research for improving the accuracy of measuring mean flow velocity additionally quantitative control of the soil surface roughness can make the experiment more standardized 5 conclusions dynamic changes in the contents of soc and sic contents in sediment during the erosion processes were investigated the difference in soc and sic contents in sediment among treatments with various raindrop sizes and inflow rates was significant p 0 05 we used brt to estimate soc and sic according to the h d τ max runoff rate ω sc slr and the particle related factors d50 d 4 3 d 3 2 clay content silt content and sand content of the non dispersed sediment the brt models explained 42 1 and 56 1 of the variations in the soc and sic contents in the sediment respectively the importance ranking of the determinants for soc differed from that for sic indicating that different major factors controlled the different types of c during the erosion processes the relative importance of the particle related factors was approximately 50 demonstrating that psd was a crucial factor for both soc and sic transport the reason for the influence of psd on the soc and sic contents in the sediment is that the c content varies among different sized aggregates particles is heterogeneous the soc content was sensitive to the presence of fine particles while the sic content was largely determined by coarse particles because smaller particles with higher specific surface areas tend to adsorb more soc whereas coarser particles tend to contain more carbonates in the form of binding agents with increasing slr and sc the soc content decreased while the sic content increased because the proportion of fine particles containing more soc decreased and the proportion of coarse particles containing more sic increased in the sediment under intensive rainfall on steep slopes soc tended to be slightly depleted while sic was slightly enriched thereby changing the proportions of soc and sic in erosional and depositional sites in summary we identified the importance ranking of the determinants for the soc and sic contents and demonstrated that the psd of eroded sediment was a crucial factor for the soc and sic contents in this study thus the effect of psd should be considered when modelling the global c cycle these results provide useful information about the factors influencing sic during erosion processes filling gaps in this field of research and
