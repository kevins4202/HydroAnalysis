low wind speed convective heat exchange is similar for both smooth and corrugated surfaces and corrugation increases cooling at higher air flow velocities convective heat exchange is larger for the w cone but cooling is only slightly smaller than found on the s cone corrugated w cone should thus give larger yield than the corresponding smooth s cone keywords water harvesting dew condensation cfd simulation hollow cone corrugated hollow cone 1 introduction and background in the hydrological cycle natural dew has the same origin as fog and rain precipitations namely condensation of the water vapor contained in the atmosphere the latter results from water evaporated from sea river lakes vegetation and soil recent isotopic studies kaseke et al 2017 indeed show that fog and dew have multiple origins and that groundwater in drylands can be recycled via evapotranspiration and redistributed to the upper soil profile as non rainfall water in contrast to precipitations which condense in the cold regions of the atmosphere dew alike radiative fog forms under radiation cooling of a substrate dew water is thus a surface phenomenon in contrast to precipitations which is a volume process natural dew is a common and sometimes significant water source in many ecosystems especially those in arid and semi arid areas of the world see e g monteith 1963 baier 1966 malek et al 1999 agam and berliner 2006 liu et al 2020 dew as a source of water for humans has been long ignored although it is generally a water of good quality kaseke and wang 2018 since the last 20 years many studies aimed to increase the dew yield up to its theoretical limit on order of 1 l m2 see e g the reviews by tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 and beysens 2018 the dew yield essentially depends on the balance between the surface and atmosphere emissions dew yield is limited by the available cooling energy on order of 60 w m 2 in the humid air conditions where dew can form bliss 1961 beysens 2018 the latent heat of condensation and the convective heat flux between the substrate and the surrounding air the latter increases with wind speed but can be greatly reduced in hollow structures like hollow cones increasing the dew yield needs to augment the cooling energy but also the efficiency of water drops collection the latter involves the efficiency of droplets shedding by gravity the effect of gravity increases with the angle of the structure with horizontal however radiative cooling diminishes with this angle a good compromise is a tilt angle of 30 with horizontal beysens et al 2003 hollow cones with 60 half angle have thus provided good results for dew condensation and dew collection in outdoor conditions clus et al 2009 dew drop collection efficiency can be enhanced by the effect of convex edges where drops grow faster thanks to a solid angle of vapor collection larger than in the middle of the substrate medici et al 2014 edge drops reaches the critical size where the gravity force overcomes the pinning force sooner and slide down incorporating the drops on their pathway acting thus as efficient natural wipers in addition corrugation increases the local tilt angle with horizontal beysens 2018 thus increasing locally the gravity forces acting on the drops fig 1 origami structures that partially combine the above positive effects on dew yield partly hollow structures edge effects have been seen to increase the yield by a factor as large as 400 for small yields beysens et al 2013 corrugation however increases the convective heat exchange with surrounding air and in this aspect may substantially reduce the substrate cooling in order to estimate the effect of corrugation on a hollow cone one reports in the following the comparison by computational fluid dynamics cfd of a corrugated w shaped hollow cone with the same smooth structure both showing condensing surfaces with nearly 30 angle with horizontal cone half angle of nearly 60 two softwares were used ansys cfx for detailed aerodynamics where the computational domain is modeled to obtain a fully developed wind profile and comsol multiphysics aiming to detail the heat fluxes including radiative exchange surface to sky and surface to surface since neither ansys cfx nor comsol simulation models include dew formation an evaluation of dew yield was performed by calculating with comsol the local temperatures which can be related to the dew yield per surface area within some assumptions that will be discussed the ansys cfx was utilised to analyse the proposed design of the cones and test the aerodynamic effects on the airflow velocity over the inner surfaces of the condenser the metrics used for the aerodynamic performance assessment were based on minimising the air speed as well as maintaining uniform levels of air velocity on the condensing surface the cfd analysis allowed the cones schema to be optimized by testing various architectural solutions which resulted into the improvement of the design s aerodynamic performance a total of five cases were studied from which two candidates were finally selected fig 2 the thermal effects were studied by comsol on the two finalists w and s cones 2 methods 2 1 the cones in the pre study by cfx simulation the cone dimensions are 7 25 m s cone upper radius 5 5 m w cone upper radius with upper part at 10 m above the ground fig 2 the reason for the upper radius difference between s and w cones is due to the structural and architectural design of the cones as the angles of the cones are the same and the height also the same then the mouth of the s cone is wider the w cone turns up at the edges to create a uniform top edge the condensing surface area in the w cone is scw 100 9 m2 while the one in the s cone is scs 187 3 m2 the w cone has smaller surface area because it is inscribed in the s cone surface the s cone having a larger diameter than the w cone the comsol simulation uses a schematic representation of both w and s cones where the supporting column has been omitted and the external shape has been schematized see figs 5 and 6 below the goal is indeed to look only to the useful hydrodynamics around the cone and focusing on the air flows and heat exchange inside the funnels the dimensions of the cones are made identical to better compare their thermal characteristics the cone dimensions are s cone 4 735 m radius and w cone 4 635 m external radius and 3 944 m internal radius with both 0 21 m lower radius at 2 554 m below the top the s cone half angle is 60 5 and the w cone is inscribed in two cones with half angles 60 0 and 55 6 the upper part is at 8 m above the ground the condensing surface area in the w cone is scw 66 8 m2 while the one in the s cone is scs 80 8 m2 as for the cfx simulation the w cone exhibits a smaller surface area because it has a smaller external radius than the s cone air temperature is set at 15 c and wind speed is varied by steps from 0 5 to 5 m s cfx or at two typical values 10 4 and 2 m s comsol the cfx simulation deals with the exact shape of the w cone 2 2 ansys cfx simulation as already noted the ansys cfx code version 18 is utilised to analyse the proposed design of the cones and test the aerodynamic effects on the airflow velocity over the inner surfaces of the condenser k Îµ turbulence model is used to simulate mean flow characteristics for turbulent flow conditions in order to capture the aerodynamic effect of the installation the geometry includes the lower stand trunk of the tree and all the details of the supporting structure that could affect the airflow in the main areas of interest the computational size of the domain was developed in line with the recommendations for the assessment of wind conditions around buildings mochida et al 2006 the inlet the sides and the upper boundary were set at 5 times the cone height h whilst the outflow boundary was set at 15h behind the cone ensuring an appropriate development of the wakes produced by the interaction of the flow with the geometry itself unobstructed upstream conditions were also considered as the most likely scenario to take place on site where the condensing trees will be installed as summarised by blocken et al 2007 the following requirements were implemented i sufficient height mesh resolution in the vertical direction in order to allow the height of the first cell to be smaller than 1 m ii horizontal homogeneous atmospheric boundary layer flow in upstream and downstream regions iii ensuring that the distance between the centre of the first mesh cell and the ground z p is smaller than the height of the terrain physical roughness z c due to the symmetrical design of the condensing trees a rectangular computational domain was created for this analysis the specification of the atmospheric boundary layer profile is crucial for a correct simulation of the airflow environment the boundary layer is described as the lower portion of the atmosphere where the wind is largely affected by friction with the surface of the earth this friction generates turbulence and depends on the type of terrain and geometrical obstructions on the surface the cfd model used a semi empirical logarithmic function see e g pal arya 1988 to describe the wind profile v z 1 v z v 10 l n z z c l n 10 z c where zc is the roughness length taken to be zc 0 1 m and v 10 is wind speed at 10 m off the ground the logarithmic profile is normally used as inlet condition the region near to the ground of the domain required special attention as this area is where the interaction between flow and walls happens if this area of contact is not appropriately defined imprecisions may arise in the cfd assessment to eliminate this risk a fine mesh was applied to the ground with an inflation layer of 3 steps whilst the wall function was automatically assigned when the k Îµ model was selected side walls and upper domain were modeled using symmetry boundary conditions whilst a zero static pressure boundary condition was applied to the outlet the three dimensional steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was solved to simulate the wind flows within the domain turbulence was modelled with the k Îµ model as mentioned above the computational domain was discretised with a tetrahedral mesh of 6 million cells an inflation layer of 3 steps where the first layer s height is measured at 0 25 m ensured the adequate mesh resolution at ground level several mesh sensitivity tests were carried out no relevant differences have been identified in the velocity fields of the upstream and downstream flows because of the shape of the faceted crown the w cone is expected to produce local acceleration of the flow and accentuated deflection of the flow streamlines the s cone instead has a smoother external surface therefore this shape is expected to reduce flow disruption and facilitate flow acceleration away from the crown 2 3 comsol multiphysics simulation the commercial software comsol multiphysics was used to analyze the heat transfer and fluid flow taking place around the cones also using the k Îµ turbulence model to simulate the mean flow characteristics for turbulent flow conditions the goal of this modeling effort is to predict the temperature of the condenser surfaces for different values of air velocity in the fluid domains the continuity equations as well the navier stokes and the energy conservation equations have to be solved simultaneously the cones structure is made of styrofoam to ensure thermal isolation the simulation of the dew condenser heat exchange takes in account the following processes i thermal behavior of the radiative material and the insulation material including its thermal conductivity thermal expansion density heat capacity and emissivity in the atmospheric window whenever known see table 1 for simplicity the radiative and insulation materials have been taken the same styrofoam with emissivity 0 83 as in sharan et al 2017 simulation ii radiative cooling power which depends on the condenser geometry and also on atmospheric conditions condenser and sky emissivity air temperature ta cloud cover n iii incoming diffusive and convective free or forced heat exchange with air which depends on wind speed v wind speed direction and condenser geometry the condensation process is not accounted for in the model dry air approximation the equations of momentum continuity and temperature are solved by using the numerical code in the simulation only typical night conditions are considered e g clear sky n 0 ta 288 15 k 15 c relative humidity rh 80 these conditions correspond to a dew point temperature td 11 6 c standard numerical values are used for the air properties density thermal conductivity specific heat etc see table 1 emissivities are taken in the atmospheric window the most interesting result of the simulation is the local temperature of the condenser from which the dew yield can be deduced see appendix 1 boundary conditions for air velocity are the same as with cfx namely air velocity follows the classical logarithmic variation with respect to elevation z according to eq 1 with zc 0 1 m i no slip conditions on condenser surfaces and ground ii open frontier on ceiling and the two vertical sides of the fluid domain iii convective flow at the exit heat transfer from the air to the surface of the condenser occurs by forced convection the complete energy equation has thus to be solved in the fluid domain using the velocities found from the solutions of the continuity equation and conservation of momentum equation navier stokes the energy equation describing this heat transfer process is given by 2 Ï c p dt dt k 2 t where Ï is the density of air cp is the specific heat of air k is the thermal conductivity of air and t the air temperature the effect of convection on the heat transfer process is taken into account in the derivative term dt dt of eq 2 3 dt dt t t v g r a d t where v is the velocity field in the air the steady state case was solved such as the time derivative term t t in eq 3 is set to zero a condition of continuity of heat flow has been taken for the upper edges and the external face of the cones the temperature of the condenser will be lower than that of the ambient air due to the radiative cooling natural convection will thus appear enhancing heat transfer between air and condenser this effect can be taken into account by a temperature dependence of the fluid density buoyancy effect in the conservation of momentum equation however the coupling forced natural convection is difficult to account it needs a long iterative process and the effect of convection which matters only for weak air flow velocity is neglected in this study in the solid domain conduction is modeled using a simple heat equation no slip boundary condition is for all condenser surfaces the reynolds number which compares the inertial forces with the viscous forces and determines whether the flow is turbulent or laminar reads as 4 r e vl Î½ here l 10 m is the condenser typical lengthscale Î½ is air kinematic viscosity and v is wind speed giving re 7 105 v laminar flow is expected for a reynolds number lower than a critical value which depends on the geometry it is on order of 2000 for cylinders but can be reduced depending on the geometry as a matter of fact turbulence was observed even for wind speed as low as 10 4 m s 1 after some trials it was considered for the simulation a box of 75 m long 20 m wide and 8 m high whose top is at 8 m above the lower part of the cones in accord with the specifications noted in section 2 2 the large value of the box length is necessary because the effects of pressure matter and were seen on smaller boxes all of the meshes created in comsol multiphysics were physics controlled and automatically generated the meshes varied in size ranging from a coarser mesh all the way up to a normal mesh several mesh sensitivity tests were carried out concerning a possible dependency of the results on various types of meshes no relevant differences have been identified in the velocity field of the upstream and downstream flow and in the temperature field the final aim of the cfd numerical is to estimate the dew water output with respect to the meteorological parameters this is a very general and difficult task and up to now several simplifications have been made to retain only the most important parameters as the actual yield per surface area h depends on the supersaturation reached by the condensing substrate the determination of the temperature drop ta tc here tc is the condenser surface temperature with respect to air temperature can represent the dew yield as shown in appendix 1 total yield is calculated from h and the condensing surface area sc hsc 3 results and discussion 3 1 air flow the two s and w shapes have been tested with the ansys cfx simulation with incoming air velocity 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 m s 1 at 10 m elevation the main result is that while the inside air flows are different for s and w shapes the variation of wind speed does not appreciably affect the aerodynamic performances of the two cones one thus only report data in figs 3 and 4 corresponding to the wind speed values 0 5 and 2 m s 1 fig 4abcd compares the aerodynamic effects on a symmetry plane along the wind direction for s and w cones for wind speed values 0 5 and 2 m s 1 increasing the wind speed only reinforces the fact that lower wind speed is seen in the s cone central air volume than in the w cone in addition above the cones higher streamline development above the w cone signs a more turbulent airflow than above the s cone fig 4a d visualize the wind velocity on the internal surface of the condenser which is of prime importance for convective heat transfer increasing the incoming wind velocity changes has very little effect in contrast wind on s cone internal surface is seen to be lower than on the w cone surface one thus sees that condenser surface velocity is largely affected by external and internal geometry smoother geometries help to maintain low wind speed at condenser surface velocity at condenser surface is higher in the w cone than in the s cone as caused by the triangulated external surfaces and exposed highest edges of the condenser one thus expects enhanced convective heat transfer with the w cone some studies have been carried out with comsol at two typical wind speeds at 10 m elevation a very low speed of 10 4 m s 1 where the reynolds number re 70 and a speed of 2 m s 1 re 1 4 106 the latter value is a mean value for dew formation which in average occurs between 0 and 4 4 m s 1 see beysens 2018 and corresponds to the mean wind speed during night at the site where such condensers should be implemented the low speed value 10 4 m s 1 was chosen because the simulation with cfx which was looking for variations in aerodynamic patterns did not find significant differences between high and low wind speed the aerodynamics of the design performs similarly at all wind conditions tested then the decision of modeling the wind at 10 4 m s 1 has been taken as this represents a little to no wind scenario that is likely to be experienced on site in addition this low wind condition helps to reach convergent solutions in a reasonably short time span by reducing turbulent effects although turbulence is seen even at low wind speed fig 5 stagnation of the flow is also observed which limits the convective heat exchanges and facilitates dew formation 3 2 surface temperature temperature of the inner surface of the cones are reported in fig 6 a d for both w and s cones at the two wind speeds of 10 4 m s 1 and 2 m s 1 and summarized in table 2 for 10 4 m s 1 windspeed the mean cooling with respect to air temperature is found to be 5 85 k s cone and 6 55 k w cone and for 2 m s windspeed 5 49 k s cone and 5 25 k w cone corrugation increases on one hand radiative cooling but on the other hand reduces cooling by enhanced convective heat exchange at low speed convective heat exchange is similar for both smooth and corrugated surfaces and corrugation increases cooling for the w cone at higher air flow velocities convective heat exchange is larger for the w cone and cooling is eventually found smaller than for the smooth cone however the difference 0 24 k remains small details of air temperature are also shown in fig 6e f air is seen to cool down after having passed near the cone edge 4 conclusion from a detailed analysis of air flows around corrugated w cone and smooth s cone it appears clearly that although the inside air flows are different for the two shapes the variation of wind speed does not appreciably affect the aerodynamic performances of the two cones the scooping effect however performs better in the s shape than in the w shape with wind speed on the internal surface of the s cone lower compared to the w shape the shape of the crown in the s shape cone indeed amplifies the upward trajectory of the wind that is redirected away from the inner area of the cone as it hits the edge of attack this geometrical feature helps significantly in reducing the wind speed on the internal surface of the s cone compared to the w shape from these air flow characteristics it naturally follows that the w cone which radiates more also cools more at low windspeed than the s cone where the convective heat transfer is low in contrast at large windspeed the w cone cools less as an effect of enhanced convective heat transfer in the corrugated structure for typical air flow velocity of 2 m s 1 the difference in mean cooling between both shapes remains however small 0 24 k since cooling temperatures are nearly proportional to dew yield for the weak cooling temperatures as encountered in dew condensation it means that the corrugated w cone which exhibit better dew drop collecting properties will give a final better dew collection yield per surface area than the corresponding smooth s cone total yield will obviously has to account for the different w and s cone actual surface areas in the example reported here with 24 faces for the w cone the s cone exhibits a surface larger than the w cone credit authorship contribution statement

the ground with an inflation layer of 3 steps whilst the wall function was automatically assigned when the k Îµ model was selected side walls and upper domain were modeled using symmetry boundary conditions whilst a zero static pressure boundary condition was applied to the outlet the three dimensional steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was solved to simulate the wind flows within the domain turbulence was modelled with the k Îµ model as mentioned above the computational domain was discretised with a tetrahedral mesh of 6 million cells an inflation layer of 3 steps where the first layer s height is measured at 0 25 m ensured the adequate mesh resolution at ground level several mesh sensitivity tests were carried out no relevant differences have been identified in the velocity fields of the upstream and downstream flows because of the shape of the faceted crown the w cone is expected to produce local acceleration of the flow and accentuated deflection of the flow streamlines the s cone instead has a smoother external surface therefore this shape is expected to reduce flow disruption and facilitate flow acceleration away from the crown 2 3 comsol multiphysics simulation the commercial software comsol multiphysics was used to analyze the heat transfer and fluid flow taking place around the cones also using the k Îµ turbulence model to simulate the mean flow characteristics for turbulent flow conditions the goal of this modeling effort is to predict the temperature of the condenser surfaces for different values of air velocity in the fluid domains the continuity equations as well the navier stokes and the energy conservation equations have to be solved simultaneously the cones structure is made of styrofoam to ensure thermal isolation the simulation of the dew condenser heat exchange takes in account the following processes i thermal behavior of the radiative material and the insulation material including its thermal conductivity thermal expansion density heat capacity and emissivity in the atmospheric window whenever known see table 1 for simplicity the radiative and insulation materials have been taken the same styrofoam with emissivity 0 83 as in sharan et al 2017 simulation ii radiative cooling power which depends on the condenser geometry and also on atmospheric conditions condenser and sky emissivity air temperature ta cloud cover n iii incoming diffusive and convective free or forced heat exchange with air which depends on wind speed v wind speed direction and condenser geometry the condensation process is not accounted for in the model dry air approximation the equations of momentum continuity and temperature are solved by using the numerical code in the simulation only typical night conditions are considered e g clear sky n 0 ta 288 15 k 15 c relative humidity rh 80 these conditions correspond to a dew point temperature td 11 6 c standard numerical values are used for the air properties density thermal conductivity specific heat etc see table 1 emissivities are taken in the atmospheric window the most interesting result of the simulation is the local temperature of the condenser from which the dew yield can be deduced see appendix 1 boundary conditions for air velocity are the same as with cfx namely air velocity follows the classical logarithmic variation with respect to elevation z according to eq 1 with zc 0 1 m i no slip conditions on condenser surfaces and ground ii open frontier on ceiling and the two vertical sides of the fluid domain iii convective flow at the exit heat transfer from the air to the surface of the condenser occurs by forced convection the complete energy equation has thus to be solved in the fluid domain using the velocities found from the solutions of the continuity equation and conservation of momentum equation navier stokes the energy equation describing this heat transfer process is given by 2 Ï c p dt dt k 2 t where Ï is the density of air cp is the specific heat of air k is the thermal conductivity of air and t the air temperature the effect of convection on the heat transfer process is taken into account in the derivative term dt dt of eq 2 3 dt dt t t v g r a d t where v is the velocity field in the air the steady state case was solved such as the time derivative term t t in eq 3 is set to zero a condition of continuity of heat flow has been taken for the upper edges and the external face of the cones the temperature of the condenser will be lower than that of the ambient air due to the radiative cooling natural convection will thus appear enhancing heat transfer between air and condenser this effect can be taken into account by a temperature dependence of the fluid density buoyancy effect in the conservation of momentum equation however the coupling forced natural convection is difficult to account it needs a long iterative process and the effect of convection which matters only for weak air flow velocity is neglected in this study in the solid domain conduction is modeled using a simple heat equation no slip boundary condition is for all condenser surfaces the reynolds number which compares the inertial forces with the viscous forces and determines whether the flow is turbulent or laminar reads as 4 r e vl Î½ here l 10 m is the condenser typical lengthscale Î½ is air kinematic viscosity and v is wind speed giving re 7 105 v laminar flow is expected for a reynolds number lower than a critical value which depends on the geometry it is on order of 2000 for cylinders but can be reduced depending on the geometry as a matter of fact turbulence was observed even for wind speed as low as 10 4 m s 1 after some trials it was considered for the simulation a box of 75 m long 20 m wide and 8 m high whose top is at 8 m above the lower part of the cones in accord with the specifications noted in section 2 2 the large value of the box length is necessary because the effects of pressure matter and were seen on smaller boxes all of the meshes created in comsol multiphysics were physics controlled and automatically generated the meshes varied in size ranging from a coarser mesh all the way up to a normal mesh several mesh sensitivity tests were carried out concerning a possible dependency of the results on various types of meshes no relevant differences have been identified in the velocity field of the upstream and downstream flow and in the temperature field the final aim of the cfd numerical is to estimate the dew water output with respect to the meteorological parameters this is a very general and difficult task and up to now several simplifications have been made to retain only the most important parameters as the actual yield per surface area h depends on the supersaturation reached by the condensing substrate the determination of the temperature drop ta tc here tc is the condenser surface temperature with respect to air temperature can represent the dew yield as shown in appendix 1 total yield is calculated from h and the condensing surface area sc hsc 3 results and discussion 3 1 air flow the two s and w shapes have been tested with the ansys cfx simulation with incoming air velocity 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 m s 1 at 10 m elevation the main result is that while the inside air flows are different for s and w shapes the variation of wind speed does not appreciably affect the aerodynamic performances of the two cones one thus only report data in figs 3 and 4 corresponding to the wind speed values 0 5 and 2 m s 1 fig 4abcd compares the aerodynamic effects on a symmetry plane along the wind direction for s and w cones for wind speed values 0 5 and 2 m s 1 increasing the wind speed only reinforces the fact that lower wind speed is seen in the s cone central air volume than in the w cone in addition above the cones higher streamline development above the w cone signs a more turbulent airflow than above the s cone fig 4a d visualize the wind velocity on the internal surface of the condenser which is of prime importance for convective heat transfer increasing the incoming wind velocity changes has very little effect in contrast wind on s cone internal surface is seen to be lower than on the w cone surface one thus sees that condenser surface velocity is largely affected by external and internal geometry smoother geometries help to maintain low wind speed at condenser surface velocity at condenser surface is higher in the w cone than in the s cone as caused by the triangulated external surfaces and exposed highest edges of the condenser one thus expects enhanced convective heat transfer with the w cone some studies have been carried out with comsol at two typical wind speeds at 10 m elevation a very low speed of 10 4 m s 1 where the reynolds number re 70 and a speed of 2 m s 1 re 1 4 106 the latter value is a mean value for dew formation which in average occurs between 0 and 4 4 m s 1 see beysens 2018 and corresponds to the mean wind speed during night at the site where such condensers should be implemented the low speed value 10 4 m s 1 was chosen because the simulation with cfx which was looking for variations in aerodynamic patterns did not find significant differences between high and low wind speed the aerodynamics of the design performs similarly at all wind conditions tested then the decision of modeling the wind at 10 4 m s 1 has been taken as this represents a little to no wind scenario that is likely to be experienced on site in addition this low wind condition helps to reach convergent solutions in a reasonably short time span by reducing turbulent effects although turbulence is seen even at low wind speed fig 5 stagnation of the flow is also observed which limits the convective heat exchanges and facilitates dew formation 3 2 surface temperature temperature of the inner surface of the cones are reported in fig 6 a d for both w and s cones at the two wind speeds of 10 4 m s 1 and 2 m s 1 and summarized in table 2 for 10 4 m s 1 windspeed the mean cooling with respect to air temperature is found to be 5 85 k s cone and 6 55 k w cone and for 2 m s windspeed 5 49 k s cone and 5 25 k w cone corrugation increases on one hand radiative cooling but on the other hand reduces cooling by enhanced convective heat exchange at low speed convective heat exchange is similar for both smooth and corrugated surfaces and corrugation increases cooling for the w cone at higher air flow velocities convective heat exchange is larger for the w cone and cooling is eventually found smaller than for the smooth cone however the difference 0 24 k remains small details of air temperature are also shown in fig 6e f air is seen to cool down after having passed near the cone edge 4 conclusion from a detailed analysis of air flows around corrugated w cone and smooth s cone it appears clearly that although the inside air flows are different for the two shapes the variation of wind speed does not appreciably affect the aerodynamic performances of the two cones the scooping effect however performs better in the s shape than in the w shape with wind speed on the internal surface of the s cone lower compared to the w shape the shape of the crown in the s shape cone indeed amplifies the upward trajectory of the wind that is redirected away from the inner area of the cone as it hits the edge of attack this geometrical feature helps significantly in reducing the wind speed on the internal surface of the s cone compared to the w shape from these air flow characteristics it naturally follows that the w cone which radiates more also cools more at low windspeed than the s cone where the convective heat transfer is low in contrast at large windspeed the w cone cools less as an effect of enhanced convective heat transfer in the corrugated structure for typical air flow velocity of 2 m s 1 the difference in mean cooling between both shapes remains however small 0 24 k since cooling temperatures are nearly proportional to dew yield for the weak cooling temperatures as encountered in dew condensation it means that the corrugated w cone which exhibit better dew drop collecting properties will give a final better dew collection yield per surface area than the corresponding smooth s cone total yield will obviously has to account for the different w and s cone actual surface areas in the example reported here with 24 faces for the w cone the s cone exhibits a surface larger than the w cone credit authorship contribution statement

watershed in the rugged southern part of the qinling mountains region in shaanxi province fig 1 a was selected as the case study area with a drainage area of 2186 km2 fig 1b the terrain elevation decreases from north to south with steep brooks and streams favoring formation of floods fig 1b and 1c due to the barrier effect of qinling mountains humid air from the southern and southeastern areas brings a large amount of water vapor and the watershed is prone to frequent flash floods caused by heavy rainfall especially in summer summer rainfall accounts for 46 of the annual precipitation characterized by short duration and high intensity resulting in flash floods the average annual precipitation and runoff of this watershed are about 900 mm and 400 mm respectively more than 70 of the watershed area is sandy soils fig 1d due to the influence of rainfall and topography flash floods of the dedahe watershed have pronounced seasonality chao et al 2018 2 2 data in this study we selected daheba watershed with an area of 2186 km2 as a case study to do simulations using the wrf hydro rapid model and evaluate its performance at three inner stations longcaoping xiasahwo chenjiaba and one outlet station daheba there are 5 flood events of daheba station from 2013 to 2014 and two flood events of three inner stations in 2014 each flood event number is represented by 10 digits consisting of year month day and hour the 1st to 4th digits represents year following by 2 digits for month 2 for day and 2 for hour to make the comparison of simulated and modeled times of flood peaks easier we

longwave radiation and horizontal and vertical wind speeds satellite precipitation data come from the cmorph product the spatial resolution of cmorph products is 8 km and the temporal resolution is 0 5 h the half hourly data were accumulated to hourly the 8 km cmorph precipitation product was downscaled to 1 km precipitation data comrphd using the bilinear interpolation method the downscaled cmorph and gauge precipitation data with the temporal resolution of 1 h were merged using the mgwr bi algorithm chao et al 2018 firstly we interpolated the cmorphd precipitation data to the station level data at the 16 gauging stations through the bilinear interpolation method and calculated the bias between the gauge precipitation data and the cmorphd interpolated precipitation data then the mgwr bi algorithm which is composed of three steps was used to estimate the bias on each gird cell the first step is to use the bi square function to calculate the spatial weights matrix the second step is to apply the coefficient calculation formula to compute the regression coefficients of the mgwr model on each grid cell using the derived spatial weights matrix the third step is to use the mgwr model to estimate biases on each grid cell which requires the regression coefficients and explanatory variables such as dem aspect slope surface roughness distance to coastline and wind speed finally the derived biases were removed from the downscaled satellite precipitation cmorphd to produce the merged 1 h 1 km precipitation data more details on the mgwr bi algorithm can be found in chao et al 2018 the resultant merged data were used as the input of the wrf hydro model the other input meteorological data including air temperature surface pressure specific humidity incoming shortwave

one hydrological station which observed hydrological variables such as precipitation discharge evaporation and water level during 2013 2014 were used in this study there were only five rain gauges and one hydrological station within the whole watershed before 2011 15 rain gauges started collecting precipitation data from 2013 one hydrological station daheba and three self recording water stage and flow stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba are operational within the watershed from 2013 fig 1b the self recording water stage and flow station requires a flood season to calibrate so that only the 2014 data are available in 2015 the hydropower project was started and the cofferdam was established at daheba station which brings certain influences on the flood concentration the observation data of daheba station provides information for cofferdam project since 2015 and it would be used as the observed inflow for the dam s storage when the project is finished the observed streamflow data at the watershed outlet for the period 2013 2014 and the discharge of three self recording water stage and flow stations in 2014 were collected for this study for the selected period the observation network density has been increased and the dam has not yet been built therefore the study area during the study period is an ideal case study region with low human impacts and a good representativeness of natural rainfall runoff behavior 3 model and evaluation approach 3 1 brief description of the wrf hydro rapid model the wrf model is a widely used numerical weather prediction nwp tool for climate weather research developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar nehrkorn et al 2010 skamarock and klemp 2008 the wrf hydro modeling framework is the hydrological extension of the noah and noah mp land surface model arnault et al 2016 yucel et al 2015 the wrf hydro modeling framework has several options for hydrologic models including noah and noah mp land surface model to simulate overland flow saturated subsurface flow channel routing and baseflow gochis et al 2018 the noah mp land surface model is used in wrf hydro modeling framework which can be run standalone or coupled with the wrf atmospheric model lin et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 the wrf hydro is a flexible model framework it can not only simulate the hydrograph for flood forecasting at multiple scales standalone but also can be coupled with other models or modules for water resources management water quality prediction and so on senatore et al 2015 the rapid is a river network routing model based on the traditional muskingum method and a geographic information system gis david et al 2016 2011b 2013 one advantage of the rapid is direct computation of streamflow using the vector based spatial geographic data such as national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus and hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds another advantage of the rapid is its computational efficiency compared to grid routing scheme in this study we used the land surface model namely the noah mp model of the wrf hydro framework to simulate the yielded runoff and its components on each grid cell and use the runoff simulated by the noah mp model as the input of the rapid model to simulate the runoff concentration and routing processes in this study we focused on the offline applications of wrf hydro with a vector based routing model rapid to understand the effect of improved precipitation accuracy on flood simulation and forecasting 3 2 hydrological evaluation of merged precipitation data to evaluate the effectiveness and impacts of the merging approach and its resultant merged precipitation on flood simulation and forecasting we selected five flood events at the daheba station and two events at the three self recording water stage and flow stations table 1 to conduct the hydrological evaluation of the merged precipitation data hydrological evaluation means the evaluation of the simulated hydrographs driven by both the original precipitation data and merged result comparing to the streamflow observations since the wrf hydro rapid is a distributed model that is able to simulate streamflow at any river reach we divided the daheba watershed into 47 sub watersheds fig 1b the spatial resolution of all input data is 1 km and the temporal simulation resolution of wrf hydro rapid is set to 1 h the five flood events of the daheba watershed and two respective flood events of longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba sub watersheds were used to evaluate the simulated discharges three evaluation metrics were selected to evaluate the model simulation including the absolute relative error of flood peak relative error of flood volume and deterministic coefficient chao et al 2019 hapuarachchi et al 2001 the absolute relative error of flood peak d p is defined as the difference between the observed and simulated flood peaks hapuarachchi et al 2001 1 d p q o m a x q c m a x q o m a x where q o m a x and q c m a x are the observed and simulated flood peaks respectively smaller d p indicates that the simulated flood peak is closer to the observed flood peak the relative error of flood volume d v ma et al 2006 measuring the accuracy of modeled total flood water volume is defined as 2 d v i 1 n q c i Î´ t i 1 n q o i Î´ t i 1 n q o i Î´ t where q o i and q c i are the observed and simulated discharge at time i respectively and Î´ t is the time interval and is equal to 1 h in this study the deterministic coefficient d c chao et al 2019 measures the fitting between the simulated and observed discharge series 3 d c 1 i 1 n q o q c 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 where q o is the average value of the observed flood discharge time series greater dc indicates the simulated discharge being closer to the observed 3 3 spatial performance evaluation of the wrf hydro rapid model the wrf hydro rapid model is a distributed model and is able to simulate discharge at any river reach to investigate whether the performance of the wrf hydro rapid model varies in space we further compared the performance at four streamflow gauging stations since the three self recording gauging stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba only have data for 2014 we therefore only analyzed the results for the two events in 2014 i e 2014083000 and 2014090700 flood events the xiashawo longcaoping and chenjiaba sub watersheds are spatially independent first order sub watershed of the daheba watershed fig 1b therefore the performances of the wrf hydro rapid model at the three stations are independent of each other in model calculation process for the same flood event which provides a valuable way to evaluate whether the predictability of wrf hydro rapid model differs in space comparison between the performance of wrf hydro rapid model at the watershed outlet daheba station and those at the three inner stations provide another way to evaluate whether the performance of the wrf hydro rapid model differs across spatial scale 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the merged precipitation results fig 2 compares the merged precipitation data from downscaled cmorph and gauge observations chao et al 2018 through the three statistical indexes bias mm h root mean square error rmse mm h and correlation coefficient r a bilinear interpolation was used to map the 8 km gridded cmorph data onto the 16 stations of cmorphd the merged precipitation products have smaller biases 0 63 0 12 mm h than the cmorphd precipitation data 3 02 0 35 mm h fig 2a smaller rmse values 1 59 6 64 mm h fig 2b than the cmorphd precipitation data 3 31 8 25 mm h fig 2b and larger r values 0 64 0 74 fig 2c than the cmorphd precipitation 0 11 0 06 fig 2c the minimum r value 0 64 of the merged precipitation for the 2013071500 flood event is greater than the maximum r value of the cmorphd 0 06 for the 2014083000 flood event and each blue bar is higher than the corresponding red bar fig 2c the merged precipitation using the mgwr bi algorithm agreed more closely with the gauge observations than the cmorphd data the hourly cmorphd precipitation data have lower quality indicated by low r values between 0 11 and 0 06 high rmse values between 3 31 mm h and 8 25 mm h and large biases between the 3 02 mm h and 0 35 mm h fig 2a 2c the rmses of the merged precipitation are less than 6 7 mm h fig 2b and the r values greater than 0 6 fig 2c while the cmorphd precipitation has smaller bias 0 18 mm h fig 2a than the merged precipitation 0 24 mm h fig 2a for the flood event of 2014090700 these results clearly demonstrate that the merged precipitation data undoubtedly have higher quality than the original cmorph data fig 3 shows the probability distributions of precipitation intensities of the gauge cmorphd and merged precipitation data the probability of gauge cmorphd and merged precipitation lower than 2 mm hr 1 is 94 90 and 93 respectively while that of higher than 10 mm hr 1 is 1 4 1 7 and 1 4 respectively when precipitation is higher than 10 mm hr 1 the probability of merged precipitation is more consistent with the probability of gauge precipitation indicating that the mgwr bi algorithm performs well in merging precipitation greater than 10 mm hr 1 clearly the satellite based cmorphd data tends to underestimate the lower rainfall rates i e rates lower than 2 mm hr 1 which occurs most of the time in contrast it tends to overestimate the high extreme rainfall rates i e those larger than 10 mm hr 1 these apparent biases can introduce considerable uncertainty in the cmorphd driven flood simulations it is clearly that the merged precipitation has gained better agreement with the gauge data than the cmorphd data fig 3 4 2 watershed level hydrological evaluation of the merged precipitation using the wrf hydro rapid model fig 4 compares the simulations of the five flood events by using cmorphd and merged precipitation data the absolute relative errors of flood peak d p of all cmorphd precipitation driven simulations are higher than 0 6 fig 4a and those of the merged precipitation simulations are between 0 02 and 0 24 with a mean value of 0 09 fig 4a and table 2 compared with the cmorphd precipitation driven simulations the accuracy of simulated flood peak of the merged precipitation driven simulations is much higher the flood volume relative errors d v of cmorphd driven simulations fall between 0 66 and 0 43 with a mean value of 0 57 table 2 and those of the merged precipitation driven simulations between 0 25 and 0 18 with a mean value of 0 05 fig 4b the deterministic coefficients d c of the comrphd precipitation driven simulations are less than 0 5 fig 4c d c s of the merged precipitation driven simulations are more than 0 62 with a mean value of 0 75 fig 4c indicating that flood hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations have a better fitting than the flood hydrographs of cmorphd driven results therefore the merged precipitation has largely improved the flood simulation accuracy especially the accuracies of flood peak and volume 4 3 sub watershed level hydrological evaluation of the merged precipitation using the wrf hydro rapid model fig 5 shows the flood hydrographs at the daheba station among the five flood events during 2013 to 2014 three exceeded the warning flow of 1000 m3 s the simulated flood peaks are lower than the observed flood peaks for all five flood events especially the cmorphd simulations d p s of the merged precipitation driven simulations are less than 0 10 for all flood events except the 20140803000 flood event fig 5a 5e the simulated peak times of the merged precipitation driven simulations are within 3h for all flood events but the 2014090700 flood event fig 5a 5e in terms of the d p and d c metrics the merged precipitation driven simulations has the least performance for 2014083000 flood event fig 5d the d p and d c values of the merged precipitation driven simulation for this event are 0 25 and 0 62 respectively fig 5d however these values are still acceptable for the other events the merged precipitation driven simulations have achieved much better results the simulations have well captured the rising and the falling limbs of the 2013072200 and 2013071500 flood events especially at the higher flow 1000 m3 s stage fig 5b and 5c d c s of the merged precipitation driven simulations are greater than 0 7 and d p s of merged precipitation driven are less than 0 09 for the three events that exceeded the warning flow fig 5b 5c and 5e the discharge hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations for the five flood events agree closely with the gauge discharge hydrographs fig 5a 5e the discharge hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations are better than cmorphd driven simulations the merged precipitation driven simulations of the wrf hydro rapid model clearly outperform those cmorphd simulations especially these events that exceeded the waning flow at daheba station the merged precipitation products clearly help to improve the accuracy of flood simulations fig 5 fig 6 shows the hydrographs at the longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba stations self recording water stage and flow stations the simulated flood peaks driven by the cmorphd precipitation data are apparently much lower than the observed flood peaks fig 6a 6f in contrast the simulated flood peaks driven by the merged precipitation data generally match very well with the observations fig 6a 6f for the 2014083000 flood event the simulated flood recessions are faster than the observed ones and the d c of the merged precipitation driven simulations for xiashawo station is greater than loncaoping and chenjiaba station with the average d c of 0 68 for the 2014083000 flood event fig 6a 6c for the 2014090700 flood event d c of the merged precipitation driven simulations is higher than 0 55 with an average of 0 63 fig 6d 6f d p and d v of the merged precipitation driven simulations are reduced and d c of the merged precipitation driven simulations is improved the performance of wrf hydro rapid model using merged precipitation is clearly much better as the merged precipitation can largely improve the accuracy of flood simulation figs 5 and 6 4 4 spatial evaluation of the wrf hydro rapid performance fig 7 shows the statistics of the merged precipitation driven simulations for 2014083000 and 2014090700 flood events at the watershed outlet dedahe station and the three inner gauging stations xiashawo longcaoping and chenjiaba the contributing areas of the three sub watersheds increase from xiashawo 114 4 km2 to longcaoping 173 4 km2 and to chenjiaba 371 km2 fig 1b and table 1 the average d p values for the four stations are less than 0 30 with largest value for the chenjiaba station 0 28 followed by the xiashawo 0 19 longcaoping 0 18 and daheba stations 0 17 fig 7 except the chenjiaba station the average d p value does not differ much at the other three stations with quite different contributing areas in terms of the d v metrics its average values for the four stations falls between 0 26 and 0 10 with the largest error at the chenjiaba 0 26 and the lowest error at the daheba station 0 1 fig 7 the average dv values for the other two basins are between 0 16 and 0 18 fig 7 the average d c for the four stations varies between 0 61 and 0 73 with the highest values at the xiashawo station 0 73 followed by the deheba 0 71 longcaoping 0 63 and chenjiaba 0 61 stations fig 7 as indicated by fig 7 there is no apparent dependency of the three model performance metrics on the size of simulated watershed although the dv value at the outlet station daheba is clearly better than those at the three inner stations fig 7 the values of the other two metrics are comparable to those values at the three inner stations fig 7 these results indicate that watershed area is not an apparent factor influencing the performance of the wrf hydro rapid model and prove that the wrf hydro rapid model is robust to achieve comparable simulation quality across the daheba watershed accurate predictions of flood peak and flood peak time are critical for flood forecasting warning and prevention there are three flood events 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 that exceeded the warning flow 1000 m3 s during 2013 2014 in the study area fig 5 to check the capability of wrf hydro rapid to predict the flood peaks at any river reach and flood propagation along the river reaches we further investigated the modeled flood peak values and their timings along the river network of the daheba watershed for the three flood events as shown in fig 8 the daheba watershed has three large tributaries jiaoxi river pu river and wenshui river from west to east eight first order reaches no 1 2 3 4 5 6 13 and 14 reaches and nine second order reaches no 7 12 16 17 22 23 26 28 and 29 reaches are located at the upstream of the daheba watershed while six first order reaches no 31 34 36 38 39 42 reaches at the downstream of the daheba watershed fig 1b and fig 8a the rest reaches are third order reaches or higher it is clearly that flood peak increases from lower order upper stream river reaches to higher order downstream river reaches fig 8a 8c for example the simulated peak discharges of all first order reaches are less than 245 m3 s for all of the three flood events while peak flows at the downstream reaches such as no 43 and 46 can reach between 400 and 1200 m3 s fig 8a 8c the simulated peak discharges for the outlet river reach i e reach no 47 are 1478 2 m3 s 1435 8 m3 s and 1449 5 m3 s for the three events respectively fig 8a 8c the spatial distribution of simulated peak discharges by the wrf hydro rapid model show a clear flow cumulative effect across this study area and proves its ability to simulate flood propagation along the terrain the simulated flood peak times at the watershed outlet by the merged precipitation driven wrf hydro rapid predictions are 2013 07 18 13 00 2013 07 22 18 00 and 2014 09 10 15 00 for the 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 flood events respectively table 3 and fig 8d 8f the peak times at the outlet for the 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 flood events are 86 19 and 89 h later since rainfall starts respectively table 3 for the three flood events the spatial distributions of flood peak times show similar increasing gradients from upper stream to downstream fig 8d 8f indicating the flood propagation it is not surprising to observe flood peaks occurring earlier in the upper stream reaches such as reaches 1 10 followed by the middle reaches such as reaches 21 23 26 28 and 30 and the downstream reaches like reaches 41 43 44 and 46 47 fig 8d 8f however there are also different patterns in the peak time maps for the three flood events for example the peak times at the watershed outlet reach 47 are 13 16 and 37 h later than the first peak times in the upper stream for the 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 flood events respectively table 3 in addition reaches 1 2 7 and 8 located in the northwest of this region are the first reaches experiencing flood peaks for the 2013071500 flood event in contrast reaches 1 2 7 and 34 are these reaches having the earliest peaks for the 2013072200 flood event while the reaches with the earliest peaks for the 2014090700 flood event are 1 6 10 and 13 14 along with the other twelve reaches table 3 there are many factors that affect the flood peak time including spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation precipitation duration precipitation intensity number of precipitation events topographic features flow concentration process and so on based on our analysis the main reasons for these differences are the difference in rainfall spatiotemporal distributions of these flood events in this region the number of precipitation events and duration of each precipitation event are different for the three flood events for the 2013071500 flood event the rainstorm is composed of two large precipitation events with maximum hourly areal rainfall peak greater than 5 mm and a total duration of 40 h fig 5b for the 2013072200 flood event only one precipitation event occurs and lasted for about 24 h fig 5c the 2014090700 flood event has a very long duration i e 11 days and has multiple flood peaks and precipitation events fig 5e rainfall intensity in the 2014090700 flood event is generally mild relative to the 2013071500 and 2013072200 flood events and is higher in the beginning and lower in the later phase fig 5e there are four major precipitation events and three flood peaks before reaching the maximum observed flood peak discharge additionally the daheba watershed is located at a mountainous area with complex topography which also has a certain influence on the spatial distribution of precipitation and the processes of runoff generation and concentration the above results clearly indicate that the spatiotemporal distributions of precipitation have a large impact on the formation of flood events the spatial patterns of flood peak times in different river reaches and the magnitudes of flood peak in different river reaches without sophisticated distributed hydrological models such as wrf hydro rapid model it is impossible to predict these valuable spatiotemporal information in summary the spatial maps of simulated flood peak values and flood peak times by the wrf hydro rapid model for the three flood events show logical and reasonable patterns across the region and also show different rainfall runoff responses due to difference in the spatiotemporal distributions of rainfall among the events the above results demonstrate that the wrf hydro rapid model as a distributed model is a promising and valuable tool for flood simulation and forecasting its ability to make prediction at any river reach and produce consistent quality along the river network is important for its application these results also increase our confidence on the wrf hydro rapid model for flood simulation and forecasting at local reach scale and basin scale 5 discussions and conclusions precipitation is the main input data for hydrological models and land surface models collischonn et al 2008 devia et al 2015 langella et al 2010 it directly affects the precision and accuracy of model simulation and forecasting results the high quality of precipitation with high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for flood simulation and forecasting especially flash flood forecasting in mountainous areas in order to obtain high quality of precipitation in small and medium size mountainous watershed we used the merged algorithm named mgwr bi to produce rainfall data with a substantially improved quality it can fulfill both downscaling of satellite precipitation and their merging with gauge observations the evaluation results show that mgwr bi algorithm can substantially improve the quality of precipitation for five flood events figs 2 and 3 namely the mgwr bi algorithm is an effective and robust for merging multi source precipitation gauge observation radar qpe and satellite qpe although accuracy of the merged precipitation products with a finer spatial resolution has been improved many factors can impact the accuracy of the merging results such as the quality of observation and satellite precipitation selection of the merged algorithms and spatial distribution and density of gauge stations many previous studies have merged gauge data radar qpe and satellite qpe by using different merged methods beck et al 2017 ma et al 2018 shen et al 2014 it will be valuable to apply the wrf hydro rapid model to conduct hydrological evaluation for the other precipitation merging methods analyzing the impacts of gauge network density and optimizing the spatial distribution of gauge station network will be also important research topics the merged precipitation clearly helped the wrf hydro rapid model to improve its simulation results by comparing with the cmorphd driven simulations fig 4 and table 2 emphasizing the importance of improving rainfall quality for improving the accuracy of flood simulation and forecasting for the hydrological models and land surface models the hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations fitted much better with the observed hydrograph than the cmorphd precipitation driven simulations at daheba station and three self recording water stage and flow stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba it reasonably explains that higher quality of precipitation generates better simulation results figs 5 and 6 the simulated hydrographs show strong sensitivity to rainfall events the simulated hydrograph shape is similar to the observed hydrograph shape which proves the effectiveness of the rapid streamflow confluence and routing scheme the model simulations can well capture the hydrological response of each sub watershed for most of the flood events overall the wrf hydro rapid model with merged precipitation as input not only performs well at watershed outlet station daheba but also shows good performances at the inner three stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba the performance of model to simulate flood peak flood volume and hydrograph is affected by precipitation uncertainty river network and parameter accuracy yucel et al 2015 summarized several error sources for the wrf hydro modeling framework including uncertainty in precipitation intensity location of storm and duration of storms human activities and climate change have been altering the hydrological cycles and processes in many regions increasing the difficulty and affecting the accuracy of model simulation eisner et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 to further improve the model accuracy methods accounting for or offsetting these uncertainty or limitations should be further studied our results also show that the wrf hydro rapid model is able to produce comparable performance at the outlet station and the other three inner stations figs 5 7 the spatial distribution of simulated peak discharges and peak times for the three flood events exceeded the warning flow show reasonable spatial gradients fig 8 in addition the wrf hydro rapid model greatly increases the computational efficiency because of the conversion from grid output to vector output the wrf hydro rapid model has an ability to simulate the flood propagation and provide valuable information for flood prediction preparedness prevention and mitigation making it a promising and valuable tool for scientific research and practical application due to lack of gauge observations flood simulation and forecasting has always been a challenge in small and medium size watershed especially for flash flood simulation and forecasting in a mountainous area with complex topography and underlying conditions this study provides a reference for flood simulation and forecasting of small and medium size watershed by using the precipitation merging products the wrf hydro modeling framework is applicable to large scale flood simulation and forecasting which is its initial goal our study also demonstrates that the wrf hydro rapid still has a wide application prospect

rapid model model evaluation 1 introduction what happens to the rain is a basic science question in hydrology penman 1961 local heavy rainfall is prone to cause flash floods especially in medium and small mountainous watersheds whose drainage area is between 200 and 3000 km2 with complex topography chao et al 2019 eshel et al 2017 gochis et al 2015 flash floods often cause severe damages due to quick occurrence undoubtedly high performance rainfall runoff models are the key for flash flood simulation and forecasting studies show that 70 80 of the uncertainty in flood simulation and

the wu tu watershed in taiwan during typhoon periods by merging gauge observations and satellite derived precipitation previous studies demonstrate that multi sources precipitation products are promising for hydrological model simulations in terms of improving flood simulation and forecasting in this study the mixed geographically weighted regression and bi square function mgwr bi algorithm is used for merging gauge precipitation with the cpc morphing technique satellite precipitation data cmorph to obtain an hourly 1 km merged product the objectives of this study are three fold 1 to prove the effectiveness of the multi source precipitation merging approach on improving the quality of precipitation data 2 to conduct hydrological evaluation of the merged precipitation data produced by the mgwr bi algorithm and 3 to investigate whether the distributed wrf hydro rapid model can have consistent performance in space 2 study area and data 2 1 study area in this study the daheba watershed in the rugged southern part of the qinling mountains region in shaanxi province fig 1 a was selected as the case study area with a drainage area of 2186 km2 fig 1b the terrain elevation decreases from north to south with steep brooks and streams favoring formation of floods fig 1b and 1c due to the barrier effect of qinling mountains humid air from the southern and southeastern areas brings a large amount of water vapor and the watershed is prone to frequent flash floods caused by heavy rainfall especially in summer summer rainfall accounts for 46 of the annual precipitation characterized by short duration and high intensity resulting in flash floods the average annual precipitation and runoff of this watershed are about 900 mm and 400 mm respectively more than 70 of the watershed area is sandy soils fig 1d due to the influence of rainfall and topography flash floods of the dedahe watershed have pronounced seasonality chao et al 2018 2 2 data in this study we selected daheba watershed with an area of 2186 km2 as a case study to do simulations using the wrf hydro rapid model and evaluate its performance at three inner stations longcaoping xiasahwo chenjiaba and one outlet station daheba there are 5 flood events of daheba station from 2013 to 2014 and two flood events of three inner stations in 2014 each flood event number is represented by 10 digits consisting of year month day and hour the 1st to 4th digits represents year following by 2 digits for month 2 for day and 2 for hour to make the comparison of simulated and modeled times of flood peaks easier we chose 0 00 of the day on which rainstorm started as the starting time for each flood event the model input data with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h were obtained from

longwave radiation and horizontal and vertical wind speeds satellite precipitation data come from the cmorph product the spatial resolution of cmorph products is 8 km and the temporal resolution is 0 5 h the half hourly data were accumulated to hourly the 8 km cmorph precipitation product was downscaled to 1 km precipitation data comrphd using the bilinear interpolation method the downscaled cmorph and gauge precipitation data with the temporal resolution of 1 h were merged using the mgwr bi algorithm chao et al 2018 firstly we interpolated the cmorphd precipitation data to the station level data at the 16 gauging stations through the bilinear interpolation method and calculated the bias between the gauge precipitation data and the cmorphd interpolated precipitation data then the mgwr bi algorithm which is composed of three steps was used to estimate the bias on each gird cell the first step is to use the bi square function to calculate the spatial weights matrix the second step is to apply the coefficient calculation formula to compute the regression coefficients of the mgwr model on each grid cell using the derived spatial weights matrix the third step is to use the mgwr model to estimate biases on each grid cell which requires the regression coefficients and explanatory variables such as dem aspect slope surface roughness distance to coastline and wind speed finally the derived biases were removed from the downscaled satellite precipitation cmorphd to produce the merged 1 h 1 km precipitation data more details on the mgwr bi algorithm can be found in chao

one hydrological station which observed hydrological variables such as precipitation discharge evaporation and water level during 2013 2014 were used in this study there were only five rain gauges and one hydrological station within the whole watershed before 2011 15 rain gauges started collecting precipitation data from 2013 one hydrological station daheba and three self recording water stage and flow stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba are operational within the watershed from 2013 fig 1b the self recording water stage and flow station requires a flood season to calibrate so that only the 2014 data are available in 2015 the hydropower project was started and the cofferdam was established at daheba station which brings certain influences on the flood concentration the observation data of daheba station provides information for cofferdam project since 2015 and it would be used as the observed inflow for the dam s storage when the project is finished the observed streamflow data at the watershed outlet for the period 2013 2014 and the discharge of three self recording water stage and flow stations in 2014 were collected for this study for the selected period the observation network density has been increased and the dam has not yet been built therefore the study area during the study period is an ideal case study region with low human impacts and a good representativeness of natural rainfall runoff behavior 3 model and evaluation approach 3 1 brief description of the wrf hydro rapid model the wrf model is a widely used numerical weather prediction nwp tool for climate weather research developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar nehrkorn et al 2010 skamarock and klemp 2008 the wrf hydro modeling framework is the hydrological extension of the noah and noah mp land surface model arnault et al 2016 yucel et al 2015 the wrf hydro modeling framework has several options for hydrologic models including noah and noah mp land surface model to simulate overland flow saturated subsurface flow channel routing and baseflow gochis et al 2018 the noah mp land surface model is used in wrf hydro modeling framework which can be run standalone or coupled with the wrf atmospheric model lin et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 the wrf hydro is a flexible model framework it can not only simulate the hydrograph for flood forecasting at multiple scales standalone but also can be coupled with other models or modules for water resources management water quality prediction and so on senatore et al 2015 the rapid is a river network routing model based on the traditional muskingum method and a geographic information system gis david et al 2016 2011b 2013 one advantage of the rapid is direct computation of streamflow using the vector based spatial geographic data such as national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus and hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds another advantage of the rapid is its computational efficiency compared to grid routing scheme in this study we used the land surface model namely the noah mp model of the wrf hydro framework to simulate the yielded runoff and its components on each grid cell and use the runoff simulated by the noah mp model as the input of the rapid model to simulate the runoff concentration and routing processes in this study we focused on the offline applications of wrf hydro with a vector based routing model rapid to understand the effect of improved precipitation accuracy on flood simulation and forecasting 3 2 hydrological evaluation of merged precipitation data to evaluate the effectiveness and impacts of the merging approach and its resultant merged precipitation on flood simulation and forecasting we selected five flood events at the daheba station and two events at the three self recording water stage and flow stations table 1 to conduct the hydrological evaluation of the merged precipitation data hydrological evaluation means the evaluation of the simulated hydrographs driven by both the original precipitation data and merged result comparing to the streamflow observations since the wrf hydro rapid is a distributed model that is able to simulate streamflow at any river reach we divided the daheba watershed into 47 sub watersheds fig 1b the spatial resolution of all input data is 1 km and the temporal simulation resolution of wrf hydro rapid is set to 1 h the five flood events of the daheba watershed and two respective flood events of longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba sub watersheds were used to evaluate the simulated discharges three evaluation metrics were selected to evaluate the model simulation including the absolute relative error of flood peak relative error of flood volume and deterministic coefficient chao et al 2019 hapuarachchi et al 2001 the absolute relative error of flood peak d p is defined as the difference between the observed and simulated flood peaks hapuarachchi et al 2001 1 d p q o m a x q c m a x q o m a x where q o m a x and q c m a x are the observed and simulated flood peaks respectively smaller d p indicates that the simulated flood peak is closer to the observed flood peak the relative error of flood volume d v ma et al 2006 measuring the accuracy of modeled total flood water volume is defined as 2 d v i 1 n q c i Î´ t i 1 n q o i Î´ t i 1 n q o i Î´ t where q o i and q c i are the observed and simulated discharge at time i respectively and Î´ t is the time interval and is equal to 1 h in this study the deterministic coefficient d c chao et al 2019 measures the fitting between the simulated and observed discharge series 3 d c 1 i 1 n q o q c 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 where q o is the average value of the observed flood discharge time series greater dc indicates the simulated discharge being closer to the observed 3 3 spatial performance evaluation of the wrf hydro rapid model the wrf hydro rapid model is a distributed model and is able to simulate discharge at any river reach to investigate whether the performance of the wrf hydro rapid model varies in space we further compared the performance at four streamflow gauging stations since the three self recording gauging stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba only have data for 2014 we therefore only analyzed the results for the two events in 2014 i e 2014083000 and 2014090700 flood events the xiashawo longcaoping and chenjiaba sub watersheds are spatially independent first order sub watershed of the daheba watershed fig 1b therefore the performances of the wrf hydro rapid model at the three stations are independent of each other in model calculation process for the same flood event which provides a valuable way to evaluate whether the predictability of wrf hydro rapid model differs in space comparison between the performance of wrf hydro rapid model at the watershed outlet daheba station and those at the three inner stations provide another way to evaluate whether the performance of the wrf hydro rapid model differs across spatial scale 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the merged precipitation results fig 2 compares the merged precipitation data from downscaled cmorph and gauge observations chao et al 2018 through the three statistical indexes bias mm h root mean square error rmse mm h and correlation coefficient r a bilinear interpolation was used to map the 8 km gridded cmorph data onto the 16 stations of cmorphd the merged precipitation products have smaller biases 0 63 0 12 mm h than the cmorphd precipitation data 3 02 0 35 mm h fig 2a smaller rmse values 1 59 6 64 mm h fig 2b than the cmorphd precipitation data 3 31 8 25 mm h fig 2b and larger r values 0 64 0 74 fig 2c than the cmorphd precipitation 0 11 0 06 fig 2c the minimum r value 0 64 of the merged precipitation for the 2013071500 flood event is greater than the maximum r value of the cmorphd 0 06 for the 2014083000 flood event and each blue bar is higher than the corresponding red bar fig 2c the merged precipitation using the mgwr bi algorithm agreed more closely with the gauge observations than the cmorphd data the hourly cmorphd precipitation data have lower quality indicated by low r values between 0 11 and 0 06 high rmse values between 3 31 mm h and 8 25 mm h and large biases between the 3 02 mm h and 0 35 mm h fig 2a 2c the rmses of the merged precipitation are less than 6 7 mm h fig 2b and the r values greater than 0 6 fig 2c while the cmorphd precipitation has smaller bias 0 18 mm h fig 2a than the merged precipitation 0 24 mm h fig 2a for the flood event of 2014090700 these results clearly demonstrate that the merged precipitation data undoubtedly have higher quality than the original cmorph data fig 3 shows the probability distributions of precipitation intensities of the gauge cmorphd and merged precipitation data the probability of gauge cmorphd and merged precipitation lower than 2 mm hr 1 is 94 90 and 93 respectively while that of higher than 10 mm hr 1 is 1 4 1 7 and 1 4 respectively when precipitation is higher than 10 mm hr 1 the probability of merged precipitation is more consistent with the probability of gauge precipitation indicating that the mgwr bi algorithm performs well in merging precipitation greater than 10 mm hr 1 clearly the satellite based cmorphd data tends to underestimate the lower rainfall rates i e rates lower than 2 mm hr 1 which occurs most of the time in contrast it tends to overestimate the high extreme rainfall rates i e those larger than 10 mm hr 1 these apparent biases can introduce considerable uncertainty in the cmorphd driven flood simulations it is clearly that the merged precipitation has gained better agreement with the gauge data than the cmorphd data fig 3 4 2 watershed level hydrological evaluation of the merged precipitation using the wrf hydro rapid model fig 4 compares the simulations of the five flood events by using cmorphd and merged precipitation data the absolute relative errors of flood peak d p of all cmorphd precipitation driven simulations are higher than 0 6 fig 4a and those of the merged precipitation simulations are between 0 02 and 0 24 with a mean value of 0 09 fig 4a and table 2 compared with the cmorphd precipitation driven simulations the accuracy of simulated flood peak of the merged precipitation driven simulations is much higher the flood volume relative errors d v of cmorphd driven simulations fall between 0 66 and 0 43 with a mean value of 0 57 table 2 and those of the merged precipitation driven simulations between 0 25 and 0 18 with a mean value of 0 05 fig 4b the deterministic coefficients d c of the comrphd precipitation driven simulations are less than 0 5 fig 4c d c s of the merged precipitation driven simulations are more than 0 62 with a mean value of 0 75 fig 4c indicating that flood hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations have a better fitting than the flood hydrographs of cmorphd driven results therefore the merged precipitation has largely improved the flood simulation accuracy especially the accuracies of flood peak and volume 4 3 sub watershed level hydrological evaluation of the merged precipitation using the wrf hydro rapid model fig 5 shows the flood hydrographs at the daheba station among the five flood events during 2013 to 2014 three exceeded the warning flow of 1000 m3 s the simulated flood peaks are lower than the observed flood peaks for all five flood events especially the cmorphd simulations d p s of the merged precipitation driven simulations are less than 0 10 for all flood events except the 20140803000 flood event fig 5a 5e the simulated peak times of the merged precipitation driven simulations are within 3h for all flood events but the 2014090700 flood event fig 5a 5e in terms of the d p and d c metrics the merged precipitation driven simulations has the least performance for 2014083000 flood event fig 5d the d p and d c values of the merged precipitation driven simulation for this event are 0 25 and 0 62 respectively fig 5d however these values are still acceptable for the other events the merged precipitation driven simulations have achieved much better results the simulations have well captured the rising and the falling limbs of the 2013072200 and 2013071500 flood events especially at the higher flow 1000 m3 s stage fig 5b and 5c d c s of the merged precipitation driven simulations are greater than 0 7 and d p s of merged precipitation driven are less than 0 09 for the three events that exceeded the warning flow fig 5b 5c and 5e the discharge hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations for the five flood events agree closely with the gauge discharge hydrographs fig 5a 5e the discharge hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations are better than cmorphd driven simulations the merged precipitation driven simulations of the wrf hydro rapid model clearly outperform those cmorphd simulations especially these events that exceeded the waning flow at daheba station the merged precipitation products clearly help to improve the accuracy of flood simulations fig 5 fig 6 shows the hydrographs at the longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba stations self recording water stage and flow stations the simulated flood peaks driven by the cmorphd precipitation data are apparently much lower than the observed flood peaks fig 6a 6f in contrast the simulated flood peaks driven by the merged precipitation data generally match very well with the observations fig 6a 6f for the 2014083000 flood event the simulated flood recessions are faster than the observed ones and the d c of the merged precipitation driven simulations for xiashawo station is greater than loncaoping and chenjiaba station with the average d c of 0 68 for the 2014083000 flood event fig 6a 6c for the 2014090700 flood event d c of the merged precipitation driven simulations is higher than 0 55 with an average of 0 63 fig 6d 6f d p and d v of the merged precipitation driven simulations are reduced and d c of the merged precipitation driven simulations is improved the performance of wrf hydro rapid model using merged precipitation is clearly much better as the merged precipitation can largely improve the accuracy of flood simulation figs 5 and 6 4 4 spatial evaluation of the wrf hydro rapid performance fig 7 shows the statistics of the merged precipitation driven simulations for 2014083000 and 2014090700 flood events at the watershed outlet dedahe station and the three inner gauging stations xiashawo longcaoping and chenjiaba the contributing areas of the three sub watersheds increase from xiashawo 114 4 km2 to longcaoping 173 4 km2 and to chenjiaba 371 km2 fig 1b and table 1 the average d p values for the four stations are less than 0 30 with largest value for the chenjiaba station 0 28 followed by the xiashawo 0 19 longcaoping 0 18 and daheba stations 0 17 fig 7 except the chenjiaba station the average d p value does not differ much at the other three stations with quite different contributing areas in terms of the d v metrics its average values for the four stations falls between 0 26 and 0 10 with the largest error at the chenjiaba 0 26 and the lowest error at the daheba station 0 1 fig 7 the average dv values for the other two basins are between 0 16 and 0 18 fig 7 the average d c for the four stations varies between 0 61 and 0 73 with the highest values at the xiashawo station 0 73 followed by the deheba 0 71 longcaoping 0 63 and chenjiaba 0 61 stations fig 7 as indicated by fig 7 there is no apparent dependency of the three model performance metrics on the size of simulated watershed although the dv value at the outlet station daheba is clearly better than those at the three inner stations fig 7 the values of the other two metrics are comparable to those values at the three inner stations fig 7 these results indicate that watershed area is not an apparent factor influencing the performance of the wrf hydro rapid model and prove that the wrf hydro rapid model is robust to achieve comparable simulation quality across the daheba watershed accurate predictions of flood peak and flood peak time are critical for flood forecasting warning and prevention there are three flood events 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 that exceeded the warning flow 1000 m3 s during 2013 2014 in the study area fig 5 to check the capability of wrf hydro rapid to predict the flood peaks at any river reach and flood propagation along the river reaches we further investigated the modeled flood peak values and their timings along the river network of the daheba watershed for the three flood events as shown in fig 8 the daheba watershed has three large tributaries jiaoxi river pu river and wenshui river from west to east eight first order reaches no 1 2 3 4 5 6 13 and 14 reaches and nine second order reaches no 7 12 16 17 22 23 26 28 and 29 reaches are located at the upstream of the daheba watershed while six first order reaches no 31 34 36 38 39 42 reaches at the downstream of the daheba watershed fig 1b and fig 8a the rest reaches are third order reaches or higher it is clearly that flood peak increases from lower order upper stream river reaches to higher order downstream river reaches fig 8a 8c for example the simulated peak discharges of all first order reaches are less than 245 m3 s for all of the three flood events while peak flows at the downstream reaches such as no 43 and 46 can reach between 400 and 1200 m3 s fig 8a 8c the simulated peak discharges for the outlet river reach i e reach no 47 are 1478 2 m3 s 1435 8 m3 s and 1449 5 m3 s for the three events respectively fig 8a 8c the spatial distribution of simulated peak discharges by the wrf hydro rapid model show a clear flow cumulative effect across this study area and proves its ability to simulate flood propagation along the terrain the simulated flood peak times at the watershed outlet by the merged precipitation driven wrf hydro rapid predictions are 2013 07 18 13 00 2013 07 22 18 00 and 2014 09 10 15 00 for the 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 flood events respectively table 3 and fig 8d 8f the peak times at the outlet for the 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 flood events are 86 19 and 89 h later since rainfall starts respectively table 3 for the three flood events the spatial distributions of flood peak times show similar increasing gradients from upper stream to downstream fig 8d 8f indicating the flood propagation it is not surprising to observe flood peaks occurring earlier in the upper stream reaches such as reaches 1 10 followed by the middle reaches such as reaches 21 23 26 28 and 30 and the downstream reaches like reaches 41 43 44 and 46 47 fig 8d 8f however there are also different patterns in the peak time maps for the three flood events for example the peak times at the watershed outlet reach 47 are 13 16 and 37 h later than the first peak times in the upper stream for the 2013071500 2013072200 and 2014090700 flood events respectively table 3 in addition reaches 1 2 7 and 8 located in the northwest of this region are the first reaches experiencing flood peaks for the 2013071500 flood event in contrast reaches 1 2 7 and 34 are these reaches having the earliest peaks for the 2013072200 flood event while the reaches with the earliest peaks for the 2014090700 flood event are 1 6 10 and 13 14 along with the other twelve reaches table 3 there are many factors that affect the flood peak time including spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation precipitation duration precipitation intensity number of precipitation events topographic features flow concentration process and so on based on our analysis the main reasons for these differences are the difference in rainfall spatiotemporal distributions of these flood events in this region the number of precipitation events and duration of each precipitation event are different for the three flood events for the 2013071500 flood event the rainstorm is composed of two large precipitation events with maximum hourly areal rainfall peak greater than 5 mm and a total duration of 40 h fig 5b for the 2013072200 flood event only one precipitation event occurs and lasted for about 24 h fig 5c the 2014090700 flood event has a very long duration i e 11 days and has multiple flood peaks and precipitation events fig 5e rainfall intensity in the 2014090700 flood event is generally mild relative to the 2013071500 and 2013072200 flood events and is higher in the beginning and lower in the later phase fig 5e there are four major precipitation events and three flood peaks before reaching the maximum observed flood peak discharge additionally the daheba watershed is located at a mountainous area with complex topography which also has a certain influence on the spatial distribution of precipitation and the processes of runoff generation and concentration the above results clearly indicate that the spatiotemporal distributions of precipitation have a large impact on the formation of flood events the spatial patterns of flood peak times in different river reaches and the magnitudes of flood peak in different river reaches without sophisticated distributed hydrological models such as wrf hydro rapid model it is impossible to predict these valuable spatiotemporal information in summary the spatial maps of simulated flood peak values and flood peak times by the wrf hydro rapid model for the three flood events show logical and reasonable patterns across the region and also show different rainfall runoff responses due to difference in the spatiotemporal distributions of rainfall among the events the above results demonstrate that the wrf hydro rapid model as a distributed model is a promising and valuable tool for flood simulation and forecasting its ability to make prediction at any river reach and produce consistent quality along the river network is important for its application these results also increase our confidence on the wrf hydro rapid model for flood simulation and forecasting at local reach scale and basin scale 5 discussions and conclusions precipitation is the main input data for hydrological models and land surface models collischonn et al 2008 devia et al 2015 langella et al 2010 it directly affects the precision and accuracy of model simulation and forecasting results the high quality of precipitation with high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for flood simulation and forecasting especially flash flood forecasting in mountainous areas in order to obtain high quality of precipitation in small and medium size mountainous watershed we used the merged algorithm named mgwr bi to produce rainfall data with a substantially improved quality it can fulfill both downscaling of satellite precipitation and their merging with gauge observations the evaluation results show that mgwr bi algorithm can substantially improve the quality of precipitation for five flood events figs 2 and 3 namely the mgwr bi algorithm is an effective and robust for merging multi source precipitation gauge observation radar qpe and satellite qpe although accuracy of the merged precipitation products with a finer spatial resolution has been improved many factors can impact the accuracy of the merging results such as the quality of observation and satellite precipitation selection of the merged algorithms and spatial distribution and density of gauge stations many previous studies have merged gauge data radar qpe and satellite qpe by using different merged methods beck et al 2017 ma et al 2018 shen et al 2014 it will be valuable to apply the wrf hydro rapid model to conduct hydrological evaluation for the other precipitation merging methods analyzing the impacts of gauge network density and optimizing the spatial distribution of gauge station network will be also important research topics the merged precipitation clearly helped the wrf hydro rapid model to improve its simulation results by comparing with the cmorphd driven simulations fig 4 and table 2 emphasizing the importance of improving rainfall quality for improving the accuracy of flood simulation and forecasting for the hydrological models and land surface models the hydrographs of the merged precipitation driven simulations fitted much better with the observed hydrograph than the cmorphd precipitation driven simulations at daheba station and three self recording water stage and flow stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba it reasonably explains that higher quality of precipitation generates better simulation results figs 5 and 6 the simulated hydrographs show strong sensitivity to rainfall events the simulated hydrograph shape is similar to the observed hydrograph shape which proves the effectiveness of the rapid streamflow confluence and routing scheme the model simulations can well capture the hydrological response of each sub watershed for most of the flood events overall the wrf hydro rapid model with merged precipitation as input not only performs well at watershed outlet station daheba but also shows good performances at the inner three stations longcaoping xiashawo and chenjiaba the performance of model to simulate flood peak flood volume and hydrograph is affected by precipitation uncertainty river network and parameter accuracy yucel et al 2015 summarized several error sources for the wrf hydro modeling framework including uncertainty in precipitation intensity location of storm and duration of storms human activities and climate change have been altering the hydrological cycles and processes in many regions increasing the difficulty and affecting the accuracy of model simulation eisner et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 to further improve the model accuracy methods accounting for or offsetting these uncertainty or limitations should be further studied our results also show that the wrf hydro rapid model is able to produce comparable performance at the outlet station and the other three inner stations figs 5 7 the spatial distribution of simulated peak discharges and peak times for the three flood events exceeded the warning flow show reasonable spatial gradients fig 8 in addition the wrf hydro rapid model greatly increases the computational efficiency because of the conversion from grid output to vector output the wrf hydro rapid model has an ability to simulate the flood propagation and provide valuable information for flood prediction preparedness prevention and mitigation making it a promising and valuable tool for scientific research and practical application due to lack of gauge observations flood simulation and forecasting has always been a challenge in small and medium size watershed especially for flash flood simulation and forecasting in a mountainous area with complex topography and underlying conditions this study provides a reference for flood simulation and forecasting of small and medium size watershed by using the precipitation merging products the wrf hydro modeling framework is applicable to large scale flood simulation and forecasting which is its initial goal our study also demonstrates that the wrf hydro rapid still has a wide application prospect

5012,deep soil water dsw is of utmost importance for plant growth and groundwater recharge but the depletion of dsw has been largely reported due to land use change especially because of the conversion from shallow to deep rooted plants to answer the question whether dsw can be replenished it is important to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw under different vegetation types china s loess plateau has experienced drastic land use change resulting in soil water depletion in deep vadose zones which provides a good platform to explore these issues we collected 380 soil samples from five boreholes up to 18 m deep covered by five plants grassland apricot pine poplar and peashrub and determined the contents stable and radioactive isotopes Î´2h Î´18o and 3h of soil water dsw defined as soil water below 3 m in this study was mainly recharged by the wet events in rainy season especially those with intensities 50 mm day through piston flow but they were significantly influenced by land use types specifically the forestland and shrubland had lower evaporation effects and higher precipitation offset and their soil water was recharged by wet events with higher intensities than those under grassland nevertheless the deep rooted plants substantially reduced recharge rates due to excessive root water uptake and thus prevented rainfall from replenishing dsw this study has implications to groundwater sustainability in those regions with limited water resources drastic land use change and thick unsaturated zones keywords stable and radioactive isotopes soil water sources land use change groundwater recharge loess plateau 1 introduction deep soil water dsw is critical for plant growth and groundwater recharge especially for those regions with limited water resources allison and hughes 1983 edmunds 2003 numerous studies however have concluded that dsw is being depleted by plants with developed roots li et al 2019a zhang et al 2001 the recharge mechanism of dsw and their relationships with vegetation types remain unclear gates et al 2011 this is especially difficult in those regions with deep unsaturated zones due to the limitation of analytical techniques three methods are usually applied to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw i e water balance method tracer technique and numerical modeling scanlon et al 2002 for regions with arid climate thick unsaturated zones and limited recharge rates the water balance method and numerical modeling mostly based on monitoring of soil water contents can bring errors larger than the estimated recharge allison and hughes 1975 gee and hillel 1988 in this case the tracer approaches are superior including chloride scanlon et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 Î´2h and Î´18o evaristo et al 2019 gazis and feng 2004 sprenger et al 2017 and tritium 3h li and si 2018 lin and wei 2006 the stable isotopes Î´2h and Î´18o are mostly employed to reveal the possible sources of soil water according to the craig gordon model allen et al 2019 benettin et al 2018 further the radioactive isotope e g 3h is widely used to determine the ages and recharge rates of subsurface water cartwright et al 2017 therefore the combined application of stable and radioactive isotopes Î´2h Î´18o and 3h can qualitatively and quantitatively reveal the source transport and age of dsw which has been poorly understood investigation of dsw recharge mechanism is urgent for regions with limited water resources substantial land use changes and thick unsaturated zones given concentrated rainstorms low vegetation cover and erodible loess up to 350 m below the surface china s loess plateau has the largest soil erosion rates fu et al 2005 zhu et al 2018 to control soil loss a series of revegetation programs have been launched since the early 1950s consequently substantial farmlands have been transformed to grasslands and forestlands li et al 2016 which triggered soil water depletion reduced the recharge rates of groundwater and threatened the sustainability of groundwater resources across the whole plateau huang et al 2018 the sustainability of subsurface water and plant is thus doubted to solve this issue it is crucial to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw and this is especially important for deep soil layers since it connects precipitation with groundwater this study aims to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw and the effects of land use change in the loess deposits soil samples for 13 m profiles under five land use types were collected to measure the contents stable and radioactive isotopes of soil water the potential novelty of this study may include two aspects first the stable and radioactive isotopes were combined to interpret the sources and recharge possibility of dsw the radioactive isotopes constrain the ages of water at different depths which is helpful for stable isotopes to present more reliable information about dsw sources second the loess plateau is a platform with arid climate and substantial land use change from shallow to deep rooted plants and the sustainability of vegetation has thus been doubted because of the excessive depletion of dsw our results will provide information for this region and other regions with similar conditions for sustainable management of vegetation and water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sampling location is in the shenmu county of north shaanxi province fig 1 a the temperature has an annual average of 8 4 c and the precipitation has an annual average of 437 0 mm with 80 of precipitation falling from july to september hu et al 2009 li et al 2019c the soil is mainly sandy loam usda soil texture classification standard with soil bulk density field capacity and wilting point of 1 42 g cm 3 13 and 3 respectively grasslands shrublands and forestlands are the main land use types after the conversion from farmland since the 1950 s as for shrublands and forestlands the older plants usually have more developed

consequently the differences in the sampled soils are likely to be the land use change effects which has been detailed in our previous study for legacy nitrate effects on groundwater quality ji et al 2020 as such for the purposes of this study these five sites are considered representative of the different land use changes and their impacts a hollow stem auger was used to collect soil samples at an interval of 0 2 m from the surface to the depths of 13 8 18 m table 1 we divided each sample into two subsamples one subsample was dried in an oven for soil moisture measurement and the other

50 mm day p 50 mm day we constrained the age and source of dsw with the profile of soil water tritium contents as the tritium peak originated from the 1963 precipitation li et al 2019d li and si 2018 the whole profile can be separated into two sub profiles the soil profile below tritium peak depth contains water from the pre 1963 precipitation while the soil water above tritium peak depth originates from the precipitation after 1963 2 4 analyzing land use change effects on soil water recharge as each land use type was farmland for all sampling sites 50 years ago the soil profiles above the tritium peak depth thus recorded the information of land use change effects in recent 50 years these shallow profiles were thus used to discuss the land use change effects on soil water recharge as root water uptake does not change the water stable isotopes evaristo et al 2015 the significant differences in stable isotope profiles can be attributed to varying evaporation effects li et al 2017a the evaporation effects can be reflected by the slopes of trend lines of soil water isotopes tl sws and the smaller slopes represent greater evaporation effects the precipitation offset po was calculated to reveal the vegetation effects evaristo et al 2015 xiang et al 2019 specifically the precipitation offset suggests the difference in the isotope composition of precipitation and soil water and can identify the evaporation effects hydrological processes occurring under disequilibrium from other hydrological processes e g plant transpiration the hydrological processes under chemical equilibrium usually have positive po values while the processes under disequilibrium usually have negative po values therefore the po values can indicate the compensation effects of rainfall and evaporation effects of soil profiles in general the po value of precipitation is zero and smaller po values of soil water reflect lower rainfall compensation but stronger evaporation effects 3 po Î´ 2

least significant differences lsd tests were used to reveal the significance of the differences in variables under different land use types with significant level of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil profiles the five profiles had significantly different soil water contents p 0 05 table 2 averaged across each profile the gravimetirc water contents were 13 8 3 0 11 2 2 9 8 5 2 6 10 0 2 6 and 5 7 2 9 for grassland apricot pine poplar and peashrub respectively the soil water contents overall decreased with increasing stand ages of plants table 1 fig 2 a which is related to the excessive water uptake caused by the larger root biomass of older plants however water contents varied over depths in specific the soil water contents within 0 10 m were lower than those below 10 m which may suggest the root water uptake effects further the variability in soil water was smaller in deep layers especially the higher water contents at about 13 m deep which suggests the similar soil conditions and confirms the reliability of our sampling method the water stable isotopes under grassland were the most enriched whereas those under peashrub were the most depleted table 2 suggesting the largest evaporation under grassland and the least evaporation under peashrub as for different layers the water stable isotopes sharply changed within 0 3 m however they were less variable and tended to stabilize thereafter fig 2b the water stable isotopes in the upper layers were isotopically depleted than those in the deeper layers which reflected the depth subject to impacts of rainfall infiltration and evaporation the tritium profile was parabolic suggesting the occurrence of piston flow the tritium peak appeared at approximately 11 m under grassland fig 2c indicating the moving distance of the 1963 precipitation with 3 m and 11 m as two critical points the whole profiles can be partitioned into three sub profiles the profile of 0 3 m can be defined as the active layers since it is strongly controlled by infiltration and evaporation the profile of 3 11 m includes water younger than 50 years subject to little evaporation and the profile 11 m contains water older than 50 years 3 2 stable isotopes in precipitation daily precipitation had Î´2h and Î´18o ranging from 115 5 to 1 3 and 15 9 to 1 0 with a volume weighted mean of 54 8 and 8 2 respectively the lmwl was Î´2h 7 14 0 39 Î´18o 4 57 2 82 r2 0 93 n 122 Î´18o was selected to reveal the seasonal effect and amount effect due to its similar variations as Î´2h the rainfall in the second half year july to november had more depleted isotopes than that in the first half year fig 3 a the results are consistent with the aforementioned definition of rainy and dry seasons except for october and november because of uncommon heavy rainfall in the sampling period fig 3 further as the first and second half year had small and large precipitation amounts respectively the seasonal variations in precipitation isotopes overall indicated the amount effect of precipitation on isotope composition fig 3a in addition the correlation coefficient of Î´18o and precipitation amounts was 0 67 p 0 05 which implied that the stable isotopic compositions can indirectly indicate the precipitation intensities potentially recharging soil water 3 3 dual isotope comparison the soil water isotope points were all close to but fell below lmwl fig 4 a indicating that soil water comes from rainfall the soil water isotopes were more enriched than the volume weighted value of precipitation Î´2h 54 8 Î´18o 8 2 and the slopes and intercepts of tl sws were lower than those of lmwl table 2 suggesting the strong non equilibrium evaporation effects but it seemed that the evaporation effects may vary with land use specifically the slope of tl sw under poplar was the largest 6 50 0 67 followed by pine 6 13 0 39 grassland 5 99 0 47 peashrub 5 97 0 47 and apricot 4 42 1 19 respectively table 2 4 discussion 4 1 how is soil water recharged the sampling sites receive no irrigation and have riverbed much lower than water table further the deeply buried groundwater below 49 m cannot recharge soil water by the capillary rise as such soil water may only originate from precipitation li et al 2017a the dual isotope comparison showed that soil water isotope points were all near but fell below lmwl fig 4a and most d excess values of soil water were smaller than 10 which indicated that soil water comes from precipitation but has experienced strong non equilibrium evaporation the parabolic tritium profile recorded the deposition process of tritium in rainfall which confirmed the deduction of soil water sources further the tritium profile constrained the years during which recharge via precipitation occurs in specific the soil water within 0 11 m originated from precipitation of recent 50 years while that below 11 m came from precipitation of 50 years ago we further calculated the source water recharging soil in the three layers using the intersections of lmwl and newly defined el sws i e 0 3 m 3 11 m and 11 m fig 5 a b the profiles of 0 3 m had more depleted isotopes of soil water and source water than those below 3 m fig 5a indicating the potential impacts of the rainfall events prior to our sampling instead the profiles below 3 m were more stable fig 5b which showed the long term soil water movement and recharge processes however the isotope values of source water in the profile of 3 11 m and 11 m were very similar indicating the homogenerity in soil water recharge processes below 3 m comparing with precipitation isotopes the isotopes of source water were more close to those of precipitation in rainy season fig 5a furthermore the source water isotopes below 3 m were beside those precipitation with intensity 50 mm day fig 5b as such the rainfall with intensity 50 mm day in rainy season is likely to be the main source of soil water below 3 m dsw in this study the results suggested that dsw originated mainly from extreme precipitation which has been reported in other studies hu et al 2019 jasechko and taylor 2015 thomas et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 in particular liu et al 2010 found that precipitation can infiltrate up to 6 m in 2003 with annual rainfall of 954 mm accounting for 163 of the long term average rainfall in the changwu loess tableland the soil water recharge processes mainly include two forms i e piston and preferential flow beven and germann 1982 zimmermann et al 1966 the stable isotope profiles fig 2b indicated the occurrence of piston flow since the new isotopically depleted water pushes down the old isotopically enriched water in addition the parabolic tritium profile confirmed the existence of piston flow fig 2c which has been reported in other loess regions such as luochuan huang et al 2019 inner mengolia and shanxi province lin and wei 2006 and changwu li and si 2018 but if the tritium profile has multiple peaks preferential flow may occur via fissures macropores or sinkholes gates et al 2011 lin and wei 2006 which is not the case for this study as such piston flow is the main recharge form of soil water in the loess 4 2 how is soil water recharge connected with land use the soil water contents beneath deep rooted plants were significantly lower than those beneath shallow rooted plants fig 2a it suggested that the land use change significantly reduced soil water storage and even terminated deep soil water recharge wang et al 2010 however the evaporation effects under forestland and shrubland were lower than those under grassland based on the slopes of tl sws table 2 which may be attributed to the lower land surface albedo caused by higher leaf area index under forestland and shrubland ye et al 2019 in specific the leaf area index of grassland is within 0 2 whereas the leaf area index of deep rooted plants is usually 2 therefore the large water consumption beneath deep rooted plants can only be caused by the excessive root water uptake transpiration effects alaoui et al 2011 which is closely related to the varying root depths to the best of our knowledge the root depth of grassland is less than 1 m mostly 20 40 cm while the root depth of deep rooted plants apricot pine poplar and peashrub is usually 10 m and the root mass is positively correlated to plant age li et al 2019b in specific the older plants with more developed root system consume more water and result in less recharge recent studies also had similar findings that when the rooting depth of older plants exceeds 15 m the recharge rate is almost zero li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the land use change effects can be further analyzed by the calculated soil water sources fig 5c d compared with grassland the stable isotopes of source water under peashrub pine and apricot were more depleted suggesting lower evaporation effects beneath shrubland and forestland the dsw beneath shrubland and forestland was mainly replenished by wet events with higher intensities than those under grassland which is because only precipitation with higher intensities can pass through the large canopies of shrubland and forestland de medeiros et al 2001 the soil water sources at various depths under each land use type were further calculated the isotopes of source water within 3 11 m were greater than those within 0 3 m indicating the evaporation effects during water infiltration processes the difference in soil water sources below 11 m was not discussed because it reflected the processes before the land use change under investigation in this study we further discussed the land use change effects with deep drainage table 3 the recharge rate under grassland calculated using the tritium peak method was 23 1 mm yr 1 which accounted for 5 3 of mean annual precipitation although the infiltration rates speed of vertical water movement beneath shrubland and forestland have been found to be much higher ilstedt et al 2007 sun et al 2018 the recharge rates deep percolation under deep rooted plants were much smaller because of root water uptake li et al 2019b wang et al 2010 specific to this study the recharge rate under grassland was 23 1 mm yr 1 but the calculated mean annual soil water deficit was 23 4 to 48 9 mm yr 1 under the several types of deep rooted plants in consequence no recharge would exhibit under the deep rooted plants the po values under grassland were relatively smaller than those under deep rooted plants fig 6 suggesting the lower compensation effects and higher evaporation effects under grassland it seemed that the recharge rates were inconsistent with the results of po values suggesting higher precipitation offset under deep rooted plants fig 6 specifically the po values were calculated based on water stable isotopes influenced by precipitation offset and evaporation whereas the recharge rates were calculated based on soil water contents which are also affected by root water uptake ellsworth and williams 2007 ferretti et al 2003 therefore the inconsistency between recharge rates and po values is mainly attributed to the strong water uptake of deep rooted plants with little alteration of water stable isotopes 4 3 implications to groundwater management land use change significantly alters terrestrial water cycle sterling et al 2013 and further affects dsw and groundwater recharge in this study we found that the deep rooted plants could prevent rainfall from replenishing dsw li et al 2019b wang et al 2010 which further terminates groundwater recharge li et al 2017b as such we should pay more attention to this issue and take some countermeasures changing the land use structure may be a good option on one hand because of continuous consumption and the limited recharge of dsw the growth of trees and shrubs are getting more difficult with increasing age which reduces their ability of soil loss control on the other hand to sustain the groundwater resources it is better to transform the forestlands and shrublands to new land use types with lower root water uptake in an appropriate age further the adjustment of land use structure can be more feasible to be consistent with the land use planning of the government as for the whole study region we calculated the average water deficit as 608 3 mm which accounts for about 139 of local rainfall i e 437 0 mm as such it is impossible to offset soil water deficit even if rainfall can completely infiltrate in consequence soil water and groundwater can hardly be replenished by annual precipitation the isotope evidence suggested that only extreme precipitation can replenish dsw and further recharge groundwater however the extreme rainfall events in this area are decreasing year by year due to climate change jiang et al 2017 under such background it is more difficult for groundwater to be recharged in the future as such sustainable management of groundwater resources in the deep vadose zones is urgent huang et al 2013 5 conclusion this study explored the recharge mechanism of dsw and their connection with land use the loess plateau with large conversion of shallow to deep rooted plants and deep vadose zones was taken as an example study area the wet events in rainy season especially those with intensities 50 mm day is the main source of dsw below 3 m piston flow was likely to dominate the recharge of dsw but it was significantly influenced by land uses with lower evaporation effects and higher precipitation offset the soil water beneath forestland and shrubland was recharged by wet events with higher intensities than those under grassland but the recharge rates beneath deep rooted plants were substantially reduced relative to shallow rooted plants due to the excessive root water uptake as such the deep rooted plants can prevent rainfall from replenishing dsw this study has implications to sustainable groundwater management in those regions with limited water resources drastic land use change

5012,deep soil water dsw is of utmost importance for plant growth and groundwater recharge but the depletion of dsw has been largely reported due to land use change especially because of the conversion from shallow to deep rooted plants to answer the question whether dsw can be replenished it is important to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw under different vegetation types china s loess plateau has experienced drastic land use change resulting in soil water depletion in deep vadose zones which provides a good platform to explore these issues we collected 380 soil samples from five boreholes up to 18 m deep covered by five plants grassland apricot pine poplar and peashrub and determined the contents stable and radioactive isotopes Î´2h Î´18o and 3h of soil water dsw defined as soil water below 3 m in this study was mainly recharged by the wet events in rainy season especially those with intensities 50 mm day through piston flow but they were significantly influenced by land use types specifically the forestland and shrubland had lower evaporation effects and higher precipitation offset and their soil water was recharged by wet events with higher intensities than those under grassland nevertheless the deep rooted plants substantially reduced recharge rates due to excessive root water uptake and thus prevented rainfall from replenishing dsw this study has implications to groundwater sustainability in those regions with limited water resources drastic land use change and thick unsaturated zones keywords stable and radioactive isotopes soil water sources land use change groundwater recharge loess plateau 1 introduction deep soil water dsw is critical for plant growth and groundwater recharge especially for those regions with limited water resources allison and hughes 1983 edmunds 2003 numerous studies however have concluded that dsw is being depleted by plants with developed roots li et al 2019a zhang et al 2001 the recharge mechanism of dsw and their relationships with vegetation types remain unclear gates et al 2011 this is especially difficult in those regions with deep unsaturated zones due to the limitation of analytical techniques three methods are usually applied to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw i e water balance method tracer technique and numerical modeling scanlon et al 2002 for regions with arid climate thick unsaturated zones and limited recharge rates the water balance method and numerical modeling mostly based on monitoring of soil water contents can bring errors larger than the estimated recharge allison and hughes 1975 gee and hillel 1988 in this case the tracer approaches are superior including chloride scanlon et al 2006 zhang et al 2018 Î´2h and Î´18o evaristo et al 2019 gazis and feng 2004 sprenger et al 2017 and tritium 3h li and si 2018 lin and wei 2006 the stable isotopes Î´2h and Î´18o are mostly employed to reveal the possible sources of soil water according to the craig gordon model allen et al 2019 benettin et al 2018 further the radioactive isotope e g 3h is widely used to determine the ages and recharge rates of subsurface water cartwright et al 2017 therefore the combined application of stable and radioactive isotopes Î´2h Î´18o and 3h can qualitatively and quantitatively reveal the source transport and age of dsw which has been poorly understood investigation of dsw recharge mechanism is urgent for regions with limited water resources substantial land use changes and thick unsaturated zones given concentrated rainstorms low vegetation cover and erodible loess up to 350 m below the surface china s loess plateau has the largest soil erosion rates fu et al 2005 zhu et al 2018 to control soil loss a series of revegetation programs have been launched since the early 1950s consequently substantial farmlands have been transformed to grasslands and forestlands li et al 2016 which triggered soil water depletion reduced the recharge rates of groundwater and threatened the sustainability of groundwater resources across the whole plateau huang et al 2018 the sustainability of subsurface water and plant is thus doubted to solve this issue it is crucial to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw and this is especially important for deep soil layers since it connects precipitation with groundwater this study aims to reveal the recharge mechanism of dsw and the effects of land use change in the loess deposits soil samples for 13 m profiles under five land use types were collected to measure the contents stable and radioactive isotopes of soil water the potential novelty of this study may include two aspects first the stable and radioactive isotopes were combined to interpret the sources and recharge possibility of dsw the radioactive isotopes constrain the ages of water at different depths which is helpful for stable isotopes to present more reliable information about dsw sources second the loess plateau is a platform with arid climate and substantial land use change from shallow to deep rooted plants and the sustainability of vegetation has thus been doubted because of the excessive depletion of dsw our results will provide information for this region and other regions with similar conditions for sustainable management of vegetation and water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sampling location is in the shenmu

grasslands shrublands and forestlands are the main land use types after the conversion from farmland since the 1950 s as for shrublands and forestlands the older plants usually have more developed root system li et al 2019b wang et al 2010 therefore plant age is usually used to reflect the impacts of root system due to their positive relationship the water table is 49 m deep as the bedrock is

the five profiles had significantly different soil water contents p 0 05 table 2 averaged across each profile the gravimetirc water contents were 13 8 3 0 11 2 2 9 8 5 2 6 10 0 2 6 and 5 7 2 9 for grassland apricot pine poplar and peashrub respectively the soil water contents overall decreased with increasing stand ages of plants table 1 fig 2 a which is related to the excessive water uptake caused by the larger root biomass of older plants however water contents varied over depths in specific the soil water contents within 0 10 m were lower than those below 10 m which may suggest the root water uptake effects further the variability in soil water was smaller in deep layers especially the higher water contents at about 13 m deep which suggests the similar soil conditions and confirms the reliability of our sampling method the water stable isotopes under grassland were the most enriched whereas those under peashrub were the most depleted table 2 suggesting the largest evaporation under grassland and the least evaporation under peashrub as for different layers the water stable isotopes sharply changed within 0 3 m however they were less variable and tended to stabilize thereafter fig 2b the water stable isotopes in the upper layers were isotopically depleted than those in the deeper layers which reflected the depth subject to impacts of rainfall infiltration and evaporation the tritium profile was parabolic suggesting the occurrence of piston flow the tritium peak appeared at approximately 11 m under grassland fig 2c indicating the moving distance of the 1963 precipitation with 3 m and 11 m as two critical points the whole profiles can be partitioned into three sub profiles the profile of 0 3 m can be defined as the active layers since it is strongly controlled by infiltration and evaporation the profile of 3 11 m includes water younger than 50 years subject to little evaporation and the profile 11 m contains water older than 50 years 3 2 stable isotopes in precipitation daily precipitation had Î´2h and Î´18o ranging from 115 5 to 1 3 and 15 9 to 1 0 with a volume weighted mean of 54 8 and 8 2 respectively the lmwl was Î´2h 7 14 0 39 Î´18o 4 57 2 82 r2 0 93 n 122 Î´18o was selected to reveal the seasonal effect and amount effect due to its similar variations as Î´2h the rainfall in the second half year july to november had more depleted isotopes than that in the first half year fig 3 a the results are consistent with the aforementioned definition of rainy and dry seasons except for october and november because of uncommon heavy rainfall in the sampling period fig 3 further as the first and second half year had small and large precipitation amounts respectively the seasonal variations in precipitation isotopes overall indicated the amount effect of precipitation on isotope composition fig 3a in addition the correlation coefficient of Î´18o and precipitation amounts was 0 67 p 0 05 which implied that the stable isotopic compositions can indirectly indicate the precipitation intensities potentially recharging soil water 3 3 dual isotope comparison the soil water isotope points were all close to but fell below lmwl fig 4 a indicating that soil water comes from rainfall the soil water isotopes were more enriched than the volume weighted value of precipitation Î´2h 54 8 Î´18o 8 2 and the slopes and intercepts of tl sws were lower than those of lmwl table 2 suggesting the strong non equilibrium evaporation effects but it seemed that the evaporation effects may vary with land use specifically the slope of tl sw under poplar was the largest 6 50 0 67 followed by pine 6 13 0 39 grassland 5 99 0 47 peashrub 5 97 0 47 and apricot 4 42 1 19 respectively table 2 4 discussion 4 1 how is soil water recharged the sampling sites receive no irrigation and have riverbed much lower than water table further the deeply buried groundwater below 49 m cannot recharge soil water by the capillary rise as such soil water may only originate from precipitation li et al 2017a the dual isotope comparison showed that soil water isotope points were all near but fell below lmwl fig 4a and most d excess values of soil water were smaller than 10 which indicated that soil water comes from precipitation but has experienced strong non equilibrium evaporation the parabolic tritium profile recorded the deposition process of tritium in rainfall which confirmed the deduction of soil water sources further the tritium profile constrained the years during which recharge via precipitation occurs in specific the soil water within 0 11 m originated from precipitation of recent 50 years while that below 11 m came from precipitation of 50 years ago we further calculated the source water recharging soil in the three layers using the intersections of lmwl and newly defined el sws i e 0 3 m 3 11 m and 11 m fig 5 a b the profiles of 0 3 m had more depleted isotopes of soil water and source water than those below 3 m fig 5a indicating the potential impacts of the rainfall events prior to our sampling instead the profiles below 3 m were more stable fig 5b which showed the long term soil water movement and recharge processes however the isotope values of source water in the profile of 3 11 m and 11 m were very similar indicating the homogenerity in soil water recharge processes below 3 m comparing with precipitation isotopes the isotopes of source water were more close to those of precipitation in rainy season fig 5a furthermore the source water isotopes below 3 m were beside those precipitation with intensity 50 mm day fig 5b as such the rainfall with intensity 50 mm day in rainy season is likely to be the main source of soil water below 3 m dsw in this study the results suggested that dsw originated mainly from extreme precipitation which has been reported in other studies hu et al 2019 jasechko and taylor 2015 thomas et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 in particular liu et al 2010 found that precipitation can infiltrate up to 6 m in 2003 with annual rainfall of 954 mm accounting for 163 of the long term average rainfall in the changwu loess tableland the soil water recharge processes mainly include two forms i e piston and preferential flow beven and germann 1982 zimmermann et al 1966 the stable isotope profiles fig 2b indicated the occurrence of piston flow since the new isotopically depleted water pushes down the old isotopically enriched water in addition the parabolic tritium profile confirmed the existence of piston flow fig 2c which has been reported in other loess regions such as luochuan huang et al 2019 inner mengolia and shanxi province lin and wei 2006 and changwu li and si 2018 but if the tritium profile has multiple peaks preferential flow may occur via fissures macropores or sinkholes gates et al 2011 lin and wei 2006 which is not the case for this study as such piston flow is the main recharge form of soil water in the loess 4 2 how is soil water recharge connected with land use the soil water contents beneath deep rooted plants were significantly lower than those beneath shallow rooted plants fig 2a it suggested that the land use change significantly reduced soil water storage and even terminated deep soil water recharge wang et al 2010 however the evaporation effects under forestland and shrubland were lower than those under grassland based on the slopes of tl sws table 2 which may be attributed to the lower land surface albedo caused by higher leaf area index under forestland and shrubland ye et al 2019 in specific the leaf area index of grassland is within 0 2 whereas the leaf area index of deep rooted plants is usually 2 therefore the large water consumption beneath deep rooted plants can only be caused by the excessive root water uptake transpiration effects alaoui et al 2011 which is closely related to the varying root depths to the best of our knowledge the root depth of grassland is less than 1 m mostly 20 40 cm while the root depth of deep rooted plants apricot pine poplar and peashrub is usually 10 m and the root mass is positively correlated to plant age li et al 2019b in specific the older plants with more developed root system consume more water and result in less recharge recent studies also had similar findings that when the rooting depth of older plants exceeds 15 m the recharge rate is almost zero li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the land use change effects can be further analyzed by the calculated soil water sources fig 5c d compared with grassland the stable isotopes of source water under peashrub pine and apricot were more depleted suggesting lower evaporation effects beneath shrubland and forestland the dsw beneath shrubland and forestland was mainly replenished by wet events with higher intensities than those under grassland which is because only precipitation with higher intensities can pass through the large canopies of shrubland and forestland de medeiros et al 2001 the soil water sources at various depths under each land use type were further calculated the isotopes of source water within 3 11 m were greater than those within 0 3 m indicating the evaporation effects during water infiltration processes the difference in soil water sources below 11 m was not discussed because it reflected the processes before the land use change under investigation in this study we further discussed the land use change effects with deep drainage table 3 the recharge rate under grassland calculated using the tritium peak method was 23 1 mm yr 1 which accounted for 5 3 of mean annual precipitation although the infiltration rates speed of vertical water movement beneath shrubland and forestland have been found to be much higher ilstedt et al 2007 sun et al 2018 the recharge rates deep percolation under deep rooted plants were much smaller because of root water uptake li et al 2019b wang et al 2010 specific to this study the recharge rate under grassland was 23 1 mm yr 1 but the calculated mean annual soil water deficit was 23 4 to 48 9 mm yr 1 under the several types of deep rooted plants in consequence no recharge would exhibit under the deep rooted plants the po values under grassland were relatively smaller than those under deep rooted plants fig 6 suggesting the lower compensation effects and higher evaporation effects under grassland it seemed that the recharge rates were inconsistent with the results of po values suggesting higher precipitation offset under deep rooted plants fig 6 specifically the po values were calculated based on water stable isotopes influenced by precipitation offset and evaporation whereas the recharge rates were calculated based on soil water contents which are also affected by root water uptake ellsworth and williams 2007 ferretti et al 2003 therefore the inconsistency between recharge rates and po values is mainly attributed to the strong water uptake of deep rooted plants with little alteration of water stable isotopes 4 3 implications to groundwater management land use change significantly alters terrestrial water cycle sterling et al 2013 and further affects dsw and groundwater recharge in this study we found that the deep rooted plants could prevent rainfall from replenishing dsw li et al 2019b wang et al 2010 which further terminates groundwater recharge li et al 2017b as such we should pay more attention to this issue and take some countermeasures changing the land use structure may be a good option on one hand because of continuous consumption and the limited recharge of dsw the growth of trees and shrubs are getting more difficult with increasing age which reduces their ability of soil loss control on the other hand to sustain the groundwater resources it is better to transform the forestlands and shrublands to new land use types with lower root water uptake in an appropriate age further the adjustment of land use structure can be more feasible to be consistent with the land use planning of the government as for the whole study region we calculated the average water deficit as 608 3 mm which accounts for about 139 of local rainfall i e 437 0 mm as such it is impossible to offset soil water deficit even if rainfall can completely infiltrate in consequence soil water and groundwater can hardly be replenished by annual precipitation the isotope evidence suggested that only extreme precipitation can replenish dsw and further recharge groundwater however the extreme rainfall events in this area are decreasing year by year due to climate change jiang et al 2017 under such background it is more difficult for groundwater to be recharged in the future as such sustainable management of groundwater resources in the deep vadose zones is urgent huang et al 2013 5 conclusion this study explored the recharge mechanism of dsw and their connection with land use the loess plateau with large conversion of shallow to deep rooted plants and deep vadose zones was taken as an example study area the wet events in rainy season especially those with intensities 50 mm day is the main source of dsw below 3 m piston flow was likely to dominate the recharge of dsw but it was significantly influenced by land uses with lower evaporation effects and higher precipitation offset the soil water beneath forestland and shrubland was recharged by wet events with higher intensities than those under grassland but the recharge rates beneath deep rooted plants were substantially reduced relative to shallow rooted plants due to the excessive root water uptake as such the deep rooted plants can prevent rainfall from replenishing dsw this study has implications to sustainable groundwater management in those regions with limited water resources drastic land use change

5013,most of the world s lakes are fed through water conveyance namely lakes that continuously receive and discharge water however the complex hydrological processes of such lakes make it difficult to determine their specific biogeochemical carbon c cycles poyang lake was selected for this study whose capacity to receive and discharge through water conveyance is the largest in china we used both main and trace elements in the lake as stable isotopes of surface water and its tributaries to trace c sources and to reveal the c water coupling relationship poyang lake has a high river lake connectivity and results show that it undergoes rapid water renewal the effect of this is that a large amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic cannot be converted and deposited into sediment resulting in an annual dic input and output of 1 3 109 kg year 1 the main dic sources in poyang lake are atmospheric deposition 27 carbonate weathering 27 and silicate weathering 26 furthermore the coupling characteristics of c and water in the poyang lake basin change continuously under such conditions results from this study provide a reference for the investigation of such water conveyance type lakes and the coupling effects associated with c and water keywords lake conveyance carbon transport carbon source water cycle Î´13c dic 1 introduction lakes are increasingly being identified as

tributaries after c exchanges take place at the sediment water interface ala aho et al 2018 alin and johnson 2007 raymond et al 2013 and c is supplemented and consumed by producers consumers and decomposers in lake water which determine whether a lake is autotrophic or heterotrophic gudasz et al 2010 c will then be conveyed by lake water and transported to downstream river systems at the lake outlet fig s1 understanding c balance characteristics of river lake systems and sources of lake c driven by water cycles are the basis for clarifying the nutrient supplies used for lake metabolism while also playing important roles in establishing the productivity and eutrophication level of lakes particularly for lakes with high river lake connectivity studies on c sources of lakes driven by water cycles help us to better understand the relationships between lake and watershed c cycles as well as the impact from changes in the water cycle caused by anthropogenic activities such as dam building and climate change such as global warming on lake and global c cycles ala aho et al 2018 maavara et al 2017 williams et al 2016 for conveyance type lakes namely those that continuously receive and discharge water the relationship between the water cycle and the c cycle is particularly close oliveira et al 2006 melack and engle 2009 the water retention time of such lakes is short moreover seasonal hydrological changes in these lakes are significant for example poyang lake can retain a large amount of water during the rainy season as the dry season approaches its water is rapidly discharged to its lower reaches occasionally even receiving a small amount of water from the yangtze river fig 1 therefore the study of c cycle processes in such conveyance type lakes is bound to involve hydrological processes although proportionally these lakes are relatively common throughout the world their complex hydrological processes make it difficult to determine their biogeochemical carbon c cycles in this study we assumed that both the water and the c sources of poyang lake vary seasonally and that dic flux entering into and leaving from poyang lake through various hydrological channels are significantly different the specific objectives of our study were 1 to assess the river lake connectivity of poyang lake water by ionic composition and calculate the c flux and its seasonal difference in both the receiving and discharging water of poyang lake through different hydrological channels during the water cycle process 2 to evaluate the contribution and the seasonal difference of the main c and water sources of the basin to the water in poyang lake 3 to reveal the coupling relationship of c and water among the hydrological processes including deposition river transport etc specific to water conveyance type lake basins results from this study provide a reference for the investigation of lakes that continuously convey water and the coupling effects of c and water in such lakes 2 methods 2 1 study site poyang lake 28 40 29 46 115 49 116 46 located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river is one of the few lakes that remain naturally

of lacustrine systems connected to rivers receiving its water supply from five major rivers including the gan river the largest tributary of poyang lake accounting for 58 4 of river flow into the lake the fu river the xin river the rao river and the xiu river hereinafter referred to as the five rivers luo et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 before flowing into the yangtze river from the hukou after being regulated and stored yao et al 2015 the poyang lake basin belongs to a typical subtropical warm and humid climate with an average annual rainfall total of approximately 1622 mm rainwater that is deposited into the poyang lake basin is mainly concentrated between april and june accounting for approximately 42 to 53 of the annual rainfall wu et al 2014 jia et al 2019 due to significant annual water level fluctuations in the lake many floodplains have formed near the lake surface thus forming the natural characteristic of a lake in high water and a river in low water wang et al 2019

phillips and gregg 2003 3 results 3 1 changes in seasonal Î´13c dic and total carbon values this study determined that the poyang lake basin undergoes significant seasonal change p 0 05 in dissolved c concentrations and Î´13c dic values the seasonal dic and doc concentration order in the gan river was as follows spring winter autumn summer namely concentrations during periods of increasing spring and low winter water levels were greater than those during decreasing autumn and high summer water levels corresponding dic and doc concentrations in poyang lake were the same as the gan river however we detected one special case where the seasonal dic concentration order in poyang lake was as follows spring autumn winter summer we speculate that the reason why dic in poyang lake in winter was lower than that in autumn may be due to the active photosynthesis of phytoplankton in poyang lake in winter jia et al 2020 resulting in a large consumption of dic in lake water at the same time the lake water in winter had poorer fluidity and weaker biological respiration which prevented dic from being replenished in time dissolved c in rainwater was significantly lower than that of surface water p 0 05 fig 3 a c the average Î´13c dic values in surface water and rainwater were 12 3 and 12 0 respectively the seasonal Î´13c dic concentration order in surface water was as follows autumn 8 7 mean value spring 11 6 winter 14 1 summer 15 3 moreover Î´13c dic values in rainwater were more scattered than in surface water it is worth noting that the Î´13c dic value fluctuation trend in rainwater was opposite to that in surface water and the order was as follows summer winter 11 0 spring 12 1 autumn 13 9 fig 3d 3 2 deposition flux and dissolved carbon in receiving and discharging water the seasonal rainfall order in the poyang lake basin was as follows summer spring autumn winter namely rainfall during periods of increasing and high water levels in poyang lake was greater than that during periods of deceasing and low water levels rainfall in summer accounted for 44 1 of the rainfall throughout the entire year due to dilution dissolved carbon dc concentrations in rainwater were often low when rainfall amounts were significant seasonal variation in doc concentrations was particularly obvious table s1 moreover dc deposition flux was higher in spring summer and autumn and lower in winter deposition flux in 2017 and 2018 was 68 8 kg hm 2 and 90 2 kg hm 2 respectively the average annual deposition flux was 79 5 kg hm 2 fig 4 table s1 using the gan river as an example being the largest tributary of poyang lake we can demonstrate the dc contribution in the river to that in poyang lake the dc concentration in autumn was significantly higher than that in other seasons table s2 the input flux was high in both summer and autumn and low in spring and winter the dtc contribution from the gan river to poyang lake was 1 2 109 kg year 1 and the contribution of the five rivers to dtc in poyang lake was 2 1 109 kg year 1 poyang lake water flows into the yangtze river through its lake outlet whereupon the c output flux was 2 4 109 kg yr 1 fig 4 table s2 4 discussion 4 1 hydrochemical composition of poyang lake and the gan river hydrochemical composition can be used to assess river lake connectivity and the intensity and type of rock weathering gibbs 1970 weynell et al 2016 piper 1944 cations in the gan river and poyang lake were dominated by ca2 which accounted for 57 6 of all cations followed by na k 32 7 and mg2 9 6 while corresponding anions were dominated by so4 2 40 0 cl 31 5 co3 2 hco3 28 5 fig 5 the ca2 ratio of the gan river was higher in spring and summer and lower in autumn and winter this could be because poyang lake receives water from the gan river thus seasonal ion fluctuations in the gan river occur earlier than in poyang lake anion ratios fluctuated significantly in the gan river and poyang lake in spring and in poyang lake in winter but were relatively stable during the other seasons fig 5 sample points were mainly distributed within sixth and ninth areas of rhombus region piper 1944 indicating that non carbonic acid hardness secondary salinity of the gan river and poyang lake was approximately 50 hydrochemical composition can also help to explain the consistency of c water and ion sources carbonate and silicate weathering products include both hydrochemical ions and dic ion positions were the same for the gan river and poyang lake in the piper plot fig 5 and gibbs plot fig 6 which showed a clear connection between the water quality of the gan river and poyang lake as well as the fact that water from the former had a significant effect on water from the latter fig 5 shows that rock weathering processes was the main controlling factor of water of poyang lake and the gan river for which all samples fell within the rock weathering field in summer sample points were distributed as seen in the lower left section of fig 6 wherein tds and na na ca were both low which could also be due to dilution during the rainy season at the same time the high temperature and strong hydrological process in summer promoted the weathering of carbonate and silicate causing more ca2 dissolve thus the proportion of na decreased 4 2 using Î´d and Î´18o to identify water sources in total we collected 141 surface water samples including water from the gan river and poyang lake and 58 precipitation samples from 2017 to 2019 mean Î´d and Î´18o values in water from the gan river were 35 5 and 5 9 respectively mean Î´d and Î´18o values in water from poyang lake were 28 5 7 0 higher than the gan river and 4 6 1 3 higher than the gan river respectively the Î´d and Î´18o values in poyang lake ranging from 44 0 to 9 6 and 6 9 to 1 8 respectively were more scattered compared to the gan river ranging from 44 9 to 22 8 and 7 1 to 4 3 respectively fig 7 a for the gan river and poyang lake seasonal fluctuations in Î´d and Î´18o values exhibited the same trend the seasonal Î´d isotope value order was as follows spring winter autumn summer and the corresponding Î´18o value order was as follows spring winter summer autumn on the whole Î´d and Î´18o values in poyang lake surface water were higher during periods of low and increasing water levels and lower during periods of high and decreasing water levels the possible reason was that during periods of low and increasing water levels the water supply was reduced and the influence of evaporation took up a larger proportion the point in fig 6 shifed to the evaporation dominance region resulting in the accumulation of heavy isotopes mean Î´d and Î´18o rainwater values were 34 5 and 5 8 respectively similar to surface water Î´d and Î´18o rainwater values were also higher in spring and winter and lower in summer and autumn the seasonal Î´d and Î´18o value order was as follows spring winter autumn summer which was basically consistent with the surface water order fig 7b the formula of the local meteoric water line lmwl in the poyang lake basin was as follows y 8 2x 13 4 r2 0 94 which was close to the global meteoric water line gmwl Î´d and Î´18o can be used as tools to trace water sources craig 1961 horton et al 2016 ala aho et al 2018 we assumed that the main h2o sources in the water bodies investigated were river water groundwater soil water and rainwater sun et al 2019 gou et al 2020 the Î´d values of soil water and groundwater in the poyang lake basin were 8 5 and 5 6 deng et al 2016 respectively the Î´18o values of soil water and groundwater in the poyang lake basin were 45 5 zhang et al 2015 miao et al 2019 and 30 0 wang 2018 respectively the Î´d and Î´18o rainwater values during each season were taken from measured data fig 8 the main sources were groundwater 47 rainwater 28 and river water 20 such obvious seasonal change confirmed that water sources continuously altered as water was received and discharged the contribution of groundwater in summer was higher than that during other seasons 4 3 using Î´13c dic to identify dic sources Î´13c dic can be used as a tool to trace c sources schulte et al 2011 finlay and kendall 2008 chen et al 2018 we assumed that Î´13c dic values of soil organic matter som carbonate weathering and silicate weathering in the poyang lake basin were 24 hao et al 2019 0 zhao et al 2019 and 17 cheng et al 2018 respectively atmospheric Î´13c dic deposition values from each season were obtained from measured data fig 9 organic Î´13c dic c values in the sediment of poyang lake were 22 48 4 10 wang et al 2014 which was very close to the average som value in china 24 hao et al 2019 therefore we assumed that lake sediment and som in the basin derived from the same source during the water conveyance process i e receiving and discharging water the c source continuously changed the main sources were atmospheric deposition 27 carbonate weathering 27 and silicate weathering 26 such obvious seasonal change confirmed that c sources continuously altered as water was received and discharged in summer high temperature and strong hydrological processes were conducive to the decomposition of som and silicate weathering and their contribution rates were higher than those in other seasons which was consistent with fig 6 4 4 coupled carbon cycle and hydrological process mechanisms in the poyang lake basin photosynthesis respiration and co2 exchange at the air water interface have little effect on dic in natural water systems therefore dic mainly derives from som decomposition atmospheric deposition and rock weathering including silicate rock weathering and carbonate rock weathering there was no significant difference in major pollutant concentrations in the five rivers of poyang lake luo et al 2014 thus we had reason to assume that there was no significant difference in the dc concentrations of the five rivers from this we estimated that the annual lake inflow was 1 2 1011 m3 and the annual lake dic flux inflow was 1 3 109 kg yr 1 fig 10 the annual dic input and output in poyang lake was relatively balanced both being 1 3 109 kg yr 1 therefore poyang lake did not retain a large amount of dic it can be speculated that the high river lake connectivity of poyang lake resulted in the rapid renewal of lake water thus large amounts of inorganic c could not be converted into organic c and deposited into sediment compared to surface water we only detected a slight contribution of c deposition into the lake approximately 1 3 107 kg yr 1 estimated by a poyang lake area of 3860 km2 i e the maximum area of the lake rock weathering was the source that supplied greater than half of the dic into poyang lake carbonate weathering accounted for 27 and silicate weathering accounted for 26 as a key rock weathering product dic enters lakes through surface water groundwater and soil water soil c leaches into surface water or groundwater and it is then transported into the lake through surface water and groundwater therefore although the proportion of soil water in all sources was low only 5 it was indeed an important source of lake c 20 5 conclusions poyang lake s river lake connectivity is high for which soil and rock weathering are the dominant sources of dissolved ions annual dic inputs and outputs in poyang lake were relatively balanced both being 1 3 109 kg yr 1 which means that this lake does not retain a large amount of dic we speculate that the rapid renewal of lake water will result a large amount of inorganic c can not be converted into organic c and deposited into sediment in lakes with high river lake connectivity similar to poyang lake importantly this lead us to re examine the role of lakes with high river lake connectivity as c sinks there are close

5013,most of the world s lakes are fed through water conveyance namely lakes that continuously receive and discharge water however the complex hydrological processes of such lakes make it difficult to determine their specific biogeochemical carbon c cycles poyang lake was selected for this study whose capacity to receive and discharge through water conveyance is the largest in china we used both main and trace elements in the lake as stable isotopes of surface water and its tributaries to trace c sources and to reveal the c water coupling relationship poyang lake has a high river lake connectivity and results show that it undergoes rapid water renewal the effect of this is that a large amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic cannot be converted and deposited into sediment resulting in an annual dic input and output of 1 3 109 kg year 1 the main dic sources in poyang lake are atmospheric deposition 27 carbonate weathering 27 and silicate weathering 26 furthermore the coupling characteristics of c and water in the poyang lake basin change continuously under such conditions results from this study provide a reference for the investigation of such water conveyance type lakes and the coupling effects associated with c and water keywords lake conveyance carbon transport carbon source water cycle Î´13c dic 1 introduction lakes are increasingly being identified as important carbon c cycling sites at local regional and global scales finlay et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 yvon durocher et al 2017 lake c cycling processes are a balance between atmospheric and

the water cycle itself is one of the major driving forces that conveys biogeochemical constituents through the world s reservoirs and across the atmosphere soil inland water ocean sediment continuum

such as particulate organic carbon poc and dissolved organic carbon doc into the basin zwart et al 2017 rivers are the means whereby organic and inorganic c are brought together which derive from organic c that has been fixed by terrestrial vegetation including doc and poc and rock weathering including dic and particulate inorganic carbon pic respectively these two sources are important for the productivity i e approximately 30 70 berggren et al 2010 carpenter et al 2005 tanentzap et al 2014 of lakes einarsdottir et al 2017 hall et al 2016 ojala et al 2011 for lakes connected to tributaries after c exchanges take place at the sediment water interface ala aho et al 2018 alin and johnson 2007 raymond et al 2013 and c is supplemented and consumed by producers consumers and decomposers in lake water which determine whether a lake is autotrophic or heterotrophic gudasz et al 2010 c will then be conveyed by lake water and transported to downstream river systems at the lake outlet fig s1 understanding c balance characteristics of river lake systems and sources of lake c driven by water cycles are the basis for clarifying the nutrient supplies used for lake metabolism while also playing important roles in establishing the productivity and eutrophication level of lakes particularly for lakes with high river lake connectivity studies on c sources of lakes driven by water cycles help us to better understand the relationships between lake and watershed c cycles as well as the impact from changes in the water cycle caused by anthropogenic activities such as dam building and climate change such as global warming on lake and global c cycles ala aho et al 2018 maavara et al 2017 williams et al 2016 for conveyance type lakes namely those that continuously receive and discharge water the relationship between the water cycle and the c cycle is particularly close oliveira et al 2006 melack and engle 2009 the water retention time of such lakes is short moreover seasonal hydrological changes in these lakes are significant for example poyang lake can retain a large amount of water during the rainy season as the dry season approaches its water is rapidly discharged to its lower reaches occasionally even receiving a small amount of water from the yangtze river fig 1 therefore the study of c cycle processes in such conveyance type lakes is bound to involve hydrological processes although proportionally these lakes are relatively common throughout the world their complex hydrological processes make it difficult to determine their biogeochemical carbon c cycles in this study we assumed that both the water and the c sources of poyang lake vary seasonally and that dic flux entering into and leaving from poyang lake through various hydrological channels are significantly different the specific objectives of our study were 1 to assess the river lake connectivity of poyang lake water by ionic composition and calculate the c flux and its seasonal difference in both the receiving and discharging water of poyang lake through different hydrological channels during the water cycle process 2 to evaluate the contribution and the seasonal difference of the main c and water sources of the basin to the water in poyang lake 3 to reveal the coupling relationship of c and water among the hydrological processes including deposition river transport etc specific to water conveyance type lake basins results from this study provide a reference for the investigation of lakes that continuously convey water and the coupling effects of c and water in such lakes 2 methods 2 1 study site poyang lake 28 40 29 46 115 49 116 46 located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river is one of the few lakes that remain naturally

deposited into the poyang lake basin is mainly concentrated between april and june accounting for approximately 42 to 53 of the annual rainfall wu et al 2014 jia et al 2019 due to significant annual water level fluctuations in the lake many floodplains have formed near the lake surface thus forming the natural characteristic of a lake in high water and a river in low water wang et al 2019

phillips and gregg 2003 3 results 3 1 changes in seasonal Î´13c dic and total carbon values this study determined that the poyang lake basin undergoes significant seasonal change p 0 05 in dissolved c concentrations and Î´13c dic values the seasonal dic and doc concentration order in the gan river was as follows spring winter autumn summer namely concentrations during periods of increasing spring and low winter water levels were greater than those during decreasing autumn and high summer water levels corresponding dic and doc concentrations in poyang lake were the same as the gan river however we detected one special case where the seasonal dic concentration order in poyang lake was as follows spring autumn winter summer we speculate that the reason why dic in poyang lake in winter was lower than that in autumn may be due to the active photosynthesis of phytoplankton in poyang lake in winter jia et al 2020 resulting in a large consumption of dic in lake water at the same time the lake water in winter had poorer fluidity and weaker biological respiration which prevented dic from being replenished in time dissolved c in rainwater was significantly lower than that of surface water p 0 05 fig 3 a c the average Î´13c dic values in surface water and rainwater were 12 3 and 12 0 respectively the seasonal Î´13c dic concentration order in surface water was as follows autumn 8 7 mean value spring 11 6 winter 14 1 summer 15 3 moreover Î´13c dic values in rainwater were more scattered than in surface water it is worth noting that the Î´13c dic value fluctuation trend in rainwater was opposite to that in surface water and the order was as follows summer winter 11 0 spring 12 1 autumn 13 9 fig 3d 3 2 deposition flux and dissolved carbon in receiving and discharging water the seasonal rainfall order in the poyang lake basin was as follows summer spring autumn winter namely rainfall during periods of increasing and high water levels in poyang lake was greater than that during periods of deceasing and low water levels rainfall in summer accounted for 44 1 of the rainfall throughout the entire year due to dilution dissolved carbon dc concentrations in rainwater were often low when rainfall amounts were significant seasonal variation in doc concentrations was particularly obvious table s1 moreover dc deposition flux was higher in spring summer and autumn and lower in winter deposition flux in 2017 and 2018 was 68 8 kg hm 2 and 90 2 kg hm 2 respectively the average annual deposition flux was 79 5 kg hm 2 fig 4 table s1 using the gan river as an example being the largest tributary of poyang lake we can demonstrate the dc contribution in the river to that in poyang lake the dc concentration in autumn was significantly higher than that in other seasons table s2 the input flux was high in both summer and autumn and low in spring and winter the dtc contribution from the gan river to poyang lake was 1 2 109 kg year 1 and the contribution of the five rivers to dtc in poyang lake was 2 1 109 kg year 1 poyang lake water flows into the yangtze river through its lake outlet whereupon the c output flux was 2 4 109 kg yr 1 fig 4 table s2 4 discussion 4 1 hydrochemical composition of poyang lake and the gan river hydrochemical composition can be used to assess river lake connectivity and the intensity and type of rock weathering gibbs 1970 weynell et al 2016 piper 1944 cations in the gan river and poyang lake were dominated by ca2 which accounted for 57 6 of all cations followed by na k 32 7 and mg2 9 6 while corresponding anions were dominated by so4 2 40 0 cl 31 5 co3 2 hco3 28 5 fig 5 the ca2 ratio of the gan river was higher in spring and summer and lower in autumn and winter this could be because poyang lake receives water from the gan river thus seasonal ion fluctuations in the gan river occur earlier than in poyang lake anion ratios fluctuated significantly in the gan river and poyang lake in spring and in poyang lake in winter but were relatively stable during the other seasons fig 5 sample points were mainly distributed within sixth and ninth areas of rhombus region piper 1944 indicating that non carbonic acid hardness secondary salinity of the gan river and poyang lake was approximately 50 hydrochemical composition can also help to explain the consistency of c water and ion sources carbonate and silicate weathering products include both hydrochemical ions and dic ion positions were the same for the gan river and poyang lake in the piper plot fig 5 and gibbs plot fig 6 which showed a clear connection between the water quality of the gan river and poyang lake as well as the fact that water from the former had a significant effect on water from the latter fig 5 shows that rock weathering processes was the main controlling factor of water of poyang lake and the gan river for which all samples fell within the rock weathering field in summer sample points were distributed as seen in the lower left section of fig 6 wherein tds and na na ca were both low which could also be due to dilution during the rainy season at the same time the high temperature and strong hydrological process in summer promoted the weathering of carbonate and silicate causing more ca2 dissolve thus the proportion of na decreased 4 2 using Î´d and Î´18o to identify water sources in total we collected 141 surface water samples including water from the gan river and poyang lake and 58 precipitation samples from 2017 to 2019 mean Î´d and Î´18o values in water from the gan river were 35 5 and 5 9 respectively mean Î´d and Î´18o values in water from poyang lake were 28 5 7 0 higher than the gan river and 4 6 1 3 higher than the gan river respectively the Î´d and Î´18o values in poyang lake ranging from 44 0 to 9 6 and 6 9 to 1 8 respectively were more scattered compared to the gan river ranging from 44 9 to 22 8 and 7 1 to 4 3 respectively fig 7 a for the gan river and poyang lake seasonal fluctuations in Î´d and Î´18o values exhibited the same trend the seasonal Î´d isotope value order was as follows spring winter autumn summer and the corresponding Î´18o value order was as follows spring winter summer autumn on the whole Î´d and Î´18o values in poyang lake surface water were higher during periods of low and increasing water levels and lower during periods of high and decreasing water levels the possible reason was that during periods of low and increasing water levels the water supply was reduced and the influence of evaporation took up a larger proportion the point in fig 6 shifed to the evaporation dominance region resulting in the accumulation of heavy isotopes mean Î´d and Î´18o rainwater values were 34 5 and 5 8 respectively similar to surface water Î´d and Î´18o rainwater values were also higher in spring and winter and lower in summer and autumn the seasonal Î´d and Î´18o value order was as follows spring winter autumn summer which was basically consistent with the surface water order fig 7b the formula of the local meteoric water line lmwl in the poyang lake basin was as follows y 8 2x 13 4 r2 0 94 which was close to the global meteoric water line gmwl Î´d and Î´18o can be used as tools to trace water sources craig 1961 horton et al 2016 ala aho et al 2018 we assumed that the main h2o sources in the water bodies investigated were river water groundwater soil water and rainwater sun et al 2019 gou et al 2020 the Î´d values of soil water and groundwater in the poyang lake basin were 8 5 and 5 6 deng et al 2016 respectively the Î´18o values of soil water and groundwater in the poyang lake basin were 45 5 zhang et al 2015 miao et al 2019 and 30 0 wang 2018 respectively the Î´d and Î´18o rainwater values during each season were taken from measured data fig 8 the main sources were groundwater 47 rainwater 28 and river water 20 such obvious seasonal change confirmed that water sources continuously altered as water was received and discharged the contribution of groundwater in summer was higher than that during other seasons 4 3 using Î´13c dic to identify dic sources Î´13c dic can be used as a tool to trace c sources schulte et al 2011 finlay and kendall 2008 chen et al 2018 we assumed that Î´13c dic values of soil organic matter som carbonate weathering and silicate weathering in the poyang lake basin were 24 hao et al 2019 0 zhao et al 2019 and 17 cheng et al 2018

5014,monthly hydrological models are very useful tools for modeling of catchment hydrology in this study a two stage partitioning monthly water balance model tspm with three parameters is developed based on a generalized proportionality hypothesis a total of four model scenarios are conducted to investigate the effects of calculation procedures of the soil water content on model performances by incorporating the hyperbolic tangent function used in the two parameter monthly water balance model twbm by xiong and guo 1999 the developed monthly models are then tested in 205 catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels basins across the united states application results demonstrate that the three parameter model tspm1 performs well and has better performance than the modified two parameter model tspm4 using the equations of soil moisture and runoff from the twbm five monthly models with different structures and model parameter numbers are compared to the two developed tspm models results show that the tspm1 and tspm4 models have a median performance among these models they show an excellent performance in high flow but a relatively weak performance in low flow especially for the tspm4 model the relationship between the model performances and catchment characteristics is explored and results demonstrate that the climate and vegetation conditions of catchment e g aridity index and forest fraction exert very significant effects on model performances including entire goodness of fit low and high flows in runoff simulations keywords proportionality hypothesis monthly water balance model catchment characteristics model comparison 1 introduction hydrological models apply various mathematical and or physical formulas to the conceptualization of catchment hydrologic processes they play significant role in simulating and predicting of hydrologic processes and assessment of water resources availability plenty of hydrological models have been developed at different time scales e g hourly daily monthly and yearly and with varying degrees of model complexity owing to its simple application e g relatively low requirement of model input simple model structure and relatively less parameter numbers and well performance the monthly water balance models have been widely employed for the rainfall runoff modeling xiong and guo 1999 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2017 bock et al 2018 topaloviÄ et al 2020 most of the monthly hydrological models can achieve the runoff modeling through two to five model parameters which make them more parsimonious than models at smaller time scales e g hourly or daily generally the monthly hydrological models are mainly used for catchment runoff simulation kim et al 2016 deng et al 2019 assessment of climate change and human activity effects farsi and mahjouri 2019 rodrÃ­guez huerta et al 2020 and evaluation of regional water resources deng and wang 2019 wang et al 2017a many different monthly models have been presented and modified after its first publication in the 1940 s by thornthwaite 1948 thereafter thornthwaite and mather 1955 proposed a deterministic monthly model with two parameters in 1981 thomas 1981 developed a four parameter monthly model named abcd model which is popular used in lots of monthly modeling studies alley 1984 martinez and gupta 2010 wang et al 2017b in the 1990 s additional monthly hydrological models were developed for assessing the climate impact on catchment hydrological processes such as the belgium model developed by vandewiele et al 1992 the gr2m model which is one of the gr model series perrin et al 2003 mouelhi et al b 2006a the two parameter monthly model twbm developed by xiong and guo 1999 and the dwbm model zhang et al 2008 numerous monthly hydrological models from simple to complex model structures and different numbers of model parameters are proposed after several decades of development in order to give a clear view about the application differences of these monthly models researchers conducted comparative studies of different types of conceptual models vandewiele et al 1992 jiang et al 2007 bai et al 2015 the previous studies demonstrated that difference of model performance exists owing to the model differences while the monthly hydrological models generally perform very similar runoff simulations for catchment with specific characteristics such as humid region moreover the simple monthly model is efficient and of great use in runoff simulations xiong and guo 1999 for example bai et al 2015 found that model with only two parameters is sufficient to obtain satisfactory monthly runoff simulations the development of monthly water balance model does not always pursue the model complexity thus a simple monthly model should be acceptable if it can yield satisfactory performance based on this concept we try to build a monthly water balance model that can balance the model complexity and model performances in this study a two stage partitioning monthly model with three parameters is developed and tested based on the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels basins across the united states in the previous work wang and tang 2014 derived a one parameter budyko model for water balance at mean annual time scale they go beyond the budyko type models the abcd model and the soil conservation service scs curve number model towards to identify the generalized proportionality hypothesis as the commonality of three models at long term scale monthly scale and event scale the generalized proportionality hypothesis offers a hydrological principle for describing the relationship among the climate catchment and hydrological responses since wang and tang s study only focused on the identification of a darwinian hydrological principle independent of time scales it would be meaningful to find out if this principle could be successfully used to construct monthly water balance model and achieve good performance motivated by this question this study aims to build a monthly water balance model by using the generalized proportionality twice further calculation modules for soil moisture and runoff from the twbm model are brought into the developed model for comparative study it should be noted that the newly developed monthly models and the abcd model would share a similar theoretical background i e the generalized proportionality hypothesis however the proportionality relationship would be implemented twice including the calculation of actual evaporation and end month storage in the new model s construction instead of once in a key equation in the abcd model in view of that the abcd model achieves very high score in model performance among lumped conceptual monthly models it s very difficult to surpass based on our knowledge nevertheless it is still meaningful to explore the possibility of new model s construction and its potential in hydrological modeling moreover the relationship between model performances in different aspects and catchment characteristics e g physical and hydroclimatic factors is analyzed in this study via the constructed models the paper is organized as follows the newly proposed monthly model and the other monthly water balance models used for comparison are described in section 2 following the methodology section 3 briefly describes the study area and data sources section 4 presents the results and discussion finally the summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 developed modified models at the long term time scale precipitation equals to the sum of evaporation and runoff since water storage change of the catchment is negligible based on the generalized proportionality wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 the partitioning equation describing the relationship between available water and available energy at the mean annual time scale can be represented by 1 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p p 2 Îµ 2 Îµ thus the mean annual evaporation e can be calculated through 2 e p e p p e p 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p p 2 Îµ 2 Îµ where parameter É is interpreted as the ratio between initial evaporation and total evaporation ep represents the potential evaporation for the mean annual water balance mentioned above water storage change is usually negligible however storage change needs to be considered since it plays significant role at monthly and seasonal scales thus available water supply at monthly scale is represented by wt pt st 1 instead of precipitation p at long term time scale by invoking proportionality analogy at the monthly scale the precipitation p in eq should be substituted by wt which is defined as available water and equals to the summation of monthly precipitation and initial soil moisture at the current month therefore a partitioning equation of monthly actual evapotranspiration can be described by 3 e t w t 1 e p w t 1 e p w t 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p w t 2 Îµ 2 Îµ the monthly actual evapotranspiration is calculated by 4 e t w t e p w t e p 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p w t 2 Îµ 2 Îµ the general monthly water balance equation at the watershed scale li et al 2016 can be written as 5 p t s t 1 s t e t q t where pt represents monthly precipitation st 1 and st represent the soil moisture content at the beginning and end of the month respectively et is the actual evapotranspiration and qt is the runoff at the outlet of the watershed the left hand side of eq is the available water for competition which can be partitioned into three components including st et and qt in the abcd model and a proportionality based monthly model denoted as mep developed by zhao et al 2016 the end month storage st and actual evapotranspiration et are combined and defined as yt aiming to formulate this partitioning into two component competition like budyko equation and scs curve number method here we try a different combination of end month storage st and runoff qt and define their summation as xt to stand for the runoff generation opportunity in the new developed two stage partitioning model tspm it is feasible theoretically even though runoff increases unboundedly with precipitation leading to an upper bound of xt as clear as the combination of st and et based on the definitions of wt and xt eq becomes 6 p t s t 1 w t s t q t x t e t then xt can be calculated by 7 x t w t e t in the next step the calculation of soil moisture st can be achieved through four different potential ways as follows 2 1 1 using the generalized proportion model denoted as tspm1 according to the temporal pattern for three darwinian hydrologic models summarized by wang and tang 2014 and its extension by zhao et al 2016 the key equation at monthly scale is as follows 8 y t w t 1 b w t 1 b w t 2 4 m 2 m b w t 2 m 2 m beyond this equation the temporal pattern can be described as the ration of component s actual value i e yt to its gross value i e wt is a function of the ratio of the component s potential value parameter b which is the upper bound of yt to the total value wt i e yt wt f m b wt in this study the runoff generation opportunity xt can be partitioned into the end month storage st and runoff qt i e xt st qt thus the ratio of st to xt can be expressed by the function f Î´ sb xt with a new parameter Î´ being introduced analogous to the above mentioned principle we then have 9 s t x t 1 s b x t 1 s b x t 2 4 Î´ 2 Î´ s b x t 2 Î´ 2 Î´ expanding further we have 10 s t x t s b x t s b 2 4 Î´ 2 Î´ s b x t 2 Î´ 2 Î´ where sb is the upper bound of st and represents the catchment storage capacity Î´ is a parameter as an analog to parameter É according to the abcd model and twbm model their model equations for soil moisture computation offer the possibility to use them in the developed tspm model thus another three potential methods used for computing st are presented below 2 1 2 abcd model way model denoted as tspm2 11 s t s t e t e e p s b thereby 12 s t 1 e e p s b 1 e t 2 1 3 twbm way model denoted as tspm3 13 s t s b tanh s t 1 p t e t s b s t s b tanh w t e t s b in the above three cases the monthly runoff qt is finally computed by the following equation after the calculation of st 14 q t x t s t 2 1 4 twbm way but computing qt firstly model denoted as tspm4 15 q t s t 1 p t e t tanh s t 1 p t e t s b then 16 s t w t e t q t for the tspm2 tspm3 and tspm4 two parameters need to be calibrated including the initial evaporation ratio É dimensionless and the catchment storage capacity sb mm while for the tspm1 another parameter is introduced during the second application of the generalized proportionality hypothesis which is the initial runoff generation opportunity ratio Î´ dimensionless for the calibration of model parameters the objective function is to minimize the overall error e g mean squared error and total volume error between the simulated runoff and the observed values in this study the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 is used to search the optimal value of model parameters 2 2 monthly model descriptions five lumped monthly water balance models including abcd and its modified version denoted as ab twbm gr2m and mep models are selected for comparative study they have been widely used in hydrological simulation since they perform well with simple model structure and relatively fewer parameters andermann et al 2012 wang et al 2013 li et al 2016 lyon et al 2017 deng et al 2018 these models have very close complexity to the developed tspm models with the parameters ranging from two to four all the models are driven by monthly precipitation p and monthly potential evapotranspiration ep and estimate monthly runoff q and monthly actual evaporation e as outputs a brief description of the main characteristics of the five monthly models are summarized in table 1 further details of the model structure and equations are provided in appendix a the ab model is a simplified abcd model thomas 1981 in runoff component the runoff in the abcd model consists of direct runoff and groundwater recharge which is accomplished by two parameters i e ratio of groundwater recharge to surface runoff c and rate of groundwater discharge d to be consistent with the other models namely one runoff component the runoff separation is neglected by removing the above two parameters besides the abcd model is also selected for model comparison it is the only model with runoff separation being considered among the five used monthly models the twbm model developed by xiong and guo 1999 has been widely applied for monthly runoff simulation and forecast wang et al 2013 xiong et al 2015 xu et al 2019 it includes two major modules i e the actual evapotranspiration and runoff in which a hyperbolic tangent function is used for calculation the model has only one state variable i e the soil moisture content the gr2m model is a lumped monthly model in which a parent model structure was developed based on the previous model perrin et al 2003 the internal state variables consist of an upper production store and a lower routing reservoir the model has only two free parameters and has been shown to perform well on a testing of 410 catchments throughout the world mouelhi et al 2006b the mep model is based on the optimality principle of entropy or the generalized proportionality relationship wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 this model can be considered as a modification of the abcd model developed by thomas 1981 the major differences are the evaporation and runoff calculations the actual evaporation in the mep model is computed by introducing a parameter of initial evaporation instead of an exponential function in abcd model the runoff in the mep model is an integral component while it is further separated into surface runoff and groundwater discharge in the abcd model the state variable of the mep model is soil moisture content 2 3 performance evaluation criteria the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the runoff volume error ve are used as model assessment criteria emphasizing the overall agreement between runoff simulations and observations the nse ranges from to 1 and has been widely used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological modeling a nse value of 1 means that a perfect match of simulated runoff to the observations while a value of zero indicates that the model simulations are equivalent to the mean value of the runoff observations and negative nse values indicate that the mean observed runoff is better than the model simulations the ve is a measure of bias between the simulated and observed runoff volume for example a ve value of zero represents the water balance requirement is fully satisfied and a positive value means an underestimation of the total runoff volume 17 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 18 ve 1 t 1 n q sim t t 1 n q obs t where q sim t and q obs t are the simulated and observed runoff at the tth month q obs is the mean values of the runoff observations and n denotes the total number of months for simulation further the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the log transformed runoff nselnq oudin et al 2006 are employed to evaluate model performance in high and low flows the kge is sensitive to variance and high flows li et al 2018 with its value ranging from poor fit to 1 perfect fit three basic assessment indexes including the pearson s linear correlation coefficient r the ratio of standard deviations of simulated and observed monthly runoff Î± and the ratio of mean values of simulated and observed monthly runoff Î² are incorporated into the function of kge 19 kge 1 r 1 2 Î± 1 2 Î² 1 2 the nselnq is very widely used for evaluating the simulations of low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 santos et al 2018 it ranges from to 1 the nselnq value of 1 means perfect agreement

hydrological modeling in this study the first 20 years 1981 2000 are used to calibrate the hydrological models and the rest of the 14 years 2001 2014 for model validation the data of the first two years 1981 1982 are used for model warm up to reduce the effects of initial conditions daily time series of variables including precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff observations are acquired from the camels data set produced by addor et al 2017 the camels contains a set of attributes for 671 catchments in the contiguous united states that minimally impacted by human activities compared to the model parameter estimation experiment duan et al 2006 the camels includes more catchments 671 vs 438 and has more recent data 1980 2015 vs 1948 2003 thus the data sets from the camels are applied for monthly hydrological modeling in this study the daily time series of observed p are obtained from the daymet data sets in n15 meteorological forcing data the ep is estimated using priestly taylor formulation priestley and taylor 1972 calibrated for each catchment based on the daymet data sets in n15 meteorological forcing data newman et al 2015 the daily discharge series are obtained from the usgs national water information system server the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff data are already spatial averaged for each basin thus monthly p ep and q for each basin only need to be processed at time scale i e calculating the summation of the corresponding daily data at each month to neglect the influence of snow melt the rainfall dominated basins in which the precipitation produces greatest contribution to the runoff are selected based on the fraction of precipitation falling as snow fs this index is defined on days colder than 0 and is provided in the climatic attributes of catchments in camels herein we simply classify the rainfall dominated basin using a fs threshold of 0 1 i e fs less than 0 1 further another criteria is considered that only basins with conditioned fs and also inside the huc regions 3 6 8 11 12 13 15 17 and 18 are used for hydrological modeling the basins in the above huc regions are located in the us sunbelt with long summers and mild and short winters or western coast mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 by keeping the data series in consistence to 1981 2014 the study basins represented by its runoff observation stations finally have a total number of 205 and they are shown in fig 1 4 result and discussion 4 1 model performance assessment of developed models for each basin monthly runoff simulations from the developed two stage partitioning monthly model and its modified versions are assessed over the 20 years of calibration period and 14 years of validation period fig 2 presents the nse kge nselnq and ve of the 205 selected basins results show the tspm2 model performs the worst yielding the lowest values of nse kge nselnq and the largest ve value at different percentiles table 2 presents the mean values of the hydrological indexes of all the selected basins the tspm2 has significantly poor runoff simulation performances among the four monthly model scenarios suggesting that using the abcd model way i e exponential function to calculate the soil water moisture is not suitable in the proposed monthly model structure for example when computing the end month storage the corresponding formulas in the other three models are directly related to the available water i e they are function of wt as shown in eqs 10 13 16 while for the tspm2 model the st is calculated by eq 12 that is transformed based on eq a4 in the abcd model it has not considered the available water for the calculation of soil water storage according to the monthly water balance equation the available water wt plays a vital role in end month storage since it is the source of the water cycle thus the poor performance for the tspm2 model might at least partially be explained by lack of consideration of the available water when calculating the end month storage st for the results of the tspm3 and tspm4 they have almost similar values of nse and kge with relative differences smaller than 3 for both periods the main differences are the values of the ve and nselnq especially for the latter index for example the relative differences of ve are 16 and 12 for the calibration and validation periods respectively while the corresponding relative differences of nselnq are 137 and 117 results show that the tspm4 has relatively better performance than the tspm3 especially in low flows the tspm3 and tspm4 are a pair of models that share the same equations of evaporation module and have the same model parameters and state variables including numbers and meanings after the calculation of actual evaporation the hyperbolic tangent tanh function which is borrowed from the twbm model is used for computing the runoff qt and soil moisture content st the only difference between tspm3 and tspm4 is the calculation order of qt and st according to the above results using the tanh function to calculate the runoff qt firstly i e tspm4 outperforms the tspm3 which runs an inverse way by calculating the runoff st firstly overall the two stage partitioning monthly model tspm1 with three parameters performs best for all the four criteria among the four developed models while the tspm4 achieves the best performances among the developed models with two parameters i e tspm2 tspm3 and tspm4 when compared to the tspm4 the three parameter tspm1 model shows significant progress in low flow and water volume error with 82 higher of nselnq and 34 lower of ve averaged of calibration and validation periods while its general progress is relatively slight with 4 8 higher of nse fig 3 and fig 4 present the cumulative distribution functions for the nse of the tspm1 and tspm4 respectively for both the calibration and validation periods from the results of the tspm1 the numbers of basins with nse 0 6 are 167 and 134 for the calibration and validation periods respectively which accounts for 81 and 65 of basin numbers for the tspm4 the corresponding basin numbers are 162 and 131 for the calibration and validation periods respectively suggesting that the tspm4 can obtain almost similar performances to the tspm1 at the acceptable nse level i e nse 0 6 while the three parameter model tspm1 generally yields significantly better runoff simulations than the two parameter model tspm4 at the higher nse level e g nse 0 7 or nse 0 8 the spatial distribution of nse performances for the tspm1 and tspm4 models is illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively according to the model performances across the study basins both the two models achieve the bigger nse values e g nse 0 75 over higher latitudes of the west coast and regions of the appalachian highlands in the southeast 4 2 comparison of developed model with best performance and other models 4 2 1 model performances evaluation the developed two parameter and three parameter models with best performances i e tspm4 and tspm1 respectively are compared with the five selected models in terms of the nse kge nselnq and ve of the basins note that the four model performance criteria are calculated for the entire period of 1983 2014 for simplicity data sets are divided into calibration and validation periods and model parameters are still calibrated during the period of 1981 2000 while model performances are not assessed for two periods separately but for the entire period as shown in fig 7 the gr2m model yields the highest nse among the models with two parameters i e gr2m ab tspm4 and twbm implying that it generally performs the best in the two parameter model group the rank of the averaged nse values for the two parameter model group is gr2m ab tspm4 twbm sorted in the decreasing order comparing to the twbm the gr2m ab and tspm4 models have 20 4 12 6 and 6 6 higher of averaged nse values respectively for the performance in certain aspects of hydrograph runoff simulations in high flow and low flow have slight differences to the nse results the rank of the averaged kge and nselnq values are ab gr2m tspm4 twbm and gr2m ab twbm tspm4 respectively it should be noted that the ab and gr2m models have very close values for the averaged kge and nselnq with relative differences less than 1 for the high flow the developed tspm4 model shows a 5 8 lower of kge value than the ab model and a 6 6 higher of kge value than the twbm model while for the low flow the tspm4 has the worst performance and shows a relatively great difference to the other two parameter models for example its averaged nselnq value is about 163 lower than the ab and gr2m models and 93 lower than the twbm model generally the developed two parameter model tspm4 has a relatively better performance than the twbm model while a relatively worse performance than the ab and gr2m models for the two kinds of three parameter models the mep model obtains better performance than the proposed tspm1 model with relative 5 1 higher of averaged nse value the mep model has almost similar performance in high flow where the relative difference in the averaged kge value is less than 0 2 however the tspm1 model shows a significant difference in the nselnq value e g with a 68 8 lower than the mep model implying that it has relatively weaker performance in low flow than the mep model the abcd model achieves the best performances among the seven selected monthly models no matter in high or low flows it has the highest nse kge and nselnq values as to the runoff volume error all the models have relatively small errors to the runoff observations with ves less than 5 except for the abcd model the abcd model has the maximum ve value of 5 2 it should be noted that the simulated runoff from all the models is generally underestimated over the 205 selected basins in general the abcd model outperforms the other selected models although it has slightly larger runoff volume error the developed two parameter model tspm4 and three parameter model tspm1 show acceptable performance and have better runoff simulations than the twbm model especially in high flow however the two models have a relatively larger difference in nselnq when comparing to the other models specifically the tspm1 model achieves medium performance in general among these models except for the low flow for instance it has a higher nse value than the twbm and tspm4 models a higher kge value than the mep twbm and tspm4 models and a smallest ve among the seven models while the tspm1 model shows a lower nselnq value than the other five selected models the weak performance obtained by the tspm1 model in low flow might be interpreted by the impact of its model structure since the calibrated model parameters satisfy their defined ranges the criteria describing the specific aspect of runoff simulation including high flow kge low flow nselnq and water balance ve are not always consistent with the goodness of fit criteria nse for all the selected models for example the tspm1 model has better results in general evaluation index nse and high flow index kge than those from the twbm model while it has worse performance in low flow nselnq than the latter model this indicates that different models have strengths and weakness in different aspect of runoff simulations 4 2 2 the influence of catchment characteristics on model performances to further investigate the relationship between the model performances and catchment characteristics the 205 basins are classified into different types using four types of catchment characteristics including catchment slope forest fraction aridity index ai and seasonality of runoff siq both the catchment slope and forest fraction represent the physical characteristics while the ai and siq represent the hydroclimatic characteristics of a catchment table 3 gives a brief description about the classification of the catchment characteristics the basins with slope value less than 25 m km can be defined as flat by consulting the handbook of hydrology in china the ai is defined as the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to the mean annual precipitation ai ep p the basins are considered to be humid for the ai value below 1 basins with ai value higher than 2 are considered to be arid and basins belong to semi humid region when ai value is between 1 and 2 budyko 1974 the seasonality index which ranges from 0 to 1 is used to depict the intra annual distribution of hydroclimatic attribute in reference to runoff response of catchment and the details of how to calculate si can be found in dingman 2002 the si of runoff is estimated based on the mean monthly values of the basins hydroclimatic attribute can be considered as non seasonal and assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the year when the si value is less than 0 2 petersen et al 2012 it should be noted that the ranges of the four catchment indexes for each classification are artificially defined based on the previous researches bai et al 2015 figs 8 11 summarize the classified model performances in four different aspects including the nse ve kge and nselnq in these figures the slope of the lines represents the sensitivity of model performances to the catchment characteristics a larger slope denotes that the present catchment characteristic has more significant influence on model performance to synthetically quantify the impact of catchment characteristic on model performances the average values of performance indexes from all the seven models in each catchment characteristic type are calculated and shown as green solid dots in figs 8 to 11 the linear trend of the monthly model averaged index dots is then displayed in the figures as well as the slope of the linear regression and significance level for the general performance of these monthly models shown in figs 8 and 9 both the nse and ve exert the strongest sensitivity to the ai followed by the forest fraction siq and catchment slope both the ai and forest fraction have very significant impacts on the model performance when comparing to the other two types of catchment characteristics especially for the ai the slope of the linear trend for the ai in fig 8c and fig 9c has the largest value demonstrating that the catchment climate condition plays the most significant role in monthly runoff modeling among the four catchment characteristics specifically monthly models have obviously better runoff simulations in humid basins than that in arid basins the decreasing of model performance along with the increasing of aridity index might be possibly caused by the heterogeneity of hydrologic process in arid basin ye et al 1997 bai et al 2015 as the physical characteristic of catchment the forest fraction has the second significant impacts on model performance fig 8b and fig 9b runoff simulations in basins with higher forest coverage are generally better than that in basins with lower forest fraction the possible reason might be the positive correlation between the catchment climate and the vegetation condition i e the wetter catchment usually has higher fraction of forest coverage ye et al 2015 thus better model performance in the basins with higher forest fraction is achieved corresponding to the better runoff simulations in the wetter basins in regards to influence of catchment slope the model performance does not vary monotonously with the degree of slope fig 8a and fig 9a model performance shows a very significant improvement from basins with flat slope to basins with medium slope then it has a slight decrease from medium slope basins to steep slope basins generally monthly models perform best in the basins with medium slope while they have the worst performance in basins with flat slope it might at least partially be explained by the dense river network for basins located in flat topography resulting in a complex runoff generation and routing mechanisms wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 fig 8d and fig 9d show that the seasonality of runoff affects the monthly model performance monthly models perform better in basins with higher siq than in basins with lower siq the higher siq value for the basins the more significant that the entire annual runoff concentrates in a single month suggesting the runoff shows stronger unimodality in the seasonal variation basins with simpler runoff hydrograph e g unimodality would be easier to be modeled by hydrological models than basins with severe variations in runoff hydrograph e g multimodality additionally the constructed two parameter tspm4 model shows a relatively larger ves than the other models in basins with steep slope or with low forest fraction or in arid region or with significant seasonality of runoff while mean ves fig 9 of the rest of monthly models show a generally consistent variations along with the different classifications of the four catchment characteristics furthermore the differences of the mean ve among the seven models at each classification of catchment characteristic are relatively much smaller as compared to the differences of the mean nse shown in fig 8 fig 10 and fig 11 present the sensitivity of model performance to these catchment characteristics from the aspect of high and low flows in the runoff hydrograph results show that both the kge and nselnq are most sensitive to ai followed by forest fraction catchment slope and siq still the climatic and vegetation conditions of catchment yield significant impacts on the high and low flows of runoff especially for the climatic factor for the other two factors the catchment slope has relatively more significant effects on model performance when comparing to the seasonality of runoff in particular model performance on high flow and low flow is better in basins with medium catchment slope than that with flat or steep slope this is consistent with the sensitivity result of general performance to the catchment slope while the siq has weaker effects on model performance in high and low flows especially for the low flow fig 11d in addition the tspm1 model achieves satisfactory performance in high flow and has very close results to the best performed model i e the abcd model whereas the tspm4 and twbm models show almost the worst performance fig 10 the results presented in fig 11 demonstrate that the constructed monthly models i e tspm1 and tspm4 have relatively worse performance in low flow than the other five monthly models particularly in basins with steep catchment slope or arid region 5 summary and conclusion this study proposes a three parameter monthly model denoted as tspm based on the generalized proportionality relationship furthermore the hyperbolic tangent function used for the calculation of soil moisture in the two parameter monthly water balance model twbm is employed to explore its impact on model performances of the tspm to assess their model performance 205 basins with different climatic conditions from the camels data sets in the contiguous united states are selected for monthly runoff modeling additionally we select five monthly water balance models and compare with the developed tspm models from the different aspects of runoff performances the relationships between model performances and catchment characteristics are analyzed as well as the possible reasons conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the two constructed monthly models perform well in monthly runoff simulating with simple model structure and small number of model parameters the monthly model with three parameters tspm1 which is developed based on the two stage partitioning for the calculation of actual evaporation and soil water content has better performance than the model with two parameters tspm4 which has the same module with the former model for the actual evaporation calculation but different module for the calculation of the soil water content 2 tspm1 and tspm4 models have generally better performance than the twbm model while they have relatively worse performance than the other four monthly models both the two models achieve good performance in high flow especially for the tspm1 model which only has relatively lower results than the abcd model and has almost similar kge values to the ab gr2m mep models however limited capability of runoff simulating in low flow is occurred since they have smaller nselnq values than the five selected monthly models this is particularly true for the tspm4 model 3 both the climatic and vegetation characteristics of catchment i e aridity index ai and forest fraction have very significant impacts on the performance of monthly models even for the high and low flows in runoff hydrograph while the climatic condition plays more important role than the vegetation condition in determining the model performances the two developed tspm1 and tspm4 models and the other five selected monthly models achieve better runoff simulations in humid or high forest fraction basins than in arid or low forest fraction basins results demonstrate that the generalized proportionality hypothesis wang and tang 2014 is capable of constructing monthly water balance models the proposed tspm1 model provides another path in hydrological modeling as one of the member of the monthly water balance model family future work could be focused on the improvement of runoff simulation in low flow credit authorship

5014,monthly hydrological models are very useful tools for modeling of catchment hydrology in this study a two stage partitioning monthly water balance model tspm with three parameters is developed based on a generalized proportionality hypothesis a total of four model scenarios are conducted to investigate the effects of calculation procedures of the soil water content on model performances by incorporating the hyperbolic tangent function used in the two parameter monthly water balance model twbm by xiong and guo 1999 the developed monthly models are then tested in 205 catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels basins across the united states application results demonstrate that the three parameter model tspm1 performs well and has better performance than the modified two parameter model tspm4 using the equations of soil moisture and runoff from the twbm five monthly models with different structures and model parameter numbers are compared to the two developed tspm models results show that the tspm1 and tspm4 models have a median performance among these models they show an excellent performance in high flow but a relatively weak performance in low flow especially for the tspm4 model the relationship between the model performances and catchment characteristics is explored and results demonstrate that the climate and vegetation conditions of catchment e g aridity index and forest fraction exert very significant effects on model performances including entire goodness of fit low and high flows in runoff simulations keywords proportionality hypothesis monthly water balance model catchment characteristics model comparison 1 introduction hydrological models apply various mathematical and or physical formulas to the conceptualization of catchment hydrologic processes they play significant role in simulating and predicting of hydrologic processes and assessment of water resources availability plenty of hydrological models have been developed at different time scales e g hourly daily monthly and yearly and with varying degrees of model complexity owing to its simple application e g relatively low requirement of model input simple model structure and relatively less parameter numbers and well performance the monthly water balance models have been widely employed for the rainfall runoff modeling xiong and guo 1999 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2017 bock et al 2018 topaloviÄ et al 2020 most of the monthly hydrological models can achieve the runoff modeling through two to five model parameters which make them more parsimonious than models at smaller time scales e g hourly or daily generally the monthly hydrological models are mainly used for catchment runoff simulation kim et al 2016 deng et al 2019 assessment of climate change and human activity effects farsi and mahjouri 2019 rodrÃ­guez huerta et al 2020 and evaluation of regional water resources deng and wang 2019 wang et al 2017a many different monthly models have been presented and modified after its first publication in the 1940 s by thornthwaite 1948 thereafter thornthwaite and mather 1955 proposed a deterministic monthly model with two parameters in 1981 thomas 1981 developed a four parameter monthly model named abcd model which is popular used in lots of monthly modeling studies alley 1984 martinez and gupta 2010 wang et al 2017b in the 1990 s additional monthly hydrological models were developed for assessing the climate impact on catchment hydrological processes such as the belgium model developed by vandewiele et al 1992 the gr2m model which is one of the gr model series perrin et al 2003 mouelhi et al b 2006a the two parameter monthly model twbm developed by xiong and guo 1999 and the dwbm model zhang et al 2008 numerous monthly hydrological models from simple to complex model structures and different numbers of model parameters are proposed after several decades of development in order to give a clear view about the application differences of these monthly models researchers conducted comparative studies of different types of conceptual models vandewiele et al 1992 jiang et al 2007 bai et al 2015 the previous studies demonstrated that difference of model performance exists owing to the model differences while the monthly hydrological models generally perform very similar runoff simulations for catchment with specific characteristics such as humid region moreover the simple monthly model is efficient and of great use in runoff simulations xiong and guo 1999 for example bai et al 2015 found that model with only two parameters is sufficient to obtain satisfactory monthly runoff simulations the development of monthly water balance model does not always pursue the model complexity thus a simple monthly model should be acceptable if it can yield satisfactory performance based on this concept we try to build a monthly water balance model that can balance the model complexity and model performances in this study a two stage partitioning monthly model with three parameters is developed and tested based on the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels basins across the united states in the previous work wang and tang 2014 derived a one parameter budyko model for water balance at mean annual time scale they go beyond the budyko type models the abcd model and the soil conservation service scs curve number model towards to identify the generalized proportionality hypothesis as the commonality of three models at long term scale monthly scale and event scale the generalized proportionality hypothesis offers a hydrological principle for describing the relationship among the climate catchment and hydrological responses since wang and tang s study only focused on the identification of a darwinian hydrological principle independent of time scales it would be meaningful to find out if this principle could be successfully used to construct monthly water balance model and achieve good performance motivated by this question this study aims to build a monthly water balance model by using the generalized proportionality twice further calculation modules for soil moisture and runoff from the twbm model are brought into the developed model for comparative study it should be noted that the newly developed monthly models and the abcd model would share a similar theoretical background i e the generalized proportionality hypothesis however the proportionality relationship would be implemented twice including the calculation of actual evaporation and end month storage in the new model s construction instead of once in a key equation in the abcd model in view of that the abcd model achieves very high score in model performance among lumped conceptual monthly models it s very difficult to surpass based on our knowledge nevertheless it is still meaningful to explore the possibility of new model s construction and its potential in hydrological modeling moreover the relationship between model performances in different aspects and catchment characteristics e g physical and hydroclimatic factors is analyzed in this study via the constructed models the paper is organized as follows the newly proposed monthly model and the other monthly water balance models used for comparison are described in section 2 following the methodology section 3 briefly describes the study area and data sources section 4 presents the results and discussion finally the summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 developed modified models at the long term time scale precipitation equals to the sum of evaporation and runoff since water storage change of the catchment is negligible based on the generalized proportionality wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 the partitioning equation describing the relationship between available water and available energy at the mean annual time scale can be represented by 1 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p p 2 Îµ 2 Îµ thus the mean annual evaporation e can be calculated through 2 e p e p p e p 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p p 2 Îµ 2 Îµ where parameter É is interpreted as the ratio between initial evaporation and total evaporation ep represents the potential evaporation for the mean annual water balance mentioned above water storage change is usually negligible however storage change needs to be considered since it plays significant role at monthly and seasonal scales thus available water supply at monthly scale is represented by wt pt st 1 instead of precipitation p at long term time scale by invoking proportionality analogy at the monthly scale the precipitation p in eq should be substituted by wt which is defined as available water and equals to the summation of monthly precipitation and initial soil moisture at the current month therefore a partitioning equation of monthly actual evapotranspiration can be described by 3 e t w t 1 e p w t 1 e p w t 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p w t 2 Îµ 2 Îµ the monthly actual evapotranspiration is calculated by 4 e t w t e p w t e p 2 4 Îµ 2 Îµ e p w t 2 Îµ 2 Îµ the general monthly water balance equation at the watershed scale li et al 2016 can be written as 5 p t s t 1 s t e t q t where pt represents monthly precipitation st 1 and st represent the soil moisture content at the beginning and end of the month respectively et is the actual evapotranspiration and qt is the runoff at the outlet of the watershed the left hand side of eq is the available water for competition which can be partitioned into three components including st et and qt in the abcd model and a proportionality based monthly model denoted as mep developed by zhao et al 2016 the end month storage st and actual evapotranspiration et are combined and defined as yt aiming to formulate this partitioning into two component competition like budyko equation and scs curve number method here we try a different combination of end month storage st and runoff qt and define their summation as xt to stand for the runoff generation opportunity in the new developed two stage partitioning model tspm it is feasible theoretically even though runoff increases unboundedly with precipitation leading to an upper bound of xt as clear as the combination of st and et based on the definitions of wt and xt eq becomes 6 p t s t 1 w t s t q t x t e t then xt can be calculated by 7 x t w t e t in the next step the calculation of soil moisture st can be achieved through four different potential ways as follows 2 1 1 using the generalized proportion model denoted as tspm1 according to the temporal pattern for three darwinian hydrologic models summarized by wang and tang 2014 and its extension by zhao et al 2016 the key equation at monthly scale is as follows 8 y t w t 1 b w t 1 b w t 2 4 m 2 m b w t 2 m 2 m beyond this equation the temporal pattern can be described as the ration of component s actual value i e yt to its gross value i e wt is a function of the ratio of the component s potential value parameter b which is the upper bound of yt to the total value wt i e yt wt f m b wt in this study the runoff generation opportunity xt can be partitioned into the end month storage st and runoff qt i e xt st qt thus the ratio of st to xt can be expressed by the function f Î´ sb xt with a new parameter Î´ being introduced analogous to the above mentioned principle we then have 9 s t x t 1 s b x t 1 s b x t 2 4 Î´ 2 Î´ s b x t 2 Î´ 2 Î´ expanding further we have 10 s t x t s b x t s b 2 4 Î´ 2 Î´ s b x t 2 Î´ 2 Î´ where sb is the upper bound of st and represents the catchment storage capacity Î´ is a parameter as an analog to parameter É according to the abcd model and twbm model their model equations for soil moisture computation offer the possibility to use them in the developed tspm model thus another three potential methods used for computing st are presented below 2 1 2 abcd model way model denoted as tspm2 11 s t s t e t e e p s b thereby 12 s t 1 e e p s b 1 e t 2 1 3 twbm way model denoted as tspm3 13 s t s b tanh s t 1 p t e t s b s t s b tanh w t e t s b in the above three cases the monthly runoff qt is finally computed by the following equation after the calculation of st 14 q t x t s t 2 1 4 twbm way but computing qt firstly model denoted as tspm4 15 q t s t 1 p t e t tanh s t 1 p t e t s b then 16 s t w t e t q t for the tspm2 tspm3 and tspm4 two parameters need to be calibrated including the initial evaporation ratio É dimensionless and the catchment storage capacity sb mm while for the tspm1 another parameter is introduced during the second application of the generalized proportionality hypothesis which is the initial runoff generation opportunity ratio Î´ dimensionless for the calibration of model parameters the objective function is to minimize the overall error e g mean squared error and total volume error between the simulated runoff and the observed values in this study the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 is used to search the optimal value of model parameters 2 2 monthly model descriptions five lumped monthly water balance models including abcd and its modified version denoted as ab twbm gr2m and mep models are selected for comparative study they have been widely used in hydrological simulation since they perform well with simple model structure and relatively fewer parameters andermann et al 2012 wang et al 2013 li et al 2016 lyon et al 2017 deng et al 2018 these models have very close complexity to the developed tspm models with the parameters ranging from two to four all the models are driven by monthly precipitation p and monthly potential evapotranspiration ep and estimate monthly runoff q and monthly actual evaporation e as outputs a brief description of the main characteristics of the five monthly models are summarized in table 1 further details of the model structure and equations are provided in appendix a the ab model is a simplified abcd model thomas 1981 in runoff component the runoff in the abcd model consists of direct runoff and groundwater recharge which is accomplished by two parameters i e ratio of groundwater recharge to surface runoff c and rate of groundwater discharge d to be consistent with the other models namely one runoff component the runoff separation is neglected by removing the above two parameters besides the abcd model is also selected for model comparison it is the only model with runoff separation being considered among the five used monthly models the twbm model developed by xiong and guo 1999 has been widely applied for monthly runoff simulation and forecast wang et al 2013 xiong et al 2015 xu et al 2019 it includes two major modules i e the actual evapotranspiration and runoff in which a hyperbolic tangent function is used for calculation the model has only one state variable i e the soil moisture content the gr2m model is a lumped monthly model in which a parent model structure was developed based on the previous model perrin et al 2003 the internal state variables consist of an upper production store and a lower routing reservoir the model has only two free parameters and has been shown to perform well on a testing of 410 catchments throughout the world mouelhi et al 2006b the mep model is based on the optimality principle of entropy or the generalized proportionality relationship wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 this model can be considered as a modification of the abcd model developed by thomas 1981 the major differences are the evaporation and runoff calculations the actual evaporation in the mep model is computed by introducing a parameter of initial evaporation instead of an exponential function in abcd model the runoff in the mep model is an integral component while it is further separated into surface runoff and groundwater discharge in the abcd model the state variable of the mep model is soil moisture content 2 3 performance evaluation criteria the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the runoff volume error ve are used as model assessment criteria emphasizing the overall agreement between runoff simulations and observations the nse ranges from to 1 and has been widely used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological modeling a nse value of 1 means that a perfect match of simulated runoff to the observations while a value of zero indicates that the model simulations are equivalent to the mean value of the runoff observations and negative nse values indicate that the mean observed runoff is better than the model simulations the ve is a measure of bias between the simulated and observed runoff volume for example a ve value of zero represents the water balance requirement is fully satisfied and a positive value means an underestimation of the total runoff volume 17 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 18 ve 1 t 1 n q sim t t 1 n q obs t where q sim t and q obs t are the simulated and observed runoff at the tth month q obs is the mean values of the runoff observations and n denotes the total number of months for simulation further the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the log transformed runoff nselnq oudin et al 2006 are employed to evaluate model performance in high and low flows the kge is sensitive to variance and high flows li et al 2018 with its value ranging from poor fit to 1 perfect fit three basic assessment indexes including the pearson s linear correlation coefficient r the ratio of standard deviations of simulated and observed monthly runoff Î± and the ratio of mean values of simulated and observed monthly runoff Î² are incorporated into the function of kge 19 kge 1 r 1 2 Î± 1 2 Î² 1 2 the nselnq is very widely used for evaluating the simulations of low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 santos et al 2018 it ranges from to 1 the nselnq value of 1 means perfect agreement

to deal with zero flows occurred when the catchment is non perennial or ephemeral the value of Î» may have impacts on the model performance evaluation as recommended by pushpalatha et al 2012 the one

hydrological modeling in this study the first 20 years 1981 2000 are used to calibrate the hydrological models and the rest of the 14 years 2001 2014 for model validation the data of the first two years 1981 1982 are used for model warm up to reduce the effects of initial conditions daily time series of variables including precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff observations are acquired from the camels data set produced by addor et al 2017 the camels contains a set of attributes for 671 catchments in the contiguous united states that minimally impacted by human activities compared to the model parameter estimation experiment duan et al 2006 the camels includes more catchments 671 vs 438 and has more recent data 1980 2015 vs 1948 2003 thus the data sets from the camels are applied for monthly hydrological modeling in this study the daily time series of observed p are obtained from the daymet data sets in n15 meteorological forcing data the ep is estimated using priestly taylor formulation priestley and taylor 1972 calibrated for each catchment based on the daymet data sets in n15 meteorological forcing data newman et al 2015 the daily discharge series are obtained from the usgs national water information system server the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff data are already spatial averaged for each basin thus monthly p ep and q for each basin only need to be processed at time scale i e calculating the summation of the corresponding daily data at each month to neglect the influence of snow melt the rainfall dominated basins in which the precipitation produces greatest contribution to the runoff are selected based on the fraction of precipitation falling as snow fs this index is defined on days colder than 0 and is provided in the climatic attributes of catchments in camels herein we simply classify the rainfall dominated basin using a fs threshold of 0 1 i e fs less than 0 1 further another criteria is considered that only basins with conditioned fs and also inside the huc regions 3 6 8 11 12 13 15 17 and 18 are used for hydrological modeling the basins in the above huc regions are located in the us sunbelt with long summers and mild and short winters or western coast mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 by keeping the data series in consistence to 1981 2014 the study basins represented by its runoff observation stations finally have a total number of 205 and they are shown in fig 1 4 result and discussion 4 1 model performance assessment of developed models for each basin monthly runoff simulations from the developed two stage partitioning monthly model and its modified versions are assessed over the 20 years of calibration period and 14 years of validation period fig 2 presents the nse kge nselnq and ve of the 205 selected basins results show the tspm2 model performs the worst yielding the lowest values of nse kge nselnq and the largest ve value at different percentiles table 2 presents the mean values of the hydrological indexes of all the selected basins the tspm2 has significantly poor runoff simulation performances among the four monthly model scenarios suggesting that using the abcd model way i e exponential function to calculate the soil water moisture is not suitable in the proposed monthly model structure for example when computing the end month storage the corresponding formulas in the other three models are directly related to the available water i e they are function of wt as shown in eqs 10 13 16 while for the tspm2 model the st is calculated by eq 12 that is transformed based on eq a4 in the abcd model it has not considered the available water for the calculation of soil water storage according to the monthly water balance equation the available water wt plays a vital role in end month storage since it is the source of the water cycle thus the poor performance for the tspm2 model might at least partially be explained by lack of consideration of the available water when calculating the end month storage st for the results of the tspm3 and tspm4 they have almost similar values of nse and kge with relative differences smaller than 3 for both periods the main differences are the values of the ve and nselnq especially for the latter index for example the relative differences of ve are 16 and 12 for the calibration and validation periods respectively while the corresponding relative differences of nselnq are 137 and 117 results show that the tspm4 has relatively better performance than the tspm3 especially in low flows the tspm3 and tspm4 are a pair of models that share the same equations of evaporation module and have the same model parameters and state variables including numbers and meanings after the calculation of actual evaporation the hyperbolic tangent tanh function which is borrowed from the twbm model is used for computing the runoff qt and soil moisture content st the only difference between tspm3 and tspm4 is the calculation order of qt and st according to the above results using the tanh function to calculate the runoff qt firstly i e tspm4 outperforms the tspm3 which runs an inverse way by calculating the runoff st firstly overall the two stage partitioning monthly model tspm1 with three parameters performs best for all the four criteria among the four developed models while the tspm4 achieves the best performances among the developed models with two parameters i e tspm2 tspm3 and tspm4 when compared to the tspm4 the three parameter tspm1 model shows significant progress in low flow and water volume error with 82 higher of nselnq and 34 lower of ve averaged of calibration and validation periods while its general progress is relatively slight with 4 8 higher of nse fig 3 and fig 4 present the cumulative distribution functions for the nse of the tspm1 and tspm4 respectively for both the calibration and validation periods from the results of the tspm1 the numbers of basins with nse 0 6 are 167 and 134 for the calibration and validation periods respectively which accounts for 81 and 65 of basin numbers for the tspm4 the corresponding basin numbers are 162 and 131 for the calibration and validation periods respectively suggesting that the tspm4 can obtain almost similar performances to the tspm1 at the acceptable nse level i e nse 0 6 while the three parameter model tspm1 generally yields significantly better runoff simulations than the two parameter model tspm4 at the higher nse level e g nse 0 7 or nse 0 8 the spatial distribution of nse performances for the tspm1 and tspm4 models is illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively according to the model performances across the study basins both the two models achieve the bigger nse values e g nse 0 75 over higher latitudes of the west coast and regions of the appalachian highlands in the southeast 4 2 comparison of developed model with best performance and other models 4 2 1 model performances evaluation the developed two parameter and three parameter models with best performances i e tspm4 and tspm1 respectively are compared with the five selected models in terms of the nse kge nselnq and ve of the basins note that the four model performance criteria are calculated for the entire period of 1983 2014 for simplicity data sets are divided into calibration and validation periods and model parameters are still calibrated during the period of 1981 2000 while model performances are not assessed for two periods separately but for the entire period as shown in fig 7 the gr2m model yields the highest nse among the models with two parameters i e gr2m ab tspm4 and twbm implying that it generally performs the best in the two parameter model group the rank of the averaged nse values for the two parameter model group is gr2m ab tspm4 twbm sorted in the decreasing order comparing to the twbm the gr2m ab and tspm4 models have 20 4 12 6 and 6 6 higher of averaged nse values respectively for the performance in certain aspects of hydrograph runoff simulations in high flow and low flow have slight differences to the nse results the rank of the averaged kge and nselnq values are ab gr2m tspm4 twbm and gr2m ab twbm tspm4 respectively it should be noted that the ab and gr2m models have very close values for the averaged kge and nselnq with relative differences less than 1 for the high flow the developed tspm4 model shows a 5 8 lower of kge value than the ab model and a 6 6 higher of kge value than the twbm model while for the low flow the tspm4 has the worst performance and shows a relatively great difference to the other two parameter models for example its averaged nselnq value is about 163 lower than the ab and gr2m models and 93 lower than the twbm model generally the developed two parameter model tspm4 has a relatively better performance than the twbm model while a relatively worse performance than the ab and gr2m models for the two kinds of three parameter models the mep model obtains better performance than the proposed tspm1 model with relative 5 1 higher of averaged nse value the mep model has almost similar performance in high flow where the relative difference in the averaged kge value is less than 0 2 however the tspm1 model shows a significant difference in the nselnq value e g with a 68 8 lower than the mep model implying that it has relatively weaker performance in low flow than the mep model the abcd model achieves the best performances among the seven selected monthly models no matter in high or low flows it has the highest nse kge and nselnq values as to the runoff volume error all the models have relatively small errors to the runoff observations with ves less than 5 except for the abcd model the abcd model has the maximum ve value of 5 2 it should be noted that the simulated runoff from all the models is generally underestimated over the 205 selected basins in general the abcd model outperforms the other selected models although it has slightly larger runoff volume error the developed two parameter model tspm4 and three parameter model tspm1 show acceptable performance and have better runoff simulations than the twbm model especially in high flow however the two models have a relatively larger difference in nselnq when comparing to the other models specifically the tspm1 model achieves medium performance in general among these models except for the low flow for instance it has a higher nse value than the twbm and tspm4 models a higher kge value than the mep twbm and tspm4 models and a smallest ve among the seven models while the tspm1 model shows a lower nselnq value than the other five selected models the weak performance obtained by the tspm1 model in low flow might be interpreted by the impact of its model structure since the calibrated model parameters satisfy their defined ranges the criteria describing the specific aspect of runoff simulation including high flow kge low flow nselnq and water balance ve are not always consistent with the goodness of fit criteria nse for all the selected models for example the tspm1 model has better results in general evaluation index nse and high flow index kge than those from the twbm model while it has worse performance in low flow nselnq than the latter model this indicates that different models have strengths and weakness in different aspect of runoff simulations 4 2 2 the influence of catchment characteristics on model performances to further investigate the relationship between the model performances and catchment characteristics the 205 basins are classified into different types using four types of catchment characteristics including catchment slope forest fraction aridity index ai and seasonality of runoff siq both the catchment slope and forest fraction represent the physical characteristics while the ai and siq represent the hydroclimatic characteristics of a catchment table 3 gives a brief description about the classification of the catchment characteristics the basins with slope value less than 25 m km can be defined as flat by consulting the handbook of hydrology in china the ai is defined as the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to the mean annual precipitation ai ep p the basins are considered to be humid for the ai value below 1 basins with ai value higher than 2 are considered to be arid and basins belong to semi humid region when ai value is between 1 and 2 budyko 1974 the seasonality index which ranges from 0 to 1 is used to depict the intra annual distribution of hydroclimatic attribute in reference to runoff response of catchment and the details of how to calculate si can be found in dingman 2002 the si of runoff is estimated based on the mean monthly values of the basins hydroclimatic attribute can be considered as non seasonal and assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the year when the si value is less than 0 2 petersen et al 2012 it should be noted that the ranges of the four catchment indexes for each classification are artificially defined based on the previous researches bai et al 2015 figs 8 11 summarize the classified model performances in four different aspects including the nse ve kge and nselnq in these figures the slope of the lines represents the sensitivity of model performances to the catchment characteristics a larger slope denotes that the present catchment characteristic has more significant influence on model performance to synthetically quantify the impact of catchment characteristic on model performances the average values of performance indexes from all the seven models in each catchment characteristic type are calculated and shown as green solid dots in figs 8 to 11 the linear trend of the monthly model averaged index dots is then displayed in the figures as well as the slope of the linear regression and significance level for the general performance of these monthly models shown in figs 8 and 9 both the nse and ve exert the strongest sensitivity to the ai followed by the forest fraction siq and catchment slope both the ai and forest fraction have very significant impacts on the model performance when comparing to the other two types of catchment characteristics especially for the ai the slope of the linear trend for the ai in fig 8c and fig 9c has the largest value demonstrating that the catchment climate condition plays the most significant role in monthly runoff modeling among the four catchment characteristics specifically monthly models have obviously better runoff simulations in humid basins than that in arid basins the decreasing of model performance along with the increasing of aridity index might be possibly caused by the heterogeneity of hydrologic process in arid basin ye et al 1997 bai et al 2015 as the physical characteristic of catchment the forest fraction has the second significant impacts on model performance fig 8b and fig 9b runoff simulations in basins with higher forest coverage are generally better than that in basins with lower forest fraction the possible reason might be the positive correlation between the catchment climate and the vegetation condition i e the wetter catchment usually has higher fraction of forest coverage ye et al 2015 thus better model performance in the basins with higher forest fraction is achieved corresponding to the better runoff simulations in the wetter basins in regards to influence of catchment slope the model performance does not vary monotonously with the degree of slope fig 8a and fig 9a model performance shows a very significant improvement from basins with flat slope to basins with medium slope then it has a slight decrease from medium slope basins to steep slope basins generally monthly models perform best in the basins with medium slope while they have the worst performance in basins with flat slope it might at least partially be explained by the dense river network for basins located in flat topography resulting in a complex runoff generation and routing mechanisms wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 fig 8d and fig 9d show that the seasonality of runoff affects the monthly model performance monthly models perform better in basins with higher siq than in basins with lower siq the higher siq value for the basins the more significant that the entire annual runoff concentrates in a single month suggesting the runoff shows stronger unimodality in the seasonal variation basins with simpler runoff hydrograph e g unimodality would be easier to be modeled by hydrological models than basins with severe variations in runoff hydrograph e g multimodality additionally the constructed two parameter tspm4 model shows a relatively larger ves than the other models in basins with steep slope or with low forest fraction or in arid region or with significant seasonality of runoff while mean ves fig 9 of the rest of monthly models show a generally consistent variations along with the different classifications of the four catchment characteristics furthermore the differences of the mean ve among the seven models at each classification of catchment characteristic are relatively much smaller as compared to the differences of the mean nse shown in fig 8 fig 10 and fig 11 present the sensitivity of model performance to these catchment characteristics from the aspect of high and low flows in the runoff hydrograph results show that both the kge and nselnq are most sensitive to ai followed by forest fraction catchment slope and siq still the climatic and vegetation conditions of catchment yield significant impacts on the high and low flows of runoff especially for the climatic factor for the other two factors the catchment slope has relatively more significant effects on model performance when comparing to the seasonality of runoff in particular model performance on high flow and low flow is better in basins with medium catchment slope than that with flat or steep slope this is consistent with the sensitivity result of general performance to the catchment slope while the siq has weaker effects on model performance in high and low flows especially for the low flow fig 11d in addition the tspm1 model achieves satisfactory performance in high flow and has very close results to the best performed model i e the abcd model whereas the tspm4 and twbm models show almost the worst performance fig 10 the results presented in fig 11 demonstrate that the constructed monthly models i e tspm1 and tspm4 have relatively worse performance in low flow than the other five monthly models particularly in basins with steep catchment slope or arid region 5 summary and conclusion this study proposes a three parameter monthly model denoted as tspm based on the generalized proportionality relationship furthermore the hyperbolic tangent function used for the calculation of soil moisture in the two parameter monthly water balance model twbm is employed to explore its impact on model performances of the tspm to assess their model performance 205 basins with different climatic conditions from the camels data sets in the contiguous united states are selected for monthly runoff modeling additionally we select five monthly water balance models and compare with the developed tspm models from the different aspects of runoff performances the relationships between model performances and catchment characteristics are analyzed as well as the possible reasons conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the two constructed monthly models perform well in monthly runoff simulating with simple model structure and small number of model parameters the monthly model with three parameters tspm1 which is developed based on the two stage partitioning for the calculation of actual evaporation and soil water content has better performance than the model with two parameters tspm4 which has the same module with the former model for the actual evaporation calculation but different module for the calculation of the soil water content 2 tspm1 and tspm4 models have generally better performance than the twbm model while they have relatively worse performance than the other four monthly models both the two models achieve good performance in high flow especially for the tspm1 model which only has relatively lower results than the abcd model and has almost similar kge values to the ab gr2m mep models however limited capability of runoff simulating in low flow is occurred since they have smaller nselnq values than the five selected monthly models this is particularly true for the tspm4 model 3 both the climatic and vegetation characteristics of catchment i e aridity index ai and forest fraction have very significant impacts on the performance of monthly models even for the high and low flows in runoff hydrograph while the climatic condition plays more important role than the vegetation condition in determining the model performances the two developed tspm1 and tspm4 models and the other five selected monthly models achieve better runoff simulations in humid or high forest fraction basins than in arid or low forest fraction basins results demonstrate that the generalized proportionality hypothesis wang and tang 2014 is capable of constructing monthly water balance models the proposed tspm1 model provides another path in hydrological modeling as one of the member of the monthly water balance model family future work could be focused on the improvement of runoff simulation in low flow credit authorship
