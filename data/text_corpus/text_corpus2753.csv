13765,the present study investigated the reverse electrodialysis red energy generation potential of treated wastewaters from ataköy and ambarlı wastewater treatment plant wwtp when discharged at the marmara sea the good quality of the wwtp effluents and their suitable conductivity around 1 ms cm 1 resulted in a power density around 0 5 w m 2 when they are operated together with the marmara sea in a lab scale red system this led to the generation of an approximative daily gross energy of 18 6 mw h and 16 mw h with ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively considering optimal red conditions able to reach a power density of 2 5 w m 2 ataköy wwtp can generate net energy of 39 9 mw h day which represents 25 1 of the total energy demand of the plant similarly the ambarlı wwtp can cover 25 of the plant energy demand by generating daily net energy of 36 8 mw h improving the characteristics of the ions exchange membranes iems by introducing highly selective and cost effective membranes is part of the necessary solution to increase the power output of the process keywords energy ions exchange membranes reverse electrodialysis salinity gradient power wastewater 1 introduction the chemical potential difference between water bodies releases energy when two solutions with different concentrations in salinity mix this is known as salinity gradient power sgp 1 or salinity gradient energy sge although not well known it is renewable and clean energy suitable for coastal countries and can contribute to increasing the many renewable energy sources already available to participate in accelerating the fossil fuel mitigation policy adopted by many nations in the last century in the principle of sgp when a freshwater stream flows toward the sea or high saline water and discharge into it there is an increase of the entropy of the system and a dissipation of a chemical potential gradient when the two solutions of different concentration irreversibly mix one to another and can be converted into energy through specific systems performing a controlled mixing process 2 4 the reversal of some desalination processes can convert the potential energy from the salinity gradient into electricity giving rise to new technologies such as red and pressure retarded osmosis pro which are the most frequently studied membrane based technologies to harvest the sgp 2 pattle developed and proposed the first concept of electrical energy extraction from the mixing of fresh and saltwater in 1954 5 and the technique he described is similar to the process known today as red it was not until 1977 that the global potential of sgp was estimated by wick and schmitt to be approximately 2 6 tw 6 this value is near to the estimated 2 8 tw values today 7 in contrary to pro where water is transported across a semi permeable membrane the energy extracted by red occurs by the transport of ions through iems negatively charged cation exchange membranes cems and positively charged anion exchange membranes aems during the mixing of two solutions with different salinity 8 red utilizes a flow system between electrodes and alternating cems and aems 9 where the transport of dissolved salt ions through the stack of alternating iems creates an electrical potential capable of generating electricity 7 10 the ions na and cl in the concentrated solution compartments migrate across the membranes toward the diluted solution compartments na migrates through the cems toward the cathode while cl migrates through aems toward the anode since the membranes are semipermeable they allow anions to pass through the aems and cations through cems by migrating in opposite directions from the concentrated saline solution to the diluted solution but theoretically block the transport of co ions and water 1 7 when an external load is applied to the electrodes the migration of ions at opposite directions creates an ionic current at the electrodes which are converted to electrical energy 9 11 12 although sea waters and rivers are great candidates for sgp generation recently some attention has been devoted to alternative feed solutions such as wastewaters and brines from desalination plants to reach a quality standard to be reused the treatment of municipal wastewater require energy which can make the process expensive when treated wastewater is used in a red stack the effluent solution can still be reused for many purposes 13 istanbul is a metropolitan with over 15 million inhabitants making it one of the world s most populated and largest cities according to the report published by iski istanbul water and sewerage administration in 2018 istanbul disposes of many advanced biological treatment plants some of the wwtps integrated membrane bioreactors mbr while ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro membrane processes are used as advanced treatment processes to purify part of the effluent from biological processes resulting in high quality effluent mainly reused in the watering of gardens a total of 900 465 kw h day 1 electrical energy is consumed in the wwtp in istanbul while up to 336 417 kw h day 1 electrical energy is produced from anaerobic digestion of sludge 14 the effluents from istanbul wwtps are discharged in the marmara sea these effluents are low in conductivity around 1 1 1 4 ms cm 1 and can be considered as low saline solutions and used to generate sgp during the mixing of these effluents with the marmara sea up to now a few investigations have been conducted in the field of sgp extraction by the red process using real feed solutions most of the studies are focused on lab scales fed with synthetic solutions real feed solutions are more complex and the presence of divalent ions in sea waters dissolved matters and suspended solids found in natural water make the process difficult and require high engineering skills to be optimized however targeting different feed solutions such as brines concentrates from different desalination processes and wastewater treated effluent can diversify the potential of red when natural feed streams are used in red without adequate anti fouling treatments a mixture of fouling can take place on the membranes mainly composed of remnants of diatoms clay minerals organic fouling and scaling 15 avci et al compared natural feed streams salinity gradient power harvesting by red with synthetic equivalent ionic strength and reported approximately 2 3 loss in power density they attributed this result to increased membrane resistance reduced open circuit voltage ocv and the occurrence of uphill transport for ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the red stack operated with natural feed streams 16 many researchers reported up to 50 decrease in the power density within the first hour of red operation with natural feed streams 15 17 18 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the decrease of the system performance is prevalently due to the significant increase of cem resistance due to the presence of negatively charged organic matters in natural water bodies as a membrane process membrane fouling and concentration polarization could be some major effects with real feed solutions in addition to antifouling strategies to clean and recover the membrane and the red stack performance pretreatment of the feed solutions membrane modification to improve its properties and the fouling resistance 19 and profiled membranes 15 are alternatives using ataköy and ambarlı wwtp as models for being among the biggest wwtp of the city of istanbul the present study investigated the red energy generation potential with municipal wastewaters treated by advanced biological treatment mbr and uf processes together with the marmara sea the energy potential will be determined and simulation with optimal conditions will help determine the net red energy output in ataköy and amabarlı wwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale red stack a lab scale red module essentially composed of an red stack of 10 cell pairs the feed solutions tanks the peristaltic pump used to circulate the feed solutions and the electrode rinse solution ers into and out of the module and a multimeter used as the electrical measurements apparatus has been constructed and operated for 7 days 36 h running in the present study the module consisted of iems spacers and the electrode system a single cell unit consists of a cem a high compartment hc aem and a low compartment lc three tanks with 2 l volume each were used as reservoirs one tank was filled with the marmara sea the second tank with treated wastewater while the third tank carried the ers a peristaltic pump was used to circulate the feed solutions from the tanks through the red module the design of the red stack is presented in fig 1 2 2 red stack components the stack consisted of alternative iems 11 cems and 10 aems purchased from iontech china and characterized as depicted in table 1 each membrane has an active membrane area of 0 0059 m2 0 077m 0 077m for a total active membrane area of 0 118 m2 woven spacers with 380 μm thickness were used between the alternating iems to create stark compartments both electrodes anode and cathode of dimensions 1 100 100 mm purchased from china were titanium mesh coated with rubidium and iridium ti ru ir the feed solutions were separately pumped into and out the stack in a single pass while the ers was continuously circulated to the stack and back to the tank the flow rates of the hc and lc solutions have been set differently to reduce the impact of the lc solution resistance and the diffusion boundary layer resistance 20 instead of feeding the red stack with identic flow rates for both lc and hc solutions operating the red process with an hc flow rate lower than the lc reduces the lc resistance consequently the solutions of the present study were circulated with a fixed flow rate of around 20 ml min for the lc solution treated wastewater and 14 ml min for hc solution the marmara sea 2 3 feed solutions the feed solutions were collected from istanbul the marmara sea was collected from the vicinity of the plant where municipal wastewaters are discharged after treatment istanbul disposes of 89 municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp 8 pretreatment and 81 advanced biological treatment plants with a total capacity of 5 815 260 m³ day 1 receiving around 3 927 030 m³ day 1 wastewater 14 both located in the european side ataköy and ambarlı are among the high capacity treatment plant of the city with a total capacity of 600 000 m³ day 1 and 400 000 m³ day respectively and receives 411 250 m³ day 1 and 336 820 m³ day 1 respectively ataköy wwtp includes an mbr unit with a capacity of 30 000 m³ day 1 and ambarlı wwtp contains an uf unit with a capacity of 25 000 m³ day 1 expected to reach 50 000 m³ day 1 soon 14 4 wastewaters were collected and used as diluted solutions in the red stack 2 samples 1 from advanced biological treatment effluent ab1 and 1 from mbr unit effluent mbr and 2 other samples 1 advanced biological treatment ab2 and 1 from the uf membrane treatment unit uf were collected from ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively the characteristics values of the feed solutions are presented in table 2 the ers is assumed to have a salt concentration between that of the concentrated and the diluted solutions it was prepared by mixing in 1 l distilled water 0 05 m k4fe cn 6 and 0 05 m k3fe cn 6 the solution is mixed up to homogeneity before being used in the red stack the conductivity of the prepared ers was 20 85 ms cm 2 4 design of plant red installation ambarlı and ataköy wwtp are located at the marmara seaside 5 m and 10 m altitude respectively the treated wastewaters are discharged into the sea by gravitation an appropriate red stack can be installed underground allowing both feed solutions to flow by gravity into the stack the brackish solution from the stack will then be stored at about 5 m down sea level before being pumped to the surface of the marmara sea as schematically depicted by fig 2 2 5 power density and feed solutions analyses many elements among which power density pd and energy efficiency ee are of key importance for the generation of power in an red unit depending on the final unit many definitions of pd are available among which the generated power per unit of investment w or cubic meter installation w m3 are well known in red pd is the power generated per membrane area w m2 while the ee is the fraction of the potentially available energy from the salinity difference that is converted into electrical energy by an red unit 21 early red researchers resulted in low pd and ee a pd around 0 4 w m2 and below was achieved using a high concentrated nacl solution 250 g l together with 1 g l nacl as a diluted solution 22 in recent years with the introduction of commercial tailored iems and better stack design significant power efficiency improvements have been achieved 23 24 the pd of a red cell unit measured in watt per square meter w m2 is computed using the formula below 1 p d v i a where pd is the power density v is the voltage in volt i is the current in ampere and a the total area of the cem and aem in square meter m2 2 6 energy calculations and membrane autopsy power and energy are two important elements used to understand the performance of the red process and the formulas below are used to determine their values power is calculated as p i v 2 where p is power in watt w i is the intensity in ampere a and v is the voltage v the power consumed by a pump to circulate the feed solutions is calculated with the formula 3 p p q ρ g h 3 6 10 6 η where pp is the pump power kw q is the volumetric flow of the fluid through the pump m3 h ρ is the density of the fluid being pumped 1000 kg m3 g is the gravity 9 81 m s2 h is the head produced by the pump m and η is the efficiency the energy generated or consumed by a device is computed as follow 4 e p t where e is energy kilowatt hour kwh t is the time of operation in hour h the intensity a and the voltage v were measured with a multimeter connected to the electrodes scanning electron microscope sem and fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir agilent technologies cary 630 ftir spectrometer were used to analyze the membrane morphology and structure before and after the red process 3 results and discussion 3 1 red power density potential of ataköy and ambarlı wastewaters fig 3 below depicted the power density values overtime for 7 days fig 3a and the average power densities fig 3b of the red process operated with ataköy and ambarlı wwtp effluents and the marmara sea the effluent solutions from uf and mbr presented better power densities compared to advanced biological treatment effluents with the 7 days average power densities of uf effluent solutions of 0 49 w m 2 being the maximum power density fig 3b by operating the process for 7 days they were a higher decrease in the power densities in the first 3 days and stabilized to an insignificant decrease for the remaining days with all feed solutions it is a common belief that the presence of multivalent ions and natural organic matter nom causes a lower power density by reducing the ocv when natural streams are fed in the red process membrane fouling takes place at the presence of nom and affects the membrane performance and reduces the effective lifetime of the membrane it is supported that the negatively charged noms such as humic acids shield the positively charged groups in aems reducing the membrane permselectivity and increasing its resistance 25 many researchers reported up to 50 decrease in the power density within the first hour of the red operation with natural feed streams 15 17 18 however all the wastewaters used in this study and the marmara sea presented a good quality with a neglectable concentration of organic matters minimizing membrane fouling and scaling and resulting in a low decrease in the power densities less than 10 in the first 2 days which is the highest slope of power density loss fig 3 a the diluted solution was treated with advanced treatment processes different from microfilters used as pretreatment which are unable to remove organic matters therefore causing organic fouling which dramatically reduced the process power output in the past studies streams 15 17 to demonstrate the importance of the feed solution quality vanoppen et al compared different pretreatments of wastewaters to be used in an red process and reported that both 100 μm filtration and rapid sand filtration were able to significantly reduce membrane fouling and resulted to only 20 of permselectivity decrease 26 their study also suggests that a much better wastewater quality will result in an insignificant loss of the power output as reported in the present research and similarly reported by gómez coma et al 13 who used wastewater treated with a 10 μm filter and resulted in a very low decrease of the power output during 480 h of red operation as reported by goa et al increasing the membrane selectivity and anti organic fouling potential would maximize the energy output and the membrane life when natural feed solutions are used but above all feed solution with fewer pollutants is important since membrane fouling is not the only issue but the low inter membrane space provided by the spacers for the circulation of the feed solutions can be clogged with untreated feed solutions and can lead to a pressure drop and a dramatical decrease of the flow rate vanoppen et al investigated pretreatment techniques for wwtp effluent used in a red unit and supported that adequate pretreatment is required to efficiently run the red system they found that 100 μm filters and rapid sand filtration can significantly reduce membrane fouling and can prevent pressure drops high frequency of cleanings and low permselectivity 26 nam et al investigated a pilot scale red fed with sea and wastewaters and achieved a power density of 0 38 m2 w 27 although they worked with elevated hc salinity 52 9 53 8 ms cm the quality of their wastewater effluent was low resulting in lower power density in their study compared to the present study it is obvious that the high effluent quality from ataköy and ambarlı wwtp together with the clean marmara sea surrounding the treatment plant cut off the need for a pretreatment process when these solutions are fed to a red stack the present study may have presented a better result compared to former studies using similar feed solutions however the obtained power densities are still below optimal values for the process to be viable and accepted in the energy market due to the use of a stack with a very low number of pair cells and membranes which are less suitable for red low permselectivity high resistance and thickness besides the hc was filled with the marmara sea with a conductivity of 33 2 ms cm increasing the hc salinity would increase the driving force and contribute to optimizing the power density 28 but this option is not possible for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp since they are located at the vicinity of the marmara sea but can be considered for other treatment plants located nearby high saline solution such as the mediterranean sea 3 2 energy generated by red with ataköy and ambarlı wastewater discharged in the marmara sea ataköy wwtp discharges a daily average of 411 250 m3 treated wastewater at the marmara sea 381 250 m3 day 1 from the advanced biological treatment ab1 and 30 000 m3 day 1 from the mbr process mbr a 7 days average power density of 0 45 w m 2 and 0 47 w m 2 was achieved with the red process when ab1 and mbr are discharged respectively in the marmara sea the effluent from mbr is relatively clean compared to ab1 the presence of trace organic matters in ab1 participated in slightly reducing the achieved power density by affecting the ion transport efficiency and by deposing on the membrane surface fig 4 causing some fouling 25 26 however not a big difference is observed showing that the ab1 solution can effectively be used in the red process and result in high power density when operating at optimal conditions using the formulas 1 2 and 4 and considering the diluted feed solution flow rate of 20 ml min the sgp and energy produced by red can be calculated for 4 diluted feed solutions treated wastewaters with the marmara sea discharging all these treated wastewaters into the marmara sea through the red process resulted in total energy production of 18 566 25 kw h day 1 subdivided as 17 156 25 kw h day 1 with the effluent from ab1 and 1410 kw h day 1 with effluent from mbr as presented by table 3 in table 4 similar results were observed with ambarlı wwtp in this case the power density was 0 44 w m 2 and 0 49 w m 2 with advanced biological treatment effluent ab2 and uf effluent uf respectively as observed with the mbr process in ataköy treatment plant effluent uf effluent presented the highest power density due to the high effluent quality resulted from the treatment performance which mainly removed particulate organic and inorganic matters during the filtration process discharging the treated wastewaters effluent from ambarlı wwtp into the marmara sea through the red process resulted in total energy production of 16 045 kw h day 1 subdivided as 14 820 kw h day 1 with the effluent from ab2 and 1225 kw h day 1 with effluent from uf the effluent from uf treatment achieved the highest power density between the four diluted solutions studied but the total amount of water from uf being very low the daily energy generation is limited it is obvious that the wastewater treatment method affects the red performance due to the treated wastewater quality 26 but advanced biological treatment being the less effective treatment in the present study still resulted in good power densities when compared to advanced treatment such as mbr and uf 3 3 autopsy of the iems after 7 days operations although it is generally supported that red is less prone to fouling than typical pressure driven membrane processes such as ro or uf the main issues encountered by all membrane processes are membrane fouling wetting clogging and damage these influence the integrity of the membranes and contribute to worsening the performance of the membrane process over time 29 30 to understand the fate of the iems after the red operation sem and ftir analyses have been performed the sem images and the ftir spectra are depicted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively and they enlighten the behavior of the iems after 7 days of operation in a red process using advanced treated municipal wastewaters and the marmara sea as feed solutions in fig 4 the sem images with 5000x magnifications show the morphology of the neat cem and aem as well as their morphologies on the hc side marmara sea and lc sides uf mbr and ab1 effluent solutions after 7 days red operation consequently depicting the structure modification and the pollutants trapped on the surface of the membranes during the red process the neat membranes presented a non porous morphology on the other hand the used membrane surface was affected by the elements present in the feed solutions and the deposition of crystals and debris there was a high deposition of salt crystals on both cem and aem facing the sea water side and some crystals can also be seen on the lc sides of the membranes the lc sides of the iems used for uf mbr ab1 municipal wastewater effluents seem to be affected slightly by the deposition of some materials these are tiny organic and inorganic matters not removed during the advanced treatment processes and some debris deposited in the water during the stagnation phase after the treatment processes debris may not be a substantial problem since adequate care will be taken to avoid such deposition if advanced treated wastewater is to be used in a red process the table 5 depicted the elemental composition of the materials on the membrane surface from edx analysis slight changes of the molecular composition and concentration was observed between the neat membranes and their corresponding used iems showing the presence of some multivalent ions such as mg2 ca2 and fe2 on both cems and aems the change of the initial elemental composition and concentration is proof that the iems have been affected during the red process the change in the membrane structures after 7 days of red operation was examined with ftir and depicted in fig 5 both neat aem and cem showed a major pick at 2849 cm 1 and 2917 cm 1 which are related to the stretching vibration c h groups present in the membranes backbone they also have a stretching oh group exhibited by 3444 cm 1 and 3381 cm 1 peaks a cloud of peaks from 675 cm 1 to 1636 cm 1 characterizing the functional groups of the cem associated with polysulfones and from 719 cm 1 to 1711 cm 1 characterizing the functional groups of the aem associated with quaternary ammonium were also presented by the ftir spectra the aromatic ring stretch is also represented in these clouds of peaks 31 32 considering the ftir spectra there is no change or almost no noticeable changes in the peaks observed between neat and used membranes no peaks removed none added after 7 days red operation their wavenumbers and wavelengths remained almost similar for all the membranes with the same nature cems or aems regardless of the feed solutions the spectra remain unchanged they showed no sign of distortion from the red process this result suggests that none of the membranes lost their properties after 7 days of operation in red with the marmara sea and the different advanced treated wastewater uf mbr and advanced biological treated wastewater effluent solutions the effect of membrane fouling on the red performance especially in the application of natural waters real river or saline waters contributes to reducing the attraction of the red process 33 fouling is mainly caused by particles mainly composed of remnants of diatoms clay minerals organic fouling and scaling 15 as well as the presence of nom the present study showed that the decrease of the power density observed over time in the process and reported in the literature is not mainly due to the loss of the membrane properties but may be connected to the deposition of the pollutants on the membrane surface the saturation of the low inter membrane space provided by the spacers for the circulation of the feed solutions which can lead to a pressure drop and the reduction of the membrane conductivity induced by the deposition of pollutants on its surface understanding this is important for the application of backwashing techniques during the red process operation 3 4 optimized red and energy return on investment eroi the achieved power density in the present study was relatively low with 0 49 w m 2 as maximum power density achieved by uf effluent and the marmara sea the reason for low power output is mainly due to the low pair cell used low hc salinity module and spacer geometry as well as the properties of the membrane 28 rather than the feed solution characteristics to confirm this assumption the same module with similar conditions was operated using a synthetic concentrated and diluted solution containing only nacl with salinity like the marmara sea and uf effluent solution respectively the average power density for 7 days operation was 0 54 w m 2 which is close to the one generated by real wastewater and the marmara sea this is proof that the low power density generated with the marmara sea and the treated wastewater effluents was not due to the diluted treated wastewater solutions but the aforementioned parameters and it is worth mentioning that the low salinity of the marmara sea contributed as well in yielding low energy output using an hc solution with high salinity 54 7 μs7cm gómez coma et al achieved a power density of 1 43 w m 2 13 almost three times the power density in our study th high power density in their study can be attributed to the membrane performance profiled membrane and the high salinity of the concentrated solution by optimizing these parameters literature supported a power density over 2 5 w m 2 28 34 35 achievable this is not to account for the red process optimization predicted as the result of highly selective and effective membranes and spacer less or suitable spacer predicted to boost the energy output of the red process in the future many options to improve power density are currently being investigated including membrane profiling conductive spacers and alternative modes of operation to estimate the energy return on investment eroi the energy consumed by the pump to ensure the transport of the feed solutions have been determined considering a stack with 2000 cems and 2000 aems a total of 429 stacks and 351 stacks are required to operate the effluent from ataköy wwtp and ambarlı wwtp respectively the energy consumption in the red process is entirely based on the pumping of the feed solutions energy use for pumping is estimated to reach 25 of the total energy generated by the red system 24 and it affects both the net energy recovery and the operational costs of the process by using the eq s 3 and 4 the energy consumed for pumping daily the feed solutions through the suggested red plant is determined to be 10 584 kw h day 1 and 8 668 4 kw h day 1 for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively as depicted by table 6 with our current energy output the pump seems to consume more than 50 of the total energy generated by each plant the energy required to pump the hc and lc solutions through the red stack is affected by the flow rates which also affects the electrical performance of the red process operating the red stacks with optimal flow rates is therefore crucial 20 to improve the net power output it is necessary to use pumps that are versatile and allow maximum energy savings this keeps energy costs down and considerably reduces the pumping station s life cycle costs more important feed solutions should be fed to the stack at an optimum flow rate as supported by zhu et al with 10 cell pair of a total 0 13 m2 as membrane active area they demonstrated that 10 ml min and 20 ml min was the optimal flow rate for hc and lc respectively to optimize the red energy generation and simultaneously reduce the pumping cost 20 weiner et al investigated optimum red conditions and reported that an optimal stack design which minimizes the levelized cost of energy lcoe consists of low load resistance and feed flow rate as well as a larger residence time 36 in fact the residence time is proportional to the flow rate which is proportional to the pumping cost the present study after testing different flow rates optimized the energy pumping cost by operating the process with 14 ml min for the hc and 20 ml min for the low lc found to be the optimal pumping flow rate at present state of art the minimal power density achievable by red is estimated to be around 2 5 w m 2 28 34 35 considering this as a simulated power density value the optimized energy output for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp is predicted using the formulas 1 2 and 4 operating with similar conditions with the not optimized red process will result in a similar membrane area table 3 and table 4 and pumping energy consumption table 6 the pumping energy being constant table 6 very low net energy is generated with the present conditions 7 982 25 kw h day1 and 7 376 6 kw h day1 for ataköy and ambarlı wwtps respectively however optimizing the red process will result in the generation of 39 911 25 kw h day1 and 36 883 kw h day1 net energy from the ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively the energy generated by the non optimized and optimized red process are shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively for a real plant increasing the number of membranes in the stack may slightly reduce the energy generated however the pumping cost may also be reduced as well as iems area since less end membranes will be required 3 5 energy coverage with red at ataköy and ambarlı wwtp ataköy and ambarlı wwtps consume a total of 159 084 kw h day 1 and 148 513 kw h day 1 energy respectively 14 and using the treated wastewater in an red unit can generate 7 982 25 kw h day 1 and 7 376 6 kw h day 1 net energy respectively this represents 5 02 of the daily energy consumed in ataköy wwtp and 5 for ambarlı wwtp for the different wastewater treatment and plant maintenance the results of the red energy coverage of both plants are presented in table 8 however these results were achieved with a low power density around 0 5 w m 2 due to membrane properties red module and spacer geometry which contributed to a high resistance and a low power density rather than the process feed solutions properties at present state of art the average power density is estimated to be around 2 5 w m 2 and considering this as a simulated value the optimized energy output for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp is estimated to be around 39 911 25 kw h day 1 and 36 883 kw h day 1 respectively with such power output the energy generated by red will cover 25 1 and 25 of the ataköy and ambarlı energy needs respectively as shown in table 9 with the expectations of better and specific membranes for red in the future and high improvement of the red sgp harvesting this percentage will rise and may lead to the concept of zero energy wastewater treatment plant 3 6 reuse of the wastewaters the treated wastewater effluents from uf and mbr units are used in the watering of the gardens surrounding the treatment plant a slight increase of the wastewater salinity took place during the red process resulting in a conductivity close to 2000 μs cm this is a moderate salinity and can be tolerated when used in agriculture besides the solution presented a very low cod as a result of the mrb and uf processes which effectively removed the dissolved matters and most pollutants from the solution as reported by gómez coma et al effluent quality and energy consumption are the key parameters restraining wastewater reclamation 13 red coupled with wwtps can significantly reduce the need for fossil fuel consumption in the plant and can contribute to a more sustainable and environmental friendly process that generates energy for self operation the reclaimed water showed a high quality and can still be used after the red process 3 7 challenges and perspectives electrical energy harvesting by red is new under the developing process with a lot of challenges to overcome in order to be accepted in the energy market iems characteristics membranes costs suitable spacers and electrodes are the parameters of interest to make the process economically acceptable from the sensitivity analysis daniilidis et al reported that membrane related parameters i e pricing and performance and inflation are the most important factors in the implementation of red in real and large scale 34 the iec selectivity and membrane resistance are the most sensible red iem parameters which should be high for the first two and low for the last one the fabrication process and coating or modifications of iems should be the focus of new researches to adapt the membranes to the required red system to be commercially applicable and economically cost effective through the vulgarization of the red process many attempts to produce properly designed red membranes are still under investigation with major progresses in the improvement of membrane selectivity and resistance divalent ions in the sea and river water ideal candidates for real red implementation remain one of the major constraints of red performance due to both induced uphill transport and increased membrane resistance to mitigate those divalent ion effects novel and tailor made membranes are being investigated 37 to improve the electrochemical properties of the iems among which high permselectivity and low resistance many attempts have been made such as organic inorganic nanocomposite membranes from polyphenylene oxide ppo 38 halogenated polyethers such as polyepichlorohydrin pech 39 sulfonated polyethersulfone spes cation cem 40 these attempts aimed to improve the power density and the lcoe of red membrane modification to improve its properties and reduce its vulnerability to fouling have been performed with success as an example study of güler et al who successfully coated a standard commercial aem and improved the membrane antifouling properties and monovalent ion selectivity 19 another perspective is to produce a membrane with a relatively thin thickness to reduce membrane resistance and spacer less membrane carrying straight ridges named profiled membrane and fabricated to eliminate the use of non conductive spacers in red stack 41 42 the preparation of ultrathin approximately 500 nm thickness and ion selective janus membranes will allow a low fluidic resistance and rapid mass transport which will improve the conversion of the sgp 43 and the need for understanding nanofluidics and nanoconfinement therefore ionic transport in confined nano environment will open a new way in membrane design and application in sgp production 44 the current state of technology results to high lcoe in red compared to other currently available energy technologies but the projection with the improvement of the power density 2 7 w m2 and membrane price less than 4 m2 in near future can make red competitive in term of electricity production compared to conventional and established renewable technologies with a projected lower lcoe index of 0 16 kw h 34 a low cost and easy to produce tailor made iems suitable for red with low resistance high permselectivity high iec resistant to fouling chemically and mechanically stable will win the race to a low lcoe red process that can be competitive in the energy market hybrid red processes which includes the combination of desalination processes such as ro and md as high saline sources and wastewaters for both concentrated and diluted solution sources are new prospections for a tendency to zero waste management systems with energy extractions and resources recovery the costs of iems are still high today these costs are expected to decrease with the increase of iems use and the vulgarization of the red process on another hand it is likely that there is a decrease in the intensity of the power with the increasing number of membranes in the red stack the energy values depicted in tables 3 and 4 were calculated taking into account the results obtained in the laboratory experiments it is recommended to carry out a pilot scale study on the change of power density with increasing cell pairs in the red stack after laboratory work to enlighten and project real energy obtainable from the wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusion with the rise of climate change a clean environment and the need for alternative energy sources to keep our economy boosted became an obligation renewable energy has been considered with success as alternative energy to fossil in the same scope sgp is now being investigated as another key factor to cover energy demand red has been investigated with synthetic solutions but very few researches outline the use of natural feeds such as sea and wastewaters the present study pointed out a good combination of wwtp and red for energy generation from the mixing of treated wastewater effluent and the marmara sea in order to cover part of the energy demand in the wwtp although about 5 of the energy demand has been covered by our study considering state of art red conditions over 25 of the energy demand can be covered by the red process in the wwtp a study considering the best iems available and optimal operating conditions in a pilot scale red stack with a high number of pair cells is needed to improve our understanding of how red can contribute to reducing energy demand in the wwtps such as ataköy and ambarlı which discharge high quality treated effluent into the sea in addition using the brines from a nearby desalination plant as a concentrated solution would tremendously increase the power output declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

13765,the present study investigated the reverse electrodialysis red energy generation potential of treated wastewaters from ataköy and ambarlı wastewater treatment plant wwtp when discharged at the marmara sea the good quality of the wwtp effluents and their suitable conductivity around 1 ms cm 1 resulted in a power density around 0 5 w m 2 when they are operated together with the marmara sea in a lab scale red system this led to the generation of an approximative daily gross energy of 18 6 mw h and 16 mw h with ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively considering optimal red conditions able to reach a power density of 2 5 w m 2 ataköy wwtp can generate net energy of 39 9 mw h day which represents 25 1 of the total energy demand of the plant similarly the ambarlı wwtp can cover 25 of the plant energy demand by generating daily net energy of 36 8 mw h improving the characteristics of the ions exchange membranes iems by introducing highly selective and cost effective membranes is part of the necessary solution to increase the power output of the process keywords energy ions exchange membranes reverse electrodialysis salinity gradient power wastewater 1 introduction the chemical potential difference between water bodies releases energy when two solutions with different concentrations in salinity mix this is known as salinity gradient power sgp 1 or salinity gradient energy sge although not well known it is renewable and clean energy suitable for coastal countries and can contribute to increasing the many renewable energy sources already available to participate in accelerating the fossil fuel mitigation policy adopted by many nations in the last century in the principle of sgp when a freshwater stream flows toward the sea or high saline water and discharge into it there is an increase of the entropy of the system and a dissipation of a chemical potential gradient when the two solutions of different concentration irreversibly mix one to another and can be converted into energy through specific systems performing a controlled mixing process 2 4 the reversal of some desalination processes can convert the potential energy from the salinity gradient into electricity giving rise to new technologies such as red and pressure retarded osmosis pro which are the most frequently studied membrane based technologies to harvest the sgp 2 pattle developed and proposed the first concept of electrical energy extraction from the mixing of fresh and saltwater in 1954 5 and the technique he described is similar to the process known today as red it was not until 1977 that the global potential of sgp was estimated by wick and schmitt to be approximately 2 6 tw 6 this value is near to the estimated 2 8 tw values today 7 in contrary to pro where water is transported across a semi permeable membrane the energy extracted by red occurs by the transport of ions through iems negatively charged cation exchange membranes cems and positively charged anion exchange membranes aems during the mixing of two solutions with different salinity 8 red utilizes a flow system between electrodes and alternating cems and aems 9 where the transport of dissolved salt ions through the stack of alternating iems creates an electrical potential capable of generating electricity 7 10 the ions na and cl in the concentrated solution compartments migrate across the membranes toward the diluted solution compartments na migrates through the cems toward the cathode while cl migrates through aems toward the anode since the membranes are semipermeable they allow anions to pass through the aems and cations through cems by migrating in opposite directions from the concentrated saline solution to the diluted solution but theoretically block the transport of co ions and water 1 7 when an external load is applied to the electrodes the migration of ions at opposite directions creates an ionic current at the electrodes which are converted to electrical energy 9 11 12 although sea waters and rivers are great candidates for sgp generation recently some attention has been devoted to alternative feed solutions such as wastewaters and brines from desalination plants to reach a quality standard to be reused the treatment of municipal wastewater require energy which can make the process expensive when treated wastewater is used in a red stack the effluent solution can still be reused for many purposes 13 istanbul is a metropolitan with over 15 million inhabitants making it one of the world s most populated and largest cities according to the report published by iski istanbul water and sewerage administration in 2018 istanbul disposes of many advanced biological treatment plants some of the wwtps integrated membrane bioreactors mbr while ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro membrane processes are used as advanced treatment processes to purify part of the effluent from biological processes resulting in high quality effluent mainly reused in the watering of gardens a total of 900 465 kw h day 1 electrical energy is consumed in the wwtp in istanbul while up to 336 417 kw h day 1 electrical energy is produced from anaerobic digestion of sludge 14 the effluents from istanbul wwtps are discharged in the marmara sea these effluents are low in conductivity around 1 1 1 4 ms cm 1 and can be considered as low saline solutions and used to generate sgp during the mixing of these effluents with the marmara sea up to now a few investigations have been conducted in the field of sgp extraction by the red process using real feed solutions most of the studies are focused on lab scales fed with synthetic solutions real feed solutions are more complex and the presence of divalent ions in sea waters dissolved matters and suspended solids found in natural water make the process difficult and require high engineering skills to be optimized however targeting different feed solutions such as brines concentrates from different desalination processes and wastewater treated effluent can diversify the potential of red when natural feed streams are used in red without adequate anti fouling treatments a mixture of fouling can take place on the membranes mainly composed of remnants of diatoms clay minerals organic fouling and scaling 15 avci et al compared natural feed streams salinity gradient power harvesting by red with synthetic equivalent ionic strength and reported approximately 2 3 loss in power density they attributed this result to increased membrane resistance reduced open circuit voltage ocv and the occurrence of uphill transport for ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the red stack operated with natural feed streams 16 many researchers reported up to 50 decrease in the power density within the first hour of red operation with natural feed streams 15 17 18 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the decrease of the system performance is prevalently due to the significant increase of cem resistance due to the presence of negatively charged organic matters in natural water bodies as a membrane process membrane fouling and concentration polarization could be some major effects with real feed solutions in addition to antifouling strategies to clean and recover the membrane and the red stack performance pretreatment of the feed solutions membrane modification to improve its properties and the fouling resistance 19 and profiled membranes 15 are alternatives using ataköy and ambarlı wwtp as models for being among the biggest wwtp of the city of istanbul the present study investigated the red energy generation potential with municipal wastewaters treated by advanced biological treatment mbr and uf processes together with the marmara sea the energy potential will be determined and simulation with optimal conditions will help determine the net red energy output in ataköy and amabarlı wwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory scale red stack a lab scale red module essentially composed of an red stack of 10 cell pairs the feed solutions tanks the peristaltic pump used to circulate the feed solutions and the electrode rinse solution ers into and out of the module and a multimeter used as the electrical measurements apparatus has been constructed and operated for 7 days 36 h running in the present study the module consisted of iems spacers and the electrode system a single cell unit consists of a cem a high compartment hc aem and a low compartment lc three tanks with 2 l volume each were used as reservoirs one tank was filled with the marmara sea the second tank with treated wastewater while the third tank carried the ers a peristaltic pump was used to circulate the feed solutions from the tanks through the red module the design of the red stack is presented in fig 1 2 2 red stack components the stack consisted of alternative iems 11 cems and 10 aems purchased from iontech china and characterized as depicted in table 1 each membrane has an active membrane area of 0 0059 m2 0 077m 0 077m for a total active membrane area of 0 118 m2 woven spacers with 380 μm thickness were used between the alternating iems to create stark compartments both electrodes anode and cathode of dimensions 1 100 100 mm purchased from china were titanium mesh coated with rubidium and iridium ti ru ir the feed solutions were separately pumped into and out the stack in a single pass while the ers was continuously circulated to the stack and back to the tank the flow rates of the hc and lc solutions have been set differently to reduce the impact of the lc solution resistance and the diffusion boundary layer resistance 20 instead of feeding the red stack with identic flow rates for both lc and hc solutions operating the red process with an hc flow rate lower than the lc reduces the lc resistance consequently the solutions of the present study were circulated with a fixed flow rate of around 20 ml min for the lc solution treated wastewater and 14 ml min for hc solution the marmara sea 2 3 feed solutions the feed solutions were collected from istanbul the marmara sea was collected from the vicinity of the plant where municipal wastewaters are discharged after treatment istanbul disposes of 89 municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtp 8 pretreatment and 81 advanced biological treatment plants with a total capacity of 5 815 260 m³ day 1 receiving around 3 927 030 m³ day 1 wastewater 14 both located in the european side ataköy and ambarlı are among the high capacity treatment plant of the city with a total capacity of 600 000 m³ day 1 and 400 000 m³ day respectively and receives 411 250 m³ day 1 and 336 820 m³ day 1 respectively ataköy wwtp includes an mbr unit with a capacity of 30 000 m³ day 1 and ambarlı wwtp contains an uf unit with a capacity of 25 000 m³ day 1 expected to reach 50 000 m³ day 1 soon 14 4 wastewaters were collected and used as diluted solutions in the red stack 2 samples 1 from advanced biological treatment effluent ab1 and 1 from mbr unit effluent mbr and 2 other samples 1 advanced biological treatment ab2 and 1 from the uf membrane treatment unit uf were collected from ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively the characteristics values of the feed solutions are presented in table 2 the ers is assumed to have a salt concentration between that of the concentrated and the diluted solutions it was prepared by mixing in 1 l distilled water 0 05 m k4fe cn 6 and 0 05 m k3fe cn 6 the solution is mixed up to homogeneity before being used in the red stack the conductivity of the prepared ers was 20 85 ms cm 2 4 design of plant red installation ambarlı and ataköy wwtp are located at the marmara seaside 5 m and 10 m altitude respectively the treated wastewaters are discharged into the sea by gravitation an appropriate red stack can be installed underground allowing both feed solutions to flow by gravity into the stack the brackish solution from the stack will then be stored at about 5 m down sea level before being pumped to the surface of the marmara sea as schematically depicted by fig 2 2 5 power density and feed solutions analyses many elements among which power density pd and energy efficiency ee are of key importance for the generation of power in an red unit depending on the final unit many definitions of pd are available among which the generated power per unit of investment w or cubic meter installation w m3 are well known in red pd is the power generated per membrane area w m2 while the ee is the fraction of the potentially available energy from the salinity difference that is converted into electrical energy by an red unit 21 early red researchers resulted in low pd and ee a pd around 0 4 w m2 and below was achieved using a high concentrated nacl solution 250 g l together with 1 g l nacl as a diluted solution 22 in recent years with the introduction of commercial tailored iems and better stack design significant power efficiency improvements have been achieved 23 24 the pd of a red cell unit measured in watt per square meter w m2 is computed using the formula below 1 p d v i a where pd is the power density v is the voltage in volt i is the current in ampere and a the total area of the cem and aem in square meter m2 2 6 energy calculations and membrane autopsy power and energy are two important elements used to understand the performance of the red process and the formulas below are used to determine their values power is calculated as p i v 2 where p is power in watt w i is the intensity in ampere a and v is the voltage v the power consumed by a pump to circulate the feed solutions is calculated with the formula 3 p p q ρ g h 3 6 10 6 η where pp is the pump power kw q is the volumetric flow of the fluid through the pump m3 h ρ is the density of the fluid being pumped 1000 kg m3 g is the gravity 9 81 m s2 h is the head produced by the pump m and η is the efficiency the energy generated or consumed by a device is computed as follow 4 e p t where e is energy kilowatt hour kwh t is the time of operation in hour h the intensity a and the voltage v were measured with a multimeter connected to the electrodes scanning electron microscope sem and fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir agilent technologies cary 630 ftir spectrometer were used to analyze the membrane morphology and structure before and after the red process 3 results and discussion 3 1 red power density potential of ataköy and ambarlı wastewaters fig 3 below depicted the power density values overtime for 7 days fig 3a and the average power densities fig 3b of the red process operated with ataköy and ambarlı wwtp effluents and the marmara sea the effluent solutions from uf and mbr presented better power densities compared to advanced biological treatment effluents with the 7 days average power densities of uf effluent solutions of 0 49 w m 2 being the maximum power density fig 3b by operating the process for 7 days they were a higher decrease in the power densities in the first 3 days and stabilized to an insignificant decrease for the remaining days with all feed solutions it is a common belief that the presence of multivalent ions and natural organic matter nom causes a lower power density by reducing the ocv when natural streams are fed in the red process membrane fouling takes place at the presence of nom and affects the membrane performance and reduces the effective lifetime of the membrane it is supported that the negatively charged noms such as humic acids shield the positively charged groups in aems reducing the membrane permselectivity and increasing its resistance 25 many researchers reported up to 50 decrease in the power density within the first hour of the red operation with natural feed streams 15 17 18 however all the wastewaters used in this study and the marmara sea presented a good quality with a neglectable concentration of organic matters minimizing membrane fouling and scaling and resulting in a low decrease in the power densities less than 10 in the first 2 days which is the highest slope of power density loss fig 3 a the diluted solution was treated with advanced treatment processes different from microfilters used as pretreatment which are unable to remove organic matters therefore causing organic fouling which dramatically reduced the process power output in the past studies streams 15 17 to demonstrate the importance of the feed solution quality vanoppen et al compared different pretreatments of wastewaters to be used in an red process and reported that both 100 μm filtration and rapid sand filtration were able to significantly reduce membrane fouling and resulted to only 20 of permselectivity decrease 26 their study also suggests that a much better wastewater quality will result in an insignificant loss of the power output as reported in the present research and similarly reported by gómez coma et al 13 who used wastewater treated with a 10 μm filter and resulted in a very low decrease of the power output during 480 h of red operation as reported by goa et al increasing the membrane selectivity and anti organic fouling potential would maximize the energy output and the membrane life when natural feed solutions are used but above all feed solution with fewer pollutants is important since membrane fouling is not the only issue but the low inter membrane space provided by the spacers for the circulation of the feed solutions can be clogged with untreated feed solutions and can lead to a pressure drop and a dramatical decrease of the flow rate vanoppen et al investigated pretreatment techniques for wwtp effluent used in a red unit and supported that adequate pretreatment is required to efficiently run the red system they found that 100 μm filters and rapid sand filtration can significantly reduce membrane fouling and can prevent pressure drops high frequency of cleanings and low permselectivity 26 nam et al investigated a pilot scale red fed with sea and wastewaters and achieved a power density of 0 38 m2 w 27 although they worked with elevated hc salinity 52 9 53 8 ms cm the quality of their wastewater effluent was low resulting in lower power density in their study compared to the present study it is obvious that the high effluent quality from ataköy and ambarlı wwtp together with the clean marmara sea surrounding the treatment plant cut off the need for a pretreatment process when these solutions are fed to a red stack the present study may have presented a better result compared to former studies using similar feed solutions however the obtained power densities are still below optimal values for the process to be viable and accepted in the energy market due to the use of a stack with a very low number of pair cells and membranes which are less suitable for red low permselectivity high resistance and thickness besides the hc was filled with the marmara sea with a conductivity of 33 2 ms cm increasing the hc salinity would increase the driving force and contribute to optimizing the power density 28 but this option is not possible for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp since they are located at the vicinity of the marmara sea but can be considered for other treatment plants located nearby high saline solution such as the mediterranean sea 3 2 energy generated by red with ataköy and ambarlı wastewater discharged in the marmara sea ataköy wwtp discharges a daily average of 411 250 m3 treated wastewater at the marmara sea 381 250 m3 day 1 from the advanced biological treatment ab1 and 30 000 m3 day 1 from the mbr process mbr a 7 days average power density of 0 45 w m 2 and 0 47 w m 2 was achieved with the red process when ab1 and mbr are discharged respectively in the marmara sea the effluent from mbr is relatively clean compared to ab1 the presence of trace organic matters in ab1 participated in slightly reducing the achieved power density by affecting the ion transport efficiency and by deposing on the membrane surface fig 4 causing some fouling 25 26 however not a big difference is observed showing that the ab1 solution can effectively be used in the red process and result in high power density when operating at optimal conditions using the formulas 1 2 and 4 and considering the diluted feed solution flow rate of 20 ml min the sgp and energy produced by red can be calculated for 4 diluted feed solutions treated wastewaters with the marmara sea discharging all these treated wastewaters into the marmara sea through the red process resulted in total energy production of 18 566 25 kw h day 1 subdivided as 17 156 25 kw h day 1 with the effluent from ab1 and 1410 kw h day 1 with effluent from mbr as presented by table 3 in table 4 similar results were observed with ambarlı wwtp in this case the power density was 0 44 w m 2 and 0 49 w m 2 with advanced biological treatment effluent ab2 and uf effluent uf respectively as observed with the mbr process in ataköy treatment plant effluent uf effluent presented the highest power density due to the high effluent quality resulted from the treatment performance which mainly removed particulate organic and inorganic matters during the filtration process discharging the treated wastewaters effluent from ambarlı wwtp into the marmara sea through the red process resulted in total energy production of 16 045 kw h day 1 subdivided as 14 820 kw h day 1 with the effluent from ab2 and 1225 kw h day 1 with effluent from uf the effluent from uf treatment achieved the highest power density between the four diluted solutions studied but the total amount of water from uf being very low the daily energy generation is limited it is obvious that the wastewater treatment method affects the red performance due to the treated wastewater quality 26 but advanced biological treatment being the less effective treatment in the present study still resulted in good power densities when compared to advanced treatment such as mbr and uf 3 3 autopsy of the iems after 7 days operations although it is generally supported that red is less prone to fouling than typical pressure driven membrane processes such as ro or uf the main issues encountered by all membrane processes are membrane fouling wetting clogging and damage these influence the integrity of the membranes and contribute to worsening the performance of the membrane process over time 29 30 to understand the fate of the iems after the red operation sem and ftir analyses have been performed the sem images and the ftir spectra are depicted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively and they enlighten the behavior of the iems after 7 days of operation in a red process using advanced treated municipal wastewaters and the marmara sea as feed solutions in fig 4 the sem images with 5000x magnifications show the morphology of the neat cem and aem as well as their morphologies on the hc side marmara sea and lc sides uf mbr and ab1 effluent solutions after 7 days red operation consequently depicting the structure modification and the pollutants trapped on the surface of the membranes during the red process the neat membranes presented a non porous morphology on the other hand the used membrane surface was affected by the elements present in the feed solutions and the deposition of crystals and debris there was a high deposition of salt crystals on both cem and aem facing the sea water side and some crystals can also be seen on the lc sides of the membranes the lc sides of the iems used for uf mbr ab1 municipal wastewater effluents seem to be affected slightly by the deposition of some materials these are tiny organic and inorganic matters not removed during the advanced treatment processes and some debris deposited in the water during the stagnation phase after the treatment processes debris may not be a substantial problem since adequate care will be taken to avoid such deposition if advanced treated wastewater is to be used in a red process the table 5 depicted the elemental composition of the materials on the membrane surface from edx analysis slight changes of the molecular composition and concentration was observed between the neat membranes and their corresponding used iems showing the presence of some multivalent ions such as mg2 ca2 and fe2 on both cems and aems the change of the initial elemental composition and concentration is proof that the iems have been affected during the red process the change in the membrane structures after 7 days of red operation was examined with ftir and depicted in fig 5 both neat aem and cem showed a major pick at 2849 cm 1 and 2917 cm 1 which are related to the stretching vibration c h groups present in the membranes backbone they also have a stretching oh group exhibited by 3444 cm 1 and 3381 cm 1 peaks a cloud of peaks from 675 cm 1 to 1636 cm 1 characterizing the functional groups of the cem associated with polysulfones and from 719 cm 1 to 1711 cm 1 characterizing the functional groups of the aem associated with quaternary ammonium were also presented by the ftir spectra the aromatic ring stretch is also represented in these clouds of peaks 31 32 considering the ftir spectra there is no change or almost no noticeable changes in the peaks observed between neat and used membranes no peaks removed none added after 7 days red operation their wavenumbers and wavelengths remained almost similar for all the membranes with the same nature cems or aems regardless of the feed solutions the spectra remain unchanged they showed no sign of distortion from the red process this result suggests that none of the membranes lost their properties after 7 days of operation in red with the marmara sea and the different advanced treated wastewater uf mbr and advanced biological treated wastewater effluent solutions the effect of membrane fouling on the red performance especially in the application of natural waters real river or saline waters contributes to reducing the attraction of the red process 33 fouling is mainly caused by particles mainly composed of remnants of diatoms clay minerals organic fouling and scaling 15 as well as the presence of nom the present study showed that the decrease of the power density observed over time in the process and reported in the literature is not mainly due to the loss of the membrane properties but may be connected to the deposition of the pollutants on the membrane surface the saturation of the low inter membrane space provided by the spacers for the circulation of the feed solutions which can lead to a pressure drop and the reduction of the membrane conductivity induced by the deposition of pollutants on its surface understanding this is important for the application of backwashing techniques during the red process operation 3 4 optimized red and energy return on investment eroi the achieved power density in the present study was relatively low with 0 49 w m 2 as maximum power density achieved by uf effluent and the marmara sea the reason for low power output is mainly due to the low pair cell used low hc salinity module and spacer geometry as well as the properties of the membrane 28 rather than the feed solution characteristics to confirm this assumption the same module with similar conditions was operated using a synthetic concentrated and diluted solution containing only nacl with salinity like the marmara sea and uf effluent solution respectively the average power density for 7 days operation was 0 54 w m 2 which is close to the one generated by real wastewater and the marmara sea this is proof that the low power density generated with the marmara sea and the treated wastewater effluents was not due to the diluted treated wastewater solutions but the aforementioned parameters and it is worth mentioning that the low salinity of the marmara sea contributed as well in yielding low energy output using an hc solution with high salinity 54 7 μs7cm gómez coma et al achieved a power density of 1 43 w m 2 13 almost three times the power density in our study th high power density in their study can be attributed to the membrane performance profiled membrane and the high salinity of the concentrated solution by optimizing these parameters literature supported a power density over 2 5 w m 2 28 34 35 achievable this is not to account for the red process optimization predicted as the result of highly selective and effective membranes and spacer less or suitable spacer predicted to boost the energy output of the red process in the future many options to improve power density are currently being investigated including membrane profiling conductive spacers and alternative modes of operation to estimate the energy return on investment eroi the energy consumed by the pump to ensure the transport of the feed solutions have been determined considering a stack with 2000 cems and 2000 aems a total of 429 stacks and 351 stacks are required to operate the effluent from ataköy wwtp and ambarlı wwtp respectively the energy consumption in the red process is entirely based on the pumping of the feed solutions energy use for pumping is estimated to reach 25 of the total energy generated by the red system 24 and it affects both the net energy recovery and the operational costs of the process by using the eq s 3 and 4 the energy consumed for pumping daily the feed solutions through the suggested red plant is determined to be 10 584 kw h day 1 and 8 668 4 kw h day 1 for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively as depicted by table 6 with our current energy output the pump seems to consume more than 50 of the total energy generated by each plant the energy required to pump the hc and lc solutions through the red stack is affected by the flow rates which also affects the electrical performance of the red process operating the red stacks with optimal flow rates is therefore crucial 20 to improve the net power output it is necessary to use pumps that are versatile and allow maximum energy savings this keeps energy costs down and considerably reduces the pumping station s life cycle costs more important feed solutions should be fed to the stack at an optimum flow rate as supported by zhu et al with 10 cell pair of a total 0 13 m2 as membrane active area they demonstrated that 10 ml min and 20 ml min was the optimal flow rate for hc and lc respectively to optimize the red energy generation and simultaneously reduce the pumping cost 20 weiner et al investigated optimum red conditions and reported that an optimal stack design which minimizes the levelized cost of energy lcoe consists of low load resistance and feed flow rate as well as a larger residence time 36 in fact the residence time is proportional to the flow rate which is proportional to the pumping cost the present study after testing different flow rates optimized the energy pumping cost by operating the process with 14 ml min for the hc and 20 ml min for the low lc found to be the optimal pumping flow rate at present state of art the minimal power density achievable by red is estimated to be around 2 5 w m 2 28 34 35 considering this as a simulated power density value the optimized energy output for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp is predicted using the formulas 1 2 and 4 operating with similar conditions with the not optimized red process will result in a similar membrane area table 3 and table 4 and pumping energy consumption table 6 the pumping energy being constant table 6 very low net energy is generated with the present conditions 7 982 25 kw h day1 and 7 376 6 kw h day1 for ataköy and ambarlı wwtps respectively however optimizing the red process will result in the generation of 39 911 25 kw h day1 and 36 883 kw h day1 net energy from the ataköy and ambarlı wwtp respectively the energy generated by the non optimized and optimized red process are shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively for a real plant increasing the number of membranes in the stack may slightly reduce the energy generated however the pumping cost may also be reduced as well as iems area since less end membranes will be required 3 5 energy coverage with red at ataköy and ambarlı wwtp ataköy and ambarlı wwtps consume a total of 159 084 kw h day 1 and 148 513 kw h day 1 energy respectively 14 and using the treated wastewater in an red unit can generate 7 982 25 kw h day 1 and 7 376 6 kw h day 1 net energy respectively this represents 5 02 of the daily energy consumed in ataköy wwtp and 5 for ambarlı wwtp for the different wastewater treatment and plant maintenance the results of the red energy coverage of both plants are presented in table 8 however these results were achieved with a low power density around 0 5 w m 2 due to membrane properties red module and spacer geometry which contributed to a high resistance and a low power density rather than the process feed solutions properties at present state of art the average power density is estimated to be around 2 5 w m 2 and considering this as a simulated value the optimized energy output for ataköy and ambarlı wwtp is estimated to be around 39 911 25 kw h day 1 and 36 883 kw h day 1 respectively with such power output the energy generated by red will cover 25 1 and 25 of the ataköy and ambarlı energy needs respectively as shown in table 9 with the expectations of better and specific membranes for red in the future and high improvement of the red sgp harvesting this percentage will rise and may lead to the concept of zero energy wastewater treatment plant 3 6 reuse of the wastewaters the treated wastewater effluents from uf and mbr units are used in the watering of the gardens surrounding the treatment plant a slight increase of the wastewater salinity took place during the red process resulting in a conductivity close to 2000 μs cm this is a moderate salinity and can be tolerated when used in agriculture besides the solution presented a very low cod as a result of the mrb and uf processes which effectively removed the dissolved matters and most pollutants from the solution as reported by gómez coma et al effluent quality and energy consumption are the key parameters restraining wastewater reclamation 13 red coupled with wwtps can significantly reduce the need for fossil fuel consumption in the plant and can contribute to a more sustainable and environmental friendly process that generates energy for self operation the reclaimed water showed a high quality and can still be used after the red process 3 7 challenges and perspectives electrical energy harvesting by red is new under the developing process with a lot of challenges to overcome in order to be accepted in the energy market iems characteristics membranes costs suitable spacers and electrodes are the parameters of interest to make the process economically acceptable from the sensitivity analysis daniilidis et al reported that membrane related parameters i e pricing and performance and inflation are the most important factors in the implementation of red in real and large scale 34 the iec selectivity and membrane resistance are the most sensible red iem parameters which should be high for the first two and low for the last one the fabrication process and coating or modifications of iems should be the focus of new researches to adapt the membranes to the required red system to be commercially applicable and economically cost effective through the vulgarization of the red process many attempts to produce properly designed red membranes are still under investigation with major progresses in the improvement of membrane selectivity and resistance divalent ions in the sea and river water ideal candidates for real red implementation remain one of the major constraints of red performance due to both induced uphill transport and increased membrane resistance to mitigate those divalent ion effects novel and tailor made membranes are being investigated 37 to improve the electrochemical properties of the iems among which high permselectivity and low resistance many attempts have been made such as organic inorganic nanocomposite membranes from polyphenylene oxide ppo 38 halogenated polyethers such as polyepichlorohydrin pech 39 sulfonated polyethersulfone spes cation cem 40 these attempts aimed to improve the power density and the lcoe of red membrane modification to improve its properties and reduce its vulnerability to fouling have been performed with success as an example study of güler et al who successfully coated a standard commercial aem and improved the membrane antifouling properties and monovalent ion selectivity 19 another perspective is to produce a membrane with a relatively thin thickness to reduce membrane resistance and spacer less membrane carrying straight ridges named profiled membrane and fabricated to eliminate the use of non conductive spacers in red stack 41 42 the preparation of ultrathin approximately 500 nm thickness and ion selective janus membranes will allow a low fluidic resistance and rapid mass transport which will improve the conversion of the sgp 43 and the need for understanding nanofluidics and nanoconfinement therefore ionic transport in confined nano environment will open a new way in membrane design and application in sgp production 44 the current state of technology results to high lcoe in red compared to other currently available energy technologies but the projection with the improvement of the power density 2 7 w m2 and membrane price less than 4 m2 in near future can make red competitive in term of electricity production compared to conventional and established renewable technologies with a projected lower lcoe index of 0 16 kw h 34 a low cost and easy to produce tailor made iems suitable for red with low resistance high permselectivity high iec resistant to fouling chemically and mechanically stable will win the race to a low lcoe red process that can be competitive in the energy market hybrid red processes which includes the combination of desalination processes such as ro and md as high saline sources and wastewaters for both concentrated and diluted solution sources are new prospections for a tendency to zero waste management systems with energy extractions and resources recovery the costs of iems are still high today these costs are expected to decrease with the increase of iems use and the vulgarization of the red process on another hand it is likely that there is a decrease in the intensity of the power with the increasing number of membranes in the red stack the energy values depicted in tables 3 and 4 were calculated taking into account the results obtained in the laboratory experiments it is recommended to carry out a pilot scale study on the change of power density with increasing cell pairs in the red stack after laboratory work to enlighten and project real energy obtainable from the wastewater treatment plants 4 conclusion with the rise of climate change a clean environment and the need for alternative energy sources to keep our economy boosted became an obligation renewable energy has been considered with success as alternative energy to fossil in the same scope sgp is now being investigated as another key factor to cover energy demand red has been investigated with synthetic solutions but very few researches outline the use of natural feeds such as sea and wastewaters the present study pointed out a good combination of wwtp and red for energy generation from the mixing of treated wastewater effluent and the marmara sea in order to cover part of the energy demand in the wwtp although about 5 of the energy demand has been covered by our study considering state of art red conditions over 25 of the energy demand can be covered by the red process in the wwtp a study considering the best iems available and optimal operating conditions in a pilot scale red stack with a high number of pair cells is needed to improve our understanding of how red can contribute to reducing energy demand in the wwtps such as ataköy and ambarlı which discharge high quality treated effluent into the sea in addition using the brines from a nearby desalination plant as a concentrated solution would tremendously increase the power output declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

13766,gravity driven membrane gdm systems are promising for decentralized drinking water treatment at the point of use due to their treatment efficiency and low maintenance requirements to further improve permeate quality in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc adsorption onto activated carbon has been proposed as a pretreatment in the present study a novel gdm system with integrated granular activated carbon gac was tested the performances of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf ultrafiltration membranes 0 45 m² in combination with two different gac were compared the pvdf modules achieved a mean flux between 4 3 and 5 1 l m² h at 32 5 mbar flux stabilization in gac gdm systems was observed during long term experiments over 272 days ph increase caused by one gac after start up had a severe adverse effect on the flux due to caco3 precipitation resulting in a 34 lower stable flux compared to the other gac gdm system permeate quality was substantially improved in terms of doc and uva254 the organic micropollutants carbamazepine and formylaminoantipyrine were effectively removed in both gac gdm systems by at least 88 and 92 respectively the gdm systems effectively retained enterococcus faecalis and particles 1 200 μm by 5 1 and 1 6 log units respectively overall a gdm system combined with gac revealed the best performance producing approx 50 l d purified water the gac gdm systems were operated without any maintenance measures and improved the permeate quality substantially thus application of the studied gac gdm systems is a suitable option for decentralized drinking water treatment keywords gravity driven membrane decentralized drinking water treatment granular activated carbon organic micropollutant removal 1 introduction point of use pou systems for decentralized water treatment are a suitable solution to provide safe drinking water treatment on a household level especially where piped water supply does not exist or tap water does not meet drinking water standards 1 2 the application of membranes in this context is attractive owing to their efficiency in pathogen removal and their compact footprint however maintenance and electricity dependence limit their applicability 1 gravity driven membrane gdm filtration is a promising technology employing ultrafiltration uf membranes operated in dead end mode at a gravitational pressure typically between 40 and 70 mbar without any back flushing or chemical cleaning 3 5 previous studies evaluating the performance for potable water treatment have shown that gdm systems effectively remove pathogens colloids and particulate matter 3 6 during long term operation flux stabilization was observed allowing operation without maintenance measures 7 hence gdm systems have the advantage of low maintenance and off grid operation and are therefore suitable for a wider application in decentralized drinking water treatment compared to conventional membrane systems to further improve the permeate quality in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc and thereby lowering the risk of microbial recontamination after membrane treatment 8 adsorption onto activated carbon has been proposed as a pretreatment 9 10 adsorption onto activated carbon is known to remove doc 11 and organic micropollutants omp 12 14 previous studies investigating gdm systems in combination with upstream activated carbon adsorption described superior removal of doc 4 15 16 and bisphenol a microcystin lr and atrazine 10 from surface or rainwater compared to control systems without adsorption step furthermore pretreatment with granular activated carbon gac showed the potential to improve the flux of gdm systems by foulant and nutrient reduction resulting in a lower resistance of the fouling layer 4 15 this study investigated the performance of the prototype of a novel ready to use gdm system for decentralized drinking water treatment at the pou it was designed to be compact and easy to handle to be as user friendly as possible integration of gac into the gdm system aimed to improve the permeate quality with respect to organic background matter and organic micropollutants while maintaining the simplicity and compact footprint of the gdm system the performances of a uf polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane in combination with two different commercially available gac epibon a and hydraffin cc were compared in short and long term experiments using tap water spiked with omp and bacteria indicator organism enterococcus faecalis the anti epileptic drug carbamazepine cbz and the human biotransformation product of metamizole formylaminoantipyrine faa were selected to represent compounds with high and medium adsorptive removal by activated carbon respectively 17 18 the present study

ultrafiltration membranes 150 kda molecular weight cut off 30 nm nominal and 50 nm maximum pore size according to the manufacturer on a polyethylene terephthalate pet supporting layer which are welded onto one spacer frame the spaces between the panels 6 mm were entirely filled with gac resulting in a thin vertical gac layer prior to operation the pvdf membranes were activated by immersing the modules in a 4 g l sodium hypochlorite commercial hygienic cleaner solution for 1 d in the present study two commercial gac with differing characteristics epibon a and hydraffin cc donau carbon

as feed water a suspension of a non pathogenic enterococcus e faecalis strain based on symbioflor 1 symbiopharm germany was added as surrogate for fecal contamination the feed water contained between 1 9 106 and 6 5 107 colony forming units cfu of e faecalis per 100 ml at the time of sampling 2 3 experimental setup and approach the gdm system was submerged in a 10 8 l reactor tank as shown in fig 1 the feed water was continuously mixed in a 1 m³ feed tank and supplied to the reactor tank by a peristaltic pump the hydrostatic pressure driving the membrane filtration was kept constant at 32 5 mbar relative to the permeate outlet by adjusting the height of the overflow the feed flow rate was permanently equal or above the permeate flow rate overflowing feed water was manually returned from the overflow tank 210 l to the feed tank since the reactor tank was not mixed an exclusively downward directed flow was assumed consequently a possible shortcut due to overflowing feed would neither affect the applied gac nor the feed water quality permeate flowed through a plug system of connecting tubes to the permeate outlet valve of the reactor tank which was kept open at all times during experiments all gdm systems were operated continuously and in dead end mode without any back flushing or chemical cleaning short term experiments with four gdm systems pvdf 1 to 4 aimed to evaluate

respectively flux development particle retention as well as omp doc and uva254 removal were monitored to assess the effect of gac on the gdm system performance an additional gdm system without gac was operated in parallel as a reference pvdf control moreover membrane surface analyses of virgin and used membranes were carried out to gain insight into membrane surface alteration as well as foulants

results and discussion 3 1 membrane performance 3 1 1 flux stabilization over the 9 month operation period the membrane flux profiles roughly show a two stage pattern fig 2 in the first days of operation a rapid increase of flux occurred followed by flux stabilization after approx 40 days in case of ep pvdf and approx 2 weeks for hy pvdf and pvdf control flux stabilization during gdm operation as observed in this study has been reported by several authors for different feed water qualities 3 5 6 21 26 stable flux indicates an equilibrium between flux reducing and flux increasing processes in the membrane fouling layer 27 thereby biologically induced structural changes of the fouling layer balance deposition of retained substances e g microorganisms colloidal matter and irremovable fouling 7 27 the resulting heterogeneous fouling layer enables long term gdm system operation without any backwashing and chemical cleaning the average stable fluxes of ep pvdf hy pvdf and pvdf control are 5 0 l m² h 3 3 l m² h and 4 6 l m² h respectively corresponding to previous observations of gdm systems operated with rainwater 24 surface water 22 23 25 or seawater 21 without pretreatment as well as a system operated with rainwater with pretreatment by gac 16 a continuously high flux is crucial for the applicability of a pou system as it determines its daily water production the studied gdm systems achieved a daily water purification of approx 50 l which complies with the estimated water demand of 8 32 l day for a family of four 1 3 1 2 impact of gac based on the time dependent flux profiles of long term experiments fig 2 two observations were made firstly in contrast to previously studied gdm systems references as in excel datei flux rapidly increases during first days of operation instead of dropping due to pore blocking and biofilm formation wu et al 2016 secondly hy pvdf reveals both an initial flux 50 below the other long term operated gdm systems and a lower stable flux by approx 30 compared to ep pvdf and pvdf control this observation was supported by overall flux data comparison of short and long term experiments shown in fig 3 the mean flux of the gdm systems without integrated gac varied between 4 3 and 5 7 l m² h fig 3 no substantial changes in flux were observed for integrated epibon a with a mean flux of 4 9 l m² h whereas integration of hydraffin cc resulted in a considerably lower mean flux of 3 3 l m² h supporting tests revealed an alkaline effect of both applied gac when placed into tap water with the same water to gac ratio as in the reactor tanks upon startup hydraffin cc and epibon a induced a ph increase from neutral ph to above 10 and 9 respectively gac is known to cause a ph increase however the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood activated carbon structures attracting protons such as delocalized π electrons of graphene or pyrone like groups are discussed to be responsible 28 29 furthermore inorganic impurities may contribute to gac basicity e g by ca oh 2 formation from cao and subsequent dissociation 30 other processes enhancing ph increase may be anion exchange behavior of gac by removing an anion from the solution and replacing it with oh the alkalinity phenomenon was observed in various water treatment processes employing miscellaneous activated carbons including carbon produced from coconut raw material like hydraffin cc 31 the ph close to the pka 2 value of carbonate pka 2 10 33 presumably led to caco3 precipitation from the comparably hard berlin tap water hardness 181 mg caco3 l 32 on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores like fouling scaling reduces the permeate flow and increases the pressure drop across the membrane owing to the dense and adherent characteristics of caco3 precipitates 33 a more pronounced ph spike and the sustained adverse effect of hydraffin cc on membrane permeability implies stronger basicity of this gac however it should be noted that more hydraffin cc could be filled into the module due to its lower bulk density table 1 since common measures against gac associated ph increase such as acid addition backwashing of the system for extended durations or recirculation of water until the ph rise is diminished 34 is not feasible for the studied gdm system application of ph neutral gac or pretreatment e g washing the gac until ph is neutral before integration into the gdm system of gac is advised to prevent negative effects on the flux overall gac integration in gdm systems resulted in lower fluxes for hy pvdf and in equal fluxes for ep pvdf compared to the reference this finding is in accordance with previous studies reporting identical 9 and decreased stabilized permeate flux 16 of gdm systems with pretreatment by gac compared to control systems however the lower flux levels achieved with hydraffin cc in this study are more likely to be caused by caco3 precipitation than a more adhere membrane foulant layer as previously reported contradicting results were obtained in a comparable system applying gac as a pretreatment for a gdm which improved river water fluxes by 200 230 by tang et al 4 15 the differing effects of gac on gdm flux may be attributed to different doc compositions in the feed water since biodegradable doc is responsible for microbial growth in the fouling layer 4 berlin tap water contains non biodegradable doc with humic substances being the most abundant doc fraction and very low contents of easily biodegradable low molecular weight compounds fig 5 peter varbanets et al 3 identified biopolymers to be responsible for the rise of fouling layer resistance in a gdm system however the feed water employed in the present study did not contain biopolymers fig 5 and doc completely passes the membrane fig s2 consequently the reduction of non biodegradable doc by adsorption onto gac may not positively influence the fouling layer and thus the flux 3 2 removal of background organics and micropollutants 3 2 1 doc and uva254 removal bevor discussing the removal of organics by the studied gdm system it is important to note that in contrast to conventional fixed bed adsorbers an unknown flow regime prevails in the investigated gac gdm system due to the vertically integrated gac fig 1 hence the contact time between feed water and gac is unknown and feed water may almost completely bypass the integrated gac both gac gdm systems demonstrate very similar removal performance of doc and uva254 resembling typical breakthrough curves of fixed bed gac adsorbers fig 4 relative doc concentrations increased quickly but did not stabilize throughout the operation time reaching 17 and 37 at specific throughputs of 20 7 l ggac and 11 5 l ggac for ep pvdf and hy pvdf respectively uv254 bulk organic compounds were initially removed by approx 10 but increased quickly and finally flattened out at approx 40 abatement for ep pvdf and 50 for hy pvdf lc ocd chromatograms of ep pvdf and hy pvdf permeate samples after similar specific throughputs indicate a very similar adsorptive removal of doc fractions fig 5 since the breakthrough curves of both ep pvdf and hy pvdf did not stabilize within 272 days the adsorption capacities of both gac for doc were not fully exploited the theoretical ebct of the gac gdm systems were calculated based on the averaged stable flux and integrated gac mass table 1 accordingly the ebct of ep pvdf and hy pvdf were 13 min and 23 min respectively which is in the range of typical ebct of fixed bed gac adsorbers 35 observed doc and uva254 breakthrough were congruent with results from sperlich et al 36 in a gac pilot plant operated with the same regional drinking water and an ebct of 15 min the matching breakthrough curves and similar theoretical ebct of the studied system and sperlich et al 36 lead to the assumption that the investigated gac gdm system performs similar to a gac fixed bed adsorber regarding doc and uva254 elimination comparing doc and uva254 removals fig s3 a preferential removal of uv254 active compounds is revealed this was confirmed by improved removal of humic substances fig 5 which commonly contain aromatic structures absorbing uv254 light preferential uva254 removal may be supported by preferred adsorption of uv254 active compounds onto epibon a and hydraffin cc and biological transformation to less uv254 absorbing compounds the improved uva254 removal is reflected in a drop of the doc uva254 removal ratio from initially 1 0 to 0 4 and 0 7 after 272 days for ep pvdf and hy pvdf respectively supporting both hypotheses hydraffin cc appears to have slightly weaker selectivity towards uv254 absorbing compounds fig s3 this finding is consistent with results reported by aschermann et al 37 where hydraffin cc demonstrated lower adsorption of humic substances compared to epibon a due to its comparatively smaller amount of meso and macropores large organic compounds may therefore not be able to access the inner surface of hydraffin cc 3 2 2 omp removal activated carbon has been reported to achieve high adsorptive removal of cbz log d 2 28 at ph 7 4 m 2363 g mol 18 38 and medium adsorptive removal of faa log d 0 25 at ph 7 4 m 231 3 g mol 39 40 relative concentrations of cbz in ep pvdf permeate of initially 1 increased almost linearly throughout the experiment up to 11 after 272 days fig 6 hy pvdf achieved higher cbz removals throughout the operation time cbz concentrations detected in the beginning were nearly all below the loq until 2 2 l ggac or 52 days and subsequently increased to a relative cbz concentration of 3 relative faa concentrations in ep pvdf permeate incremented from initially 1 to 7 at a specific throughput of 4 5 l ggac day 69 and thereafter fluctuated between 8 and 3 relative faa concentrations in hy pvdf permeate were below 3 throughout the entire operation time fluctuating relative concentrations of faa in ep pvdf permeate may be attributed to changes in the membrane permeability forcing the feed water to pass through presumably less loaded lower gac layers however stable flux throughout the experiment and the linear increase of relative cbz concentrations disprove this hypothesis fig s4 shows 15 46 faa removal in the pvdf reference system from operation day 37 on indicating a biological transformation of faa in contrast persistent cbz experiences virtually no removal in the reference module biological activity is expected to enhance in gac gdm systems due to the additional large surface area for biofilm growth biological degradation is likely responsible for improved removal of faa compared to pure adsorption this is in line with previous findings reporting biological degradation of faa in gac fixed bed filters after approx 80 days 40 superior removal of both omp in hy pvdf may be attributed to the longer residence time overall both ep pvdf and hy pvdf exhibited high removals of the investigated omp with at least 88 and 95 retention of cbz and 92 and 97 removal of faa respectively throughout the 9 month operation period observed doc uva254 and omp removals were similar to those of typical fixed bed gac adsorbers consequently feed bypassing the gac is considered negligible further studies are required to investigate gac loadings at different heights and the prevailing flow regime within the gac gdm systems 3 2 3 correlation between uva254 and omp removals previous studies reported a correlation between uva254 reduction and omp removal in fixed bed gac adsorbers 41 42 fig s5 depicts the relation between omp and uva254 removals in the studied gac gdm systems ep pvdf reveals a retention of both omp by more than 95 and 88 for uva254 removal above 80 and 40 respectively hy pvdf retained both omp by more than 96 for a reduction of uv254 active compounds above 40 consequently uva254 abatement appears to be a suitable surrogate parameter for omp retention in the examined gac gdm system facilitating comparatively fast and cheap control 3 3 bacteria and particle retention in this study bacteria retention by two gdm systems pvdf 3 and pvdf 4 without gac was assessed using the fecal indicator organism e faecalis as shown in fig s6 feed e faecalis concentrations varied between 1 9 106 and 1 9 106 cfu 100 ml in pvdf 3 and pvdf 4 permeate e faecalis concentration ranged from 23 to 524 cfu 100 ml and 1 2 000 cfu 100 ml respectively mean log removals were 5 5 and 4 7 for pvdf 3 and pvdf 4 respectively the achieved e faecalis removals by the studied gdm systems were between baseline removal log removal value lrv 3 and maximum expected removal lrv 6 in household based uf drinking water technologies according to the who 43 however a considerably higher mean log removal of 6 9 was previously reported for a pou system based on uf filtration 44 direct counting of particles between 1 and 200 μm shown in fig 7 demonstrate consistent particle contents in feed 1800 8800 counts ml and permeate 31 720 counts ml samples of the gac gdm systems and the pvdf control observed log removals were 1 7 1 6 and 1 5 for the pvdf control ep pvdf and hy pvdf respectively ultrapure water was measured as a reference and exhibited a much lower particle content compared to all permeate samples with a mean of 20 counts ml particles were substantially removed by the studied gdm system fig 7 consistent retentions of total particles in the pvdf control ep pvdf and hy pvdf indicate that the gac filling had no impact on total particle removal however relative particle size distribution depicted in fig s7 reveals a slight preferential removal of particles between 2 and 5 μm compared to pvdf control which suggests a beneficial effect of gac on the retention of small particles previous studies reported higher log removals of particles by uf membranes with 2 9 lrv of particles between 2 and 750 μm 45 and 2 6 lrv of particles between 1 and 120 μm 46 since testing an improved gdm system with modified tubing pvdf 4 had no positive effect on the removal of e faecalis the module tubing was excluded as a potential leakage for permeate contamination fig s6 particles and e faecalis may be able to pass the membrane due to impairment of the membrane structure sem images of the welding joint between the flat sheet pvdf membrane with the module spacer frame exhibit clearly visible structure of the fibrous pet supporting layer fig s8 moreover macropores in the range of various micrometers were detected hence the welding process appears to negatively affect the membrane integrity and has to be improved similar observations were made by urase et al 47 48 who concluded that abnormally large pores originating from manufacturing or handling of the membrane cause increased pathogen concentration in membrane permeate 3 4 membrane foulants analyses sem images of the virgin pvdf membrane surface shown in fig 8 a and c demonstrate homogenous pore distribution in the range of the nominal pore size given by the manufacturer 2 1 after 272 days of operation accumulation of fouling substances on the membrane surface hy pvdf is observed and pores are no longer visible fig 8b a thin fouling layer partially covering the membrane alongside gac remains were observed with the stereomicroscope fig s9 the used membrane is heterogeneously covered with precipitates figs 8d s10 and s11 no impairment of the used membrane surface was observed thus gac does not appear to damage the membrane in the studied gdm system the edx spectrum of the clean membrane exhibits distinct carbon and fluorine peaks whereby the latter is the dominant one fig 8 right as expected both used membranes show a less pronounced fluorine peak fluorine is along with carbon and hydrogen the main component of the pvdf membrane and thus indicates the degree of membrane coverage besides oxygen silicon calcium and iron were detected in used membrane spectra the calcium peak is substantially higher in case of the hy pvdf membrane the gold peak observed in all spectra is caused by the coating necessary for sem analyses and is therefore not considered the spatial distribution of oxygen calcium fluorine carbon silicon and iron on the membrane surface of hy pvdf was determined by edx mapping as provided in fig s10 precipitation of inorganic constituents of the feed water is commonly observed in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis due to the rejection of inorganic ions by the membranes resulting in concentration polarization and consequently precipitation of scale forming species 33 in the present study precipitation was caused by the ph rise induced by the gac edx spectra and mappings revealed calcium oxygen and carbon accumulation as observed in tzotzi et al 33 in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes indicating the presence of caco3 the higher detected calcium peak in case of hy pvdf fig 8 right is presumably owing stronger basic properties of the employed gac 4 conclusion the flux development removal of background organics and omp as well as bacteria and particle retention of a novel gdm system packed with gac was investigated in short and long term experiments the impact of two different gac hydraffin cc and epibon a on the gdm performance was compared conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 over the 9 month operation period flux stabilization was observed after approx 40 days average stable flux levels of 5 0 l m² h 3 3 l m² h and 3 6 l m² h were achieved for ep pvdf hy pvdf and the control respectively 2 both the atypical initial flux increase of the gac gdm systems and the 54 lower initial and 34 lower average stable flux of hy pvdf compared to ep pvdf were attributed to caco3 precipitation caused by a gac induced ph rise accordingly heterogeneous coverage of the membrane surface by mainly caco3 precipitates were found by electron microscopic analyses 3 permeate quality was substantially improved in terms of doc and uva254 the removal performance resembled typical breakthrough in fixed bed gac adsorbers 4 cbz and faa were removed effectively in both gac gdm systems by at least 88 and 92 respectively improved faa elimination despite lower adsorbability compared to cbz was attributed to biodegradation uva254 abatement appears to be a suitable control parameter for omp removal in the studied gac gdm system 5 the gdm system effectively retains bacteria and particles by 5 1 and 1 6 lrv respectively overall the gdm system combined with epibon a was identified as the favorable option due to the higher flux producing approx 50 l d purified water the gac gdm system was operated on a long term basis without any maintenance measures complying with the water need of a family of four furthermore the gdm system under investigation meets the performance requirements of highly protective household drinking water treatment options regarding bacteria removal according to the who 43 and is therefore

typically between 40 and 70 mbar without any back flushing or chemical cleaning 3 5 previous studies evaluating the performance for potable water treatment have shown that gdm systems effectively remove pathogens colloids and particulate matter 3 6 during long term operation flux stabilization was observed allowing operation without maintenance measures 7 hence gdm systems have the advantage of low maintenance and off grid operation and are therefore suitable for a wider application in decentralized drinking water treatment compared to conventional membrane systems to further improve the permeate quality in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc and thereby lowering the risk of microbial recontamination after membrane treatment 8 adsorption onto activated carbon has been proposed as a pretreatment 9 10 adsorption onto activated carbon is known to remove doc 11 and organic micropollutants omp 12 14 previous studies investigating gdm systems in combination with upstream activated carbon adsorption described superior removal of doc 4 15 16 and bisphenol a microcystin lr and atrazine 10 from surface or rainwater compared to control systems without adsorption step furthermore pretreatment with granular activated carbon gac showed the potential to improve the flux of gdm systems by foulant and nutrient reduction resulting in a lower resistance of the fouling layer 4 15 this study investigated the performance of the prototype of a novel ready to use gdm system for decentralized drinking water treatment at the pou it was designed to be compact and easy to handle to be as user friendly as possible integration of gac into the gdm system aimed to improve the permeate quality with respect to organic background matter and organic micropollutants while maintaining the simplicity and compact footprint of the gdm system the performances of a uf polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane in combination with two different commercially available gac epibon a and hydraffin cc were compared in short and long term experiments using tap water spiked with omp and bacteria indicator organism enterococcus faecalis the anti epileptic drug carbamazepine cbz and the human biotransformation product of metamizole formylaminoantipyrine faa were selected to represent compounds with high and medium adsorptive removal by activated carbon respectively 17 18 the present study aimed to examine long term flux development in the gac gdm systems and evaluate the impact of gac on the gdm performance assess the long term removals of doc uv absorption at 254 nm uva254 and omp by the gac gdm systems and the applicability of uva254 removal as a control parameter for omp removal performances determine the particle and bacteria retention by the gdm system analyze surfaces

germany consists of five vertically aligned flat sheet membrane panels with a total membrane surface area of 0 45 m² photograph shown in fig s1 each panel is made of two asymmetric pvdf ultrafiltration membranes 150 kda molecular weight cut off 30 nm nominal and 50 nm maximum pore size according to the manufacturer on a polyethylene terephthalate pet supporting layer which are welded onto one spacer frame the spaces between the panels 6 mm were entirely filled with gac resulting in a thin vertical gac layer prior to operation the pvdf membranes were activated by immersing the modules in a 4 g l sodium hypochlorite commercial hygienic cleaner solution for 1 d in the present study two commercial gac with differing characteristics epibon a and hydraffin cc donau carbon

as feed water a suspension of a non pathogenic enterococcus e faecalis strain based on symbioflor 1 symbiopharm germany was added as surrogate for fecal contamination the feed water contained between 1 9 106 and 6 5 107 colony forming units cfu of e faecalis per 100 ml at the time of sampling 2 3 experimental setup and approach the gdm system was submerged in a 10 8 l reactor tank as shown in fig 1 the feed water was continuously mixed in a 1 m³ feed tank and supplied to the reactor tank by a peristaltic pump the hydrostatic pressure driving the membrane filtration was kept constant at 32 5 mbar relative to the permeate outlet by adjusting the height of the overflow the feed flow rate was permanently equal or above the permeate flow rate overflowing feed water was manually returned from the overflow tank 210 l to the feed tank since the reactor tank was not mixed an exclusively downward directed flow was assumed consequently a possible shortcut due to overflowing feed would neither affect the applied gac nor the feed water quality permeate flowed through a plug system of connecting tubes to the permeate outlet valve of the reactor tank which was kept open at all times during experiments all gdm systems were operated continuously and in dead end mode without any back flushing or chemical cleaning short term experiments with four gdm systems pvdf 1 to 4 aimed to evaluate gdm system performance without integrated gac in terms of flux and bacteria retention table 2 in long term experiments with gac gdm systems packed with epibon a ep pvdf and hydraffin cc hy pvdf respectively flux development particle retention as well as omp doc and uva254 removal were monitored to assess the effect of gac on the gdm system performance an additional gdm system without gac was operated in parallel as a reference pvdf control moreover membrane surface analyses of virgin and used membranes were carried out to gain insight into membrane surface alteration as well as foulants on the membrane surface after long term operation 2 4 microbiological analyses to quantify the retention of e faecalis feed and permeate samples were analyzed with plate counts compact dry etc medium

results and discussion 3 1 membrane performance 3 1 1 flux stabilization over the 9 month operation period the membrane flux profiles roughly show a two stage pattern fig 2 in the first days of operation a rapid increase of flux occurred followed by flux stabilization after approx 40 days in case of ep pvdf and approx 2 weeks for hy pvdf and pvdf control flux stabilization during gdm operation as observed in this study has been reported by several authors for different feed water qualities 3 5 6 21 26 stable flux indicates an equilibrium between flux reducing and flux increasing processes in the membrane fouling layer 27 thereby biologically induced structural changes of the fouling layer balance deposition of retained substances e g microorganisms colloidal matter and irremovable fouling 7 27 the resulting heterogeneous fouling layer enables long term gdm system operation without any backwashing and chemical cleaning the average stable fluxes of ep pvdf hy pvdf and pvdf control are 5 0 l m² h 3 3 l m² h and 4 6 l m² h respectively corresponding to previous observations of gdm systems operated with rainwater 24 surface water 22 23 25 or seawater 21 without pretreatment as well as a system operated with rainwater with pretreatment by gac 16 a continuously high flux is crucial for the applicability of a pou system as it determines its daily water production the studied gdm systems achieved a daily water purification of approx 50 l which complies with the estimated water demand of 8 32 l day for a family of four 1 3 1 2 impact of gac based on the time dependent flux profiles of long term experiments fig 2 two observations were made firstly in contrast to previously studied gdm systems references as in excel datei flux rapidly increases during first days of operation instead of dropping due to pore blocking and biofilm formation wu et al 2016 secondly hy pvdf reveals both an initial flux 50 below the other long term operated gdm systems and a lower stable flux by approx 30 compared to ep pvdf and pvdf control this observation was supported by overall flux data comparison of short and long term experiments shown in fig 3 the mean flux of the gdm systems without integrated gac varied between 4 3 and 5 7 l m² h fig 3 no substantial changes in flux were observed for integrated epibon a with a mean flux of 4 9 l m² h whereas integration of hydraffin cc resulted in a considerably lower mean flux of 3 3 l m² h supporting tests revealed an alkaline effect of both applied gac when placed into tap water with the same water to gac ratio as in the reactor tanks upon startup hydraffin cc and epibon a induced a ph increase from neutral ph to above 10 and 9 respectively gac is known to cause a ph increase however the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood activated carbon structures attracting protons such as delocalized π electrons of graphene or pyrone like groups are discussed to be responsible 28 29 furthermore inorganic impurities may contribute to gac basicity e g by ca oh 2 formation from cao and subsequent dissociation 30 other processes enhancing ph increase may be anion exchange behavior of gac by removing an anion from the solution and replacing it with oh the alkalinity phenomenon was observed in various water treatment processes employing miscellaneous activated carbons including carbon produced from coconut raw material like hydraffin cc 31 the ph close to the pka 2 value of carbonate pka 2 10 33 presumably led to caco3 precipitation from the comparably hard berlin tap water hardness 181 mg caco3 l 32 on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores like fouling scaling reduces the permeate flow and increases the pressure drop across the membrane owing to the dense and adherent characteristics of caco3 precipitates 33 a more pronounced ph spike and the sustained adverse effect of hydraffin cc on membrane permeability implies stronger basicity of this gac however it should be noted that more hydraffin cc could be filled into the module due to its lower bulk density table 1 since common measures against gac associated ph increase such as acid addition backwashing of the system for extended durations or recirculation of water until the ph rise is diminished 34 is not feasible for the studied gdm system application of ph neutral gac or pretreatment e g washing the gac until ph is neutral before integration into the gdm system of gac is advised to prevent negative effects on the flux overall gac integration in gdm systems resulted in lower fluxes for hy pvdf and in equal fluxes for ep pvdf compared to the reference this finding is in accordance with previous studies reporting identical 9 and decreased stabilized permeate flux 16 of gdm systems with pretreatment by gac compared to control systems however the lower flux levels achieved with hydraffin cc in this study are more likely to be caused by caco3 precipitation than a more adhere membrane foulant layer as previously reported contradicting results were obtained in a comparable system applying gac as a pretreatment for a gdm which improved river water fluxes by 200 230 by tang et al 4 15 the differing effects of gac on gdm flux may be attributed to different doc compositions in the feed water since biodegradable doc is responsible for microbial growth in the fouling layer 4 berlin tap water contains non biodegradable doc with humic substances being the most abundant doc fraction and very low contents of easily biodegradable low molecular weight compounds fig 5 peter varbanets et al 3 identified biopolymers to be responsible for the rise of fouling layer resistance in a gdm system however the feed water employed in the present study did not contain biopolymers fig 5 and doc completely passes the membrane fig s2 consequently the reduction of non biodegradable doc by adsorption onto gac may not positively influence the fouling layer and thus the flux 3 2 removal of background organics and micropollutants 3 2 1 doc and uva254 removal bevor discussing the removal of organics by the studied gdm system it is important to note that in contrast to conventional fixed bed adsorbers an unknown flow regime prevails in the investigated gac gdm system due to the vertically integrated gac fig 1 hence the contact time between feed water and gac is unknown and feed water may almost completely bypass the integrated gac both gac gdm systems demonstrate very similar removal performance of doc and uva254 resembling typical breakthrough curves of fixed bed gac adsorbers fig 4 relative doc concentrations increased quickly but did not stabilize throughout the operation time reaching 17 and 37 at specific throughputs of 20 7 l ggac and 11 5 l ggac for ep pvdf and hy pvdf respectively uv254 bulk organic compounds were initially removed by approx 10 but increased quickly and finally flattened out at approx 40 abatement for ep pvdf and 50 for hy pvdf lc ocd chromatograms of ep pvdf and hy pvdf permeate samples after similar specific throughputs indicate a very similar adsorptive removal of doc fractions fig 5 since the breakthrough curves of both ep pvdf and hy pvdf did not stabilize within 272 days the adsorption capacities of both gac for doc were not fully exploited the theoretical ebct of the gac gdm systems were calculated based on the averaged stable flux and integrated gac mass table 1 accordingly the ebct of ep pvdf and hy pvdf were 13 min and 23 min respectively which is in the range of typical ebct of fixed bed gac adsorbers 35 observed doc and uva254 breakthrough were congruent with results from sperlich et al 36 in a gac pilot plant operated with the same regional drinking water and an ebct of 15 min the matching breakthrough curves and similar theoretical ebct of the studied system and sperlich et al 36 lead to the assumption that the investigated gac gdm system performs similar to a gac fixed bed adsorber regarding doc and uva254 elimination comparing doc and uva254 removals fig s3 a preferential removal of uv254 active compounds is revealed this was confirmed by improved removal of humic substances fig 5 which commonly contain aromatic structures absorbing uv254 light preferential uva254 removal may be supported by preferred adsorption of uv254 active compounds onto epibon a and hydraffin cc and biological transformation to less uv254 absorbing compounds the improved uva254 removal is reflected in a drop of the doc uva254 removal ratio from initially 1 0 to 0 4 and 0 7 after 272 days for ep pvdf and hy pvdf respectively supporting both hypotheses hydraffin cc appears to have slightly weaker selectivity towards uv254 absorbing compounds fig s3 this finding is consistent with results reported by aschermann et al 37 where hydraffin cc demonstrated lower adsorption of humic substances compared to epibon a due to its comparatively smaller amount of meso and macropores large organic compounds may therefore not be able to access the inner surface of hydraffin cc 3 2 2 omp removal activated carbon has been reported to achieve high adsorptive removal of cbz log d 2 28 at ph 7 4 m 2363 g mol 18 38 and medium adsorptive removal of faa log d 0 25 at ph 7 4 m 231 3 g mol 39 40 relative concentrations of cbz in ep pvdf permeate of initially 1 increased almost linearly throughout the experiment up to 11 after 272 days fig 6 hy pvdf achieved higher cbz removals throughout the operation time cbz concentrations detected in the beginning were nearly all below the loq until 2 2 l ggac or 52 days and subsequently increased to a relative cbz concentration of 3 relative faa concentrations in ep pvdf permeate incremented from initially 1 to 7 at a specific throughput of 4 5 l ggac day 69 and thereafter fluctuated between 8 and 3 relative faa concentrations in hy pvdf permeate were below 3 throughout the entire operation time fluctuating relative concentrations of faa in ep pvdf permeate may be attributed to changes in the membrane permeability forcing the feed water to pass through presumably less loaded lower gac layers however stable flux throughout the experiment and the linear increase of relative cbz concentrations disprove this hypothesis fig s4 shows 15 46 faa removal in the pvdf reference system from operation day 37 on indicating a biological transformation of faa in contrast persistent cbz experiences virtually no removal in the reference module biological activity is expected to enhance in gac gdm systems due to the additional large surface area for biofilm growth biological degradation is likely responsible for improved removal of faa compared to pure adsorption this is in line with previous findings reporting biological degradation of faa in gac fixed bed filters after approx 80 days 40 superior removal of both omp in hy pvdf may be attributed to the longer residence time overall both ep pvdf and hy pvdf exhibited high removals of the investigated omp with at least 88 and 95 retention of cbz and 92 and 97 removal of faa respectively throughout the 9 month operation period observed doc uva254 and omp removals were similar to those of typical fixed bed gac adsorbers consequently feed bypassing the gac is considered negligible further studies are required to investigate gac loadings at different heights and the prevailing flow regime within the gac gdm systems 3 2 3 correlation between uva254 and omp removals previous studies reported a correlation between uva254 reduction and omp removal in fixed bed gac adsorbers 41 42 fig s5 depicts the relation between omp and uva254 removals in the studied gac gdm systems ep pvdf reveals a retention of both omp by more than 95 and 88 for uva254 removal above 80 and 40 respectively hy pvdf retained both omp by more than 96 for a reduction of uv254 active compounds above 40 consequently uva254 abatement appears to be a suitable surrogate parameter for omp retention in the examined gac gdm system facilitating comparatively fast and cheap control 3 3 bacteria and particle retention in this study bacteria retention by two gdm systems pvdf 3 and pvdf 4 without gac was assessed using the fecal indicator organism e faecalis as shown in fig s6 feed e faecalis concentrations varied between 1 9 106 and 1 9 106 cfu 100 ml in pvdf 3 and pvdf 4 permeate e faecalis concentration ranged from 23 to 524 cfu 100 ml and 1 2 000 cfu 100 ml respectively mean log removals were 5 5 and 4 7 for pvdf 3 and pvdf 4 respectively the achieved e faecalis removals by the studied gdm systems were between baseline removal log removal value lrv 3 and maximum expected removal lrv 6 in household based uf drinking water technologies according to the who 43 however a considerably higher mean log removal of 6 9 was previously reported for a pou system based on uf filtration 44 direct counting of particles between 1 and 200 μm shown in fig 7 demonstrate consistent particle contents in feed 1800 8800 counts ml and permeate 31 720 counts ml samples of the gac gdm systems and the pvdf control observed log removals were 1 7 1 6 and 1 5 for the pvdf control ep pvdf and hy pvdf respectively ultrapure water was measured as a reference and exhibited a much lower particle content compared to all permeate samples with a mean of 20 counts ml particles were substantially removed by the studied gdm system fig 7 consistent retentions of total particles in the pvdf control ep pvdf and hy pvdf indicate that the gac filling had no impact on total particle removal however relative particle size distribution depicted in fig s7 reveals a slight preferential removal of particles between 2 and 5 μm compared to pvdf control which suggests a beneficial effect of gac on the retention of small particles previous studies reported higher log removals of particles by uf membranes with 2 9 lrv of particles between 2 and 750 μm 45 and 2 6 lrv of particles between 1 and 120 μm 46 since testing an improved gdm system with modified tubing pvdf 4 had no positive effect on the removal of e faecalis the module tubing was excluded as a potential leakage for permeate contamination fig s6 particles and e faecalis may be able to pass the membrane due to impairment of the membrane structure sem images of the welding joint between the flat sheet pvdf membrane with the module spacer frame exhibit clearly visible structure of the fibrous pet supporting layer fig s8 moreover macropores in the range of various micrometers were detected hence the welding process appears to negatively affect the membrane integrity and has to be improved similar observations were made by urase et al 47 48 who concluded that abnormally large pores originating from manufacturing or handling of the membrane cause increased pathogen concentration in membrane permeate 3 4 membrane foulants analyses sem images of the virgin pvdf membrane surface shown in fig 8 a and c demonstrate homogenous pore distribution in the range of the nominal pore size given by the manufacturer 2 1 after 272 days of operation accumulation of fouling substances on the membrane surface hy pvdf is observed and pores are no longer visible fig 8b a thin fouling layer partially covering the membrane alongside gac remains were observed with the stereomicroscope fig s9 the used membrane is heterogeneously covered with precipitates figs 8d s10 and s11 no impairment of the used membrane surface was observed thus gac does not appear to damage the membrane in the studied gdm system the edx spectrum of the clean membrane exhibits distinct carbon and fluorine peaks whereby the latter is the dominant one fig 8 right as expected both used membranes show a less pronounced fluorine peak fluorine is along with carbon and hydrogen the main component of the pvdf membrane and thus indicates the degree of membrane coverage besides oxygen silicon calcium and iron were detected in used membrane spectra the calcium peak is substantially higher in case of the hy pvdf membrane the gold peak observed in all spectra is caused by the coating necessary for sem analyses and is therefore not considered the spatial distribution of oxygen calcium fluorine carbon silicon and iron on the membrane surface of hy pvdf was determined by edx mapping as provided in fig s10 precipitation of inorganic constituents of the feed water is commonly observed in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis due to the rejection of inorganic ions by the membranes resulting in concentration polarization and consequently precipitation of scale forming species 33 in the present study precipitation was caused by the ph rise induced by the gac edx spectra and mappings revealed calcium oxygen and carbon accumulation as observed in tzotzi et al 33 in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes indicating the presence of caco3 the higher detected calcium peak in case of hy pvdf fig 8 right is presumably owing stronger basic properties of the employed gac 4 conclusion the flux development removal of background organics and omp as well as bacteria and particle retention of a novel gdm system packed with gac was investigated in short and long term experiments the impact of two different gac hydraffin cc and epibon a on the gdm performance was compared conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 over the 9 month operation period flux stabilization was observed after approx 40 days average stable flux levels of 5 0 l m² h 3 3 l m² h and 3 6 l m² h were achieved for ep pvdf hy pvdf and the control respectively 2 both the atypical initial flux increase of the gac gdm systems and the 54 lower initial and 34 lower average stable flux of hy pvdf compared to ep pvdf were attributed to caco3 precipitation caused by a gac induced ph rise accordingly heterogeneous coverage of the membrane surface by mainly caco3 precipitates were found by electron microscopic analyses 3 permeate quality was substantially improved in terms of doc and uva254 the removal performance resembled typical breakthrough in fixed bed gac adsorbers 4 cbz and faa were removed effectively in both gac gdm systems by at least 88 and 92 respectively improved faa elimination despite lower adsorbability compared to cbz was attributed to biodegradation uva254 abatement appears to be a suitable control parameter for omp removal in the studied gac gdm system 5 the gdm system effectively retains bacteria and particles by 5 1 and 1 6 lrv respectively overall the gdm system combined with epibon a was identified as the favorable option due to the higher flux producing approx 50 l d purified water the gac gdm system was operated on a long term basis without any maintenance measures complying with the water need of a family of four furthermore the gdm system under investigation meets the performance requirements of highly protective household drinking water treatment options regarding bacteria removal according to the who 43 and is therefore

13767,research concerning the design and development of non leaching antibacterial agents for quick water decontamination is in great demand for their effective re use and minimizing biocide contamination in water herein we have synthesized two bactericidal polymers based on guanidine backbone henceforth called gn and sulphonium backbone henceforth called sp we explored their uniqueness in deriving polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf based blend membranes which are foul resistant and bactericidal besides the potential of these polycations in point of use applications was explored by coating them on porous ceramic supports the chemical structures of these polymers were investigated via fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the bactericidal action was tested against escherichia coli e coli atcc 25922 and staphylococcus aureus s aureus atcc 25923 based model strains the blend membranes showed more than a 3 log reduction of bacterial colonies for both the strains and 6 log reduction in the case of ceramic supports coated with gn and sp this was further corroborated with intracellular reactive oxygen species ros measurements the non leaching nature of these biocides was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes analysis the antifouling nature of blend membranes with gn and sp polymers was demonstrated using bovine serum albumin as model foulant further the unique polymers when coated on ceramic supports showed good dye adsorption for methyl orange as model dye pollutants owing to their electrostatic interactions with the dye keywords polycations pvdf membranes antibacterial antifouling point of use 1 introduction access to safe drinking water for all is one of the key challenges of the 21st century afflicting people globally nearly 1 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 2 6 billion have no access to sanitation 1 3 due to the consumption of contaminated water more than 3900 children die every day by water borne communicable diseases 4 6 the world health organization s estimate indicates that exposure to water borne diseases like diarrhea can be effectively reduced by 35 if basic water hygiene and sanitation are provided 7 9 various technologies like flocculation distillation adsorption air floatation etc are currently used to decontaminate water however due to the presence of microbes and other colloidal impurities these processes sometimes fail to meet stringent water standards 10 to remediate these two distinct strategies can be adopted a using point of use devices and b using membrane filtration processes point of use methods are effective in remediating bacterial contaminants and in this approach nanomaterial and or catalysts are introduced to bacterial contaminated water and processes such as photocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes 11 13 biocidal leeching of bleach 14 15 kill the pathogenic contaminants from water these systems are suitable in places that lack infrastructural facilities and electricity however this process has its demerits as well after the decontamination process the nanomaterial and or catalysts have to be filtered from the water using suitable methods before it can be used for consumption 11 further chlorination or bleaching can alter taste and odor of water has low disinfection capabilities in turbid water and can potentially generate by products that can have implications for the environment 16 a point of use strategy with effective decontamination while easy post extraction is hence desirable membrane based separation on the other hand is a versatile technique which can remove a wide spectrum of contaminants like colloidal impurities pathogenic bacteria algae fungi etc and even viruses and ions by acting as molecular sieves 17 18 by tuning the pore size and its distribution different target contaminants can be removed from the water microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes in particular are effective in remediating colloidal impurities as well as bacteria with the application of low differential pressures 9 among the potential membrane materials for mf and uf poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf is extensively used owing to its excellent chemical resistance thermal stability and mechanical strength 19 20 however the performance of these membranes is adversely affected due to membrane biofouling the bacterial contaminants filtered by these membranes first deposit on the surfaces of the membrane and eventually extract required nutrients from the water and start multiplying on the active surfaces of the membranes this leads to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation once these matured biofilms are formed they limit water molecule transport by rendering friction to permeating water molecules 21 higher differential pressure is required to overcome this friction which may lead to the failure of these membranes to limit bacterial growth on the membrane surfaces engineered biocides like silver 22 25 antibiotics 26 27 chlorine 3 etc are introduced on to the surfaces to kill these pathogens 22 28 30 however the continual depletion of the biocidal agent into the water with time results in the eventual loss of antibacterial activity of these membranes 31 33 hence it is imperative to develop antimicrobial agents that have better contact killing properties as opposed to leaching based properties the antimicrobial agent should also exhibit broad activity to bacteria i e should be equally effective towards both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains these may be then tethered or blended with pvdf or other membrane material to yield good fouling resistance in this context cationic polymers have shown promising results active biocidal groups like quaternary ammonium compounds qacs amines and phosphonium based moieties when introduced into long chain polymeric derivatives have shown to enhance bacterial reduction and mitigate biofouling 2 3 34 35 among amines guanidine derivatives are highly potent antimicrobials with effective bactericidal activity to both gram positive and gram negative strains it has been used in biomedical applications like therapeutics and catheter coatings 36 37 like guanidine derivatives sulphonium based polymers are also cationic have been used in anion exchange resins and odor improvement beads in water remediation 9 38 39 cationic polymers derived from guanidine and sulphonium derivatives can hence act as good antimicrobial agents within this framework herein we report guanidine and sulphonium based polycation biocidal agents and modified pvdf with these biocides for water remediation applications at neutral ph each moiety of gn and sp carries free amine and positively charged sulfur atom respectively these cationic polymers were synthesized via free radical polymerization using 4 vinyl benzyl chloride based precursors modified with guanidine hydrochloride and tetrahydrothiophene respectively owing to the versatile action of these polymers we decided to try its effectiveness in membrane separation and point of use applications in the first approach we blended the biocidal polymers with a commercial pvdf to yield microporous blend membranes these blend membranes effectively resisted bacterial growth and protein fouling in the second approach we immobilized the bactericidal gn and sp polymers on porous ceramic media we used them as pre filtration kits to remediate bacterial contamination as well as dye removal for point of use applications 2 materials and methods tetrahydrothiophene 99 4 vinyl benzyl chloride 90 sodium tetrafluoroborate 98 and azobisisobutyronitrile aibn guanidine hydrochloride 99 were procured from sigma aldrich propan2 ol chloroform n n dimethylformamide dmf and methanol were procured from sd fine chemicals pvdf with mw 440 000 g mol kynar 761 was procured from arkema all the reagents used in the synthesis were analytical grade and were used directly without any further purification except aibn which was purified and recrystallized using methanol 2 1 synthesis of sp and gn polymers a free radical polymerization technique was used to obtain guanidine and sulphonium based polymers for sulphonium based antimicrobial polymer the monomer was prepared by refluxing 6 ml of tetrahydrothiophene and 30 ml 4 vinyl benzyl chloride in 100 ml propan2 ol for 7 days this was then purified using cold ether and water following which 19 4 g of sodium tetrafluoroborate was added and refluxed for 24 h the resulting monomer was finally recrystallized using propan2 ol 2 g of the crystallized monomer was then dissolved in 5 ml methanol solvent and 12 mg of aibn was added to this system three freeze pump thaw cycles were carried out and the polymerization was executed for 48 h at 60 c a yellow precipitate of poly benzyl sulphonium polymer was

assessments of the polymers coated on the ceramic support balls were carried out against gram positive s aureus atcc25923 and gram negative e coli atcc25922 based bacterial models the standard plate count method was employed for a bacterial viability assessment at three different time points namely 30 min 1 h and 2 h respectively bacteria were sub cultured from standard cultures in nutrient broth in a shaker incubator at 37 c and were harvested in the log phase the culture was centrifuged at 3000 g and the media was discarded the bacterial pellet was washed with 1 x pbs and re suspended in pbs to 109 cfu ml for the experiments for performing the plate count studies with blend membranes 4 5 mm disk tokens of the uv sterilized membranes were taken in a 96 well plate and seeded with 100 μl of bacteria the same were incubated for different time durations following which serial dilutions were performed and plated on freshly prepared nutrient agar plates the colonies were counted after 24 h incubation in an incubator at 37 c the control for these experiments was the pvdf membranes without any modifications each experiment was performed in triplicates for repeatability for performing the plate count studies with coated balls 1 ml of bacteria were seeded in each well of a 12 well plate containing one coated ball media and were incubated for different incubation periods in a shaker incubator the supernatant was then plated after performing serial dilutions next these plates were incubated in an incubator for 24 h after which the colonies were assessed and the concentration was determined each experiment was performed in triplicates for repeatability 2 5 2 intracellular ros assessment for intracellular ros studies one gn and one sp based ceramic ball media were taken in a 12 well plate containing 1 ml re suspended e coli or s aureus and were incubated for the different incubation periods a blank control test was performed using a ceramic substrate without any modification after incubation 500 μl of 6 ppm dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da dye was added to the systems the fluorescence measurements which are indicative of ros generation were then carried out at the excitation wavelength of 485 nm and the emission was obtained recorded at 528 nm each experiment was performed in triplicates for repeatability 2 6 point of contact dye adsorption using ceramic balls a unique experimental design was adopted to understand the point of use for the dye adsorption characteristics of gn and sp coated ceramic support for this methyl orange mo was chosen as a model dye in 2 beakers of 40 ml each 1 ppm mo dye was prepared next 2 gn ceramic balls and 2 sp ceramic balls were placed in empty teabags and were incubated for different time intervals the supernatant was then analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer for dye removal quantification finally the dye adsorption d was determined as follows 4 d concentration of dye in supernatant in ppm concentration of dye taken in ppm concentration of dye taken in ppm x100 3 results and discussion 3 1 polymer characterization fig 2 a and b show the ftir spectra of sulphonium polymer and guanidine polymers respectively in fig 2 a out of the plane bending band at 823 cm 1 was observed for the thiophene ring absorption bands from 1424 to 1515 cm 1 were observed due to c c stretching owing to the presence of benzyl ring in the polymer chain c h stretching at 2934 cm 1 preliminarily suggests the presence of alkyl chains thereby indicating successful polymerization in guanidine polymer c n stretching was observed at 1265 cm 1 due to the presence of guanine nh2 bending at 1624 cm 1 in conjunction with the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of nh2 at 3278 and 3342 cm 1 confirmed the presence of free nh2 fig 3 shows the 1h nmr of sulphonium and guanidine based polymers it was observed that both these polymers shared common peaks owing to the presence of vinyl derivatives and benzyl groups in both their backbones however chemical shifts from 5 8 to 5 84 ppm were the signature peaks of the guanidine free amine group and hence were not observed in sulphonium polymers similarly chemical shifts from 2 68 to 2 71 ppm were due to the presence of thiophene ring in sulphonium polymers these shifts were not observed in guanidine polymers the inferences from nmr data were further supported ascertained by xps analysis fig 4 shows the c1s spectrum of gn and sp polymers respectively the characteristic peaks of vinyl cc and alkyl chain c c for both the systems were observed 283 4 ev and 284 8 ev respectively in gn polymer the c nh2 peak at 288 3 ev confirmed the presence of free amine groups in sp polymer on the other hand the cs peak was observed at 285 3 ev finally to assess the molecular weight of the polymers gpc was performed it was observed that the weight average molecular weight mw of the guanidine polymer and sulphonium polymer were 1 72 105 g mol and 1 64 105 g mol respectively the polydispersity index pdi of guanidine polymer was 1 96 while the sulphonium polymer had a pdi of 2 16 the thermal stability through tga for guanidine and sulphonium based polymers indicated that these polymers were stable till approximately 300 c potentially indicating that these polymers can be processed in melt state as well with ease refer fig 5 3 2 ceramic media coated with polycations fig 6 a shows the surface morphology and sem edx analysis of pvdf gn membranes while 6 b shows the surface morphology and sem edx analysis of pvdf sp membranes while the presence of c and f are due to pvdf the presence of n and s are due to the guanidine group and the sulphonium group respectively fig 6 c and d show the cross sectional morphology of pvdf gn and pvdf sp membranes respectively while the pvdf gn membranes had smaller macro voids and finger like projections the pvdf sp membranes had finger like projections tracing from one end to the other the pore size distribution for pvdf gn membranes ranged from 0 5 to 3 μm estimated from sem images using imagej software while for pvdf sp membranes ranged from 0 5 to 1 5 μm fig 6 e and f this presumably indicates quicker de mixing in the presence of water as compared to pvdf gn membranes 9 41 42 the coating efficiency c of the gn and sp coated ceramic balls were found to be 46 18 1 54 for the guanidine based polymer and 47 36 1 81 for the sulphonium based polymer the water uptake ε for uncoated balls was found to be 2 5 0 2 while the water uptake for guanidine and sulphonium based polymers were found to be 14 43 0 54 and 16 56 0 36 respectively from this it was inferred that the sulphonium based polymer had more affinity towards water this also supported the observation of moisture peaks in ftir data for the sulphonium polymer fig 7 a shows the zeta potential values of pvdf pvdf gn pvdf sp gn and sp surfaces determined using surpass3 at ph 7 from the zeta potential values it was evident that the gn and sp polymer were cationic in nature and incorporation of these polymers into pvdf reduced the zeta potential of the membrane this increased the wettability of the surfaces as can be inferred from the contact angle measurements in fig 7 b fig 8 a shows the pure water flux for pvdf without any modification pvdf gn membranes and pvdf sp membranes it was observed that the permeate flux of the blend membranes was more than that of the pristine pvdf membranes this was due to the increased hydrophilicity of the membranes after the incorporation of the cationic polymers further it was observed that membrane flux in the pvdf sp membranes was more than that in the pvdf gn membranes due to the presence of interconnected finger like projections from one end of the pvdf sp membrane to the other this is also evident from the cross sectional sem image fig 8 b shows the antifouling results of the membranes with bsa as a foulant a foulant generally deposits gets deposited on the membrane surface and subsequently clogs the pores this leads to a decline in membrane performance and subsequently membrane failure 43 frr is the measure of the membrane s inherent property to retain its permeation flux after it is subjected to a backflush cycle to remove the foulant higher frr is hence desirable in a membrane system similarly ifr represents the irreversible foulant deposition on the membrane surface which retains even after a backflush is performed the rfr is an indication of reversibility in fouled flux from fig 8 b it can be seen that the cation blended pvdf membranes had more than 95 of frr and lower ifr as compared to the pristine ones indicating that these membranes can resist protein fouling attack 3 3 bacteriological studies using standard plate count fig 9 a and b show the standard plate count results of coated ceramic media with e coli and s aureus respectively while 9 c and 9 d show the plate count results of blend membranes with e coli and s aureus respectively the standard plate count result reflected that guanidine based polymer manifested in better bactericidal response for both the strains as compared to sulphonium based polymer further the responses of these polymers were more stringent toward s aureus as compared to e coli strain these polymers carried a net positive charge on their polymeric backbone bacteria generally carry an overall negative charge due to their outer cell wall architecture 44 46 therefore in the presence of these polymers the bacteria mentioned above would lose their structural integrity because of electrostatic interactions between the polymer and the bacteria leading to leakage of intracellular constituents of the bacteria and stringent cell death 2 46 47 hence these cationic polymers have great potential applications in blend systems as well as in coated ceramic media where the feed is infested with bacterial contamination and the response time towards the removal of these pathogens is less to further remove the discrepancy of biocidal leaching inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes was performed on the supernatant of the balls as well as the blend membranes by soaking 1 ball 1 1 cm membrane sample in 5 ml of di water and analyzing the sulfur and nitrogen content in it it was observed that the sulfur and nitrogen were below the detection limits of the instruments in either of these samples thus indicating that these can be good contact killing decontaminants it is important to understand the re usability of these ceramic media for antibacterial applications for this we rinsed these balls with 1x pbs and re performed plate count studies for an incubation period of 2 h for 5 different cycles refer fig s1 in supporting information it was observed that the coated balls retained their bactericidal properties even after cyclic use this suggests that these balls can be used for continuous bacterial pathogen removal 3 4 intracellular ros assessment active biocidal agents like guanidine and sulphonium derivatives carry an effective positive charge at neutral ph this charge is preliminarily responsible for inducing intracellular reactive stress on different pathogenic bacteria the intracellular stresses are recorded in nature as ros species which acts as an inhibitor of bacterial growth apart from being a marker of intracellular stress 3 48 the reactive oxygen species include peroxide and superoxide ions dcfh da dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye is a non fluorescent dye used to estimate ros in bacterial cells this dye is taken up by the cells where it gets de acetylated by cellular esterase to non fluorescent 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein dcfh which is rapidly oxidized by the reactive oxygen species ros to highly fluorescent 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein dcf dcf emits fluorescence and the amount of fluorescence in counts is directly co related to the amount of the reactive species 1 6 fig 10 a and b show the intracellular ros generated by coated ceramic media with e coli and s aureus respectively while 10 c and 10 d show the same for blend membranes with e coli and s aureus respectively it can be directly seen that the intracellular ros obtained in both the strains due to gn and sp based polymers was higher than the control samples this directly implies that these polymers can efficiently trigger intracellular ros in bacteria and can aid in impeding bacterial growth further it was observed that the activity of the gn polymer system was greater as compared to the sp polymer system for both the bacterial strains this correlates well with the plate count results 3 5 dye adsorption studies to elucidate the effectivity of the cationic polymers in removing dye from water we performed a point of use experiment with coated balls and recorded the time lapse results fig 11 shows the time lapse results of point of contact dye adsorption with mo as the model dye the left panel shows gn ceramic ball media in teabag while the right panel shows the sp ceramic ball till the 15th minute the gn bag showed 24 5 dye adsorption while the sp bag showed 36 dye adsorption in the 30th minute the gn bag showed 43 adsorption while the sp bag showed 69 dye adsorption in the 45th minute the gn bag showed 78 and the sp bag showed 89 adsorption in the 60th minute the gn bag showed 97 adsorption while the sp bag showed complete dye adsorption for obtaining these values tea bags without any balls were used as a control and the adsorption by tea bags itself was used as a baseline uncoated balls showed no visible dye adsorption for all the time points we also attempted dye adsorption for gn ceramic ball and sp ceramic ball using the same protocol for 10 ppm concentration it was observed that the average dye adsorption was 80 2 for gn ceramic ball while for sp ceramic ball it is 84 6 within 1 h of contact the uncoated ceramic ball media showed no affinity for dye removal this can be attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the cationic polymer and the anionic dye which in turn contributed to the recovery of the dye pollutant from the water to the polymer coated ceramic support 4 conclusions in this work we explored two unique cationic polymers based on guanidine and sulphonium these polymers were thoroughly characterized via ftir xps and 1h nmr to enhance the efficiency of these polymers and to directly deploy them in water remediation applications we fabricated polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf based blend membranes which are foul resistant and bactericidal and used these in point of use application by coating them on ceramic supports the blend membranes exhibited better permeate flux than the pristine pvdf membrane while having more than 95 of flux retention from the standard plate count method it was observed that the blend membranes showed more than a 3 log reduction of bacteria for both the strains 6 log bacterial reduction was observed for both the strains for gn based ceramic supports and sp based ceramic supports respectively the bactericidal action of these systems was corroborated with intracellular reactive oxygen species ros the non leaching aspect of these coated ceramic balls was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes analysis finally we deployed these polymers on ceramic supports for point of use dye adsorption taken together these polymers can work in tandem with current pre filters to remediate bacteria and dye pollutants as well as work in membrane separation declaration of competing interest

13767,research concerning the design and development of non leaching antibacterial agents for quick water decontamination is in great demand for their effective re use and minimizing biocide contamination in water herein we have synthesized two bactericidal polymers based on guanidine backbone henceforth called gn and sulphonium backbone henceforth called sp we explored their uniqueness in deriving polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf based blend membranes which are foul resistant and bactericidal besides the potential of these polycations in point of use applications was explored by coating them on porous ceramic supports the chemical structures of these polymers were investigated via fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the bactericidal action was tested against escherichia coli e coli atcc 25922 and staphylococcus aureus s aureus atcc 25923 based model strains the blend membranes showed more than a 3 log reduction of bacterial colonies for both the strains and 6 log reduction in the case of ceramic supports coated with gn and sp this was further corroborated with intracellular reactive oxygen species ros measurements the non leaching nature of these biocides was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes analysis the antifouling nature of blend membranes with gn and sp polymers was demonstrated using bovine serum albumin as model foulant further the unique polymers when coated on ceramic supports showed good dye adsorption for methyl orange as model dye pollutants owing to their electrostatic interactions with the dye keywords polycations pvdf membranes antibacterial antifouling point of use 1 introduction access to safe drinking water for all is one of the key challenges of the 21st century afflicting people globally nearly 1 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 2 6 billion have no access to sanitation 1 3 due to the consumption of contaminated water more than 3900 children die every day by water borne communicable diseases 4 6 the world health organization s estimate indicates that exposure to water borne diseases like diarrhea can be effectively reduced by 35 if basic water hygiene and sanitation are provided 7 9 various technologies like flocculation distillation adsorption air floatation etc are currently used to decontaminate water however due to the presence of microbes and other colloidal impurities these processes sometimes fail to meet stringent water standards 10 to remediate these two distinct strategies can be adopted a using point of use devices and b using membrane filtration processes point of use methods are effective in remediating bacterial contaminants and in this approach nanomaterial and or catalysts are introduced to bacterial contaminated water and processes such as photocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes 11 13 biocidal leeching of bleach 14 15 kill the pathogenic contaminants from water these systems are suitable in places that lack infrastructural facilities and electricity however this process has its demerits as well after the decontamination process the nanomaterial and or catalysts have to be filtered from the water using suitable methods before it can be used for consumption 11 further chlorination or bleaching can alter taste and odor of water has low disinfection capabilities in turbid water and can potentially generate by products that can have implications for the environment 16 a point of use strategy with effective decontamination while easy post extraction is hence desirable membrane based separation on the other hand is a versatile technique which can remove a wide spectrum of contaminants like colloidal impurities pathogenic bacteria algae fungi etc and even viruses and ions by acting as molecular sieves 17 18 by tuning the pore size and its distribution different target contaminants can be removed from the water microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes in particular are effective in remediating colloidal impurities as well as bacteria with the application of low differential pressures 9 among the potential membrane materials for mf and uf poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf is extensively used owing to its excellent chemical resistance thermal stability and mechanical strength 19 20 however the performance of these membranes is adversely affected due to membrane biofouling the bacterial contaminants filtered by these membranes first deposit on the surfaces of the membrane and eventually extract required nutrients from the water and start multiplying on the active surfaces of the membranes this leads to bacterial colonization and biofilm formation once these matured biofilms are formed they limit water molecule transport by rendering friction to permeating water molecules 21 higher differential pressure is required to overcome this friction which may lead to the failure of these membranes to limit bacterial growth on the membrane surfaces engineered biocides like silver 22 25 antibiotics 26 27 chlorine 3 etc are introduced on to the surfaces to kill these pathogens 22 28 30 however the continual depletion of the biocidal agent into the water with time results in the eventual loss of antibacterial activity of these membranes 31 33 hence it is imperative to develop antimicrobial agents that have better contact killing properties as opposed to leaching based properties the antimicrobial agent should also exhibit broad activity to bacteria i e should be equally effective towards both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains these may be then tethered or blended with pvdf or other membrane material to yield good fouling resistance in this context cationic polymers have shown promising results active biocidal groups like quaternary ammonium compounds qacs amines and phosphonium based moieties when introduced into long chain polymeric derivatives have shown to enhance bacterial reduction and mitigate biofouling 2 3 34 35 among amines guanidine derivatives are highly potent antimicrobials with effective bactericidal activity to both gram positive and gram negative strains it has been used in biomedical applications like therapeutics and catheter coatings 36 37 like guanidine derivatives sulphonium based polymers are also cationic have been used in anion exchange resins and odor improvement beads in water remediation 9 38 39 cationic polymers derived from guanidine and sulphonium derivatives can hence act as good antimicrobial agents within this framework herein we report guanidine and sulphonium based polycation biocidal agents and modified pvdf with these biocides for water remediation applications at neutral ph each moiety of gn and sp carries free amine and positively charged sulfur atom respectively these cationic polymers were synthesized via free radical polymerization using 4 vinyl benzyl chloride based precursors modified with guanidine hydrochloride and tetrahydrothiophene respectively owing to the versatile action of these polymers we decided to try its effectiveness in membrane separation and point of use applications in the first approach we blended the biocidal polymers with a commercial pvdf to yield microporous blend membranes these blend membranes effectively resisted bacterial growth and protein fouling in the second approach we immobilized the bactericidal gn and sp polymers on porous ceramic media we used them as pre filtration kits to remediate bacterial contamination as well as dye removal for point of use applications 2 materials and methods tetrahydrothiophene 99 4 vinyl benzyl chloride 90 sodium tetrafluoroborate 98 and azobisisobutyronitrile aibn guanidine

from arkema all the reagents used in the synthesis were analytical grade and were used directly without any further purification except aibn which was purified and recrystallized using methanol 2 1 synthesis of sp and gn polymers a free radical polymerization technique was used to obtain guanidine and sulphonium based polymers for sulphonium based antimicrobial polymer the monomer was prepared by refluxing 6 ml of tetrahydrothiophene and 30 ml 4 vinyl benzyl chloride in 100 ml propan2 ol for 7 days this was then purified using cold ether and water following which 19 4 g of sodium tetrafluoroborate was added and refluxed for 24 h the resulting monomer was finally recrystallized using propan2 ol 2 g of the crystallized monomer was then dissolved in 5 ml methanol solvent and 12 mg of aibn was added to this system three freeze pump thaw cycles were carried out and the polymerization was executed for 48 h at 60 c a yellow precipitate of poly benzyl sulphonium polymer was formed at the end of this reaction this was then purified with cold methanol and dried in the oven refer scheme 1 for guanidine antimicrobial polymer 6 ml of 4 vinyl benzyl chloride was taken in a round bottom flask and 12 mg of aibn was added to it three freeze pump thaw cycles were carried out and the polymerization was executed for 48 h at 60 c the polymer was then purified using cold methanol and dried in the oven a 1 1 w w ration of the polymer to guanidine hydrochloride was refluxed in 100 ml ethanol for 24 h the product obtained was washed with water and then with ethanol an orange product was formed after it was dried in a hot air oven refer scheme 2 2 2 membrane preparation and ceramic ball coating pristine gn and sp based polymers were brittle and the membranes

xps analysis fig 4 shows the c1s spectrum of gn and sp polymers respectively the characteristic peaks of vinyl cc and alkyl chain c c for both the systems were observed 283 4 ev and 284 8 ev respectively in gn polymer the c nh2 peak at 288 3 ev confirmed the presence of free amine groups in sp polymer on the other hand the cs peak was observed at 285 3 ev finally to assess the molecular weight of the polymers gpc was performed it was observed that the weight average molecular weight mw of the guanidine polymer and sulphonium polymer were 1 72 105 g mol and 1 64 105 g mol respectively the polydispersity index pdi of guanidine polymer was 1 96 while the sulphonium polymer had a pdi of 2 16 the thermal stability through tga for guanidine and sulphonium based polymers indicated that these polymers were stable till approximately 300 c potentially indicating that these polymers can be processed in melt state as well with ease refer fig 5 3 2 ceramic media coated with polycations fig 6 a shows the surface morphology and sem edx analysis of pvdf gn membranes while 6 b shows the surface morphology and sem edx analysis of pvdf sp membranes while the presence of c and f are due to pvdf the presence of n and s are due to the guanidine group and the sulphonium group respectively fig 6 c and d show the cross sectional morphology of pvdf gn and pvdf sp membranes respectively while the pvdf gn membranes had smaller macro voids and finger like projections the pvdf sp membranes had finger like projections tracing from one end to the other the pore size distribution for pvdf gn membranes ranged from 0 5 to 3 μm estimated from sem images using imagej software while for pvdf sp membranes ranged from 0 5 to 1 5 μm fig 6 e and f this presumably indicates quicker de mixing in the presence of water as compared to pvdf gn membranes 9 41 42 the coating efficiency c of the gn and sp coated ceramic balls were found to be 46 18 1 54 for the guanidine based polymer and 47 36 1 81 for the sulphonium based polymer the water uptake ε for uncoated balls was found to be 2 5 0 2 while the water uptake for guanidine and sulphonium based polymers were found to be 14 43 0 54 and 16 56 0 36 respectively from this it was inferred that the sulphonium based polymer had more affinity towards water this also supported the observation of moisture peaks in ftir data for the sulphonium polymer fig 7 a shows the zeta potential values of pvdf pvdf gn pvdf sp gn and sp surfaces determined using surpass3 at ph 7 from the zeta potential values it was evident that the gn and sp polymer were cationic in nature and incorporation of these polymers into pvdf reduced the zeta potential of the membrane this increased the wettability of the surfaces as can be inferred from the contact angle measurements in fig 7 b fig 8 a shows the pure water flux for pvdf without any modification pvdf gn membranes and pvdf sp membranes it was observed that the permeate flux of the blend membranes was more than that of the pristine pvdf membranes this was due to the increased hydrophilicity of the membranes after the incorporation of the cationic polymers further it was observed that membrane flux in the pvdf sp membranes was more than that in the pvdf gn membranes due to the presence of interconnected finger like projections from one end of the pvdf sp membrane to the other this is also evident from the cross sectional sem image fig 8 b shows the antifouling results of the membranes with bsa as a foulant a foulant generally deposits gets deposited on the membrane surface and subsequently clogs the pores this leads to a decline in membrane performance and subsequently membrane failure 43 frr is the measure of the membrane s inherent property to retain its permeation flux after it is subjected to a backflush cycle to remove the foulant higher frr is hence desirable in a membrane system similarly ifr represents the irreversible foulant deposition on the membrane surface which retains even after a backflush is performed the rfr is an indication of reversibility in fouled flux from fig 8 b it can be seen that the cation blended pvdf membranes had more than 95 of frr and lower ifr as compared to the pristine ones indicating that these membranes can resist protein fouling attack 3 3 bacteriological studies using standard plate count fig 9 a and b show the standard plate count results of coated ceramic media with e coli and s aureus respectively while 9 c and 9 d show the plate count results of blend membranes with e coli and s aureus respectively the standard plate count result reflected that guanidine based polymer manifested in better bactericidal response for both the strains as compared to sulphonium based polymer further the responses of these polymers were more stringent toward s aureus as compared to e coli strain these polymers carried a net positive charge on their polymeric backbone bacteria generally carry an overall negative charge due to their outer cell wall architecture 44 46 therefore in the presence of these polymers the bacteria mentioned above would lose their structural integrity because of electrostatic interactions between the polymer and the bacteria leading to leakage of intracellular constituents of the bacteria and stringent cell death 2 46 47 hence these cationic polymers have great potential applications in blend systems as well as in coated ceramic media where the feed is infested with bacterial contamination and the response time towards the removal of these pathogens is less to further remove the discrepancy of biocidal leaching inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes was performed on the supernatant of the balls as well as the blend membranes by soaking 1 ball 1 1 cm membrane sample in 5 ml of di water and analyzing the sulfur and nitrogen content in it it was observed that the sulfur and nitrogen were below the detection limits of the instruments in either of these samples thus indicating that these can be good contact killing decontaminants it is important to understand the re usability of these ceramic media for antibacterial applications for this we rinsed these balls with 1x pbs and re performed plate count studies for an incubation period of 2 h for 5 different cycles refer fig s1 in supporting information it was observed that the coated balls retained their bactericidal properties even after cyclic use this suggests that these balls can be used for continuous bacterial pathogen removal 3 4 intracellular ros assessment active biocidal agents like guanidine and sulphonium derivatives carry an effective positive charge at neutral ph this charge is preliminarily responsible for inducing intracellular reactive stress on different pathogenic bacteria the intracellular stresses are recorded in nature as ros species which acts as an inhibitor of bacterial growth apart from being a marker of intracellular stress 3 48 the reactive oxygen species include peroxide and superoxide ions dcfh da dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye is a non fluorescent dye used to estimate ros in bacterial cells this dye is taken up by the cells where it gets de acetylated by cellular esterase to non fluorescent 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein dcfh which is rapidly oxidized by the reactive oxygen species ros to highly fluorescent 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein dcf dcf emits fluorescence and the amount of fluorescence in counts is directly co related to the amount of the reactive species 1 6 fig 10 a and b show the intracellular ros generated by coated ceramic media with e coli and s aureus respectively while 10 c and 10 d show the same for blend membranes with e coli and s aureus respectively it can be directly seen that the intracellular ros obtained in both the strains due to gn and sp based polymers was higher than the control samples this directly implies that these polymers can efficiently trigger intracellular ros in bacteria and can aid in impeding bacterial growth further it was observed that the activity of the gn polymer system was greater as compared to the sp polymer system for both the bacterial strains this correlates well with the plate count results 3 5 dye adsorption studies to elucidate the effectivity of the cationic polymers in removing dye from water we performed a point of use experiment with coated balls and recorded the time lapse results fig 11 shows the time lapse results of point of contact dye adsorption with mo as the model dye the left panel shows gn ceramic ball media in teabag while the right panel shows the sp ceramic ball till the 15th minute the gn bag showed 24 5 dye adsorption while the sp bag showed 36 dye adsorption in the 30th minute the gn bag showed 43 adsorption while the sp bag showed 69 dye adsorption in the 45th minute the gn bag showed 78 and the sp bag showed 89 adsorption in the 60th minute the gn bag showed 97 adsorption while the sp bag showed complete dye adsorption for obtaining these values tea bags without any balls were used as a control and the adsorption by tea bags itself was used as a baseline uncoated balls showed no visible dye adsorption for all the time points we also attempted dye adsorption for gn ceramic ball and sp ceramic ball using the same protocol for 10 ppm concentration it was observed that the average dye adsorption was 80 2 for gn ceramic ball while for sp ceramic ball it is 84 6 within 1 h of contact the uncoated ceramic ball media showed no affinity for dye removal this can be attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the cationic polymer and the anionic dye which in turn contributed to the recovery of the dye pollutant from the water to the polymer coated ceramic support 4 conclusions in this work we explored two unique cationic polymers based on guanidine and sulphonium these polymers were thoroughly characterized via ftir xps and 1h nmr to enhance the efficiency of these polymers and to directly deploy them in water remediation applications we fabricated polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf based blend membranes which are foul resistant and bactericidal and used these in point of use application by coating them on ceramic supports the blend membranes exhibited better permeate flux than the pristine pvdf membrane while having more than 95 of flux retention from the standard plate count method it was observed that the blend membranes showed more than a 3 log reduction of bacteria for both the strains 6 log bacterial reduction was observed for both the strains for gn based ceramic supports and sp based ceramic supports respectively the bactericidal action of these systems was corroborated with intracellular reactive oxygen species ros the non leaching aspect of these coated ceramic balls was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes analysis finally we deployed these polymers on ceramic supports for point of use dye adsorption taken together these polymers can work in tandem with current pre filters to remediate bacteria and dye pollutants as well as work in membrane separation declaration of competing interest

13768,electricity generation from wastewater using a microalgae based microbial fuel cell mfc has captured a lot of attention from researchers these days microalgae microbial fuel cell m mfc is a device that can overcome the problem of fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution by generating electrical energy from wastewater and sunlight sustainable applications of the microalgae based microbial fuel cells are not only reliable for wastewater treatment and bio electricity generation but also versatile in the field of bio hydrogen energy production eco friendly solution of desalination and carbon sequestration in this review article we have summarized the mechanism and operational configuration of the microbial fuel cell using an anode chamber a cathode chamber and a separation membrane the technological advancement of photosynthetic microalgae in the microbial fuel cell for energy production and wastewater treatment has been explored the use of microalgae species such as the anode and cathode is also conferred with the resulting power densities the challenges and possible solutions of the microalgae microbial fuel cells in integrated energy production systems with wastewater treatment have been discussed for potential industrialization keywords microalgae microbial fuel cell wastewater treatment bio hydrogen bio electricity 1 introduction the upsurge in the global energy needs and the deficiency in the supply of non renewable energy resources have created a global energy crisis along with a dramatic increase in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental deterioration 1 the dependency and exploitation of conventional fossil fuels are the main causes of the depletion of natural energy reserves e g coal oil etc challenging the sustainability of the environment 2 therefore the development and utilization of renewable energy resources have gained momentum in recent years several renewable strategies are being considered to achieve a sustainable energy requirement and also to reduce the carbon footprint in addition the ever increasing wastewater generation has become one of the major environmental issues the rapid increase in wastewater generation from different resources namely domestic municipal industrial and agricultural is not only responsible for water pollution surface underground but also entails a hefty conventional energy cost for its treatment along with the release of greenhouse gases 3 indeed due to the consistent proliferation in industrial and economic growth expansions it is very difficult to reduce the wastewater generation the existing conventional wastewater treatment technologies including activated sludge drip filter membrane filter and reverse osmosis also membrane filter technique are ineffective in terms of energy requirements 4 in addition the biological treatment of wastewater is a slow practice while chemical processes have environmental concerns this scenario has called for the development of energy efficient cost effective and eco friendly wastewater treatment technologies in this regard microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that have an inherent ability to fix environmental as well as anthropogenic co2 along with the release of o2 into the environment which represents strategic importance to overcome global warming issues fig 1 microalgae also have the ability to survive under various environmental conditions and can grow in various sources of wastewater e g municipal industrial industrial domestic and agricultural wastewater mixtures and saline systems 5 microalgae absorb nutrients and toxic metals present in wastewater for their growth and as a result treat the wastewater s 6 recently several investigations reported the ability of microalgae to integrate with microbial fuel cells mfc 5 7 the integration of microalgae microbial fuel cell m mfc has become promising since these phototrophic organisms act as o2 generators in situ to facilitate the reaction in the cathode chamber in addition microalgae also efficiently remove phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater which may not be possible only with the mfc 8 therefore it offers on site wastewater treatment technology synchronized with sustainable electricity generation the practice of green energy production is a field of proliferation in the current scenario to recover the electrical energy of organic pollutants in wastewater the use of microalgae as a photosynthetic microorganism in mfc leads to the development of m mfc with an efficient approach to solving energy cost and environmental problems by simultaneously treating different wastewater along with electricity generation 9 this review catalogs the comprehensive information on the configuration of mfc hybrid systems their operating mechanisms the integration of microalgae in mfc and process parameters influencing the electricity generation further the limitations and challenges of photosynthetic m mfc are discussed by their perspective for synergistic applications for wastewater treatment bioelectricity generation desalination and production of value added chemicals since the m mfc system combines photo bioreactor for the cultivation of microalgae and mfc the review lists the merits and demerits of both the processes 2 microbial fuel cells mechanism and operational configuration microbial fuel cells are bio electrochemical systems that generate bio electricity with the help of biocatalytic reactions in the presence of electroactive microorganisms 10 11 in general an mfc consists of two compartments namely a cathode chamber and an anode chamber with an ion exchange membrane separator in the bio electrocatalytic mechanism of microbial fuel cells the anode respiring microbes generate electric current by oxidizing organic substrates at the anode in the electric current generation the anode respiring microbe transfers the electrons to an anode via extracellular electron transfer the transfer of electron can occur by means of direct interaction with outer membrane proteins electron transport distribution and solid biofilm components electron transport through a solid anodic biofilm observes high current densities with a less potential loss the biocatalytic oxidation of the substrate generates electrons and protons at the anode fig 2 electrons are then transferred to the anode surface by electronic mediators or carried by direct electron transfer via a proton membrane present on the surface of microorganisms 12 the electrons then flow to the cathode through an external circuit resulting in current flow from the cathode to anode simultaneously protons also move through the ion exchange membrane reaching the cathode chamber where electrons reduce oxygen to water the oxygen is pumped at the cathode is either pumped known as in dual chamber mfcs or via direct contact of the cathode with air designated as single chamber mfcs for proper functioning of the mfcs the concentration of dissolved oxygen do is critical as it determines the energy production previous studies have established an optimum do of 6 6 mg l in mfcs since the decrease in the do levels limits the current generation 13 14 moreover the variety of factors influencing performance e g temperature in mfc affects kinetics e g activation energy mass transfer coefficient and conductivity of solution thermodynamics e g free gibbs energy and electrode potential microbial ecology different environment for diverse species of the mfc system the variation reflects with respect to the following equations and output of the mfc power output 1 δg ηferevenergy potential 2 v mfc e0 mfc η anode η cathode i rint electromotive force 3 c x h y o z ph2o xco2 qh qe organic matter oxidation in the case of m mfcs photosynthetic microalgae species at cathode increase efficiency probably due to the generation of oxygen in the electrode chamber further the m mfc system is additionally valuable with co2 sequestration in the presence of light source the application is also useful in the recovery of wastewater via oxidation in the anodes and reduction in the cathode as well as in co2 sequestration via the reduction at the cathode with cell biomass production furthermore the use of oxygenated photosynthetic microalgae in the anode marks lower efficiency due to higher redox by oxygen generation while anaerobic microbes seem promising at this point in addition to electricity generation mfcs have demonstrated their potential application for wastewater treatment leachate treatment toxic gas treatment degradation of petroleum components hydrogen and methane production etc 15 16 in the bio electrocatalytic mechanism of pollutant removal degradation of the hydrophilic fraction preferably occurs for the fed dissolved organic substrates and generates humin with greater aromatic contents the general reactions involved in the degradation of organic pollutants have been represented in fig 3 the electric field of microbial reactions from the fuel cell to the cathode stimulates the cod decomposition actions and the biofilm nitrifier develops ammonium removal to this end numerous mfc designs and configurations have been developed for wastewater treatment that eliminates the consumption of additional electricity different hybrid mfc systems such as constructed wetlands cw mfc plant mfc mbr mfc mdc and mec have been reported for wastewater treatment 17 18 however there is a gap in a thorough evaluation of the mfc hybrid systems there is an exclusive interest in combining mfc with wastewater treatment to obtain a synergistic hybrid system for renewable energy and discussed in section 3 furthermore in the literature several studies on mfc have been reported in the approach of microalgae for cathode chamber electrode materials membranes electrocatalysts removal of various contaminants and bio electrochemical processes 19 20 the integration of microalgae with mfc is efficient i e m mfc to convert sunlight into electricity through the process of photosynthesis in microalgae cells also m mfc sequestrates co2 from the environment in addition to removing n p and heavy metal contaminants from wastewater 21 2 1 anodic chamber anode chamber is among the most crucial component of any mfc since the generation of electricity occurs here and thus called the heart of mfc along with power generation the reduction of organic compounds chemical oxygen demand cod hydrogen production treatment of wastewater biofilm formation takes place at the anode chamber 22 23 it is crucial to select the appropriate material for preparing anode in order to maximize mfc efficiency while selecting anode material several characteristic features including high photochemical stability high conductivity and low resistance need to be considered the commonly utilized non metallic anode material include carbon paper carbon rod brush graphite rod plate carbon foam etc 24 25 besides anode material microbial species consortia substrate utilized mediators ph are other factors that influence the overall efficiency of mfc studies have been conducted to evaluate different anode material design substrates in order to optimize the maximum power generation from mfc 22 26 poor interaction of the traditional carbon electrode is one of the major concerns while designing mfc to overcome this the utilization of modified anode has been suggested modification is considered to provide comparatively more active sites ultimately resulting in enhanced electron transfer paul et al reported enhanced efficiency approximately 3 6 times higher when grapheme oxide zeolite was utilized as an anode as a modification of carbon felt anode 27 in another study modified anodic macro porous graphite carbon foam mgcf possessing coating of polydopamine was utilized which increased the microbe interaction and electron transfer 28 another modified electrode multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt showed an increase in the microbial biofilm development resulting in about 49 enhanced power generation compared to that attained when an unmodified electrode was utilized 29 the utilization of natural substances such as carbonized plant trunk bamboo coconut husk recycled paper as an electrode in anode chamber is advantageous since these materials are economical and possess the inherent ability to enhance the microbial biofilm attachment 30 moreover metal anodes have also resulted in high power generation in addition to this a combination of carbon and metal also enhances overall efficiency apart from this decorated anode material also enhances the interaction of microbes with the anode the substrates which act as carbon source and as a nutrient source for the microbial growth are also potential anode material the chemical energy stored in substrates is converted into electrical energy by metabolic activities of microbes 31 these substrates can be pure compounds to wastewater obtained from the meat industry sewage dairy industry paper industry etc 32 33 along with anodic material and substrate the type of microorganism also influences the efficiency of an mfc 34 the microbes metabolize the substrate using key metabolic pathways namely glycolysis kreb s cycle and electron transport chain etc leading to atp synthesis 35 37 in the process several compounds components of etc are involved in an electron shuttle occurring from microbial membranes to the cell to the electron receptor 38 hence bacteria that could be transported externally are preferred for mfc microbes unable to transport electrons outside the membrane require additional mediators such as methylene blue thionine neutral red ferricyanide etc to bring out the transport of electrons from the membrane to the electrodes 39 2 2 cathodic chamber in a two chamber mfc the cathode acts as an electron and proton receiver whereas in one chambered mfc the air cathode functions as a receiver of the electrons electron accepting molecules present in cathode bring out the reduction of electrons which also completes the electron cycle 40 41 several molecules have been utilized to bring out the cathodic reduction such as chlorate tetrachloroethane perchlorate ferric ions nitrite sodium bromated potassium ferricyanide dichloroethane fumarate hexavalent chromium etc 42 43 moreover the anodic materials can also act as cathodes however a catalyst along with a binder is required for the proper functioning of the air cathode numerous materials including carbon or graphite felt carbon fiber brush carbon cloth graphite fiber brush double sided cloth a mesh of carbon or stainless steel have been utilized as a cathode in the mfcs 44 46 air cathodes made of metals require to be supplemented with a catalyst e g activated carbon and a binder e g polytetrafluoroethylene however the utilization of catalysts is not mandatory for all cathodes for instance cathodes having potassium ferricyanide can as an electron acceptor does not require any catalyst studies have been conducted to achieve the reduction of the air cathode layer along with enhancing the efficiency of mfcs for example santoro et al provided a comparative analysis of the performance of cathode having different platinum charges which increased energy production 26 the authors reported that the utilization of the air cathode having 0 5 1 0 mg pt cm2 resulted in enhanced power generation another study utilized cathode made from ni c fiber coated with activated carbon and reported an increase in the power density with a simultaneous decrease in the resistance in mfc 47 further an mfc possessing ni foam supplemented with a catalyst activated c and a binder ptfe produced current comparable to that of the carbon cloth platinum electrode 48 2 3 separating membrane the anodic and cathodic chambers are separated by a separating membrane through which the transfer of protons is accomplished an efficient separator must possess specific characteristics features including a high rate of proton transfer low permeability to gas thermally stable and resistance to biotic contamination 49 the separators can be of two main categories based on the type of the material selective size separator and the mechanism for proton exchange ion exchange membrane based on the exchange mechanism the membrane could be cation exchange membrane anion exchange membrane proton exchange membrane porous polymer composite and bipolar membrane in context to power generation nafion has proved to be an effective separator owing to its high rate of proton transfer stable nature and lower resistance 49 50 however the primary concern of using nafion is the high cost associated with the material along with its higher permeability of o2 and the exchange of cations keeping this into consideration other alternatives to nafion have utilized for instance a composite separating membrane was developed comprising of polyvinyl alcohol borosilicate and nafion polyvinyl borosilicate 51 the cost of the reported composite membrane was about 11 times less than as compared to the cost of only nafion further sulfonated ketone ether polyether membrane polysulfone based anion exchange membrane sulfonated polybenzimidazole as proton exchange membrane sulfonated poly imide ether with fluorenyl and trifluoromethyl for the manufacture of membranes glass wool glass fiber membrane etc are other reported separating membranes 52 53 3 wastewater and treatment with mfc wastewater is defined as any water that has been negatively affected in quality by anthropogenic activities it consists of liquid and solid waste that is generated from domestic commercial industrial or agricultural sources 54 the traditional biological treatment systems for wastewater require high operating costs and result in large amounts of sludge as secondary pollutants 55 to this end several investigations have focused on the development and deployment of cost effective wastewater treatments among these treatments it s the utilization of mfc as it requires low cost of operation energy balance low environmental footprints lower sludge formation and no aeration requirements fig 4 56 depending upon the source and nature of pollutants different types of mfc have been designed to achieve efficient wastewater treatment 40 57 both single as well as double chambered mfc has been utilized for the treatment of wastewater previous studies conducted have revealed the potential of single chamber mfcs for effective treatment of domestic wastewater as well as effluents obtained from several industries including petroleum dairy brewery distillery etc 58 wastewater containing organic pollutants is degraded by the microorganisms for their growth is fed into the anodic chamber the metabolic process results in the generation of electrons and protons which are utilized for the generation of bioelectricity ahn and logan reported a single chambered air cathode mfc for wastewater treatment mode 59 while zhang et al developed an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor microbial fuel cell biological aerated filter uasb mfc baf system for the treatment of molasses wastewater and the generation of bioelectricity simultaneously the high strength molasses wastewater was supplied with a chemical oxygen demand cod of 127 500 mg l which generated a maximum power density of 1410 2 mw m2 with a current density of 4947 9 ma m2 in this the total cod sulfate and color removal efficiencies were observed at 53 2 52 7 and 41 1 respectively 60 a pilot scale mfc system consisting of a multi anode cathode configuration was also evaluated for wastewater treatment 28 although the mfc is recognized as a self sustaining and energy efficient alternative technology concerns persist pertaining to process optimization 30 system configurations along with material utilized for electrodes surface area hydraulic retention time are the key factors that need to be considered while designing mfc based wastewater remediation systems 61 indeed the large volume of wastewater treatment needs to be addressed adequately for commercial applications hence efforts are required to design a cost effective mfc based system that can be stably and efficiently operated for long term mitigation of wastewater s 62 the difficulty in the application of mfc is mainly the cost of installation due to the expensive proton exchange membrane the cathode implemented with pt and the use of mediators in the cathode current research focuses on a cost effective mfc with single chamber architecture without the proton exchange membrane through the use of biocathodes 44 mfc with a double chamber system the pollutants serve as electron acceptors and abiotic treatment of organic pollutants is achieved in the cathode chamber the anaerobic anodic chamber is filled with organic pollutants to be treated along with bio electrochemically active microbes which bring out the oxidation of pollutants 40 electron acceptors in the cathode derived from wastewater reduce the electrons and a potential difference is generated which results in the production of bioelectricity 63 dual chambered mfc has been demonstrated to possess the potential to treat wastewater produced in brewing and food processing industry distillery slaughterhouse water containing azo dyes polyaromatic hydrocarbons metals such as cu v electroplating water 64 the wastewater obtained from various industries or domestic sewage water any polluted water contains several types of impurities and contaminants hence it is practically impossible to remove degrade all the pollutants through a single treatment process this necessitates the utilization of hybrid systems and co integrated mfcs a few of the hybrid and integrated mfcs include wetland mfc cw mfc sediment mfcs s mfc floating macrophyte based mfc fm mfc earthen pot mfc system and mfc fenton which were for effective treatment of wastewater containing a mixture of pollutants 65 the mac mfc multiple anode cathode with 12 anodes cathodes systems have been reported to eliminate about 80 of pollutants present in domestic wastewater along with the generation of the power density of 300 380 mw m2 moreover an increase in the number of electrodes resulted in better power generation a hybrid system comprising of a single chambered mfc sc mfc and an anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor mfc afmbr was designed to achieve two stage treatment of wastewater it was worked with a high permeate flow of 16 l m2 h for more than 50 days in which the total electrical energy used for the process of the mfc afmbr system was 0 0186 kw h m3 which was slightly less than the electrical energy generated by the mfc 0 0197 kw h m3 64 the authors accomplished the wastewater treatment in two stages with the initial treatment in mfc followed by the treatment of wastewater in afmbr where removal of total suspended solids and cod 92 5 took place as in the case of any mfc electricity generation was simultaneously achieved along with water treatment hydrolytic up flow sludge blanket husb cw mfc is another system pilot scale designed by corbella et al for domestic wastewater treatment the primary treatment of wastewater was accomplished in the husb reactor followed by the pumping of the wastewater in the horizontal subsurface flow hssf cw mfc system for further treatment secondary 65 the authors reported a 61 cod removal with a generation of 219 ma m2 power density in another study the fme mfc system was tested for domestic as well as distillery wastewater treatment 66 the system utilized floating macrophyte ecosystems which was fed with wastewater to be treated a cod removal of 71 with volatile fatty acid 70 removal was successfully achieved in the above system with a maximum power density of 80 08 mw m2 67 furthermore a low cost cw mfcs system operated on the pilot scale for wastewater treatment has been successfully established 68 however efforts are required for scaling up of these pilot or laboratory scale systems for large scale operation 4 photosynthetic microalgae characteristics microalgae are an extremely diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic microorganisms that exist in a wide range of habitats including freshwater to marine water environment 69 microalgae are a promising source for biomass generation which can be utilized for the production of an array of industrial relevant high value antioxidants nutraceuticals vitamins pigments etc and biofuels this is due to their ease of cultivation under controlled conditions with faster growth cycles non dependence on climatic conditions high areal productivity and year round productivity as compared to eukaryotic counterparts particularly plants 70 71 photosynthesis in microalgae helps to generate biochemical energy by converting solar energy accounting for more than fifty percent of the photosynthetic productivity on the earth the higher growth rate and co2 fixation of microalgae are important when considering them for bioenergy production 72 73 the photosynthetic process is a bio redox reaction carried out by microalgae using co2 and light photons to synthesize carbohydrates and release oxygen as well as the synthesis of additional complex biomolecules 74 75 since microalgae need light for phototrophic growth it is generally cultivated either in a natural outdoor raceway ponds or artificial indoor photobioreactors light conditions 76 the autotrophic growth of microalgae occurs using co2 as a carbon source under light illumination in an aquatic environment 77 different microalgal species have also demonstrated their ability to grow under heterotrophic conditions dark replacing co2 fixation with organic carbon sources present in the growth media 78 additionally microalgae can also grow under mixotrophy which combines photosynthesis and respiratory metabolism in simultaneous operation in parallel assimilation of co2 and sequestration of organic carbon 79 the microalgae production process begins from the screening and isolation of strains cultivation in an appropriate medium harvesting of biomass for the synthesis of the post processing target product from the biomass 80 5 microalgae in microbial fuel cells m mfcs microalgae fuel cells are a microalgae mediated bio electrochemical system for transforming carbonaceous substances to bio electricity 81 in a typical microalgae microbial fuel cell m mfc microalgal cells produce o2 by utilizing solar energy and nutrients bicarbonates and co2 released by the heterotrophic bacteria which take up the released o2 and the organic content fig 5 82 typically the microalgae fuel cells are made up of two chambers i e anode and cathode separated by a membrane 83 in the first step the organic inorganic substrate gets converted into electrons and protons in the anodic chamber the degradation of the waste biomass takes place in the anodic chamber due to microbial activity and supplies electrons and protons then these electrons are transferred to the microalgal cell to electrodes in addition the transferred electrons reached from anode to cathode by an external circuit at the same time proton infusion takes place from the anode to the cathode proton migration has been assisted by proton cation exchange membrane while electrons flow through the electrodes from the anodic chamber to the cathodic chamber 84

85 in this m mfc c vulgaris acted as an electron acceptor and utilized co2 produced at the cathode for its growth various microalgae species have also been reported to act as electron donors acceptors simultaneously 86 there exists a functional difference between m mfc which can work under both light and dark conditions and mfc require light for electricity generation the sections below detail the utilization of microalgae at anode and cathode chambers 5 1 microalgae at the anode chamber the microalgae at the anode chamber generate electrons and protons during the light phase while in the dark conditions oxidation of the organic substrates takes place by utilization of the oxygen liberated in the light period resulting in the production of energy 94 the list of previously reported studies that utilized different microalgal strain at the anode is provided in table 1 indeed the utilization of different microalgae at the anode has resulted in different power output generation for instance the comparative analysis of two m mfcs one based on c vulgaris and other containing marine algae dunaliella tertiolecta for municipal sewage sludge reported the former algal strain to be better at generating power further since microalgae are a photosynthetic microorganism the light intensity and wavelength impact its growth and in turn the power output for example when m mfc containing chlamydomonas reinhardtii was irradiated with red light with high light intensity 900 lux it generated more power output as compared to blue light and lower light intensities 100 300 and 600 lux in another study a process was designed for the utilization of anolyte produced in terracotta based m mfc 95 the authors reported enhanced efficiency through the use of microalgae as raw material a dual acrylic chamber mfc was designed with titanium wires as anode and mixture of activated sludge and scenedesmus sp was used as a nutrient source resulting in the generation of the power density of 1 78

employing microalgae are a more economical natural alternative to comparatively expensive noble catalysts utilized for o2 reduction in conventional mfcs 9 the advantage of using microalgae at the cathode is the production of o2 which is consumed by the heterotrophic bacteria and the utilization of the co2 released by bacteria by the microalga several studies have been reported to date using different microalgal strains at the cathode in m mfcs table 2 among the microalgal strains utilized at the cathode c vulgaris has been the most extensively studied and efficient strain table 2 an m mfc using c vulgaris in a series of tubular photobioreactors at cathode resulted in 21 4 mw m2 which was 2 8 times higher as compared to the abiotic cathode 106 further when immobilized c vulgaris was used at the cathode power density 2 5 w m3 was generated with 9 4 columbian efficiency 108 a new type of m mfc microbial carbon capture cells with an inbuild ability to release exhaust gases into a cathodic chamber for microalgae growth produced an anode of 5 6 w m3 17 the authors also reported complete removal of co2 produced in anode in the cathode while the system is simultaneously utilized for treating wastewater and generate electricity moreover the utilization of microalgae biomass as a substrate in the anode and the utilization of co2 for microalgae growth in the cathode resulted in a power density of 1 9 w m2 along with 6 3 columbic efficiency 112 another c vulgaris based m mfc with toray carbon as electrodes cathode with proton exchange membrane resulted in 13 5 mw m2 power density 102 a pa mfc containing immobilized c vulgaris at the cathode compartment for wastewater treatment resulted in power density up to 2572 8 mw m2 at 5000 lux light intensity and 25 c table 2 liu et al designed another mfc with the help of photosynthetic c vulgaris 100 in this study the anode electrode was fabricated by carbon fiber brushes while the cathode electrode was made up of carbon felt containing pt catalyst using the nafion solution titanium wire was used to connect the cathode to continuously illuminate using white light led even in the dark and the whole chamber was covered and wrapped by an aluminum foil self generated carbon dioxide released from the anode part and utilized by microalga present at the cathode chamber through this system the maximum power density of 187 mw m2 was produced under the capture co2 and light radiance while a power density 146 mw m2 was produced when anode gas was not supplied in the cathode chamber 100 apart from c vulgaris scenedesmus obliquus was also found to be a promising substitute to generate bioelectricity in the mfc chamber table 2 the utilization of s obliquus at the cathode resulted in 32 higher power density as compared to conventional mfc 99 further deprivation s obliquus biomass generated several intermediates and by products among which acetic acid and lactic acid were major products 88 walter et al reported a cascade of 9 m mfcs which was operated sequentially such that the output of one mfc becomes the input of other m mfc in sequential mode 101 mfc was divided into 2 compartments of the anodic and cathodic chamber both the compartments were made of carbon fiber veil gas drippers were placed in each m mfc to avoid cross circuit due to the tap water which works as catholyte with a continuous flow of 5 ml min mfcs were continuously fed by pretreated algal biomass of synechococcus leopoliensis as an organic carbon source approximately 42 w of electrical power was generated per cubic meter of freshly culture algae as a result presence of pre digester in between photo chemostat and m mfcs cascade enhanced power production studies have also been conducted to analyze the effect of different cathodic materials on the efficiency of m mfcs for instance a comparison of carbon paper and carbon fiber brush as a cathodic material in m mfc showed the generation of higher power and biomass table 2 gajda et al developed the first biotic cell m mfc with photosynthetic microalga in the cathode chamber 9 light intensity affects the functioning of the cathode as it contains microalga as maximum power density was attained at 3000 lux after which a plateau for attained when desmodesmus sp was used at the cathode 106 furthermore continuous mode of light produces more power as compared to sequential batch mode 102 furthermore the electricity generation abilities of m mfc with altered algal growth cultures chlorella and phormidium spp have also been evaluated 107 an mfc using a double chamber made from plexiglass separated by cation exchange membrane with microalga at the cathode resulting in higher energy production when the immobilized algal culture was utilized 40 80 mw m2 compared to suspension culture 21 77 m wm2 108 6 integrated systems for energy production the utilization of integrated systems allows the growth of microalgae along with energy production an integrated m mfc was designed using microalga based cathode which produced 128 μw along with biomass generation 113 a closed circuit system was designed for biogas production by the utilization of photobioreactors for microalga growth the authors reported the production of biogas in the anaerobic tank by utilizing microalgal biomass as a substrate the system employed recirculation of anaerobically digested effluent still possessing nutrients into m mfc anode for complete oxidation 114 the study reported the production of microalgae biomass 24 30 tons vs ha year and biogas production of 0 5 nm3 kg of microalgal biomass an integrated m mfc for the production of biodiesel bioethanol and bioelectricity production was also established 115 the system utilized photobioreactor coupled to an m mfc and c vulgaris served as a photosynthetic organism that captured co2 generated at cathode this resulted in the generation of bioelectricity and simultaneous utilization of the generated microalgal biomass for biodiesel production owing to the high intracellular lipid content 115 such integrated systems demonstrate the possible production of a range of biofuels simultaneously and possessing economic cost and marginal impact on the environment 7 applications of m mfcs the m mfc can be used in a wide range of applications ranging from generation of bioelectricity bio hydrogen wastewater treatment removal of chemical compounds manufacture of biosensors etc 16 116 photosynthetic m mfc systems have been explored as a platform technology for a wide range of economic and industrial applications in terms of wastewater treatment recycling and power generation an ideal m mfc corresponds to an optimized digestion or utilization rate of a detritivorous with respect to the rate of microalgae biomass generation at the cathode the range of recycling mechanisms could be optimized in a broad perspective of the physical extraction of key elements e g nitrogen phosphorous sulfur etc however the mechanism should have the ability to sequestrate co2 and release o2 water biomass and energy meanwhile the generation of bioelectricity is the main objective in m mfc technology the subsequent treatment of wastewater has also been studied considerably karra et al examined the potential of wastewater treatment in m mfc using multiple anodes and cathodes in a continuous flow mode 117 they observed the greater efficiency of the treatment of wastewater in continuous mode with mixing flow while the flow of the plug created a gradient that increased the power density than the flow of mixing in another study m mfc was designed for the simultaneous study of biodegradation and bioenergy 118 119 m mfc integrated with microalgae strain c vulgaris showed a high removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater in addition to electricity generation integration with wastewater treatment and the production of m mfc hydrogen have a potential application in the area of biosensors the ph based water alert system makes it possible for m mfc application in the testing of drinking and wastewater quality m mfc water alert sensors ensure safe and secure water depending on the requirements 28 8 large scale studies on m mfcs and performances recent approaches in the development of microbial fuel cell technology have endorsed its scale up and real world implementations as precursors to commercialization the single mfc unit is inadequate to produce power output for numerous real world applications in terms of large scale an integrated 45 l membrane less stack with a municipal wastewater treatment plant has been established as pilot studies to demonstrate the stability even when operating with low concentration of cod 98 120 in another report the study focused on a 72 l stack made of 5 membrane based mfc units with a power density of 50 9 w m3 though it suffered losses of electrical current in the parallel circuit 121 a pilot study using brewery wastewater of a total volume of 90 l five 18 l modules used a cloth separator to avoid short circuits between the anode and cathode and used the electricity generated to drive the pumping system 122 9 challenges although microalgae based microbial fuel cells are an eco friendly and sustainable approach the technology remained with certain challenges it comprises the high cost of structural arrangements and the energy consumption for cultivation and harvesting another concern that arises in m mfcs is the ph membrane gradient that causes a reduction in cell voltage and output power this constraint occurs due to acid formation at the anode alkalinity formation at the cathode and nonspecific exchange of protons across the membrane in addition slower oxygen reductions in the cathode electrode are also a notable challenge to power generation in m mfc to ensure that m mfc technology is economically viable certain challenges need to be addressed before implementing on a large scale the key challenges and conceivable solutions include selection of microalgal stains and characterization of their biochemical composition carbohydrate and lipid profile for estimating their potential for power generation and integrated system wastewater provides the nutrients to the microalgae cell but sometimes it inhibits the growth of microalgae due to dark color and hazardous contaminants for this the dilution of wastewater and or primary treatment of wastewater is required large surface area required for the cathodic chamber to receive light for the microalgae photosynthesis the high growth of microalgae will decrease the penetration power of light in the depth of the photo cathodic chamber leads to inhibit growth the generation of energy is reduced rapidly due to the increase in the thickness of the biofilm in the biocathode both at the electrode site and at the current collector the constant current supply is needed to run a device but the voltage generation in m mfc is relatively low and production stability is not reliable microalgae cathodes face a major drawback since the biologically catalyzed cathode generates less energy compared to those chemically catalyzed membrane bio incrustation is responsible for a low proton transfer rate therefore periodic membrane change is required to operate continuously which leads to an increase in the process cost role of carbon source in microalgae fuel cell effect the growth mode autotrophic or mixotrophic of microalgae 10 conclusions the generation of renewable and sustainable bioenergy from organic wastewater substrates reveals self sustaining m mfc technology it has been described as a promising synergistic system for wastewater treatment and the generation of bioelectricity to reduce dependence on conventional energy in addition m mfcs have been recognized for their multipurpose applicability e g production of electricity and hydrogen bioremediation biosensor co2 sequestration etc the m mfc configuration and specifications mentioned above and their benefits offer sustainable technology for possible applications therefore it encourages applying as multitasking for wastewater treatment power generation and storage the characteristics of m mfc technologies offer outstanding and competitive technology in the production of current sustainable energy although there is abundant information available on the conductivity of ions and interaction with microalgae in electrochemical components exploration is necessary to develop cost effective and eco friendly materials the theoretical current voltage of several mfc is high however existing collection techniques cannot fully exploit this potential therefore continuous efforts are required to improve related tools and technology many m mfcs need improvements as existing information is inadequate to establish typical factors for various distinct mfcs hybrid m mfcs provide an advanced approach for researchers as well as the performance at citing accordingly wetland mfc benthic mfc and desalination mfc have drawn consideration to an agricultural area waterlogging and saltwater areas the scientific community has not fully established the mechanism of electron generation for several microorganisms e g bacteria microalgae fungi and green plants there is a lacuna of a strategic approach that has slowed down the progress of commonly established viable mfc as this system interconnects in many areas however environmentalists and scientific communities are currently involved in microbial science system fabrication procedures and improvement of technology comprehensive applied investigations are essential to study the interfaces among different substrates and microorganisms

13768,electricity generation from wastewater using a microalgae based microbial fuel cell mfc has captured a lot of attention from researchers these days microalgae microbial fuel cell m mfc is a device that can overcome the problem of fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution by generating electrical energy from wastewater and sunlight sustainable applications of the microalgae based microbial fuel cells are not only reliable for wastewater treatment and bio electricity generation but also versatile in the field of bio hydrogen energy production eco friendly solution of desalination and carbon sequestration in this review article we have summarized the mechanism and operational configuration of the microbial fuel cell using an anode chamber a cathode chamber and a separation membrane the technological advancement of photosynthetic microalgae in the microbial fuel cell for energy production and wastewater treatment has been explored the use of microalgae species such as the anode and cathode is also conferred with the resulting power densities the challenges and possible solutions of the microalgae microbial fuel cells in integrated energy production systems with wastewater treatment have been discussed for potential industrialization keywords microalgae microbial fuel cell wastewater treatment bio hydrogen bio electricity 1 introduction the upsurge in the global energy needs and the deficiency in the supply of non renewable energy resources have created a global energy crisis along with a dramatic increase in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental deterioration 1 the dependency and exploitation of conventional fossil fuels are the main causes of the depletion of natural energy reserves e g coal oil etc challenging the sustainability of the environment 2 therefore the development and utilization of renewable energy resources have gained momentum in recent years several renewable strategies are being considered to achieve a sustainable energy requirement and also to reduce the carbon footprint in addition the ever increasing wastewater generation has become one of the major environmental issues the rapid increase in wastewater generation from different resources namely domestic municipal industrial and agricultural is not only responsible for water pollution surface underground but also entails a hefty conventional energy cost for its treatment along with the release of greenhouse gases 3 indeed due to the consistent proliferation in industrial and economic growth expansions it is very difficult to reduce the wastewater generation the existing conventional wastewater treatment technologies including activated sludge drip filter membrane filter and reverse osmosis also membrane filter technique are ineffective in terms of energy requirements 4 in addition the biological treatment of wastewater is a slow practice while chemical processes have environmental concerns this scenario has called for the development of energy efficient cost effective and eco friendly wastewater treatment technologies in this regard microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that have an inherent ability to fix environmental as well as anthropogenic co2 along with the release of o2 into the environment which represents strategic importance to overcome global warming issues fig 1 microalgae also have the ability to survive under various environmental conditions and can grow in various sources of wastewater e g municipal industrial industrial domestic and agricultural wastewater mixtures and saline systems 5 microalgae absorb nutrients and toxic metals present in wastewater for their growth and as a result treat the wastewater s 6 recently several investigations reported the ability of microalgae to integrate with microbial fuel cells mfc 5 7 the integration of microalgae microbial fuel cell m mfc has become promising since these phototrophic organisms act as o2 generators in situ to facilitate the reaction in the cathode chamber in addition microalgae also efficiently remove phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater which may not be possible only with the mfc 8 therefore it offers on site wastewater treatment technology synchronized with sustainable electricity generation the practice of green energy production is a field of proliferation in the current scenario to recover the electrical energy of organic pollutants in wastewater the use of microalgae as a photosynthetic microorganism in mfc leads to the development of m mfc with an efficient approach to solving energy cost and environmental problems by simultaneously treating different wastewater along with electricity generation 9 this review catalogs the comprehensive information on the configuration of mfc hybrid systems their operating mechanisms the integration of microalgae in mfc and process parameters influencing the electricity generation further the limitations and challenges of photosynthetic m mfc are discussed by their perspective for synergistic applications for wastewater treatment bioelectricity generation desalination and production of value added chemicals since the m mfc system combines photo bioreactor for the cultivation of microalgae and mfc the review lists the merits and demerits of both the processes 2 microbial fuel cells mechanism and operational configuration microbial fuel cells are bio electrochemical systems that generate bio electricity with the help of biocatalytic reactions in the presence of electroactive microorganisms 10 11 in general an mfc consists of two compartments namely a cathode chamber and an anode chamber with an ion exchange membrane separator in the bio electrocatalytic mechanism of microbial fuel cells the anode respiring microbes generate electric current by oxidizing organic substrates at the anode in the electric current generation the anode respiring microbe transfers the electrons to an anode via extracellular electron transfer the transfer of electron can occur by means of direct interaction with outer membrane proteins electron transport distribution and solid biofilm components electron transport through a solid anodic biofilm observes high current densities with a less potential loss the biocatalytic oxidation of the substrate generates electrons and protons at the anode fig 2 electrons are then transferred to the anode surface by electronic mediators or carried by direct electron transfer via a proton membrane present on the surface of microorganisms 12 the electrons then flow to the cathode through an external circuit resulting in current flow from the cathode to anode simultaneously protons also move through the ion exchange membrane reaching the cathode chamber where electrons reduce oxygen to water the oxygen is pumped at the cathode is either pumped known as in dual chamber mfcs or via direct contact of the cathode with air designated as single chamber mfcs for proper functioning of the mfcs the concentration of dissolved oxygen do is critical as it determines the energy production previous studies have established an optimum do of 6 6 mg l in mfcs since the decrease in the do levels limits the current generation 13 14 moreover the variety of factors influencing performance e g temperature in mfc affects kinetics e g activation energy mass transfer coefficient and conductivity of solution thermodynamics e g free gibbs energy and electrode potential microbial ecology different environment for diverse species of the mfc system the variation reflects with respect to the following equations and output of the mfc power output 1 δg ηferevenergy potential 2 v mfc e0 mfc η anode η cathode i rint electromotive force 3 c x h y o z ph2o xco2 qh qe organic matter oxidation in the case of m mfcs photosynthetic microalgae species at cathode increase efficiency probably due to the generation of oxygen in the electrode chamber further the m mfc system is additionally valuable with co2 sequestration in the presence of light source the application is also useful in the recovery of wastewater via oxidation in the anodes and reduction in the cathode as well as in co2 sequestration via the reduction at the cathode with cell biomass production furthermore the use of oxygenated photosynthetic microalgae in the anode marks lower efficiency due to higher redox by oxygen generation while anaerobic microbes seem promising at this point in addition to electricity generation mfcs have demonstrated their potential application for wastewater treatment leachate treatment toxic gas treatment degradation of petroleum components hydrogen and methane production etc 15 16 in the bio electrocatalytic mechanism of pollutant removal degradation of the hydrophilic fraction preferably occurs for the fed dissolved organic substrates and generates humin with greater aromatic contents the general reactions involved in the degradation of organic pollutants have been represented in fig 3 the electric field of microbial reactions from the fuel cell to the cathode stimulates the cod decomposition actions and the biofilm nitrifier develops ammonium removal to this end numerous mfc designs and configurations have been developed for wastewater treatment that eliminates the consumption of additional electricity different hybrid mfc systems such as constructed wetlands cw mfc plant mfc mbr mfc mdc and mec have been reported for wastewater treatment 17 18 however there is a gap in a thorough evaluation of the mfc hybrid systems there is an exclusive interest in combining mfc with wastewater treatment to obtain a synergistic hybrid system for renewable energy and discussed in section 3 furthermore in the literature several studies on mfc have been reported in the approach of microalgae for cathode chamber electrode materials membranes electrocatalysts removal of various contaminants and bio electrochemical processes 19 20 the integration of microalgae with mfc is efficient i e m mfc to convert sunlight into electricity through the process of photosynthesis in microalgae cells also m mfc sequestrates co2 from the environment in addition to removing n p and heavy metal contaminants from wastewater 21 2 1 anodic chamber anode chamber is among the most crucial component of any mfc since the generation of electricity occurs here and thus called the heart of mfc along with power generation the reduction of organic compounds chemical oxygen demand cod hydrogen production treatment of wastewater biofilm formation takes place at the anode chamber 22 23 it is crucial to select the appropriate material for preparing anode in order to maximize mfc efficiency while selecting anode material several characteristic features including high photochemical stability high conductivity and low resistance need to be considered the commonly utilized non metallic anode material include carbon paper carbon rod brush graphite rod plate carbon foam etc 24 25 besides anode material microbial species consortia substrate utilized mediators ph are other factors that influence the overall efficiency of mfc studies have been conducted to evaluate different anode material design substrates in order to optimize the maximum power generation from mfc 22 26 poor interaction of the traditional carbon electrode is one of the major concerns while designing mfc to overcome this the utilization of modified anode has been suggested modification is considered to provide comparatively more active sites ultimately resulting in enhanced electron transfer paul et al reported enhanced efficiency approximately 3 6 times higher when grapheme oxide zeolite was utilized as an anode as a modification of carbon felt anode 27 in another study modified anodic macro porous graphite carbon foam mgcf possessing coating of polydopamine was utilized which increased the microbe interaction and electron transfer 28 another modified electrode multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt showed an increase in the microbial biofilm development resulting in about 49 enhanced power generation compared to that attained when an unmodified electrode was utilized 29 the utilization of natural substances such as carbonized plant trunk bamboo coconut husk recycled paper as an electrode in anode chamber is advantageous since these materials are economical and possess the inherent ability to enhance the microbial biofilm attachment 30 moreover metal anodes have also resulted in high power generation in addition to this a combination of carbon and metal also enhances overall efficiency apart from this decorated anode material also enhances the interaction of microbes with the anode the substrates which act as carbon source and as a nutrient source for the microbial growth are also potential anode material the chemical energy stored in substrates is converted into electrical energy by metabolic activities of microbes 31 these substrates can be pure compounds to wastewater obtained from the meat industry sewage dairy industry paper industry etc 32 33 along with anodic material and substrate the type of microorganism also influences the efficiency of an mfc 34 the microbes metabolize the substrate using key metabolic pathways namely glycolysis kreb s cycle and electron transport chain etc leading to atp synthesis 35 37 in the process several compounds components of etc are involved in an electron shuttle occurring from microbial membranes to the cell to the electron receptor 38 hence bacteria that could be transported externally are preferred for mfc microbes unable to transport electrons outside the membrane require additional mediators such as methylene blue thionine neutral red ferricyanide etc to bring out the transport of electrons from the membrane to the electrodes 39 2 2 cathodic chamber in a two chamber mfc the cathode acts as an electron and proton receiver whereas in one chambered mfc the air cathode functions as a receiver of the electrons electron accepting molecules present in cathode bring out the reduction of electrons which also completes the electron cycle 40 41 several molecules have been utilized to bring out the cathodic reduction such as chlorate tetrachloroethane perchlorate ferric ions nitrite sodium bromated potassium ferricyanide dichloroethane fumarate hexavalent chromium etc 42 43 moreover the anodic materials can also act as cathodes however a catalyst along with a binder is required for the proper functioning of the air cathode numerous materials including carbon or graphite felt carbon fiber brush carbon cloth graphite fiber brush double sided cloth a mesh of carbon or stainless steel have been utilized as a cathode in the mfcs 44 46 air cathodes made of metals require to be supplemented with a catalyst e g activated carbon and a binder e g polytetrafluoroethylene however the utilization of catalysts is not mandatory for all cathodes for instance cathodes having potassium ferricyanide can as an electron acceptor does not require any catalyst studies have been conducted to achieve the reduction of the air cathode layer along with enhancing the efficiency of mfcs for example santoro et al provided a comparative analysis of the performance of cathode having different platinum charges which increased energy production 26 the authors reported that the utilization of the air cathode having 0 5 1 0 mg pt cm2 resulted in enhanced power generation another study utilized cathode made from ni c fiber coated with activated carbon and reported an increase in the power density with a simultaneous decrease in the resistance in mfc 47 further an mfc possessing ni foam supplemented with a catalyst activated c and a binder ptfe produced current comparable to that of the carbon cloth platinum electrode 48 2 3 separating membrane the anodic and cathodic chambers are separated by a separating membrane through which the transfer of protons is accomplished an efficient separator must possess specific characteristics features including a high rate of proton transfer low permeability to gas thermally stable and resistance to biotic contamination 49 the separators can be of two main categories based on the type of the material selective size separator and the mechanism for proton exchange ion exchange membrane based on the exchange mechanism the membrane could be cation exchange membrane anion exchange membrane proton exchange membrane porous polymer composite and bipolar membrane in context to power generation nafion has proved to be an effective separator owing to its high rate of proton transfer stable nature and lower resistance 49 50 however the primary concern of using nafion is the high cost associated with the material along with its higher permeability of o2 and the exchange of cations keeping this into consideration other alternatives to nafion have utilized for instance a composite separating membrane was developed comprising of polyvinyl alcohol borosilicate and nafion polyvinyl borosilicate 51 the cost of the reported composite membrane was about 11 times less than as compared to the cost of only nafion further sulfonated ketone ether polyether membrane polysulfone based anion exchange membrane sulfonated polybenzimidazole as proton exchange membrane sulfonated poly imide ether with fluorenyl and trifluoromethyl for the manufacture of membranes glass wool glass fiber membrane etc are other reported separating membranes 52 53 3 wastewater and treatment with mfc wastewater is defined as any water that has been negatively affected in quality by anthropogenic activities it consists of liquid and solid waste that is generated from domestic commercial industrial or agricultural sources 54 the traditional biological treatment systems for wastewater require high operating costs and result in large amounts of sludge as secondary pollutants 55 to this end several investigations have focused on the development and deployment of cost effective wastewater treatments among these treatments it s the utilization of mfc as it requires low cost of operation energy balance low environmental footprints lower sludge formation and no aeration requirements fig 4 56 depending upon the source and nature of pollutants different types of mfc have been designed to achieve efficient wastewater treatment 40 57 both single as well as double chambered mfc has been utilized for the treatment of wastewater previous studies conducted have revealed the potential of single chamber mfcs for effective treatment of domestic wastewater as well as effluents obtained from several industries including petroleum dairy brewery distillery etc 58 wastewater containing organic pollutants is degraded by the microorganisms for their growth is fed into the anodic chamber the metabolic process results in the generation of electrons and protons which are utilized for the generation of bioelectricity ahn and logan reported a single chambered air cathode mfc for wastewater treatment mode 59 while zhang et al developed an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor microbial fuel cell biological aerated filter uasb mfc baf system for the treatment of molasses wastewater and the generation of bioelectricity simultaneously the high strength molasses wastewater was supplied with a chemical oxygen demand cod of 127 500 mg l which generated a maximum power density of 1410 2 mw m2 with a current density of 4947 9 ma m2 in this the total cod sulfate and color removal efficiencies were observed at 53 2 52 7 and 41 1 respectively 60 a pilot scale mfc system consisting of a multi anode cathode configuration was also evaluated for wastewater treatment 28 although the mfc is recognized as a self sustaining and energy efficient alternative technology concerns persist pertaining to process optimization 30 system configurations along with material utilized for electrodes surface area hydraulic retention time are the key factors that need to be considered while designing mfc based wastewater remediation systems 61 indeed the large volume of wastewater treatment needs to be addressed adequately for commercial applications hence efforts are required to design a cost effective mfc based system that can be stably and efficiently operated for long term mitigation of wastewater s 62 the difficulty in the application of mfc is mainly the cost of installation due to the expensive proton exchange membrane the cathode implemented with pt and the use of mediators in the cathode current research focuses on a cost effective mfc with single chamber architecture without the proton exchange membrane through the use of biocathodes 44 mfc with a double chamber system the pollutants serve as electron acceptors and abiotic treatment of organic pollutants is achieved in the cathode chamber the anaerobic anodic chamber is filled with organic pollutants to be treated along with bio electrochemically active microbes which bring out the oxidation of pollutants 40 electron acceptors in the cathode derived from wastewater reduce the electrons and a potential difference is generated which results in the production of bioelectricity 63 dual chambered mfc has been demonstrated to possess the potential to treat wastewater produced in brewing and food processing industry distillery slaughterhouse water containing azo dyes polyaromatic hydrocarbons metals such as cu v electroplating water 64 the wastewater obtained from various industries or domestic sewage water any polluted water contains several types of impurities and contaminants hence it is practically impossible to remove degrade all the pollutants through a single treatment process this necessitates the utilization of hybrid systems and co integrated mfcs a few of the hybrid and integrated mfcs include wetland mfc cw mfc sediment mfcs s mfc floating macrophyte based mfc fm mfc earthen pot mfc system and mfc fenton which were for effective treatment of wastewater containing a mixture of pollutants 65 the mac mfc multiple anode cathode with 12 anodes cathodes systems have been reported to eliminate about 80 of pollutants present in domestic wastewater along with the generation of the power density of 300 380 mw m2 moreover an increase in the number of electrodes resulted in better power generation a hybrid system comprising of a single chambered mfc sc mfc and an anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor mfc afmbr was designed to achieve two stage treatment of wastewater it was worked with a high permeate flow of 16 l m2 h for more than 50 days in which the total electrical energy used for the process of the mfc afmbr system was 0 0186 kw h m3 which was slightly less than the electrical energy generated by the mfc 0 0197 kw h m3 64 the authors accomplished the wastewater treatment in two stages with the initial treatment in mfc followed by the treatment of wastewater in afmbr where removal of total suspended solids and cod 92 5 took place as in the case of any mfc electricity generation was simultaneously achieved along with water treatment hydrolytic up flow sludge blanket husb cw mfc is another system pilot scale designed by corbella et al for domestic wastewater treatment the primary treatment of wastewater was accomplished in the husb reactor followed by the pumping of the wastewater in the horizontal subsurface flow hssf cw mfc system for further treatment secondary 65 the authors reported a 61 cod removal with a generation of 219 ma m2 power density in another study the fme mfc system was tested for domestic as well as distillery wastewater treatment 66 the system utilized floating macrophyte ecosystems which was fed with wastewater to be treated a cod removal of 71 with volatile fatty acid 70 removal was successfully achieved in the above system with a maximum power density of 80 08 mw m2 67 furthermore a low cost cw mfcs system operated on the pilot scale for wastewater treatment has been successfully established 68 however efforts are required for scaling up of these pilot or laboratory scale systems for large scale operation 4 photosynthetic microalgae characteristics microalgae are an extremely diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic microorganisms that exist in a wide range of habitats including freshwater to marine water environment 69 microalgae are a promising source for biomass generation which can be utilized for the production of an array of industrial relevant high value antioxidants nutraceuticals vitamins pigments etc and biofuels this is due to their ease of cultivation under controlled conditions with faster growth cycles non dependence on climatic conditions high areal productivity and year round productivity as compared to eukaryotic counterparts particularly plants 70 71 photosynthesis in microalgae helps to generate biochemical energy by converting solar energy accounting for more than fifty percent of the photosynthetic productivity on the earth the higher growth rate and co2 fixation of microalgae are important when considering them for bioenergy production 72 73 the photosynthetic process is a bio redox reaction carried out by microalgae using co2 and light photons to synthesize carbohydrates and release oxygen as well as the synthesis of additional complex biomolecules 74 75 since microalgae need light for phototrophic growth it is generally cultivated either in a natural outdoor raceway ponds or artificial indoor photobioreactors light conditions 76 the autotrophic growth of microalgae occurs using co2 as a carbon source under light illumination in an aquatic environment 77 different microalgal species have also demonstrated their ability to grow under heterotrophic conditions dark replacing co2 fixation with organic carbon sources present in the growth media 78 additionally microalgae can also grow under mixotrophy which combines photosynthesis and respiratory metabolism in simultaneous operation in parallel assimilation of co2 and sequestration of organic carbon 79 the microalgae production process begins from the screening and isolation of strains cultivation in an appropriate medium harvesting of biomass for the synthesis of the post processing target product from the biomass 80 5 microalgae in microbial fuel cells m mfcs microalgae fuel cells are a microalgae mediated bio electrochemical system for transforming carbonaceous substances to bio electricity 81 in a typical microalgae microbial fuel cell m mfc microalgal cells produce o2 by utilizing solar energy and nutrients bicarbonates and co2 released by the heterotrophic bacteria which take up the released o2 and the organic content fig 5 82 typically the microalgae fuel cells are made up of two chambers i e anode and cathode separated by a membrane 83 in the first step the organic inorganic substrate gets converted into electrons and protons in the anodic chamber the degradation of the waste biomass takes place in the anodic chamber due to microbial activity and supplies electrons and protons then these electrons are transferred to the microalgal cell to electrodes in addition the transferred electrons reached from anode to cathode by an external circuit at the same time proton infusion takes place from the anode to the cathode proton migration has been assisted by proton cation exchange membrane while electrons flow through the electrodes from the anodic chamber to the cathodic chamber 84

85 in this m mfc c vulgaris acted as an electron acceptor and utilized co2 produced at the cathode for its growth various microalgae species have also been reported to act as electron donors acceptors simultaneously 86 there exists a functional difference between m mfc which can work under both light and dark conditions and mfc require light for electricity generation the sections below detail the utilization of microalgae at anode and cathode chambers 5 1 microalgae at the anode chamber the microalgae at the anode chamber generate electrons and protons during the light phase while in the dark conditions oxidation of the organic substrates takes place by utilization of the oxygen liberated in the light period resulting in the production of energy 94 the list of previously reported studies that utilized different microalgal strain at the anode is provided in table 1 indeed the utilization of different microalgae at the anode has resulted in different power output generation for instance the comparative analysis of two m mfcs one based on c vulgaris and other containing marine algae dunaliella tertiolecta for municipal sewage sludge reported the former algal strain to be better at generating power further since microalgae are a photosynthetic microorganism the light intensity and wavelength impact its growth and in turn the power output for example when m mfc containing chlamydomonas reinhardtii was irradiated with red light with high light intensity 900 lux it generated more power output as compared to blue light and lower light intensities 100 300 and 600 lux in another study a process was designed for the utilization of anolyte produced in terracotta based m mfc 95 the authors reported enhanced efficiency through the use of microalgae as raw material a dual acrylic chamber mfc was designed with titanium wires as anode and mixture of activated sludge and scenedesmus sp was used as a nutrient source resulting in the generation of the power density of 1 78 w m2 87 kondaveeti et al utilized h type double chamber mfc with ion exchange separators pretreated with nafion and cation exchange membrane cmi using scenedesmus obliquus at the anode made from pt coated carbon paper 88 the authors have reported 118 mw m2 and 114 mw m2 power generation from nafion and cmi ion exchange separators respectively table 1 the utilization of chlorella pyrenoidosa as the anode of m mfc was also successfully reported for electricity generation 96 the study designed two m mfc models one with graphite and the other with a carbon electrode without any mediator in the first model the microalgae were grown at the anode and cathode was made from potassium ferricyanide while in the second model live microalgae were present both at anode and cathode under different growth conditions the maximum power density was obtained 6030 mw m2 via the first model table 1 photosynthetic microbial cell pmcs containing spirullina platensis designed without mediators or any organic substrate and membrane resulted in a power output of 6 6 mw m2 90 nishio et al suggested algal biomass could be utilized as fuel to generate electricity in mfc 91 they reported algal biomass conversion into organic acids and power conversion efficiency pce was relatively high in algal mfc the author s designed equal sized graphite carbonated electrodes with fixed plexiglas acrylic sheet chambers using silicone to maintain anaerobic conditions in the anodic chamber wastewater was added to the anodic chamber by a peristaltic pump the effluent from anode chamber first entered into the water seal box and then transferred into the intermediate chamber which was finally discharged into the effluent tank using gravity or can also be collected for testing and further analysis the study reported covered anodic chamber to always produced high voltage and power density 3 35 m wm2 as compared to uncovered anodic 2 39 mw m2 compartment 5 2 microalgae at the cathode chamber biocathodes employing microalgae are a more economical natural alternative to comparatively expensive noble catalysts utilized for o2 reduction in conventional mfcs 9 the advantage of using microalgae at the cathode is the production of o2 which is consumed by the heterotrophic bacteria and the utilization of the co2 released by bacteria by the microalga several studies have been reported to date using different microalgal strains at the cathode in m mfcs table 2 among the microalgal strains utilized at the cathode c vulgaris has been the most extensively studied and efficient strain table 2 an m mfc using c vulgaris in a series of tubular photobioreactors at cathode resulted in 21 4 mw m2 which was 2 8 times higher as compared to the abiotic cathode 106 further when immobilized c vulgaris was used at the cathode power density 2 5 w m3 was generated with 9 4 columbian efficiency 108 a new type of m mfc microbial carbon capture cells with an inbuild ability to release exhaust gases into a cathodic chamber for microalgae growth produced an anode of 5 6 w m3 17 the authors also reported complete removal of co2 produced in anode in the cathode while the system is simultaneously utilized for treating wastewater and generate electricity moreover the utilization of microalgae biomass as a substrate in the anode and the utilization of co2 for microalgae growth in the cathode resulted in a power density of 1 9 w m2 along with 6 3 columbic efficiency 112 another c vulgaris based m mfc with toray carbon as electrodes cathode with proton exchange membrane resulted in 13 5 mw m2 power density 102 a pa mfc containing immobilized c vulgaris at the cathode compartment for wastewater treatment resulted in power density up to 2572 8 mw m2 at 5000 lux light intensity and 25 c table 2 liu et al designed another mfc with the help of photosynthetic c vulgaris 100 in this study the anode electrode was fabricated by carbon fiber brushes while the cathode electrode was made up of carbon felt containing pt catalyst using the nafion solution titanium wire was used to connect the cathode to continuously illuminate using white light led even in the dark and the whole chamber was covered and wrapped by an aluminum foil self generated carbon dioxide released from the anode part and utilized by microalga present at the cathode chamber through this system the maximum power density of 187 mw m2 was produced under the capture co2 and light radiance while a power density 146 mw m2 was produced when anode gas was not supplied in the cathode chamber 100 apart from c vulgaris scenedesmus obliquus was also found to be a promising substitute to generate bioelectricity in the mfc chamber table 2 the utilization of s obliquus at the cathode resulted in 32 higher power density as compared to conventional mfc 99 further deprivation s obliquus biomass generated several intermediates and by products among which acetic acid and lactic acid were major products 88 walter et al reported a cascade of 9 m mfcs which was operated sequentially such that the output of one mfc becomes the input of other m mfc in sequential mode 101 mfc was divided into 2 compartments of the anodic and cathodic chamber both the compartments were made of carbon fiber veil gas drippers were placed in each m mfc to avoid cross circuit due to the tap water which works as catholyte with a continuous flow of 5 ml min mfcs were continuously fed by pretreated algal biomass of synechococcus leopoliensis as an organic carbon source approximately 42 w of electrical power was generated per cubic meter of freshly culture algae as a result presence of pre digester in between photo chemostat and m mfcs cascade enhanced power production studies have also been conducted to analyze the effect of different cathodic materials on the efficiency of m mfcs for instance a comparison of carbon paper and carbon fiber brush as a cathodic material in m mfc showed the generation of higher power and biomass table 2 gajda et al developed the first biotic cell m mfc with photosynthetic microalga in the cathode chamber 9 light intensity affects the functioning of the cathode as it contains microalga as maximum power density was attained at 3000 lux after which a plateau for attained when desmodesmus sp was used at the cathode 106 furthermore continuous mode of light produces more power as compared to sequential batch mode 102 furthermore the electricity generation abilities of m mfc with altered algal growth cultures chlorella and phormidium spp have also been evaluated 107 an mfc using a double chamber made from plexiglass separated by cation exchange membrane with microalga at the cathode resulting in higher energy production when the immobilized algal culture was utilized 40 80 mw m2 compared to suspension culture 21 77 m wm2 108 6 integrated systems for energy production the utilization of integrated systems allows the growth of microalgae along with energy production an integrated m mfc was designed using microalga based cathode which produced 128 μw along with biomass generation 113 a closed circuit system was designed for biogas production by the utilization of photobioreactors for microalga growth the authors reported the production of biogas in the anaerobic tank by utilizing microalgal biomass as a substrate the system employed recirculation of anaerobically digested effluent still possessing nutrients into m mfc anode for complete oxidation 114 the study reported the production of microalgae biomass 24 30 tons vs ha year and biogas production of 0 5 nm3 kg of microalgal biomass an integrated m mfc for the production of biodiesel bioethanol and bioelectricity production was also established 115 the system utilized photobioreactor coupled to an m mfc and c vulgaris served as a photosynthetic organism that captured co2 generated at cathode this resulted in the generation of bioelectricity and simultaneous utilization of the generated microalgal biomass for biodiesel production owing to the high intracellular lipid content 115 such integrated systems demonstrate the possible production of a range of biofuels simultaneously and possessing economic cost and marginal impact on the environment 7 applications of m mfcs the m mfc can be used in a wide range of applications ranging from generation of bioelectricity bio hydrogen wastewater treatment removal of chemical compounds manufacture of biosensors etc 16 116 photosynthetic m mfc systems have been explored as a platform technology for a wide range of economic and industrial applications in terms of wastewater treatment recycling and power generation an ideal m mfc corresponds to an optimized digestion or utilization rate of a detritivorous with respect to the rate of microalgae biomass generation at the cathode the range of recycling mechanisms could be optimized in a broad perspective of the physical extraction of key elements e g nitrogen phosphorous sulfur etc however the mechanism should have the ability to sequestrate co2 and release o2 water biomass and energy meanwhile the generation of bioelectricity is the main objective in m mfc technology the subsequent treatment of wastewater has also been studied considerably karra et al examined the potential of wastewater treatment in m mfc using multiple anodes and cathodes in a continuous flow mode 117 they observed the greater efficiency of the treatment of wastewater in continuous mode with mixing flow while the flow of the plug created a gradient that increased the power density than the flow of mixing in another study m mfc was designed for the simultaneous study of biodegradation and bioenergy 118 119 m mfc integrated with microalgae strain c vulgaris showed a high removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater in addition to electricity generation integration with wastewater treatment and the production of m mfc hydrogen have a potential application in the area of biosensors the ph based water alert system makes it possible for m mfc application in the testing of drinking and wastewater quality m mfc water alert sensors ensure safe and secure water depending on the requirements 28 8 large scale studies on m mfcs and performances recent approaches in the development of microbial fuel cell technology have endorsed its scale up and real world implementations as precursors to commercialization the single mfc unit is inadequate to produce power output for numerous real world applications in terms of large scale an integrated 45 l membrane less stack with a municipal wastewater treatment plant has been established as pilot studies to demonstrate the stability even when operating with low concentration of cod 98 120 in another report the study focused on a 72 l stack made of 5 membrane based mfc units with a power density of 50 9 w m3 though it suffered losses of electrical current in the parallel circuit 121 a pilot study using brewery wastewater of a total volume of 90 l five 18 l modules used a cloth separator to avoid short circuits between the anode and cathode and used the electricity generated to drive the pumping system 122 9 challenges although microalgae based microbial fuel cells are an eco friendly and sustainable approach the technology remained with certain challenges it comprises the high cost of structural arrangements and the energy consumption for cultivation and harvesting another concern that arises in m mfcs is the ph membrane gradient that causes a reduction in cell voltage and output power this constraint occurs due to acid formation at the anode alkalinity formation at the cathode and nonspecific exchange of protons across the membrane in addition slower oxygen reductions in the cathode electrode are also a notable challenge to power generation in m mfc to ensure that m mfc technology is economically viable certain challenges need to be addressed before implementing on a large scale the key challenges and conceivable solutions include selection of microalgal stains and characterization of their biochemical composition carbohydrate and lipid profile for estimating their potential for power generation and integrated system wastewater provides the nutrients to the microalgae cell but sometimes it inhibits the growth of microalgae due to dark color and hazardous contaminants for this the dilution of wastewater and or primary treatment of wastewater is required large surface area required for the cathodic chamber to receive light for the microalgae photosynthesis the high growth of microalgae will decrease the penetration power of light in the depth of the photo cathodic chamber leads to inhibit growth the generation of energy is reduced rapidly due to the increase in the thickness of the biofilm in the biocathode both at the electrode site and at the current collector the constant current supply is needed to run a device but the voltage generation in m mfc is relatively low and production stability is not reliable microalgae cathodes face a major drawback since the biologically catalyzed cathode generates less energy compared to those chemically catalyzed membrane bio incrustation is responsible for a low proton transfer rate therefore periodic membrane change is required to operate continuously which leads to an increase in the process cost role of carbon source in microalgae fuel cell effect the growth mode autotrophic or mixotrophic of microalgae 10 conclusions the generation of renewable and sustainable bioenergy from organic wastewater substrates reveals self sustaining m mfc technology it has been described as a promising synergistic system for wastewater treatment and the generation of bioelectricity to reduce dependence on conventional energy in addition m mfcs have been recognized for their multipurpose applicability e g production of electricity and hydrogen bioremediation biosensor co2 sequestration etc the m mfc configuration and specifications mentioned above and their benefits offer sustainable technology for possible applications therefore it encourages applying as multitasking for wastewater treatment power generation and storage the characteristics of m mfc technologies offer outstanding and competitive technology in the production of current sustainable energy although there is abundant information available on the conductivity of ions and interaction with microalgae in electrochemical components exploration is necessary to develop cost effective and eco friendly materials the theoretical current voltage of several mfc is high however existing collection techniques cannot fully exploit this potential therefore continuous efforts are required to improve related tools and technology many m mfcs need improvements as existing information is inadequate to establish typical factors for various distinct mfcs hybrid m mfcs provide an advanced approach for researchers as well as the performance at citing accordingly wetland mfc benthic mfc and desalination mfc have drawn consideration to an agricultural area waterlogging and saltwater areas the scientific community has not fully established the mechanism of electron generation for several microorganisms e g bacteria microalgae fungi and green plants there is a lacuna of a strategic approach that has slowed down the progress of commonly established viable mfc as this system interconnects in many areas however environmentalists and scientific communities are currently involved in microbial science system fabrication procedures and improvement of technology comprehensive applied investigations are essential to study the interfaces among different substrates and microorganisms in addition for forthcoming advancement and sustainable progress in the economic world m mfc is the highly promising technique and the major area of research investigations declaration of competing

13769,in this study acetic acid and methanol were recovered from dimethyl terephthalate process wastewater using cross flow membrane and membrane distillation processes different types of ultrafiltration up150 and up005 and nanofiltration nf270 and nf90 were tested in cross flow membrane filtration to recover acetic acid from wastewater nf90 membrane supplied maximum acetic acid rejection efficiency and it increased from 39 6 to 46 9 when applied pressure increased from 10 to 20 bar the effect of solution ph was also tested and the rejection efficiency of acetic acid increased from 46 9 to 100 when the ph was increased from 2 5 to 7 0 however methanol rejection efficiency did not affect with pressure and ph change methanol rich solution obtained from nf90 membrane permeate was recovered by vacuum membrane distillation 95 methanol recovery was obtained by hydrophobic polypropylene pp membrane at 250 ml min flow rates sem images and contact angles of clean and used membranes were also provided and the results showed that hydrophilic organic acids deposited on the membrane surface increased the hydrophilicity keywords dmt process wastewater pressure driven membrane process membrane distillation acetic acid recovery methanol recovery 1 introduction dimethyl terephthalate dmt is an organic compound which is commonly used in the petrochemical industry and production of polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate pet polytrimethylene terephthalate ptt and polybutylene terephthalate pbt dmt is the diester compound formed from terephthalic acid and methanol 1 dmt is among the top 50 in the list of most produced chemicals worldwide and it is commonly used as a raw material of polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles 2 3 it is also used as the raw material in the production of materials such as polyester films packaging materials and textile fibers 4 dmt production process consumes large amounts of water and 3 10 tons of wastewater is generated for 1 ton of dmt production this kind of wastewater has a great environmental risk 3 moreover the degradation products of phthalates and esters have been listed as priority pollutants by the us epa due to their toxic effects 5 many different treatment processes related to the treatment of dmt wastewater have been developed and implemented until today physicochemical methods such as coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation and adsorption and aerobic anaerobic biological treatment methods are the leading treatment processes 6 7 more economical methods have been investigated in the treatment of this wastewater due to the fact that active sludge processes cannot be applied efficiently because of the reasons such as high hydraulic retention time 3 5 days high oxygen requirement and sludge swelling problems although anaerobic treatment processes seem advantageous in the treatment of this wastewater compared to aerobic processes the use of intensive chemicals for the elimination of inhibitors such as p toluic acid terephthalic acid formaldehyde from dmt process wastewater is the most important factor that restricts anaerobic process 8 wastewater with high chemical oxygen demand cod ranging from 17 142 g l is formed during the production of dmt moreover the main aromatic compounds in purified terephthalic acid pta wastewater are p toluic acid p ta benzoic acid ba acetic acid aa phthalic acid pa and terephthalic acid ta 9 11 studies have shown that dmt has acute and chronic toxicity effects 12 dmt and their reduction intermediates cause cancer and inflammation in the kidneys 13 therefore the us environmental protection agency epa has added these chemicals to the priority pollutant class 14 sharma et al 1994 investigated the effect of biomass supporting particles bsp on anaerobic breakdown of dmt wastewater 15 they reported that the formaldehyde in the wastewater had a toxic effect on microorganisms in the anaerobic system the bsp system was found to resist formaldehyde toxicity of up to 375 mg l as against 125 mg l in the control system they also reported that the bsp system operated for 15 days recovered faster than the control operated for 25 30 days 15 in another study shah et al 1998 investigated the effect of bsp on the aerobic bio treatment of dmt wastewater 16 86 cod removal efficiency was obtained for 20 h in wastewater containing 2000 mg l cod however similar cod removal efficiency was achieved for 6 h when bsp was used in the reactor the optimum hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate was 12 h and 14 kg cod m3 d respectively to obtain 90 cod removal efficiency in the aerobic reactor containing bsp however cod removal efficiency was 40 45 in the control reactor not containing bsp 16 the biodegradation of dmt by separate bacterial species isolated from the mangrove sediment was investigated 17 they reported that some bacterial species could use dmt alone as a carbon source and even wastewater containing 98 mg dmt l was completely degraded by pasteurella multocidasa within 60 h 17 it was emphasized that esterase was the key enzyme that played a role in microbial degradation of phthalate esters and dmt lysis efficiency was investigated by esterase purified from fusarium sp a coastal sediment fungus 18 they reported that the most suitable temperature for enzyme activity was 50 c with the optimal ph 8 18 it is well known that pressure driven membrane processes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been used intensively until today they have unique ability to separate and purify products from process streams 19 among these membrane processes applications of nf stand out for separation purification and concentration of products from streams nf was applied to separate fermentation products 20 to concentrate sugar 21 to recover of organic acids from fermentation broth 22 therefore nf can offer an alternative way to separate acetic acid from methanol in recent years membrane distillation md processes have increased their popularity for water engineering 23 thermal gradient generated between a feed and a permeate side across a microporous hydrophobic membrane was used in md process 24 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd was used for the treatment of rubber processing effluent and at least 96 removal efficiencies of total organic carbon toc color turbidity and conductivity were obtained for rubber industry wastewater 25 purwasasmita et al 2015 investigated performance of non porous thin film composite polyamide membrane distillation during beer dealcoholization process it was reported that the alcohol content could be reduced from 5 vol to 2 45 vol in 6 h 26 in another study sucrose was concentrated in a vacuum membrane distillation vmd system using hydrophobic alumina hollow fiber membranes 27 an 8 l 10 brix sucrose solution was effectively concentrated to 50 brix by removing 6 4 l of water using the vmd system in this study acetic acid and methanol recovery from dimethyl terephthalate process wastewater were carried out by cross flow membrane and membrane distillation processes respectively two different types of ultrafiltration uf membranes up150 and up005 and nf membranes nf270 and nf90 were tested to recover acetic acid using cross flow membrane system moreover methanol was recovered by vacuum membrane distillation vmd using two different types of microfiltration mf membranes pp and ptfe 2 materials and methods 2 1 specifications of dmt wastewater the wastewater used in this study was obtained from sasa polyester company adana turkey sasa has the biggest dmt production capacity in the world with 280 000 tons year dmt is the main monomer of pet and pbt polymers and the main end use of dmt is polyester production a 10 l wastewater was taken and stored at 4 c until use some specifications of wastewater are given in table 1 as can be seen from the table acetic acid and methanol constituted approximately 60 of the main polluting components in wastewater each sample was analyzed in duplicate 2 2 experimental setup of cross flow filtration system the system shown in fig 1 a was used for cross flow filtration experiments the system consisted of the following components high pressure resistant membrane module wastewater feed tank high pressure pump manometers flow meter and water bath with circulator all parts of the system were made of 316 stainless steel the system had a total feeding volume of 10 l with a membrane area of 150 cm2 the pressure of the system was adjusted by needle valves the wastewater was pumped from the feed tank to the membrane cell by the high pressure pump a coolant was available to keep the solution in the feed tank at constant temperature the obtained filtrate was transferred to the computer on line with a scale and the flux was calculated during the experiments the temperature of the system was kept constant 25 1 c with the help of the water bath circulator the membranes used in the experiments were placed in a membrane cell made of stainless steel the filtration pressure was adjusted with the valves located at the entrance of the membrane cell and read from the pressure gauges the time varying weight of the filtrate collected on the balance was recorded on a computer at 60 s intervals acetic acid and methanol concentrations in the permeate were measured at the end of each experiment the permeate flux was calculated using eq 1 1 j w q a δ t where q is the trans membrane volumetric flow l a is the effective membrane area m2 δt is the filtration time h 2 3 properties of membranes used in filtration studies the membranes used in the experimental studies were obtained by microdyn nadir and dow filmtec companies two different types of uf membranes up150 and up005 and nf membranes nf270 and nf90 were tested for acetic acid and methanol recovery uf membranes were operated at 5 bar whereas nf membranes were operated at 10 15 20 bar the wastewater ph was arranged to 4 0 4 7 7 0 and acetic acid and methanol rejection were measured versus ph the general properties of the membranes are given in table s1 all membranes were hydrophilic and they were kept in distilled water for 1 day before used in experiments the membranes were cut in suitable sizes for the filtration system and their active surfaces were placed in the membrane module in contact with the wastewater 2 4 vacuum membrane distillation experiment setup the vacuum membrane distillation vmd process is shown in fig 1b polypropylene pp and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with 0 45 μm pore size were tested with 50 100 250 ml min pump circulation rate the high concentration of methanol obtained from the cross flow membrane process was fed to the membrane distillation system using a peristaltic pump methanol rich wastewater was heated up to 60 c and permeate side was cooled up to 20 c methanol with a boiling point of 64 7 c 1 atm will have a lower boiling point under vacuum for this reason the solution was heated to 60 c and methanol was recovered in the vmd system 2 5 analysis procedure cod analysis was performed according to the closed reflux method standard method 5220 c mettler toledo multi meter was used to measure ph and conductivity acetic acid and methanol analyzes of the samples were carried out with the agilent 7890 a model gas chromatography gc device under the following working conditions flame ionization detector fid 330 c and 3 0 m 0 25 mm 0 2 μm column hp innnowax was used with inlet temperature of 250 c split ratio was 100 1 and constant flow mode was 0 82 ml min helium was used as a carrier gas oven temperature was programmed at 50 c hold time 1 min 10 c min to 150 c hold time 10 min injection volume was 1 μl the surface morphology of the membranes characterized by sem analysis zeiss supra 55 the membranes were washed two times with deionized water and dried for overnight before sem analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 cross flow filtration experiments the rejection of small organic compounds by nf depends on both their physical and chemical properties acetic acid has a molecular weight of 60 g mole and it can be concentrated by nf90 membrane depend on solution ph in contrast the molecular weight of methanol is much less than the cut off value of the nf90 membrane therefore it was expected that the separation of acetic acid from methanol would be achievable by nf 3 1 1 the effect of applied pressure on acetic acid and methanol rejection the rejection and separation of organic acid using nanofiltration is highly dependent on applied pressure two different types of uf up150 and up005 and nf nf270 and nf90 membranes were used to determine the highest rejection of acetic acid and methanol these membranes were chosen due to their easy commercial availability fig 2 shows the flux time graph of up150 and up005 membranes the initial flux of up150 membrane was 957 9 l m2 h lmh and the steady state flux decreased to 763 0 lmh the initial flux of up005 membrane was 34 9 lmh and the steady state flux decreased to 17 6 lmh according to the results of gc analyses it was found that both uf membranes did not reject acetic acid and methanol this is because the pore diameters of the uf membranes are larger than acetic acid and methanol for this reason membrane optimization studies were continued with nf membranes nf membranes were tested under 10 15 20 bar pressure flux time graphs of nf270 membrane and acetic acid methanol rejection efficiencies are shown in fig 3 the steady state flux increase from 21 8 to 97 7 lmh when the applied pressure increased from 10 to 20 bar fig 3a the flux increased when the pressure increased due to the increase of water molecules diffusing throughout the membrane considering the rejection efficiencies it could be seen that a very small amount acetic acid and methanol were rejected by nf270 fig 3b flux time graphs of nf90 membrane and acetic acid methanol rejection efficiencies are shown in fig 4 the steady state flux increase from 10 3 to 20 7 lmh when the applied pressure increased from 10 to 20 bar fig 4a considering the rejection efficiencies it could be seen that acetic acid had higher rejection efficiency compared to methanol by nf90 fig 4b this can be explained as the molecular size of acetic acid is larger than that of methanol therefore acetic acid rejection efficiency was found to be higher than methanol 3 1 2 the effect of solution ph on acetic acid and methanol rejection acetic acid is a monoprotic acid with pka value of 4 756 therefore it is clear that the degree of dissociation of acetic acid depends on ph change 98 3 acetic acid is in its neutral form at ph 3 whereas negatively charged acetate increases to 99 994 at ph 9 19 methanol has a pka value of 15 5 and it is in its neutral form at the studied ph ranges the rejection and separation of organic acid using nanofiltration is highly dependent on solution ph since higher acetic acid rejection efficiency was achieved with nf90 membrane the effect of solution ph was studied at 20 bar constant pressure three different ph 2 5 4 7 7 0 were chosen due to different charge of acetic acid which is positive neutral and negative respectively acetic acid was completely rejected at ph 7 0 however 34 6 methanol was rejected fig 5 in other words when the nf90 membrane was operated at 20 bar and ph 7 0 acetic acid was rejected completely in the concentrate and 65 4 of methanol was filtered in the permeate a negatively charged nf90 membrane was used to repel anionic acetic acid while allowing the uncharged solutes like methanol to pass through the membrane depended on solution ph tight nf90 membrane also supplied solute separations based on the size of acetic acid and methanol acetic acid rejection was the highest at ph 7 0 and decreased dramatically as ph decreased however methanol rejection did not affect with change of solution ph since the change in the solution ph also changed the surface charge of polyamide surface almost constant rejection of uncharged methanol might be due to the increase in free volume in membrane surface which the repulsion of polymer chains in three dimensions causes free volume 19 a similar result was reported by weng et al 19 and manttari et al 28 during xylose and glucose retention by nf membranes respectively nf90 membrane is positively charged at ph 2 5 slightly negatively charged at ph 4 7 and strong negatively charged at ph 7 0 29 therefore the attractive interaction might facilitate the transport of positively charged membrane and neutral form acetate at ph 2 5 however the penetration of acetic acid in permeate side decreased at ph 4 7 where net charge of acetate was zero and membrane was slightly negatively charged acetic acid rejection increased at ph 7 0 due to the donnan exclusion in other words it was a strong electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged membrane and negatively charged acetate moreover when the ph is greater than the pka value 4 76 the acetate ch3coo will also have higher hydration number or solvation number in this case size exclusion can be also part of the increase in rejection in addition to the electrostatic repulsion 30 31 an nf composite polyamide membrane was tested to separate lactic acid and unconverted sugars from microfiltrate fermentation broth 32 the membrane enhanced to retain more than 90 of the unconverted sugars while allowing more or less 30 lactic acid to permeate at a flux around 110 lmh at ph 5 5 temperature 37 c and transmembrane pressure of 13 bars in another study separation of furans and carboxylic acids from sugars in dilute acid rice straw hydrolysates was carried out by desal 5 dk nanofiltration 33 it was reported that the maximum separation factor of acetic acid over arabinose was 52 when the system was operated at ph 2 9 and an applied pressure of 24 5 34 3 bar composite nf membranes were prepared from α β γ cyclodextrin cd with polysulfone and they were tested for separation of acetic acid from dilute aqueous solution 34 the results showed that over 99 recovery of acetic acid from aqueous solution were obtained by β cd the experiments were carried out in the concentration range from 1 to 7 wt and the permeation flux declined was observed before the concentration reached at 3 5 wt the permeation flux of 84 5 and 89 2 lmh were obtained at 1 and 5 bar respectively however 88 8 lmh permeation flux at 3 5 bar was chosen suitable operating pressure weng et al 2009 used a desal 5 dk nanofiltration nf membrane to separate acetic acid from xylose using a synthetic solution 19 the retention of xylose and acetic acid varied from 28 to 81 and 6 8 to 90 respectively moreover acetic acid rejection increased from 3 at ph 2 9 to more than 90 at ph 9 1 at 24 5 bar 3 2 vmd experiments the filtrate obtained at 20 bar pressure and ph 7 0 which was the operating conditions of the nf90 membrane determined at the cross flow membrane process was used in the vacuum membrane distillation system the system was operated with a total volume of 500 ml solution after the feeding solution increased to a constant temperature of 60 1 c it was fed to the membrane module with a peristaltic pump pp and ptfe membranes with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm were used during the membrane distillation stage three different flow rates 50 ml min 100 ml min 250 ml min was tested for 3 h cold air was blown by the non circulating filtrate of the membrane module and distillate was collected through the condenser by vacuuming the collected distillate weight was measured over time and methanol concentration of the distillate were analyzed 3 2 1 determination of membrane type and flow rates fig 6 a shows the amount of distillate collected from pp membrane versus time methanol rich solution was circulated at three different flow rates increase of circulation flow increased the amount of collected distillate 105 158 and 210 g distillate were collected at 50 100 and 250 ml min flow rates respectively fig 6b shows the amount of distillate collected from ptfe membrane versus time 75 108 and 132 g distillate were collected at 50 100 and 250 ml min flow rates respectively the decrease in the circulation rate can cause to accumulate of the dissolved impurities in the solution on the membrane surface the results showed that higher distillate was collected when pp membrane was used fig 7 shows methanol recovery according to pump circulation rates methanol recovery was 95 for pp membranes at 250 ml min flow rates 3 3 sem images and contact angle analysis when sem images of nf270 and nf90 membranes were examined both membranes were contaminated by dissolved substances in wastewater fig 8 some organic acids might be coagulated and deposited on the membrane surface at ph 7 0 when the contact angles of nf90 membranes were examined it was found that the contact angle decreased with increasing of pressure and ph fig 9 this might be due to the fact that the hydrophilic impurities in the wastewater could accumulate on the membrane surface and reduce the contact angle 4 conclusions a cross flow membrane and vacuum membrane distillation processes were used to recover acetic acid and methanol from dmt process wastewater respectively the wastewater was filtered through nf270 and nf90 membranes and nf90 membrane was found to be more effective in separation of acetic acid and methanol the increase of feed pressure can improve membrane flux due to higher permeability the steady state flux and acetic acid rejection were 20 7 l m2 h and 46 9 respectively at 20 bar for nf90 membrane moreover acetic acid was completely rejected and 65 4 of methanol passed in the permeate stream when the nf90 membrane was operated at ph 7 0 donnan exclusion due to electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion due to higher hydration number and solvation number at ph 7 0 can be part of the increase in acetate rejection at the second stage vmd was used to recover methanol from the methanol rich solution the results indicated that increase of circulation flow rate increased the amount of collected distillate and pp membrane showed better performance than ptfe membrane for methanol recovery methanol recovery was 95 for pp membranes at 250 ml min flow rates an innovative approach has been proposed in this study to recover acetic acid and methanol from dmt process wastewater recovered acetic acid and methanol can be used again in the process the combined process can also be used for the concentration and recovery of aqueous solutions containing volatile solutes such as food dairy beverage bio refining

13769,in this study acetic acid and methanol were recovered from dimethyl terephthalate process wastewater using cross flow membrane and membrane distillation processes different types of ultrafiltration up150 and up005 and nanofiltration nf270 and nf90 were tested in cross flow membrane filtration to recover acetic acid from wastewater nf90 membrane supplied maximum acetic acid rejection efficiency and it increased from 39 6 to 46 9 when applied pressure increased from 10 to 20 bar the effect of solution ph was also tested and the rejection efficiency of acetic acid increased from 46 9 to 100 when the ph was increased from 2 5 to 7 0 however methanol rejection efficiency did not affect with pressure and ph change methanol rich solution obtained from nf90 membrane permeate was recovered by vacuum membrane distillation 95 methanol recovery was obtained by hydrophobic polypropylene pp membrane at 250 ml min flow rates sem images and contact angles of clean and used membranes were also provided and the results showed that hydrophilic organic acids deposited on the membrane surface increased the hydrophilicity keywords dmt process wastewater pressure driven membrane process membrane distillation acetic acid recovery methanol recovery 1 introduction dimethyl terephthalate dmt is an organic compound which is commonly used in the petrochemical industry and production of polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate pet polytrimethylene terephthalate ptt and polybutylene terephthalate pbt dmt is the diester compound formed from terephthalic acid and methanol 1 dmt is among the top 50 in the list of most produced chemicals worldwide and it is commonly used as a raw material of polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles 2 3 it is also used as the raw material in the production of materials such as polyester films packaging materials and textile fibers 4 dmt production process consumes large amounts of water and 3 10 tons of wastewater is generated for 1 ton of dmt production this kind of wastewater has a great environmental risk 3 moreover the degradation products of phthalates and esters have been listed as priority pollutants by the us epa due to their toxic effects 5 many different treatment processes related to the treatment of dmt wastewater have been developed and implemented until today physicochemical methods such as coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation and adsorption and aerobic anaerobic biological treatment methods are the leading treatment processes 6 7 more economical methods have been investigated in the treatment of this wastewater due to the fact that active sludge processes cannot be applied efficiently because of the reasons such as high hydraulic retention time 3 5 days high oxygen requirement and sludge swelling problems although anaerobic treatment processes seem advantageous in the treatment of this wastewater compared to aerobic processes the use of intensive chemicals for the elimination of inhibitors such as p toluic acid terephthalic acid formaldehyde from dmt process wastewater is the most important factor that restricts anaerobic process 8 wastewater with high chemical oxygen demand cod ranging from 17 142 g l is formed during the production of dmt moreover the main aromatic compounds in purified terephthalic acid pta wastewater are p toluic acid p ta benzoic acid ba acetic acid aa phthalic acid pa and terephthalic acid ta 9 11 studies have shown that dmt has acute and chronic toxicity effects 12 dmt and their reduction intermediates cause cancer and inflammation in the kidneys 13 therefore the us environmental protection agency epa has added these chemicals to the priority pollutant class 14 sharma et al 1994 investigated the effect of biomass supporting particles bsp on anaerobic breakdown of dmt wastewater 15 they reported that the formaldehyde in the wastewater had a toxic effect on microorganisms in the anaerobic system the bsp system was found to resist formaldehyde toxicity of up to 375 mg l as against 125 mg l in the control system they also reported that the bsp system operated for 15 days recovered faster than the control operated for 25 30 days 15 in another study shah et al 1998 investigated the effect of bsp on the aerobic bio treatment of dmt wastewater 16 86 cod removal efficiency was obtained for 20 h in wastewater containing 2000 mg l cod however similar cod removal efficiency was achieved for 6 h when bsp was used in the reactor the optimum hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate was 12 h and 14 kg cod m3 d respectively to obtain 90 cod removal efficiency in the aerobic reactor containing bsp however cod removal efficiency was 40 45 in the control reactor not containing bsp 16 the biodegradation of dmt by separate bacterial species isolated from the mangrove sediment was investigated 17 they reported that some bacterial species could use dmt alone as a carbon source and even wastewater containing 98 mg dmt l was completely degraded by pasteurella multocidasa within 60 h 17 it was emphasized that esterase was the key enzyme that played a role in microbial degradation of phthalate esters and dmt lysis efficiency was investigated by esterase purified from fusarium sp a coastal sediment fungus 18 they reported that the most suitable temperature for enzyme activity was 50 c with the optimal ph 8 18 it is well known that pressure driven membrane processes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been used intensively until today they have unique ability to separate and purify products from process streams 19 among these membrane processes applications of nf stand out for separation purification and concentration of products from streams nf was applied to separate fermentation products 20 to concentrate sugar 21 to recover of organic acids from fermentation broth 22 therefore nf can offer an alternative way to separate acetic acid from methanol in recent years membrane distillation md processes have increased their popularity for water engineering 23 thermal gradient generated between a feed and a permeate side across a microporous hydrophobic membrane was used in md process 24 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd was used for the treatment of rubber processing effluent and at least 96 removal efficiencies of total organic carbon toc color turbidity and conductivity were obtained for rubber industry wastewater 25 purwasasmita et al 2015 investigated performance of non porous thin film composite polyamide membrane distillation during beer dealcoholization process it was reported that the alcohol content could be reduced from 5 vol to 2 45 vol in 6 h 26 in another study sucrose was concentrated in a vacuum membrane distillation vmd system using hydrophobic alumina hollow fiber membranes 27 an 8 l 10 brix sucrose solution was effectively concentrated to 50 brix by removing 6 4 l of water using the vmd system in this study acetic acid and methanol recovery from dimethyl terephthalate process wastewater were carried out by cross flow membrane and membrane distillation processes respectively two different types of ultrafiltration uf membranes up150 and up005 and nf membranes nf270 and nf90 were tested to recover acetic acid using cross flow membrane system moreover methanol was recovered by vacuum membrane distillation vmd using two different types of microfiltration mf membranes pp and ptfe 2 materials and methods 2 1 specifications of dmt wastewater the wastewater used in this study was obtained from sasa polyester company adana turkey sasa has the biggest dmt production capacity in the world with 280 000 tons year dmt is the main monomer of pet and pbt polymers and the main end use of dmt is polyester production a 10 l wastewater was taken and stored at 4 c until use some specifications of wastewater are given in table 1 as can be seen from the table acetic acid and methanol constituted approximately 60 of the main polluting components in wastewater each sample was analyzed in duplicate 2 2 experimental setup of cross flow filtration system the system shown in fig 1 a was used for cross flow filtration experiments the system consisted of the following components high pressure resistant membrane module wastewater feed tank high pressure pump manometers flow meter and water bath with circulator all parts of the system were made of 316 stainless steel the system had a total feeding volume of 10 l with a membrane area of 150 cm2 the pressure of the system was adjusted by needle valves the wastewater was pumped from the feed tank to the membrane cell by the high pressure pump a coolant was available to keep the solution in the feed tank at constant temperature the obtained filtrate was transferred to the computer on line with a scale and the flux was calculated during the experiments the temperature of the system was kept constant 25 1 c with the help of the water bath circulator the membranes used in the experiments were placed in a membrane cell made of stainless steel the filtration pressure was adjusted with the valves located at the entrance of the membrane cell and read from the pressure gauges the time varying weight of the filtrate collected on the balance was recorded on a computer at 60 s intervals acetic acid and methanol concentrations in the permeate were measured at the end of each experiment the permeate flux was calculated using eq 1 1 j w q a δ t where q is the trans membrane volumetric flow l a is the effective membrane area m2 δt is the filtration time h 2 3 properties of membranes used in filtration studies the membranes used in the experimental studies were obtained by microdyn nadir and dow filmtec companies two different types of uf membranes up150 and up005 and nf membranes nf270 and nf90 were tested for acetic acid and methanol recovery uf membranes were operated at 5 bar whereas nf membranes were operated at 10 15 20 bar the wastewater ph was arranged to 4 0 4 7 7 0 and acetic acid and methanol rejection were measured versus ph the general properties of the membranes are given in table s1 all membranes were hydrophilic and they were kept in distilled water for 1 day before used in experiments the membranes were cut in suitable sizes for the filtration system and their active surfaces were placed in the membrane module in contact with the wastewater 2 4 vacuum membrane distillation experiment setup the vacuum membrane distillation vmd process is shown in fig 1b polypropylene pp and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with 0 45 μm pore size were tested with 50 100 250 ml min pump circulation rate the high concentration of methanol obtained from the cross flow membrane process was fed to the membrane distillation system using a peristaltic pump methanol rich wastewater was heated up to 60 c and permeate side was cooled up to 20 c methanol with a boiling point of 64 7 c 1 atm will have a lower boiling point under vacuum for this reason the solution was heated to 60 c and methanol was recovered in the vmd system 2 5 analysis procedure cod analysis was performed according to the closed reflux method standard method 5220 c mettler toledo multi meter was used to measure ph and conductivity acetic acid and methanol analyzes of the samples were carried out with the agilent 7890 a model gas chromatography gc device under the following working conditions flame ionization detector fid 330 c and 3 0 m 0 25 mm 0 2 μm column hp innnowax was used with inlet temperature of 250 c split ratio was 100 1 and constant flow mode was 0 82 ml min helium was used as a carrier gas oven temperature was programmed at 50 c hold time 1 min 10 c min to 150 c hold time 10 min injection volume was 1 μl the surface morphology of the membranes characterized by sem analysis zeiss supra 55 the membranes were washed two times with deionized water and dried for overnight before sem analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 cross flow filtration experiments the rejection of small organic compounds by nf depends on both their physical and chemical properties acetic acid has a molecular weight of 60 g mole and it can be concentrated by nf90 membrane depend on solution ph in contrast the molecular weight of methanol is much less than the cut off value of the nf90 membrane therefore it was expected that the separation of acetic acid from methanol would be achievable by nf 3 1 1 the effect of applied pressure on acetic acid and methanol rejection the rejection and separation of organic acid using nanofiltration is highly dependent on applied pressure two different types of uf up150 and up005 and nf nf270 and nf90 membranes were used to determine the highest rejection of acetic acid and methanol these membranes were chosen due to their easy commercial availability fig 2 shows the flux time graph of up150 and up005 membranes the initial flux of up150 membrane was 957 9 l m2 h lmh and the steady state flux decreased to 763 0 lmh the initial flux of up005 membrane was 34 9 lmh and the steady state flux decreased to 17 6 lmh according to the results of gc analyses it was found that both uf membranes did not reject acetic acid and methanol this is because the pore diameters of the uf membranes are larger than acetic acid and methanol for this reason membrane optimization studies were continued with nf membranes nf membranes were tested under 10 15 20 bar pressure flux time graphs of nf270 membrane and acetic acid methanol rejection efficiencies are shown in fig 3 the steady state flux increase from 21 8 to 97 7 lmh when the applied pressure increased from 10 to 20 bar fig 3a the flux increased when the pressure increased due to the increase of water molecules diffusing throughout the membrane considering the rejection efficiencies it could be seen that a very small amount acetic acid and methanol were rejected by nf270 fig 3b flux time graphs of nf90 membrane and acetic acid methanol rejection efficiencies are shown in fig 4 the steady state flux increase from 10 3 to 20 7 lmh when the applied pressure increased from 10 to 20 bar fig 4a considering the rejection efficiencies it could be seen that acetic acid had higher rejection efficiency compared to methanol by nf90 fig 4b this can be explained as the molecular size of acetic acid is larger than that of methanol therefore acetic acid rejection efficiency was found to be higher than methanol 3 1 2 the effect of solution ph on acetic acid and methanol rejection acetic acid is a monoprotic acid with pka value of 4 756 therefore it is clear that the degree of dissociation of acetic acid depends on ph change 98 3 acetic acid is in its neutral form at ph 3 whereas negatively charged acetate increases to 99 994 at ph 9 19 methanol has a pka value of 15 5 and it is in its neutral form at the studied ph ranges the rejection and separation of organic acid using nanofiltration is highly dependent on solution ph since higher acetic acid rejection efficiency was achieved with nf90 membrane the effect of solution ph was studied at 20 bar constant pressure three different ph 2 5 4 7 7 0 were chosen due to different charge of acetic acid which is positive neutral and negative respectively acetic acid was completely rejected at ph 7 0 however 34 6 methanol was rejected fig 5 in other words when the nf90 membrane was operated at 20 bar and ph 7 0 acetic acid was rejected completely in the concentrate and 65 4 of methanol was filtered in the permeate a negatively charged nf90 membrane was used to repel anionic acetic acid while allowing the uncharged solutes like methanol to pass through the membrane depended on solution ph tight nf90 membrane also supplied solute separations based on the size of acetic acid and methanol acetic acid rejection was the highest at ph 7 0 and decreased dramatically as ph decreased however methanol rejection did not affect with change of solution ph since the change in the solution ph also changed the surface charge of polyamide surface almost constant rejection of uncharged methanol might be due to the increase in free volume in membrane surface which the repulsion of polymer chains in three dimensions causes free volume 19 a similar result was reported by weng et al 19 and manttari et al 28 during xylose and glucose retention by nf membranes respectively nf90 membrane is positively charged at ph 2 5 slightly negatively charged at ph 4 7 and strong negatively charged at ph 7 0 29 therefore the attractive interaction might facilitate the transport of positively charged membrane and neutral form acetate at ph 2 5 however the penetration of acetic acid in permeate side decreased at ph 4 7 where net charge of acetate was zero and membrane was slightly negatively charged acetic acid rejection increased at ph 7 0 due to the donnan exclusion in other words it was a strong electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged membrane and negatively charged acetate moreover when the ph is greater than the pka value 4 76 the acetate ch3coo will also have higher hydration number or solvation number in this case size exclusion can be also part of the increase in rejection in addition to the electrostatic repulsion 30 31 an nf composite polyamide membrane was tested to separate lactic acid and unconverted sugars from microfiltrate fermentation broth 32 the membrane enhanced to retain more than 90 of the unconverted sugars while allowing more or less 30 lactic acid to permeate at a flux around 110 lmh at ph 5 5 temperature 37 c and transmembrane pressure of 13 bars in another study separation of furans and carboxylic acids from sugars in dilute acid rice straw hydrolysates was carried out by desal 5 dk nanofiltration 33 it was reported that the maximum separation factor of acetic acid over arabinose was 52 when the system was operated at ph 2 9 and an applied pressure of 24 5 34 3 bar composite nf membranes were prepared from α β γ cyclodextrin cd with polysulfone and they were tested for separation of acetic acid from dilute aqueous solution 34 the results showed that over 99 recovery of acetic acid from aqueous solution were obtained by β cd the experiments were carried out in the concentration range from 1 to 7 wt and the permeation flux declined was observed before the concentration reached at 3 5 wt the permeation flux of 84 5 and 89 2 lmh were obtained at 1 and 5 bar respectively however 88 8 lmh permeation flux at 3 5 bar was chosen suitable operating pressure weng et al 2009 used a desal 5 dk nanofiltration nf membrane to separate acetic acid from xylose using a synthetic solution 19 the retention of xylose and acetic acid varied from 28 to 81 and 6 8 to 90 respectively moreover acetic acid rejection increased from 3 at ph 2 9 to more than 90 at ph 9 1 at 24 5 bar 3 2 vmd experiments the filtrate obtained at 20 bar pressure and ph 7 0 which was the operating conditions of the nf90 membrane determined at the cross flow membrane process was used in the vacuum membrane distillation system the system was operated with a total volume of 500 ml solution after the feeding solution increased to a constant temperature of 60 1 c it was fed to the membrane module with a peristaltic pump pp and ptfe membranes with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm were used during the membrane distillation stage three different flow rates 50 ml min 100 ml min 250 ml min was tested for 3 h cold air was blown by the non circulating filtrate of the membrane module and distillate was collected through the condenser by vacuuming the collected distillate weight was measured over time and methanol concentration of the distillate were analyzed 3 2 1 determination of membrane type and flow rates fig 6 a shows the amount of distillate collected from pp membrane versus time methanol rich solution was circulated at three different flow rates increase of circulation flow increased the amount of collected distillate 105 158 and 210 g distillate were collected at 50 100 and 250 ml min flow rates respectively fig 6b shows the amount of distillate collected from ptfe membrane versus time 75 108 and 132 g distillate were collected at 50 100 and 250 ml min flow rates respectively the decrease in the circulation rate can cause to accumulate of the dissolved impurities in the solution on the membrane surface the results showed that higher distillate was collected when pp membrane was used fig 7 shows methanol recovery according to pump circulation rates methanol recovery was 95 for pp membranes at 250 ml min flow rates 3 3 sem images and contact angle analysis when sem images of nf270 and nf90 membranes were examined both membranes were contaminated by dissolved substances in wastewater fig 8 some organic acids might be coagulated and deposited on the membrane surface at ph 7 0 when the contact angles of nf90 membranes were examined it was found that the contact angle decreased with increasing of pressure and ph fig 9 this might be due to the fact that the hydrophilic impurities in the wastewater could accumulate on the membrane surface and reduce the contact angle 4 conclusions a cross flow membrane and vacuum membrane distillation processes were used to recover acetic acid and methanol from dmt process wastewater respectively the wastewater was filtered through nf270 and nf90 membranes and nf90 membrane was found to be more effective in separation of acetic acid and methanol the increase of feed pressure can improve membrane flux due to higher permeability the steady state flux and acetic acid rejection were 20 7 l m2 h and 46 9 respectively at 20 bar for nf90 membrane moreover acetic acid was completely rejected and 65 4 of methanol passed in the permeate stream when the nf90 membrane was operated at ph 7 0 donnan exclusion due to electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion due to higher hydration number and solvation number at ph 7 0 can be part of the increase in acetate rejection at the second stage vmd was used to recover methanol from the methanol rich solution the results indicated that increase of circulation flow rate increased the amount of collected distillate and pp membrane showed better performance than ptfe membrane for methanol recovery methanol recovery was 95 for pp membranes at 250 ml min flow rates an innovative approach has been proposed in this study to recover acetic acid and methanol from dmt process wastewater recovered acetic acid and methanol can be used again in the process the combined process can also be used for the concentration and recovery of aqueous solutions containing volatile solutes such as food dairy beverage bio refining
