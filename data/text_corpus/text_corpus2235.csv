11175,the processes of surface energy and water exchange are significantly necessary to the forming and evolution of regional climate the most critical issues and challenges are 1 dynamics of surface energy balance components 2 the surface energy imbalance problem which is still unsolved and 3 energy partitioning in an ecosystem this study assessed the seasonal and annual variations of the surface energy fluxes the surface energy balance closure ebc the reasons behind the surface energy imbalance and energy partitioning based on the two years 2014 2015 flux observation datasets over a semi arid agricultural region in north china the estimation of surface fluxes was also examined using satellite data the ebc analysis was carried out using the ordinary least square ols regression model of the dependent turbulent fluxes against the independently available energy and the energy balance ratio ebr the results revealed that the ebc ranged from 0 63 to 0 78 at all respects with an overall ebc of 0 74 and the daily ebc was better than 30 min averages the identified main reasons behind this imbalance were 1 the ignorance of the heat storage terms soil and canopy which improved the ebc by approximately 7 2 the vegetation and surface heterogeneity negatively affected the ebr and 3 the occurrence of advection broke the energy balance by decreasing ebc the energy partitioning was investigated using the residual method and two ratios sensible heat flux net radiation and latent heat flux net radiation the results showed that the sensible heat flux was dominating during dry periods and the latent heat flux was dominating during the wet periods and the rate of dominance was controlled by the availability of water vegetation dynamics and weather conditions keywords net solar radiation turbulent fluxes available energy evapotranspiration ordinary least square energy balance ratio 1 introduction the measurement and analysis of surface energy balance components including net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le are essential to develop land surface and climate models the net solar radiation rn is the primary source of energy on the earth surface which is divided as one part is used for the warming of the air called the sensible heat flux h the other part is consumed for evaporation and transpiration of water from water bodies and living tissues due to the water vapor flux or latent heat flux le also known as evapotranspiration et and the remaining part is transferred to the soil which is known as the soil heat flux g apart from these there are also some advection and heat storage in the upper soil and vegetation cover in reasonably small amount collectively all these components add up to a phenomenon called the surface energy balance the distribution of surface energy balance components in an ecosystem is extremely vital for the hydrological ecological and bio geophysical processes therefore the quantitative analysis of surface energy balance is very much important for the optimal utilization of water resources and environmental safety especially in arid and semiarid areas ma and fu 2006 the terrestrial water balance is also very important for the sustainable development especially in semi arid areas the water availability in these regions plays an important role for the social and economic development chehbouni et al 2000 one of the most critical issue of water balance in an ecosystem is whether the evapotranspiration is decreasing or increasing i e the dynamics of evapotranspiration and how the water balance deals with evapotranspiration measurements campos et al 2016 ryu et al 2008 many studies have demonstrated the performance of eddy covariance ec method to measure the energy and water balance components in various ecosystems such as forests grasslands farmlands and urban areas wilson and baldocchi 2000 wever et al 2002 suyker and verma 2008 xu et al 2017 miao et al 2012 in general using ec method for long term measurements of surface fluxes has been widely accepted as a standard technique aubinet et al 2012 2000 baldocchi et al 2001 however the ec system has some limitations in the measurement and quality control of flux data the data processing and quality control of these surface energy balance components at atmospheric boundary layer is highly challenging due to meet the optimum energy balance closure ebc conservation for validating and assessing the performance of land surface and climates models in the ecosystems foken and wichura 1996 wilson et al 2002 falge et al 2005 masseroni et al 2014 therefore it is significantly important to measure the standard of surface flux data the analysis of energy balance closure and energy partitioning is widely accepted standard for evaluation of surface flux data baldocchi et al 2001 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 all the four surface flux components mentioned above follow the principle of conservation of energy known as the energy balance closure ebc depicted by the following equation stull 1988 1 r n g h l e since eq 1 has not been proven with practical measurements therefore it causes the energy imbalance problem the imbalance in surface energy budget occurs due to the underestimation of turbulent fluxes as well as the overestimation of available energy quite a few studies baldocchi et al 2001 cava et al 2008 foken 2008 foken et al 2011 have tried to find out the possible causes behind the energy imbalance such as measurement errors systematic and sampling neglecting storage energy terms mismatch in the source areas for the energy balance components loss of low and or high frequency contributions to the turbulent fluxes etc stoy et al 2013 reported that the landscape heterogeneity is also responsible for the energy imbalance in his study area spanning across 173 ecosystems in the fluxnet a general imbalance of 10 to 30 has been documented in previous researches foken 2008 liu et al 2013 majozi et al 2017 wilson et al 2002 and different studies have reported different causes for the energy imbalance despite numerous studies a solid understanding of the underlaying causes of energy imbalance is still unclear and are in debate the ordinary least square ols method i e the linear regression between the turbulent fluxes h le and the available energy rn g and the energy balance ratio ebr i e h le rn g were used in this study for accessing the energy balance closure to investigate the causes responsible for the energy imbalance energy partitioning is the processes how the turbulent fluxes sensible and latent are divided in an ecosystem which plays a vital role in water resources management falge et al 2005 kang et al 2015 specifically in semi arid regions where the precipitation is received between 250 mm 500 mm the combined effects of an increasing sensible heat flux and a decreasing latent heat flux may cause the temperature to rise decreasing the relative humidity and rainfall likely intensifying drought conditions thus the relationship between temperature humidity rainfall solar radiation and energy partitioning are complicated but significant for reliable and realistic analysis gu et al 2006 yuan et al 2017 various studies have been documented the surface energy balance closure and partitioning analysis feng et al 2017 li et al 2009 s√°nchez et al 2010 von randow et al 2004 over different surfaces there are some specific studies over grassland li et al 2006 tibetan plateau gu et al 2006 savanna bagayoko et al 2007 and oasis desert ecotone pan et al 2017 where their findings can be concluded as the ebc was imbalanced with an average order of 10 30 these studies also reported that the sensible heat flux dominated the energy partition in dry seasons whereas the latent heat flux was found dominant during wet seasons during rainy and irrigation time the residual method i e rn g h le and two ratios h rn and le rn were used in this study to examine the dynamics of energy partitioning in the ecosystem the main objectives of this paper can be outlined as i to assess the seasonal and annual variation of the energy and water vapor fluxes using the flux observation data of two consecutive years in the semi arid ecosystem ii to evaluate the energy balance ebc closure iii to identify and delineate the causes behind the imbalance of surface energy iv to investigate the energy partitioning with respect to the weather conditions and seasonality and thereby v to contribute to existing literature on the surface energy balance and partitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 station description huailai remote sensing test station hlrsts was established in december 2004 by chinese academy of sciences cas at huailai county of hebei province 115 783 e 40 349 n in china it is about 83 km away from beijing and located in the middle of yan huai basin the station is surrounded by yanshan mountain 10 km from the station cropland guanting reservoir and yeyahu wetland the station fig 1 was set up as the fundamental experimentation and validation base for the quantitative remote sensing products and later added some important measurement platforms e g ec las on september 2012 for the long term monitoring of the ecological energy and hydrological processes for developing the land surface and climate models by ground and tower based remote sensing measurements wireless sensor network and footprint observations this station is also connected with the validation network of remote sensing products in china vrpc ma et al 2015a b the study site is situated at 488 3 m above mean sea level msl the average annual temperature is about 10 and receives the average precipitation of 327 6 mm 2014 2015 defining it as a semi arid agricultural area the soils are generally sandy about 32 loam 28 tight and 10 heavy according to the soil texture measurement in 2015 the year can be divided into four seasons spring april may summer june august autumn september october and winter november march the area is mainly a cropland of maize the average height is 2 2 3 m in mature stage normally the crops are sowing in spring growing in summer and harvesting in autumn the irrigation of this area is mainly rainfed and there are also some extra irrigation practices for the maize crop as the area is situated near a reservoir therefore the water also can be supplied through the soil 2 2 instrumentations this study utilized the following instruments i eddy covariance ec ii automatic weather station aws and iii large aperture scintillometer las the sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used to log raw flux data and the open path gas analyzer li7500 a li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa for the measurement of h2o and co2 in free atmosphere which are the parts of ec four specific instruments of aws were also used in this experiment the 4 component net radiometer kipp zonen delft the netherlands the temperature and humidity probe hmp45c campbell scientific inc usa soil heat flux plate hft3 campbell scientific inc usa and the rain gage te525mm campbell scientific inc usa were used to measure the net radiation temperature and humidity soil heat flux and rainfall respectively the las bls450 scintec ag rottenburg germany was used to measure the area averaged sensible heat flux data the ec system was located 115 788 e 40 349 n at 5 m height the ultrasonic orientation was in the northward direction and the separation between the ultrasonic windspeed meter csat3 and the gas analyzer li7500 a was 15 cm the las was installed with transmitter tower 115 802 3 e 40 3596 n and receiver tower 115 7825 e 40 3522 n the length of the path between the transmitting end and receiving end was 1 87 km and the direction were north east to south west with an angle of 63 the aws was installed on 10 m tower hosted several instruments but for our experiment we used the temperature and humidity probe at 5 m height the rain gage at 10 m height the four component net radiometer was installed at 5 m height and soil heat flux plate was buried at 6 cm underground 1 5 m apart from the tower 2 3 data processing and quality control the raw ec data was of 10 hz acquisition rate and processed by the open source eddypro software version 6 1 li cor biosciences usa to obtain the 30 min data including the following main steps wild point value elimination delay time correction coordinate orientation secondary frequency response correction ultrasonic temperature and density correction and also the atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity the raw 30 min flux data was quality controlled following the steps as described firstly the data were removed during rainfall and instrument maintenance secondly the flux data was rejected if the missing rate of 10 hz raw data exceeded 10 thirdly three quality flags of 0 1 and 2 were assigned to each 30 min flux data based on the stationarity and integral turbulence characteristic tests according to mauder and foken 2011 data with quality flag of 2 was discarded which means these data were measured with unsteady parameters or under poor developed turbulent conditions finally the nighttime flux data with friction velocity lower than 0 1 m s 1 was rejected along with these quality control we also rejected the incomplete 30 min dataset of rn g h and le to obtain a valid dataset in long term measurement data gaps are inevitable therefore data were missing during several hours and days of both years due to the instrumental malfunction and damage of power converter the missing and bad data were filled in two ways 1 by using linear interpolation where the gaps were of few hours 2 by using mean diurnal ensemble method and nonlinear relationship where the gaps were longer falge et al 2001 2 4 calculation of evapotranspiration et the eddy covariance method can provide the direct means of measuring evapotranspiration on long term basis for shorter intervals wilson and baldocchi 2000 using latent heat flux le component the two year 2014 2015 measurement of le was used to observe the evapotranspiration dynamics according to fao irrigation and drainage allen et al 1998 1 w m 2 of radiation latent heat flux le is equal to 0 0864 mj m 2 day 1 of evapotranspiration and 1 mj m 2 day 1 is equal to 0 408 mm day 1 of evapotranspiration these conversion factors were used in this study to calculate the et from le 2 5 evaluation of surface energy balance closure the energy balance closure ebc can be evaluated at different levels such as multi year seasonal and diurnal using different methods in this study the following two methods have been used i the energy balance ratio ebr which is the ratio of the sum of turbulent fluxes to the sum of available energy as 2 e b r h l e r n g s where h and le are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively rn is the net radiation g is the ground heat flux and s is the storage terms the cumulative sum of h le and rn g s over a specified time periods daily seasonal or annual was used to evaluate the energy balance closure the ideal closure will be achieved at unity one value of ebr the advantages of ebr is that it gives an overall evaluation of energy balance closure at longer time scales i e multi years averaging the errors on 30 min measurement data it also has a disadvantage of potential to overlook biases in the 30 min data such as the tendency to overestimate the positive fluxes in day time and underestimate the negative fluxes in night time blanken et al 1998 ii the ordinary least squares ols method which is a linear regression model that will fit the regression between the available energy rn g and the turbulent heat fluxes h le the ideal closure will be achieved when the intercept will be zero and the slope and the coefficient of determination r2 will be one unity but in practical it is not possible so we measures how much the slope is close to unity with significant r2 squires 2001 this method was extensively used in this study 2 6 storage terms the soil heat storage ss above the heat flux was calculated jacobs et al 2008 tanaka et al 2008 as 3 s s c s z p 0 Œ¥ t Œ¥ t d z where c s j m 3 k 1 is the volumetric heat capacity of soil z p is the depth of the soil heat flux plate Œ¥ t k is the soil temperature difference and Œ¥ t s is the output time interval the depth of the soil heat flux plate was 6 cm the canopy heat storage sc was calculated by using the following equation jacobs et al 2003 meyers and hollinger 2004 4 s c Œ¥ t m w c w m b c b Œ¥ t where m w kg m 2 and m b kg m 2 are the masses of water and biomass respectively c w j kg 1 k 1 and c b j kg 1 k 1 are the specific heat capacities of water and biomass respectively the energy storage by photosynthesis sp is produced due to the change in the gibbs free energy which is required to break the bonds of the reactants and those in forming glucose and oxygen meyers and hollinger 2004 the conversion of 1 mg c 0 2 m 2 s 1 canopy assimilation equates to an energy flux of 11 2 wm 2 this conversion factor can be used to evaluate the storage energy of photosynthesis from the eddy covariance measurements 2 7 remote sensing model the surface energy balance system sebs model developed by bob su in the netherlands su 2002 was used in this study to estimate the turbulent heat fluxes from satellite data this model has three distinctive features compared to other surface energy balance models which makes the model suitable to apply in real world situations first the h is calculated using two methods i where the reference height is below the top of the atmospheric surface layer asl the monin obukhov similarity functions are used ii elsewhere the bulk atmospheric similarity model is used wang et al 2008 second most of the models assumed the non dimensional parameter kb 1 as a constant whereas the sebs model computed the kb 1 on a per pixel basis using an improved algorithm that combines a full cover canopy model choudhury and monteith 1988 a bare land model brutsaert 1999 and a new scheme for vegetation bare soil interaction jia et al 2003 su et al 2001 third the h and le are calculated under dry and wet limits the latent heat flux is zero at the dry limit i e the sensible heat flux h d r y is maximum the available energy r n g on other hand at wet limit h w e t is calculated using the reversed penman monteith equation in terms of evaporative fraction efr for every pixel gibson et al 2011 su 2002 at a reference height the h is computed under given meteorological conditions on the basis of monin obukhov similarity theory 5 h k u œÅ c p Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ a ln z d z 0 m œà h z d l œà h z 0 h l 1 where k is the von k √° rm √° n constant u is the friction velocity œÅ is the density of air c p is the specific heat for air at constant pressure Œ∏ 0 is the potential temperature at surface Œ∏ a is the potential air temperature at height z z is the measurement height above the surface d is the displacement height z 0 m and z 0 h are the roughness height for momentum and heat transfer respectively œà h is the stability correction for sensible heat transfer and l is the obukhov length here the relative evaporative fraction efr and evaporative fraction can be expressed as 6 e f r h d r y h h d r y h w e t a n d e f e f r l e w e t r n g the latent heat flux le or evapotranspiration et can be estimated based on the surface energy balance as follows 7 l e e f r n g e f r l e w e t r n g r n g e f r l e w e t for more detail information on sebs model parametrization readers are directed to ma et al 2015a b and su 2002 2 8 surface energy partitioning analysis the eddy covariance surface energy data of two consecutive years 2014 and 2015 were used to evaluate the energy partitioning into sensible h and latent le heat fluxes in the study area ecosystem the daily seasonal growing and non growing and annual dynamics of the surface energy balance components were analyzed and how the sensible and latent heat fluxes correspond to that of net radiation rn the residual of available energy rae was calculated using the following equation 8 r a e r n g h l e to see the partitioning two ratios h rn and le rn were used to examine how the turbulent fluxes were explained by the net solar radiation this study also evaluated how the surface energy partitioning was affected by the direct influence of net radiation rn and vapor pressure deficit vpd during the dry and wet periods following gu et al 2006 and yuan et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 micro meteorological conditions of the study station fig 2 illustrated the daily average of air temperature soil temperature soil water content soil moisture daily sum of precipitation and vapor pressure deficit vpd for 2014 and 2015 at huailai remote sensing test station the overall average temperature was 10 6 in the study period where the maximum temperature was recorded at 28 9 in 2014 with precipitation of 319 9 mm the average annual soil temperature at 4 cm depth was 7 5 and the average annual soil water content at 4 cm depth soil moisture was 15 3 the soil temperature data was missing due to the failure of power during several days of 2015 the soil moisture indicated the pronounced dry and wet period for the study area the recorded annual precipitation was of 335 2 mm in 2015 the annual daily average vpd was varied between 0 02 and 3 3 kpa fig 2d with an overall average of 0 75 0 51 sd kpa the vpd decreased with rainfall and raised up during rain free days within the rainy seasons 3 2 interannual variability of energy and water exchange 3 2 1 seasonal variations of the surface fluxes the daily average and averaged annual measured value of the surface energy balance components of 2014 and 2015 were highlighted in fig 3 statistically the data coverage in 2014 was 70 and 71 in 2015 the maximum values of rn h le and g were 866 4 321 5 555 1 and 89 9 wm 2 in 2014 and 813 0 477 2 533 4 and 60 8 wm 2 in 2015 respectively the minimum values of rn h le and g were 112 0 145 2 167 7 and 35 1 wm 2 in 2014 and 209 9 148 2 160 9 and 56 8 wm 2 in 2015 respectively the two year daily means of rn h le and g were 100 1 29 6 45 2 and 3 4 wm 2 with the standard deviations of 87 1 28 5 46 3 and 8 9 wm 2 respectively the seasonal variations within each component could be observed throughout the years the energy balance components except the h were low at the beginning of each year and as the year progressed they all increased steadily and reached their peak during the middle of the year after reaching to their peak value they started to decrease again and became low by the end of each year the sensible heat flux h was high in magnitude during the starting of each year and was low during the middle of each year the gradual increase was seen during the growing seasons at the middle of each year and the lower value observed during non growing seasons at the starting and ending of each year in comparative analysis the latent heat flux was found to be significantly larger than the sensible heat flux during the growing seasons mid of april to mid of october and the opposite was observed to be true during the non growing periods january to mid of april during the post harvesting period mid of october to december of maize crop the sensible heat flux was little larger than latent heat flux or similar the net radiation was higher during growing seasons with a regular fluctuating tendency the water flux evapotranspiration et was low during non growing periods and high during growing periods with a similar trend like the net radiation and latent heat flux the soil heat flux was very small in magnitude with little increase in the growing seasons 3 2 2 average diurnal patterns of the surface fluxes fig 4 illustrated the average diurnal patterns of the surface fluxes during non growing mid of october mid of april early growing mid of april mid of july the maize crop was getting up to 80 of its total height with younger leaf and late growing mid of july mid of october the maize crop was fruited wilted and harvested periods for 2014 and 2015 the diurnal variation was similar in both years the sensible heat flux was the main part of the available energy during non growing seasons in both years whereas the latent heat flux was the main part of that during early growing seasons during the late growing season wilting and harvesting of maize the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux were similar or sometimes the sensible flux was slightly higher these phenomena were observed to be relatively similar in both years the net radiation was little higher in 2014 as compared to that of 2015 the magnitude of latent heat flux was higher in 2015 as compared to that of 2014 and the magnitude of sensible heat flux was higher in 2014 in comparison to 2015 3 3 assessment of surface energy balance closure ebc using the above mentioned two methods the eq 2 energy balance ratio ebr and ordinary least square ols regression the surface energy balance closure ebc was assessed for two consecutive years 2014 2015 at hlrsts this study performed the diurnal integral and seasonal analysis of ebc to investigate the overall scenario of the surface energy closure in the study site the diurnal analysis showed that the ebc was insignificant during night nocturnal time the integral analysis revealed that the daily ebc was higher than 30 min averages the seasonal variation of ebc indicated better ebc during spring and autumn than summer and winter these analyses are briefly described in the following sections the general closure of ebcs without considering the storage terms was 0 63 2014 and 0 70 2015 with significant correlation coefficients fig 9a and fig 9d the results of this study were in accordance with previous studies such as the ebc was 0 77 for a cropland surface in russia in 1988 tsvang et al 1991 0 62 in kurex 91 experiment panin et al 1998 0 7 0 8 in litfass 2003 for a cropland surface mauder et al 2006 0 58 1 in chinaflux for several surfaces li et al 2005 0 34 1 69 in fluxnet for several surfaces wilson et al 2002 0 79 0 87 in the heihe river basin for cropland forest and grassland liu et al 2011 and 0 71 1 in hiwater musoexe 2012 for several surfaces in china xu et al 2017 3 3 1 diurnal analysis of energy balance ratio ebr all the days with complete 24 hours 30 min interval datasets of 2014 and 2015 were used to observe the mean diurnal variation of ebr the mean values of rn g ss sc h le and ebr were plotted in fig 5 which indicated that the ebr was not meaningful during the transition stages of morning and evening when the mean values of rn g ss sc were near to zero during the night time 0 00 7 00 and 17 00 23 30 the ebrs value were anomalous and not displayed in fig 5 actually the night time data showed higher imbalance of surface energy due to the stable conditions of the atmosphere which minimize the turbulence and prevent the creation of eddies majozi et al 2017 the meaningful values of ebr were observed during the day time 7 30 16 30 and were in similar behavior with previous studies especially like in the fluxnet sites wilson et al 2002 fig 6 also shown that the ebr increased rapidly after 15 00 and was greater than 1 by 16 00 the possible reason behind this diurnal variation of ebr may be the potential contribution of wave phase differences in each energy balance components gao et al 2010 3 3 2 the integral analysis of energy balance closure ebc to evaluate the average and integral analysis of ebc in the study site each component of the surface energy balance rn g h and le for 2014 and 2015 are synchronously averaged on 30 min and daily basis the scatter plot in fig 6a indicated the 30 min averages of the available energy and the turbulent fluxes where the ebc was 66 with a strong correlation coefficient this presented an overall concept of ebc in the study site without considering the storage terms if the soil and canopy heat storage terms were included the ebc improved by 6 to 8 as shown in fig 9 the relationship between rn g and h le for daily averages using the valid data indicated an improvement of about 5 in the ebc as shown in fig 6b therefore in case of daily ebc analysis the storage terms calculations can be ignored but these cannot be ignored in the 30 min energy balance analysis 3 3 3 the seasonal variation of ebc fig 7 showed the seasonal ols analysis for the two year period where the ebc was 0 60 during summer june aug 0 65 during winter nov march 0 70 for spring april may and 0 72 for autumn sept oct respectively the lower ebc during summer and winter can be explained by the cloudy and rainy weather conditions of summer and foggy and snowy weather of winter because the rainfall and fog events could wet the surface of the measuring sensors thus reducing the accuracy of the instruments blonquist et al 2009 michel et al 2007 the spring and autumn seasons show improved ebc due to the clear and gentle weather some previous studies reported lower ebc in winter and higher in spring and autumn majozi et al 2017 wilson et al 2002 opposite result also found as 0 92 in winter over the flat prairie on the northern tibetan plateau ma et al 2009 however the different timescales analyses mentioned above and the discussion in this section mainly focused on the general assessment of the surface energy balance closure ebc which reflected that the imbalance of the surface energy was inevitable consequently this study focused on the possible and potential reasons behind the imbalance of the energy closure in the study site 3 4 reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy until now the possible causes of the lack of energy balance closure ebc are not clear this study discussed the reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy in the measuring station basically the measurement errors systematic and random errors are common in the analysis of surface energy balance system cava et al 2008 foken 2008 the systematic errors are mainly related to the instruments and the random errors occur due to the sampling problem for example an intercomparing study showed that the root mean square error systematic error in ec instruments for measuring rn h and le were 13 10 and 4 wm 2 respectively xu et al 2013 and the random errors of the same instruments were approximately 18 for h and 16 for le measurement wang et al 2015 the magnitude of soil heat flux is relatively small but it can be affected by the irrigation because the soil heat flux plate is buried under the soil surface however the measurement errors are not the potential reasons behind the surface energy imbalance the mismatch of source areas for the energy balance components was another important reason for the imbalance of surface energy again the sampling error occurs due to the inadequate matching of the source area of ec with the source area of net radiometer as the net radiometer is justly constant with time and wind and the systematic errors maybe introduced due to some installation limitations aubinet et al 2000 baldocchi et al 2001 this study site is mainly a rainfed irrigated cropland and situated near a reservoir the wind frequency distribution indicated that the wind was mostly from the northeast ne to southwest sw direction in both years as shown in fig 8 the ec and radiometers were installed at the study site according to the height of the crop wind directions and the field view of each instrument see section 2 2 the footprint analysis according to kormann and meixner 2001 method showed that 90 flux source was coming from the area of 500 m approximately during non growing seasons and about 300 m was during growing period not shown here the ec footprint is always less than the area of its located site xu et al 2017 these results implied that the reservoir was far from the ec source therefore the mismatch of measurement scales was one of the causes behind the energy imbalance in the study site but not the main cause the following sections focused on the main causes behind the lack of ebc in this specific study site 3 4 1 the impacts of heat storage terms generally the flux data directly measured from the instruments do not included the storage terms in this study the storage terms are calculated according to the method discussed in section 2 6 the inclusion of storage terms increased the ebc as shown in fig 9 the soil heat storage increased the ebc by 6 and 8 in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 9b and e whereas the canopy heat storage increased the ebc by 1 for both years fig 9c and f the photosynthesis storage term was ignored as its influence was negligible in yearly analysis similar results were reported by some studies such as s√°nchez et al 2010 showed about 6 increase in ebc with soil heat storage and that of 3 with canopy storage over a boreal forest site of fluxnet and meyers and hollinger 2004 indicated 7 increase in ebc with all heat storage terms over a soybean cropland so the storage terms are the potential reasons for the imbalance of the surface energy however an imbalance of about 22 remained in this study site once all the storage terms were included s√°nchez et al 2010 reported an imbalance of 18 when considering all the storage terms similarly ma et al 2009 reported an imbalance of 30 in summer over the flat prairie on the northern tibetan plateau and xin and liu 2010 also reported an imbalance of 20 over a semi arid area in china therefore this study searched for further reasons behind the lack of ebc 3 4 2 the impacts of vegetation and surface heterogeneity preliminary the monthly variation of ebc was investigated using the ols analysis the scatter plot of rn g vs h le for 30 min dataset of 2014 and 2015 fig 10 illustrated the slope of ols analysis for each month where the trend of ebc was similar in both years the noticeable decrease in ebc was found in the month of june and july for both years the period of june to july in the study site was the early growing time of the maize crop so the significant decrease in ebc can be occurred due to the vegetation heterogeneity to quantify the impacts of vegetation and surface heterogeneity the distinct irrigated and vegetation growing period were selected the crop maize growing and wilting period was predominantly from june to september of each year and it was the main crop grown in the study area the variation of the daily averaged energy balance components rn g h and le were plotted for june 2015 to september 2015 the similar result was found for 2014 not shown here in fig 11 along with the satellite estimation of le based on the sebs model using eleven modis scenes in fig 11 rn and le were positive throughout the total growing and wilting period and they had similar varying tendency in magnitude and the g and h were relatively small with positive or negative values the h revealed minor fluctuations from june to august which increased significantly during early of september and le decreased during same interval due to the wilting of crop the sebs model performed well and was consistent with the ground measurements overall slope 0 90 and r2 0 70 for estimating the four energy balance components the satellite estimation of le was plotted in fig 11d with ground measured le which exposed the sebs model produced good estimation but not the accurate estimation for the whole vegetation growing period the crop growth and irrigation in the study site caused the heterogeneity which resulted in relatively high discrete values in the le estimation the experimental area was mainly irrigated by rainfall which generally receive precipitation between march to october here the duration from april to september was considered for better representation when irrigation occurred in an area the ground soil water content increased rapidly i e a difference in the soil and water content was inducing and increasing the surface heterogeneity after irrigation it gradually spread out increasing homogeneity the daily variation of energy balance ratio ebr and rainfall during the growing period over the cropland for two consecutive years were shown in fig 12 the ebr was decreasing during rainfall increasing the surface heterogeneity and increasing after rainfall as the surface became moderately uniform therefore the surface heterogeneity plays an important role in the imbalance of surface energy and it negatively affected the ebr as the issue of ebc problem is still under debate some researchers hypothesized that it can be a scale problem ec method cannot capture the energy flux from larger eddies and low frequency circulations foken 2008 foken et al 2010 liu et al 2011 this study also found similar result that the vegetation and surface heterogeneity may cause larger eddies which resulted in a decrease in ebr therefore the vegetation and surface heterogeneity can be identified as the potential reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy 3 4 3 impacts of advection on surface energy imbalance as the study site is located near a reservoir guanting this area can be affected by advection due to the movement of water evaporation condensation rainfall infiltration etc through the atmosphere in the ecosystem under advective conditions that h 0 and le 0 the vertical exchange of eddies should contain relatively cool and wet air and also the correlation coefficients between temperature and humidity rtq should negative de bruin et al 2005 some highly advective days data h le and rtq of this study site were analyzed not shown here and found similar characteristics as expected under advective conditions so to investigate the effects of advection on the energy balance closure in the study site we divided the dataset based on three conditions the whole dataset in the day time 07 00 18 00 local time bst data under no advection h 10 w m 2 and 07 00 18 00 and data under advective conditions h 10 w m 2 and 07 00 18 00 as the measurement scale of ec is small the longer averaging period may capture more eddies finnigan et al 2003 the averaging period was set to 30 min 1 h and 2 h for each condition and the las observation of h for energy balance closure analysis were presented in a scattergram fig 13 the results of the year of 2015 the data of 2014 also exhibited the similar phenomena not shown here indicated that the ebc decreased under advective conditions but did not change with increasing averaging period fig 13c f and i the ebc was increased with increasing averaging period under no advection conditions fig 13d e g and h under advective conditions the ebc was statistically insignificant for las measured data the las measured sensible heat flux was considered in this analysis because the las was located near the ec and the study area was flat therefore the advection may destroy the surface energy balance by increasing the residuals of surface energy balance eder et al 2015 gao et al 2017 if the h was measured by las the ebc performed better than when using ec measurements fig 13a and j i e the las observation can be able to closed the surface energy balance better than the ec method foken 2008 the surface energy balance closure problem is a complex issue however the effects of storage terms vegetation and surface heterogeneity occurrence of advection and measurement scale problem were identified as main reasons behind the lack of ebc in this study area although this issue is still under discussion this study can outline the following methods for analyzing the reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy efficient measurement and estimation of storage terms investigation of the impacts of the vegetation and surface heterogeneity investigation of the impacts of advection the effects of low frequency circulations large eddies several timescale analysis and averaging techniques selection of suitable measuring locations in heterogeneous flows improvements of instruments installation based on the optimum measuring scale 3 5 energy partitioning analysis 3 5 1 seasonal energy partitioning the energy partitioning was evaluated for three distinct seasons non growing 1 from january to mid of april winter spring growing sowing to harvest of maize mid of april to mid of october spring summer autumn non growing 2 mid of october to december autumn winter the mean values of the surface energy balance components and their partitioning h rn and le rn as well as the residual of available energy rae during three periods were shown in table 1 for 2014 the similar results also found in 2015 not shown here the net radiation rn was explained by sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le representing h was 56 of rn during non growing 1 and 15 of rn during growing period the le was 18 of rn during non growing 1 and 46 of rn during growing period for non growing 2 period the h was slightly higher than le in explaining rn the latent heat flux was nearly 70 greater than the sensible heat flux during growing period whereas the opposite was true during the non growing 1 period the le was dominating during growing period because there was large water availability due to the rainfall and vegetation growing maize the rae was 10 14 w m 2 representing 18 of rn during non growing 1 54 18 w m 2 representing 33 of rn during the growing 1 55 w m 2 representing 5 of rn during the non growing 2 the negative result indicated that the soil was the main source of energy to the atmosphere during non growing 2 autumn and winter 3 5 2 influence of weather conditions on energy partitioning to investigate the influence of weather conditions on energy partitioning two most important climatic variables were considered vpd vapor pressure deficit dependent on temperature and humidity and rn net radiation dependent on solar radiation surface emissivity and albedo the daily average values of the selected variables for the whole dataset 2014 2015 was analyzed to observe the partitioning into sensible h and latent le heat fluxes for dry and wet periods fig 14 displayed the relationship between vpd and turbulent fluxes under dry conditions the h was significantly increasing with increasing vpd while the le was constant or slightly increasing with vpd under wet conditions both the h and le were insensitive to the vpd as the combined effects of increasing h and decreasing le may intensify the drought in semi arid areas gu et al 2006 the results indicated that this study area was not prone to drought as seen from fig 15 both the h and le were increasing with increasing rn but not in similar proportion during dry and wet periods the rate of increase in h was higher than that of le during dry seasons whereas the opposite was true during wet seasons the higher increasing tendency of le during wet seasons can be explained by the availability of water rainfall and the vegetation growing maize also illustrated in fig 3b however the rate of increase in h was slow concave during wet season during dry seasons the increasing rate of le was slow due to the limited water availability and there was an abrupt increase in h with an increasing rn 4 conclusions this paper evaluated the dynamics of surface energy fluxes the surface energy balance closure ebc and energy partitioning over a semi arid agricultural region in north china using two years 2014 2015 flux tower observation data this study mainly focused on identifying the reasons behind the imbalance of the surface energy by analyzing the relationship between the available energy rn g and the turbulent fluxes h le soil and canopy heat storage vegetation and surface heterogeneity and advection were identified as the main reasons influencing the energy closure an overall ebc of 0 74 was obtained using the whole 30 min dataset along with the measurement errors the storage terms also include additional energy in the energy balance system here the soil heat storage and canopy heat storage improved the ebc by approximately 6 to 8 in annual analysis therefore the heat storage terms must be considered other reasons behind the lack of ebc were investigated using a combination of ground and satellite measurements the results presented that the vegetation and land surface heterogeneity had a significant impact on the ebr the ebr was decreasing with an increasing surface and vegetation heterogeneity the longer averaging periods e g from 30 min to 2 h improved the ebc i e the more eddies were captured by ec the impacts of advection were also significant in the study site the occurrence of advection destroyed the energy balance system by decreasing ebc trend during the day time actually the ec cannot capture the energy flux from larger eddies and low frequency circulations that result due to the heterogeneity and advection however these are the identified reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy in this specific study site although the issue of surface energy imbalance is still under debate this study felt that this important issue needs more attention of all affected scientific communities to study and discuss the methods for robust correction to remove the uncertainty sources in eddy flux measurements in general the energy partitioning analysis revealed that the sensible heat flux h was dominating the partitioning during the dry seasons and the latent heat flux le was dominating during the wet seasons the energy partitioning was not solely limited by the solar radiation but also controlled by the water availability and vegetation dynamics in the ecosystem during wet seasons the water availability and vegetation growing crop provided high rate of increase in le whereas h was relatively slow in increase the h increased rapidly only during dry season due to the scarcity of water the increase in vpd caused a rapid increase in h during dry seasons but le did not decrease rather increased slightly which implied that this semiarid region was out of danger to drought acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national key research development program of china grant

11175,the processes of surface energy and water exchange are significantly necessary to the forming and evolution of regional climate the most critical issues and challenges are 1 dynamics of surface energy balance components 2 the surface energy imbalance problem which is still unsolved and 3 energy partitioning in an ecosystem this study assessed the seasonal and annual variations of the surface energy fluxes the surface energy balance closure ebc the reasons behind the surface energy imbalance and energy partitioning based on the two years 2014 2015 flux observation datasets over a semi arid agricultural region in north china the estimation of surface fluxes was also examined using satellite data the ebc analysis was carried out using the ordinary least square ols regression model of the dependent turbulent fluxes against the independently available energy and the energy balance ratio ebr the results revealed that the ebc ranged from 0 63 to 0 78 at all respects with an overall ebc of 0 74 and the daily ebc was better than 30 min averages the identified main reasons behind this imbalance were 1 the ignorance of the heat storage terms soil and canopy which improved the ebc by approximately 7 2 the vegetation and surface heterogeneity negatively affected the ebr and 3 the occurrence of advection broke the energy balance by decreasing ebc the energy partitioning was investigated using the residual method and two ratios sensible heat flux net radiation and latent heat flux net radiation the results showed that the sensible heat flux was dominating during dry periods and the latent heat flux was dominating during the wet periods and the rate of dominance was controlled by the availability of water vegetation dynamics and weather conditions keywords net solar radiation turbulent fluxes available energy evapotranspiration ordinary least square energy balance ratio 1 introduction the measurement and analysis of surface energy balance components including net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le are essential to develop land surface and climate models the net solar radiation rn is the primary source of energy on the earth surface which is divided as one part is used for the warming of the air called the sensible heat flux h the other part is consumed for evaporation and transpiration of water from water bodies and living tissues due to the water vapor flux or latent heat flux le also known as evapotranspiration et and the remaining part is transferred to the soil which is known as the soil heat flux g apart from these there are also some advection and heat storage in the upper soil and vegetation cover in reasonably small amount collectively all these components add up to a phenomenon called the surface energy balance the distribution of surface energy balance components in an ecosystem is extremely vital for the hydrological ecological and bio geophysical processes therefore the quantitative analysis of surface energy balance is very much important for the optimal utilization of water resources and environmental safety especially in arid and semiarid areas ma and fu 2006 the terrestrial water balance is also very important for the sustainable development especially in semi arid areas the water availability in these regions plays an important role for the social and economic development chehbouni et al 2000 one of the most critical issue of water balance in an ecosystem is whether the evapotranspiration is decreasing or increasing i e the dynamics of evapotranspiration and how the water balance deals with evapotranspiration measurements campos et al 2016 ryu et al 2008 many studies have demonstrated the performance of eddy covariance ec method to measure the energy and water balance components in various ecosystems such as forests grasslands farmlands and urban areas wilson and baldocchi 2000 wever et al 2002 suyker and verma 2008 xu et al 2017 miao et al 2012 in general using ec method for long term measurements of surface fluxes has been widely accepted as a standard technique aubinet et al 2012 2000 baldocchi et al 2001 however the ec system has some limitations in the measurement and quality control of flux data the data processing and quality control of these surface energy balance components at atmospheric boundary layer is highly challenging due to meet the optimum energy balance closure ebc conservation for validating and assessing the performance of land surface and climates models in the ecosystems foken and wichura 1996 wilson et al 2002 falge et al 2005 masseroni et al 2014 therefore it is significantly important to measure the standard of surface flux data the analysis of energy balance closure and energy partitioning is widely accepted standard for evaluation of surface flux data baldocchi et al 2001 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 all the four surface flux components mentioned above follow the principle of conservation of energy known as the energy balance closure ebc depicted by the following equation stull 1988 1 r n g h l e since eq 1 has not been proven with practical measurements therefore it causes the energy imbalance problem the imbalance in surface energy budget occurs due to the underestimation of turbulent fluxes as well as the overestimation of available energy quite a few studies baldocchi et al 2001 cava et al 2008 foken 2008 foken et al 2011 have tried to find out the possible causes behind the energy imbalance such as measurement errors systematic and sampling neglecting storage energy terms mismatch in the source areas for the energy balance components loss of low and or high frequency contributions to the turbulent fluxes etc stoy et al 2013 reported that the landscape heterogeneity is also responsible for the energy imbalance in his study area spanning across 173 ecosystems in the fluxnet a general imbalance of 10 to 30 has been documented in previous researches foken 2008 liu et al 2013 majozi et al 2017 wilson et al 2002 and different studies have reported different causes for the energy imbalance despite numerous studies a solid understanding of the underlaying causes of energy imbalance is still unclear and are in debate the ordinary least square ols method i e the linear regression between the turbulent fluxes h le and the available energy rn g and the energy balance ratio ebr i e h le rn g were used in this study for accessing the energy balance closure to investigate the causes responsible for the energy imbalance energy partitioning is the processes how the turbulent fluxes sensible and latent are divided in an ecosystem which plays a vital role in water resources management falge et al 2005 kang et al 2015 specifically in semi arid regions where the precipitation is received between 250 mm 500 mm the combined effects of an increasing sensible heat flux and a decreasing latent heat flux may cause the temperature to rise decreasing the relative humidity and rainfall likely intensifying drought conditions thus the relationship between temperature humidity rainfall solar radiation and energy partitioning are complicated but significant for reliable and realistic analysis gu et al 2006 yuan et al 2017 various studies have been documented the surface energy balance closure and partitioning analysis feng et al 2017 li et al 2009 s√°nchez et al 2010 von randow et al 2004 over different surfaces there are some specific studies over grassland li et al 2006 tibetan plateau gu et al 2006 savanna bagayoko et al 2007 and oasis desert ecotone pan et al 2017 where their findings can be concluded as the ebc was imbalanced with an average order of 10 30 these studies also reported that the sensible heat flux dominated the energy partition in dry seasons whereas the latent heat flux was found dominant during wet seasons during rainy and irrigation time the residual method i e rn g h le and two ratios h rn and le rn were used in this study to examine the dynamics of energy partitioning in the ecosystem the main objectives of this paper can be outlined as i to assess the seasonal and annual variation of the energy and water vapor fluxes using the flux observation data of two consecutive years in the semi arid ecosystem ii to evaluate the energy balance ebc closure iii to identify and delineate the causes behind the imbalance of surface energy iv to investigate the energy partitioning with respect to the weather conditions and seasonality and thereby v to contribute to existing literature on the surface energy balance and partitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 station description huailai remote sensing test station hlrsts was established in december 2004 by chinese academy of sciences cas at huailai county of hebei province 115 783 e 40 349 n in china it is about 83 km away from beijing and located in the middle of yan huai basin the station is surrounded by yanshan mountain 10 km from the station cropland guanting reservoir and yeyahu wetland the station fig 1 was set up as the fundamental experimentation and validation base for the quantitative remote sensing products and later added some important measurement platforms e g ec las on september 2012 for the long term monitoring of the ecological energy and hydrological processes for developing the land surface and climate models by ground and tower based remote sensing measurements wireless sensor network and footprint observations this station is also connected with the validation network of remote sensing products in china vrpc ma et al 2015a b the study site is situated at 488 3 m above mean sea level msl the average annual temperature is about 10 and receives the average precipitation of 327 6 mm 2014 2015 defining it as a semi arid agricultural area the soils are generally sandy about 32 loam 28 tight and 10 heavy according to the soil texture measurement in 2015 the year can be divided into four seasons spring april may summer june august autumn september october and winter november march the area is mainly a cropland of maize the average height is 2 2 3 m in mature stage normally the crops are sowing in spring growing in summer and harvesting in autumn the irrigation of this area is mainly rainfed and there are also some extra irrigation practices for the maize crop as the area is situated near a reservoir therefore the water also can be supplied through the soil 2 2 instrumentations this study utilized the following instruments i eddy covariance ec ii automatic weather station aws and iii large aperture scintillometer las the sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used to log raw flux data and the open path gas analyzer li7500 a li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa for the measurement of h2o and co2 in free atmosphere which are the parts of ec four specific instruments of aws were also used in this experiment the 4 component net radiometer kipp zonen delft the netherlands the temperature and humidity probe hmp45c campbell scientific inc usa soil heat flux plate hft3 campbell scientific inc usa and the rain gage te525mm campbell scientific inc usa were used to measure the net radiation temperature and humidity soil heat flux and rainfall respectively the las bls450 scintec ag rottenburg germany was used to measure the area averaged sensible heat flux data the ec system was located 115 788 e 40 349 n at 5 m height the ultrasonic orientation was in the northward direction and the separation between the ultrasonic windspeed meter csat3 and the gas analyzer li7500 a was 15 cm the las was installed with transmitter tower 115 802 3 e 40 3596 n and receiver tower 115 7825 e 40 3522 n the length of the path between the transmitting end and receiving end was 1 87 km and the direction were north east to south west with an angle of 63 the aws was installed on 10 m tower hosted several instruments but for our experiment we used the temperature and humidity probe at 5 m height the rain gage at 10 m height the four component net radiometer was installed at 5 m height and soil heat flux plate was buried at 6 cm underground 1 5 m apart from the tower 2 3 data processing and quality control the raw ec data was of 10 hz acquisition rate and processed by the open source eddypro software version 6 1 li cor biosciences usa to obtain the 30 min data including the following main steps wild point value elimination delay time correction coordinate orientation secondary frequency response correction ultrasonic temperature and density correction and also the atmospheric stability and turbulence similarity the raw 30 min flux data was quality controlled following the steps as described firstly the data were removed during rainfall and instrument maintenance secondly the flux data was rejected if the missing rate of 10 hz raw data exceeded 10 thirdly three quality flags of 0 1 and 2 were assigned to each 30 min flux data based on the stationarity and integral turbulence characteristic tests according to mauder and foken 2011 data with quality flag of 2 was discarded which means these data were measured with unsteady parameters or under poor developed turbulent conditions finally the nighttime flux data with friction velocity lower than 0 1 m s 1 was rejected along with these quality control we also rejected the incomplete 30 min dataset of rn g h and le to obtain a valid dataset in long term measurement data gaps are inevitable therefore data were missing during several hours and days of both years due to the instrumental malfunction and damage of power converter the missing and bad data were filled in two ways 1 by using linear interpolation where the gaps were of few hours 2 by using mean diurnal ensemble method and nonlinear relationship where the gaps were longer falge et al 2001 2 4 calculation of evapotranspiration et the eddy covariance method can provide the direct means of measuring evapotranspiration on long term basis for shorter intervals wilson and baldocchi 2000 using latent heat flux le component the two year 2014 2015 measurement of le was used to observe the evapotranspiration dynamics according to fao irrigation and drainage allen et al 1998 1 w m 2 of radiation latent heat flux le is equal to 0 0864 mj m 2 day 1 of evapotranspiration and 1 mj m 2 day 1 is equal to 0 408 mm day 1 of evapotranspiration these conversion factors were used in this study to calculate the et from le 2 5 evaluation of surface energy balance closure the energy balance closure ebc can be evaluated at different levels such as multi year seasonal and diurnal using different methods in this study the following two methods have been used i the energy balance ratio ebr which is the ratio of the sum of turbulent fluxes to the sum of available energy as 2 e b r h l e r n g s where h and le are the sensible and latent heat flux respectively rn is the net radiation g is the ground heat flux and s is the storage terms the cumulative sum of h le and rn g s over a specified time periods daily seasonal or annual was used to evaluate the energy balance closure the ideal closure will be achieved at unity one value of ebr the advantages of ebr is that it gives an overall evaluation of energy balance closure at longer time scales i e multi years averaging the errors on 30 min measurement data it also has a disadvantage of potential to overlook biases in the 30 min data such as the tendency to overestimate the positive fluxes in day time and underestimate the negative fluxes in night time blanken et al 1998 ii the ordinary least squares ols method which is a linear regression model that will fit the regression between the available energy rn g and the turbulent heat fluxes h le the ideal closure will be achieved when the intercept will be zero and the slope and the coefficient of determination r2 will be one unity but in practical it is not possible so we measures how much the slope is close to unity with significant r2 squires 2001 this method was extensively used in this study 2 6 storage terms the soil heat storage ss above the heat flux was calculated jacobs et al 2008 tanaka et al 2008 as 3 s s c s z p 0 Œ¥ t Œ¥ t d z where c s j m 3 k 1 is the volumetric heat capacity of soil z p is the depth of the soil heat flux plate Œ¥ t k is the soil temperature difference and Œ¥ t s is the output time interval the depth of the soil heat flux plate was 6 cm the canopy heat storage sc was calculated by using the following equation jacobs et al 2003 meyers and hollinger 2004 4 s c Œ¥ t m w c w m b c b Œ¥ t where m w kg m 2 and m b kg m 2 are the masses of water and biomass respectively c w j kg 1 k 1 and c b j kg 1 k 1 are the specific heat capacities of water and biomass respectively the energy storage by photosynthesis sp is produced due to the change in the gibbs free energy which is required to break the bonds of the reactants and those in forming glucose and oxygen meyers and hollinger 2004 the conversion of 1 mg c 0 2 m 2 s 1 canopy assimilation equates to an energy flux of 11 2 wm 2 this conversion factor can be used to evaluate the storage energy of photosynthesis from the eddy covariance measurements 2 7 remote sensing model the surface energy balance system sebs model developed by bob su in the netherlands su 2002 was used in this study to estimate the turbulent heat fluxes from satellite data this model has three distinctive features compared to other surface energy balance models which makes the model suitable to apply in real world situations first the h is calculated using two methods i where the reference height is below the top of the atmospheric surface layer asl the monin obukhov similarity functions are used ii elsewhere the bulk atmospheric similarity model is used wang et al 2008 second most of the models assumed the non dimensional parameter kb 1 as a constant whereas the sebs model computed the kb 1 on a per pixel basis using an improved algorithm that combines a full cover canopy model choudhury and monteith 1988 a bare land model brutsaert 1999 and a new scheme for vegetation bare soil interaction jia et al 2003 su et al 2001 third the h and le are calculated under dry and wet limits the latent heat flux is zero at the dry limit i e the sensible heat flux h d r y is maximum the available energy r n g on other hand at wet limit h w e t is calculated using the reversed penman monteith equation in terms of evaporative fraction efr for every pixel gibson et al 2011 su 2002 at a reference height the h is computed under given meteorological conditions on the basis of monin obukhov similarity theory 5 h k u œÅ c p Œ∏ 0 Œ∏ a ln z d z 0 m œà h z d l œà h z 0 h l 1 where k is the von k √° rm √° n constant u is the friction velocity œÅ is the density of air c p is the specific heat for air at constant pressure Œ∏ 0 is the potential temperature at surface Œ∏ a is the potential air temperature at height z z is the measurement height above the surface d is the displacement height z 0 m and z 0 h are the roughness height for momentum and heat transfer respectively œà h is the stability correction for sensible heat transfer and l is the obukhov length here the relative evaporative fraction efr and evaporative fraction can be expressed as 6 e f r h d r y h h d r y h w e t a n d e f e f r l e w e t r n g the latent heat flux le or evapotranspiration et can be estimated based on the surface energy balance as follows 7 l e e f r n g e f r l e w e t r n g r n g e f r l e w e t for more detail information on sebs model parametrization readers are directed to ma et al 2015a b and su 2002 2 8 surface energy partitioning analysis the eddy covariance surface energy data of two consecutive years 2014 and 2015 were used to evaluate the energy partitioning into sensible h and latent le heat fluxes in the study area ecosystem the daily seasonal growing and non growing and annual dynamics of the surface energy balance components were analyzed and how the sensible and latent heat fluxes correspond to that of net radiation rn the residual of available energy rae was calculated using the following equation 8 r a e r n g h l e to see the partitioning two ratios h rn and le rn were used to examine how the turbulent fluxes were explained by the net solar radiation this study also evaluated how the surface energy partitioning was affected by the direct influence of net radiation rn and vapor pressure deficit vpd during the dry and wet periods following gu et al 2006 and yuan et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 micro meteorological conditions of the study station fig 2 illustrated the daily average of air temperature soil temperature soil water content soil moisture daily sum of precipitation and vapor pressure deficit vpd for 2014 and 2015 at huailai remote sensing test station the overall average temperature was 10 6 in the study period where the maximum temperature was recorded at 28 9 in 2014 with precipitation of 319 9 mm the average annual soil temperature at 4 cm depth was 7 5 and the average annual soil water content at 4 cm depth soil moisture was 15 3 the soil temperature data was missing due to the failure of power during several days of 2015 the soil moisture indicated the pronounced dry and wet period for the study area the recorded annual precipitation was of 335 2 mm in 2015 the annual daily average vpd was varied between 0 02 and 3 3 kpa fig 2d with an overall average of 0 75 0 51 sd kpa the vpd decreased with rainfall and raised up during rain free days within the rainy seasons 3 2 interannual variability of energy and water exchange 3 2 1 seasonal variations of the surface fluxes the daily average and averaged annual measured value of the surface energy balance components of 2014 and 2015 were highlighted in fig 3 statistically the data coverage in 2014 was 70 and 71 in 2015 the maximum values of rn h le and g were 866 4 321 5 555 1 and 89 9 wm 2 in 2014 and 813 0 477 2 533 4 and 60 8 wm 2 in 2015 respectively the minimum values of rn h le and g were 112 0 145 2 167 7 and 35 1 wm 2 in 2014 and 209 9 148 2 160 9 and 56 8 wm 2 in 2015 respectively the two year daily means of rn h le and g were 100 1 29 6 45 2 and 3 4 wm 2 with the standard deviations of 87 1 28 5 46 3 and 8 9 wm 2 respectively the seasonal variations within each component could be observed throughout the years the energy balance components except the h were low at the beginning of each year and as the year progressed they all increased steadily and reached their peak during the middle of the year after reaching to their peak value they started to decrease again and became low by the end of each year the sensible heat flux h was high in magnitude during the starting of each year and was low during the middle of each year the gradual increase was seen during the growing seasons at the middle of each year and the lower value observed during non growing seasons at the starting and ending of each year in comparative analysis the latent heat flux was found to be significantly larger than the sensible heat flux during the growing seasons mid of april to mid of october and the opposite was observed to be true during the non growing periods january to mid of april during the post harvesting period mid of october to december of maize crop the sensible heat flux was little larger than latent heat flux or similar the net radiation was higher during growing seasons with a regular fluctuating tendency the water flux evapotranspiration et was low during non growing periods and high during growing periods with a similar trend like the net radiation and latent heat flux the soil heat flux was very small in magnitude with little increase in the growing seasons 3 2 2 average diurnal patterns of the surface fluxes fig 4 illustrated the average diurnal patterns of the surface fluxes during non growing mid of october mid of april early growing mid of april mid of july the maize crop was getting up to 80 of its total height with younger leaf and late growing mid of july mid of october the maize crop was fruited wilted and harvested periods for 2014 and 2015 the diurnal variation was similar in both years the sensible heat flux was the main part of the available energy during non growing seasons in both years whereas the latent heat flux was the main part of that during early growing seasons during the late growing season wilting and harvesting of maize the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux were similar or sometimes the sensible flux was slightly higher these phenomena were observed to be relatively similar in both years the net radiation was little higher in 2014 as compared to that of 2015 the magnitude of latent heat flux was higher in 2015 as compared to that of 2014 and the magnitude of sensible heat flux was higher in 2014 in comparison to 2015 3 3 assessment of surface energy balance closure ebc using the above mentioned two methods the eq 2 energy balance ratio ebr and ordinary least square ols regression the surface energy balance closure ebc was assessed for two consecutive years 2014 2015 at hlrsts this study performed the diurnal integral and seasonal analysis of ebc to investigate the overall scenario of the surface energy closure in the study site the diurnal analysis showed that the ebc was insignificant during night nocturnal time the integral analysis revealed that the daily ebc was higher than 30 min averages the seasonal variation of ebc indicated better ebc during spring and autumn than summer and winter these analyses are briefly described in the following sections the general closure of ebcs without considering the storage terms was 0 63 2014 and 0 70 2015 with significant correlation coefficients fig 9a and fig 9d the results of this study were in accordance with previous studies such as the ebc was 0 77 for a cropland surface in russia in 1988 tsvang et al 1991 0 62 in kurex 91 experiment panin et al 1998 0 7 0 8 in litfass 2003 for a cropland surface mauder et al 2006 0 58 1 in chinaflux for several surfaces li et al 2005 0 34 1 69 in fluxnet for several surfaces wilson et al 2002 0 79 0 87 in the heihe river basin for cropland forest and grassland liu et al 2011 and 0 71 1 in hiwater musoexe 2012 for several surfaces in china xu et al 2017 3 3 1 diurnal analysis of energy balance ratio ebr all the days with complete 24 hours 30 min interval datasets of 2014 and 2015 were used to observe the mean diurnal variation of ebr the mean values of rn g ss sc h le and ebr were plotted in fig 5 which indicated that the ebr was not meaningful during the transition stages of morning and evening when the mean values of rn g ss sc were near to zero during the night time 0 00 7 00 and 17 00 23 30 the ebrs value were anomalous and not displayed in fig 5 actually the night time data showed higher imbalance of surface energy due to the stable conditions of the atmosphere which minimize the turbulence and prevent the creation of eddies majozi et al 2017 the meaningful values of ebr were observed during the day time 7 30 16 30 and were in similar behavior with previous studies especially like in the fluxnet sites wilson et al 2002 fig 6 also shown that the ebr increased rapidly after 15 00 and was greater than 1 by 16 00 the possible reason behind this diurnal variation of ebr may be the potential contribution of wave phase differences in each energy balance components gao et al 2010 3 3 2 the integral analysis of energy balance closure ebc to evaluate the average and integral analysis of ebc in the study site each component of the surface energy balance rn g h and le for 2014 and 2015 are synchronously averaged on 30 min and daily basis the scatter plot in fig 6a indicated the 30 min averages of the available energy and the turbulent fluxes where the ebc was 66 with a strong correlation coefficient this presented an overall concept of ebc in the study site without considering the storage terms if the soil and canopy heat storage terms were included the ebc improved by 6 to 8 as shown in fig 9 the relationship between rn g and h le for daily averages using the valid data indicated an improvement of about 5 in the ebc as shown in fig 6b therefore in case of daily ebc analysis the storage terms calculations can be ignored but these cannot be ignored in the 30 min energy balance analysis 3 3 3 the seasonal variation of ebc fig 7 showed the seasonal ols analysis for the two year period where the ebc was 0 60 during summer june aug 0 65 during winter nov march 0 70 for spring april may and 0 72 for autumn sept oct respectively the lower ebc during summer and winter can be explained by the cloudy and rainy weather conditions of summer and foggy and snowy weather of winter because the rainfall and fog events could wet the surface of the measuring sensors thus reducing the accuracy of the instruments blonquist et al 2009 michel et al 2007 the spring and autumn seasons show improved ebc due to the clear and gentle weather some previous studies reported lower ebc in winter and higher in spring and autumn majozi et al 2017 wilson et al 2002 opposite result also found as 0 92 in winter over the flat prairie on the northern tibetan plateau ma et al 2009 however the different timescales analyses mentioned above and the discussion in this section mainly focused on the general assessment of the surface energy balance closure ebc which reflected that the imbalance of the surface energy was inevitable consequently this study focused on the possible and potential reasons behind the imbalance of the energy closure in the study site 3 4 reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy until now the possible causes of the lack of energy balance closure ebc are not clear this study discussed the reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy in the measuring station basically the measurement errors systematic and random errors are common in the analysis of surface energy balance system cava et al 2008 foken 2008 the systematic errors are mainly related to the instruments and the random errors occur due to the sampling problem for example an intercomparing study showed that the root mean square error systematic error in ec instruments for measuring rn h and le were 13 10 and 4 wm 2 respectively xu et al 2013 and the random errors of the same instruments were approximately 18 for h and 16 for le measurement wang et al 2015 the magnitude of soil heat flux is relatively small but it can be affected by the irrigation because the soil heat flux plate is buried under the soil surface however the measurement errors are not the potential reasons behind the surface energy imbalance the mismatch of source areas for the energy balance components was another important reason for the imbalance of surface energy again the sampling error occurs due to the inadequate matching of the source area of ec with the source area of net radiometer as the net radiometer is justly constant with time and wind and the systematic errors maybe introduced due to some installation limitations aubinet et al 2000 baldocchi et al 2001 this study site is mainly a rainfed irrigated cropland and situated near a reservoir the wind frequency distribution indicated that the wind was mostly from the northeast ne to southwest sw direction in both years as shown in fig 8 the ec and radiometers were installed at the study site according to the height of the crop wind directions and the field view of each instrument see section 2 2 the footprint analysis according to kormann and meixner 2001 method showed that 90 flux source was coming from the area of 500 m approximately during non growing seasons and about 300 m was during growing period not shown here the ec footprint is always less than the area of its located site xu et al 2017 these results implied that the reservoir was far from the ec source therefore the mismatch of measurement scales was one of the causes behind the energy imbalance in the study site but not the main cause the following sections focused on the main causes behind the lack of ebc in this specific study site 3 4 1 the impacts of heat storage terms generally the flux data directly measured from the instruments do not included the storage terms in this study the storage terms are calculated according to the method discussed in section 2 6 the inclusion of storage terms increased the ebc as shown in fig 9 the soil heat storage increased the ebc by 6 and 8 in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 9b and e whereas the canopy heat storage increased the ebc by 1 for both years fig 9c and f the photosynthesis storage term was ignored as its influence was negligible in yearly analysis similar results were reported by some studies such as s√°nchez et al 2010 showed about 6 increase in ebc with soil heat storage and that of 3 with canopy storage over a boreal forest site of fluxnet and meyers and hollinger 2004 indicated 7 increase in ebc with all heat storage terms over a soybean cropland so the storage terms are the potential reasons for the imbalance of the surface energy however an imbalance of about 22 remained in this study site once all the storage terms were included s√°nchez et al 2010 reported an imbalance of 18 when considering all the storage terms similarly ma et al 2009 reported an imbalance of 30 in summer over the flat prairie on the northern tibetan plateau and xin and liu 2010 also reported an imbalance of 20 over a semi arid area in china therefore this study searched for further reasons behind the lack of ebc 3 4 2 the impacts of vegetation and surface heterogeneity preliminary the monthly variation of ebc was investigated using the ols analysis the scatter plot of rn g vs h le for 30 min dataset of 2014 and 2015 fig 10 illustrated the slope of ols analysis for each month where the trend of ebc was similar in both years the noticeable decrease in ebc was found in the month of june and july for both years the period of june to july in the study site was the early growing time of the maize crop so the significant decrease in ebc can be occurred due to the vegetation heterogeneity to quantify the impacts of vegetation and surface heterogeneity the distinct irrigated and vegetation growing period were selected the crop maize growing and wilting period was predominantly from june to september of each year and it was the main crop grown in the study area the variation of the daily averaged energy balance components rn g h and le were plotted for june 2015 to september 2015 the similar result was found for 2014 not shown here in fig 11 along with the satellite estimation of le based on the sebs model using eleven modis scenes in fig 11 rn and le were positive throughout the total growing and wilting period and they had similar varying tendency in magnitude and the g and h were relatively small with positive or negative values the h revealed minor fluctuations from june to august which increased significantly during early of september and le decreased during same interval due to the wilting of crop the sebs model performed well and was consistent with the ground measurements overall slope 0 90 and r2 0 70 for estimating the four energy balance components the satellite estimation of le was plotted in fig 11d with ground measured le which exposed the sebs model produced good estimation but not the accurate estimation for the whole vegetation growing period the crop growth and irrigation in the study site caused the heterogeneity which resulted in relatively high discrete values in the le estimation the experimental area was mainly irrigated by rainfall which generally receive precipitation between march to october here the duration from april to september was considered for better representation when irrigation occurred in an area the ground soil water content increased rapidly i e a difference in the soil and water content was inducing and increasing the surface heterogeneity after irrigation it gradually spread out increasing homogeneity the daily variation of energy balance ratio ebr and rainfall during the growing period over the cropland for two consecutive years were shown in fig 12 the ebr was decreasing during rainfall increasing the surface heterogeneity and increasing after rainfall as the surface became moderately uniform therefore the surface heterogeneity plays an important role in the imbalance of surface energy and it negatively affected the ebr as the issue of ebc problem is still under debate some researchers hypothesized that it can be a scale problem ec method cannot capture the energy flux from larger eddies and low frequency circulations foken 2008 foken et al 2010 liu et al 2011 this study also found similar result that the vegetation and surface heterogeneity may cause larger eddies which resulted in a decrease in ebr therefore the vegetation and surface heterogeneity can be identified as the potential reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy 3 4 3 impacts of advection on surface energy imbalance as the study site is located near a reservoir guanting this area can be affected by advection due to the movement of water evaporation condensation rainfall infiltration etc through the atmosphere in the ecosystem under advective conditions that h 0 and le 0 the vertical exchange of eddies should contain relatively cool and wet air and also the correlation coefficients between temperature and humidity rtq should negative de bruin et al 2005 some highly advective days data h le and rtq of this study site were analyzed not shown here and found similar characteristics as expected under advective conditions so to investigate the effects of advection on the energy balance closure in the study site we divided the dataset based on three conditions the whole dataset in the day time 07 00 18 00 local time bst data under no advection h 10 w m 2 and 07 00 18 00 and data under advective conditions h 10 w m 2 and 07 00 18 00 as the measurement scale of ec is small the longer averaging period may capture more eddies finnigan et al 2003 the averaging period was set to 30 min 1 h and 2 h for each condition and the las observation of h for energy balance closure analysis were presented in a scattergram fig 13 the results of the year of 2015 the data of 2014 also exhibited the similar phenomena not shown here indicated that the ebc decreased under advective conditions but did not change with increasing averaging period fig 13c f and i the ebc was increased with increasing averaging period under no advection conditions fig 13d e g and h under advective conditions the ebc was statistically insignificant for las measured data the las measured sensible heat flux was considered in this analysis because the las was located near the ec and the study area was flat therefore the advection may destroy the surface energy balance by increasing the residuals of surface energy balance eder et al 2015 gao et al 2017 if the h was measured by las the ebc performed better than when using ec measurements fig 13a and j i e the las observation can be able to closed the surface energy balance better than the ec method foken 2008 the surface energy balance closure problem is a complex issue however the effects of storage terms vegetation and surface heterogeneity occurrence of advection and measurement scale problem were identified as main reasons behind the lack of ebc in this study area although this issue is still under discussion this study can outline the following methods for analyzing the reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy efficient measurement and estimation of storage terms investigation of the impacts of the vegetation and surface heterogeneity investigation of the impacts of advection the effects of low frequency circulations large eddies several timescale analysis and averaging techniques selection of suitable measuring locations in heterogeneous flows improvements of instruments installation based on the optimum measuring scale 3 5 energy partitioning analysis 3 5 1 seasonal energy partitioning the energy partitioning was evaluated for three distinct seasons non growing 1 from january to mid of april winter spring growing sowing to harvest of maize mid of april to mid of october spring summer autumn non growing 2 mid of october to december autumn winter the mean values of the surface energy balance components and their partitioning h rn and le rn as well as the residual of available energy rae during three periods were shown in table 1 for 2014 the similar results also found in 2015 not shown here the net radiation rn was explained by sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux le representing h was 56 of rn during non growing 1 and 15 of rn during growing period the le was 18 of rn during non growing 1 and 46 of rn during growing period for non growing 2 period the h was slightly higher than le in explaining rn the latent heat flux was nearly 70 greater than the sensible heat flux during growing period whereas the opposite was true during the non growing 1 period the le was dominating during growing period because there was large water availability due to the rainfall and vegetation growing maize the rae was 10 14 w m 2 representing 18 of rn during non growing 1 54 18 w m 2 representing 33 of rn during the growing 1 55 w m 2 representing 5 of rn during the non growing 2 the negative result indicated that the soil was the main source of energy to the atmosphere during non growing 2 autumn and winter 3 5 2 influence of weather conditions on energy partitioning to investigate the influence of weather conditions on energy partitioning two most important climatic variables were considered vpd vapor pressure deficit dependent on temperature and humidity and rn net radiation dependent on solar radiation surface emissivity and albedo the daily average values of the selected variables for the whole dataset 2014 2015 was analyzed to observe the partitioning into sensible h and latent le heat fluxes for dry and wet periods fig 14 displayed the relationship between vpd and turbulent fluxes under dry conditions the h was significantly increasing with increasing vpd while the le was constant or slightly increasing with vpd under wet conditions both the h and le were insensitive to the vpd as the combined effects of increasing h and decreasing le may intensify the drought in semi arid areas gu et al 2006 the results indicated that this study area was not prone to drought as seen from fig 15 both the h and le were increasing with increasing rn but not in similar proportion during dry and wet periods the rate of increase in h was higher than that of le during dry seasons whereas the opposite was true during wet seasons the higher increasing tendency of le during wet seasons can be explained by the availability of water rainfall and the vegetation growing maize also illustrated in fig 3b however the rate of increase in h was slow concave during wet season during dry seasons the increasing rate of le was slow due to the limited water availability and there was an abrupt increase in h with an increasing rn 4 conclusions this paper evaluated the dynamics of surface energy fluxes the surface energy balance closure ebc and energy partitioning over a semi arid agricultural region in north china using two years 2014 2015 flux tower observation data this study mainly focused on identifying the reasons behind the imbalance of the surface energy by analyzing the relationship between the available energy rn g and the turbulent fluxes h le soil and canopy heat storage vegetation and surface heterogeneity and advection were identified as the main reasons influencing the energy closure an overall ebc of 0 74 was obtained using the whole 30 min dataset along with the measurement errors the storage terms also include additional energy in the energy balance system here the soil heat storage and canopy heat storage improved the ebc by approximately 6 to 8 in annual analysis therefore the heat storage terms must be considered other reasons behind the lack of ebc were investigated using a combination of ground and satellite measurements the results presented that the vegetation and land surface heterogeneity had a significant impact on the ebr the ebr was decreasing with an increasing surface and vegetation heterogeneity the longer averaging periods e g from 30 min to 2 h improved the ebc i e the more eddies were captured by ec the impacts of advection were also significant in the study site the occurrence of advection destroyed the energy balance system by decreasing ebc trend during the day time actually the ec cannot capture the energy flux from larger eddies and low frequency circulations that result due to the heterogeneity and advection however these are the identified reasons behind the imbalance of surface energy in this specific study site although the issue of surface energy imbalance is still under debate this study felt that this important issue needs more attention of all affected scientific communities to study and discuss the methods for robust correction to remove the uncertainty sources in eddy flux measurements in general the energy partitioning analysis revealed that the sensible heat flux h was dominating the partitioning during the dry seasons and the latent heat flux le was dominating during the wet seasons the energy partitioning was not solely limited by the solar radiation but also controlled by the water availability and vegetation dynamics in the ecosystem during wet seasons the water availability and vegetation growing crop provided high rate of increase in le whereas h was relatively slow in increase the h increased rapidly only during dry season due to the scarcity of water the increase in vpd caused a rapid increase in h during dry seasons but le did not decrease rather increased slightly which implied that this semiarid region was out of danger to drought acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national key research development program of china grant

11176,leaf relative water content lrwc for paddy crop is a key component in evaluating crop growth present study aims to assess the variability of water stress in a rice agriculture system for summer rabi and winter kharif rice during pre monsoon and monsoon period respectively amongst the examined indices water band index wbi normalized water index 3 nwi 3 normalized water index 4 nwi 4 are considered to indicate water stress in paddy crop based on statistical performance of ground based hyperspectral data regression models are developed between each index and lrwc of paddy crop at three phases specifically the vegetative reproductive and ripening phases of paddy crop the result showed that the reproductive phase of paddy crop is the critical growth phase for the aforementioned indices which followed different linear and nonlinear relationships moreover mapping of lrwc of rice agriculture system from hyperspectral imagery is achieved by employing the best index models such as wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 the best estimates of lrwc at the reproductive phase for pre monsoon summer rice agriculture system exhibited wide variation from 61 29 to 91 23 wbi 62 01 to 87 49 nwi 3 and 54 95 to 89 14 nwi 4 on the other hand the best vnir index models wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 that well predicted the lrwc of paddy crop varied from 60 21 to 90 45 wbi 58 58 to 85 67 nwi 3 and 49 08 to 90 40 nwi 4 for winter rice agriculture system it is interesting to note that lrwc mapped from hyperion image has a good agreement with the observed in situ lrwc value 60 64 91 82 obtained for the rice varieties in an indian rice agriculture system this study will provide essential information to assess the paddy field heterogeneity in a rice agriculture system keywords water stress winter rice summer rice hyperion data narrow band water index leaf relative water content 1 introduction leaf relative water content lrwc serves as an important biophysical characteristic of an agricultural crop knowledge related to crop water content and its variation significantly contributes to accurately identifying the physiological status of the crop it can also aid useful information in drought monitoring assessment and thus assist in providing timely irrigation to the crop thus lrwc plays a very crucial role in improving crop health as well as crop yield on the other hand water happens to be a decisive component in rice cultivation as it plays a major role in the photosynthetic and metabolic processes of the rice plant influences chlorophyll production and mobility of fertilizer nutrient and hence undeniably affects rice yield gitelson et al 2005 law et al 2002 long et al 1996 porporato et al 2001 it is very difficult to quantify the crop water status using classical ground based sampling techniques as it is a time consuming laborious process and not feasible for agriculture of a larger dimension it can be better quantified through latest remote sensing techniques through hyperspectral air borne sensor hand held spectroradiometer and multispectral sensors cheng et al 2014 clevers et al 2010 de jong et al 2014 wang et al 2017 from the previous research study it has been reported that the nir region 750 1300 nm and the swir region 1300 2500 nm are greatly influenced by water content in the leaves leaf area index gerhards et al 2016 hunt et al 2011 luo et al 2016 ranjan et al 2015 and the leaf and canopy structure gao 1996 ranjan et al 2015 thenkabail et al 2014 zarco tejada et al 2003 furthermore ceccato et al 2001 identified that the combination of both nir and swir wavelengths produce better estimation of crop water content whereas ray et al 2006 demonstrated that the five best bands 540 610 630 700 and 1000 nm are sensitive in discriminating irrigation treatments additionally temperature narrow band vis nir formulations and chlorophyll fluorescence are strongly correlated to water stress at 747 760 762 and 780 nm wavebands liu et al 2004 zarco tejada et al 2012 to detect agricultural crop water status different indices such as water index wi normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference infrared index ndii and moisture stress index msi are derived using visible nir swir bands of the spectrum gao 1996 hardisky et al 1983 hunt and rock 1989 penuelas et al 1997 on utilization of spectroradiometric measurements ranjan et al 2015 inferred that msi ndii ndwi and normalized multiband drought index nmdi are the most precise and accurate prediction models for lrwc in wheat crop addition of blue band to vegetation index i e enhanced vegetation index evi exhibited better results than ndvi in detecting vegetation water condition although it does not include the shortwave bands that are more sensitive to vegetation water content zhao et al 2016 moreover many researchers demonstrated that the vnir based water index is increasingly employed in monitoring different agricultural crop water status at leaf and canopy levels dobrowski et al 2005 gutierrez et al 2010 liu et al 2004 marino et al 2014 serrano et al 2010 sun et al 2008 although previous studies have accounted for estimating the leaf water content of mostly wheat maize cotton crops now the question arises whether the proposed studies can be suitably used in estimating the lrwc of a really dynamic crop like paddy in indian climatic condition for precision farming furthermore crop chlorophyll pigment and genotype variation in a rice agriculture system may have an impact on rice lrwc therefore further extended research to estimate leaf water content for paddy rice is essential to make useful in the improvement of precision rice agriculture thus the present study envisages the detection of paddy crop water stress from space platform by employing different water indices primarily the performance of water indices to retrieve water content in rice leaf is examined and a relationship between the index and lrwc of rice from ground based hyperspectral measurements is established secondly the most appropriate narrow band water index regression models and the critical growth stage sensitive to the paddy crop water stress are derived in this study finally by using advanced remote sensing techniques different water index models are examined to generate water stress maps showing their spatial variation for summer rabi and winter kharif rice during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively in a rice agriculture system from high spectral resolution hyperion eo 1 imagery 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field sites in india rice is traditionally grown in two seasons as kharif winter rice and rabi summer rice during monsoon and pre monsoon seasons respectively states of assam and odisha which experience hot and humid climate prominently are engaged in rice cultivation for the present study two study sites were considered one in kamrup district of assam north east india and the other in cuttack district of odisha eastern india fig 1 the site located at gerua kamrup district of assam north east india was chosen as one of the study sites for winter rice agriculture system this is the experimental station of the regional rainfed lowland rice research station rrlrrs 26 15 18 84 n 91 33 50 68 e which was considered for winter rice cultivation in monsoon period fig 1 b it experiences a subtropical hot summer climate with an average monthly temperature variation of 11 7 c and it receives an average annual precipitation of 1722 mm the soil type of this area is classified as coarse loamy and it is located at an average elevation of 56 m above the mean sea level on the other hand the farmers agricultural farm fields in the district of cuttack odisha india 20 19 24 84 n 85 32 41 94 e with summer rice cultivation during pre monsoon period was considered as another study site fig 1 c this is an extensively rice cultivated area this area experiences a tropical wet and dry climate where temperatures may exceed 45 c in summer and may fall below 28 c in winter the average annual rainfall is around 1440 mm it is situated at an average elevation of 34 m above the mean sea level the soil is classified as typic tropaquepts as per the modern system of soil classification 2 2 ground based hyperspectral data collection for the present study in situ observations and space borne hyperspectral data are collected from two different study sites state of odisha was considered for pre monsoon summer rice study whereas assam was considered for monsoon winter rice study a new methodology has been adopted to establish the variability mapping of water content for rice agriculture system in 2014 in situ hyperspectral data were collected from an irrigated paddy field in rrlrrs assam for 24 rice varieties namely jaya parijat luit abhishek chandrama shabhagi dhan ranjit baismuthi cr dhan 601 akshya dhan chandan mahsuri tni nilanjana anjali bpt5204 ir64 tapaswini disang joymati vandana kolong naveen and no 15 the plots were prepared using conventional tillage methods to satisfy fertilizer requirement at this site urea was recommended to be applied in three splits i e half of nitrogen was suggested to be applied at the time of sowing and remaining in two equal splits the crop was provided with adequate amount of water by establishing pumping irrigation throughout the growing period paddy crop canopy spectra were acquired under cloud free clear sky conditions with a portable spectroradiometer fieldspec fr asd the spectral range and field of view of the sensor were 350 1050 nm and 25 respectively from each of the rice plots reflectance measurements were taken at a nadir looking angle from 90 cm above its canopy for every observation at least ten measurements spectral reflectance measurements were averaged as the final spectral reflectance representing each paddy field spectral reflectance was computed as the ratio of reflected radiance to incident radiance derived by a calibrated white reference inoue et al 2008 the spectroradiometric spectral reflectance was measured at a weekly interval starting from vegetative phase to ripening phase of the rice species 2 3 field campaign field campaigns were conducted to understand the field topography and obtain detailed information concerning agricultural inputs employed by farmers for the rice agriculture systems of the study sites from the field campaign conducted at rrlrrs assam during the monsoon period of the year 2014 it was found that here the farmers have not yet taken to mechanised cultivation and small holdings of farmers in general stand in the way of mechanised farming detailed information on cultivated rice varieties application of fertilizers and method of irrigation were collected based on the topography rice varieties like shabhagi dhan ranjit baismuthi anjali bpt5204 ir64 tapaswini joymati vandana luit and naveen were grown in the study site organic manure and urea was applied as per fertilizer requirement here in assam the paddy crop cycle was highly dependent on rainwater sometimes the water pumped from the brahmaputra riverbed was used to maintain standing water to a depth of 2 3 cm during monsoon period in the paddy field furthermore field campaign was conducted in the farmers agricultural fields at cuttack odisha during the pre monsoon period of the year 2016 in this campaign detailed information were collected through interaction with farmers regarding summer paddy crop varieties topographic conditions suited for summer rice cultivation application of fertilizers and mode of irrigation used in the agricultural farmland rice varieties such as khandagiri konark lalata laxmisagar naveen no 303 purusotum pratikhya and surendra were grown in this site with assured irrigation here number of small holdings of farmers were less as compared to the site in assam still the farmers were following mostly traditional method of cultivation though mechanised cultivation methods were also adopted to some extent the most important factor for summer rice production is availability of steady supply of water at early seedling stage with low temperature condition the summer rice cultivation in odisha is mainly controlled by the slope of the agricultural land according to which irrigation water is supplied here water from river bed and bore wells were used for adequate water supply throughout the cropping cycle mostly urea was applied as fertilizer in three splits in addition to organic farmyard manure in a similar way as mentioned for winter rice agriculture site 2 4 acquisition of space borne hyperspectral data hyperion sensor on board the earth observing 1 eo 1 mission is unique in the way that it maintains a high resolution hyperspectral imager capable of resolving wavelength range from 357 to 2576 nm spanning the vir nir and swir regions into 220 contiguous unique spectral bands of 10 nm resolution each hyperion can capture a surface area of 7 5 km by 100 km in a single image at a spatial resolution of 30 m ready information on a temporal scene for a certain location is not available therefore level 1 radiometrically corrected hyperion satellite data were requested for the study sites in assam and odisha under customers data acquisition requests dars scheme and downloaded from https eo1 gsfc nasa gov the details of acquired hyperion images scene characteristics of the study sites are listed in table 1 these images obtained from the hyperion sensor have to be pre processed carefully before analyzing them for any other application 2 4 1 hyperspectral data pre processing the radiometrically corrected image acquired from hyperion sensor eo 1 satellite covering the experimental site required careful processing to nullify the sensor noise it was processed by using remote sensing rs image processing software envi 4 5 the hyperspectral imagery pre processing includes rescaling abnormal pixels stripping cross track illumination correction elimination of non calibrated bad bands destripping minimum noise fraction transformation mnft prior to atmospheric and geometric correction here fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash algorithm was implemented for atmospheric correction and to get geometrically corrected product l1gst hyperion data of the same area was also used at last a spatial subset was selected from the whole scene from each of the study sites for analysis 2 5 plant leaf sampling and leaf relative water content measurements the plant leaf samples were collected from the experimental study site in assam india leaf water content was measured for the 24 rice varieties during their vegetative reproductive and ripening phases from each experimental plot just after each canopy spectral reflectance measurement plant samples 7 15 plants plot were randomly selected plant leaves were removed from its stem for the measurement by standard procedures lrwc was calculated based on oven dry method pask et al 2012 values of fresh mass fm turgid mass tm and dry mass dm were determined to calculate lrwc using the following formula 1 lrwc fm dm tm dm 100 2 6 narrow band index approach to evaluate water stress from space platform the functional relationship between relative water content in leaves and spectrum reflectance in visible and nir regions provided a non destructive technique employing visible spectral reflectance for accurate assessment of lrwc frampton et al 2013 hill 2013 zygielbaum et al 2009 additionally water absorption bands are strongly correlated with narrow band reflectance and derivative spectra in the visible near infrared vnir and shortwave infrared swir sanches et al 2014 ullah et al 2012 it was proved to be insufficient to find out lrwc using single band reflectance information thus in order to estimate lrwc more accurately narrow band indices with reflectance at two or more bands are being used mariotto et al 2013 mutanga and skidmore 2004 zhang et al 2012 rice is a very dynamic crop that varies with different topographical position and climatic zones paddy crop growth stages largely depend on the availability of leaf water content moreover the water stress at the crop developmental stage reduces rice grain yield drastically especially when the leaf water content is seriously affected this research aims to employ the narrow band water indices specifically designed for water stress of different agricultural crops to quantify the rice leaf water content accurately from space borne

narrow band indices and the observed lrwc at three phases vegetative the reproductive and the ripening during the monsoon period secondly the best performing vegetation narrow band water indices in different crop developmental phases are selected based on performance of statistical analysis at the end mapping of lrwc variation is demonstrated in winter and summer rice agriculture system from hyperion imagery during monsoon period in assam and pre monsoon period in odisha respectively in a crop calendar in indian climatic condition the relationship between the eight vnir indices and lrwc are established for the three developmental phases and their performance are summarized in table 3 it can be inferred from the obtained results that the eight vnir water indices i e water band index wbi ratio vegetation index rvi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi floating position water band index fwbi normalized water index 1 nwi 1 normalized water index 2 nwi 2 normalized water index 3 nwi 3 and normalized water index 4 nwi 4 follow both linear and non linear correlation with lrwc for the growth phases of winter rice during monsoon period table 3 shows that during the vegetative phase of the winter rice wbi fwbi nwi 4 performed better than the other examined water indices it is observed that wbi rvi ndvi nwi 2 nwi 3 nwi 4 performed better than others at its reproductive phase where as wbi and nwi 3 exhibited good results than other indices at its ripening phase 3 2 determination of critical stage for lrwc measurement the index wbi exhibited a satisfactory correlation with lrwc at all the three phases with nonlinear regression relation at vegetative phase having r2 0 739 and linear regression relation at reproductive and ripening phase of paddy crop with r2 values 0 819 and 0 601 respectively table 3 moreover the index ndvi did not perform well for paddy crop whereas it is interesting to note that satisfactory results for assessment of rice water content is observed only at reproductive and vegetative phases for rvi and fwbi respectively besides these nwi 1 and nwi 2 produced unsatisfactory results in predicting leaf water content for the three phases of rice crop except the findings obtained by nwi 2 for reproductive phase the nwi 3 and nwi 4 indices exhibited satisfactory results for reproductive phase of paddy crop from the regression model analysis it can be observed that the reproductive phase is the most sensitive phase in estimating lrwc for paddy crop furthermore wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 among the tested eight indices exhibited a very good correlation with lrwc at reproductive phase based on the performance of statistics these three indices produced improved results in estimation of rice lrwc which are demonstrated in figs 3 5 as mentioned earlier it is important to precisely predict the lrwc of rice varieties therefore it is further compared with published regression models jin et al 2013 ranjan et al 2015 comparison between the present and published wbi regression models is demonstrated in fig 6 it is found that the present wbi regression model indicated a strong agreement between the observed and the predicted lrwc of paddy rice with re 4 355 ioa 0 898 meanwhile the published wbi regression models predicted unacceptable results for paddy crop evident from the statistical analysis in table 4 because the published regression models are designed for various wheat species thus they could not provide good result for paddy crop moreover it is inferred from fig 6 that there should be a unique regression model for paddy crop to predict lrwc rather than using the regression models developed for crops other than paddy crop the results suggested that the wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 regression models could be used to estimate lrwc of paddy crop more efficiently 3 3 mapping of lrwc of agricultural crop from hyperspectral imagery 3 3 1 mapping of lrwc for winter rice agriculture system a detailed quantitative assessment of spatial variability of lrwc has been carried out for winter rice agriculture system in assam india from hyperion imagery by utilizing well established index models wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 the lrwc mapping using the presently developed index models are shown in fig 7 a c from fig 7 a it is inferred that lrwc derived from wbi regression model is well distributed spatially the estimated lrwc obtained from hyperion imagery ranged from 60 21 to 90 45 this wbi model is in good agreement with the observed lrwc value 60 64 91 82 for the studied rice varieties in winter rice agriculture system moreover it can be clearly understood that narrow wavebands at nir region are significantly correlated to water stress of paddy crop because the nir wavelengths at 900 nm 970 nm penetrate deeper into the crop canopy and thus produced satisfactory results in order to estimate water content accurately babar et al 2006 gutierrez et al 2010 it is revealed from fig 7 b that nwi 3 model estimates the lrwc spatial variation from hyperion imagery varying from 58 58 to 85 67 for winter rice during monsoon period the estimated lrwc has a good agreement with the observed in situ lrwc value it is clearly confirmed from this index model that there is a strong relationship between nir narrow wavebands to determine lrwc accurately furthermore the spatial distribution obtained from nwi 4 linear regression model exhibited well acceptable performance where lrwc varied widely from 49 08 to 90 40 fig 7 c the variability is clearly distinguished showing the field heterogeneity in the agriculture field during monsoon period 3 3 2 mapping of lrwc for summer rice agriculture system the spatial variability of lrwc is achieved from space platform through hyperion imagery by employing vnir narrow band index models which are shown in fig 8 a c by utilizing the presently developed wbi model it is observed that the lrwc variation ranged from 61 29 to 91 23 in a summer rice agriculture system while the same model exhibited 60 21 90 45 spatial variation for winter rice fig 8 a it happened so because of the seasonal variation of rice agriculture system this variation may be attributed due to the fact that the rice species cultivated in farmers fields are different from the species studied in the experimental field and the water availability during pre monsoon period may also be an influencing factor furthermore spatial distribution of lrwc obtained from hyperion image by employing nwi 3 model revealed satisfactory outcomes from hyperspectral imagery with a wide variation of 62 01 87 49 fig 8 b it is observed that the seasonal variability under pre monsoon period can be captured well under nwi 3 regression model approach from hyperspectral imagery in case of summer rice cultivation practice on the other hand from fig 8 c it is noticed that the nwi 4 model exhibited adequate findings with lrwc variation of 54 95 89 14 for the same agriculture area during pre monsoon period the estimated lrwc from the index models exhibited close field variation is clearly observed from these index models 3 3 3 validation of lrwc for the rice agriculture system hyperspectral imagery contains more than hundreds of narrowbands and provides additional information that multispectral data have missed these almost continuous spectral data have the potential for better differentiation and estimation of biophysical attributes for agricultural applications to provide a better understanding of the different index models that are developed for the estimation of the paddy crop leaf water content from hyperion data the validation procedure is employed the estimated lrwc from hyperion data is validated against ground based measurements of lrwc of paddy crop the validation outcomes for the lrwc mapping of paddy crop resulting from hyperion imagery with utilization of vnir narrow band index regression models are reported in table 5 it is found that the mean value of lrwc in summer rice is quite less than that of winter rice it is interesting to note that lrwc mapped from hyperion image has a good agreement with the observed in situ lrwc value obtained for the rice varieties from table 5 it is inferred that within the ground based lrwc value that ranged from 60 64 to 91 82 with a standard deviation of 1 274 the best vnir index models wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 well predicted the lrwc that varied from 60 21 to 90 45 58 58 to 85 67 and 49 08 to 90 40 respectively for the winter rice agriculture system obtained from hyperion imagery however it was not possible to synchronize hyperion findings with ground measurements of the summer rice agriculture system considering the observed lrwc of 24 rice varieties in the study area grown in a winter rice agriculture system these index models performed approximately in the same range of spatial distribution of lrwc for a summer rice agriculture system from hyperion imagery however the proposed methodology is limited to some extent due to availability of limited number of temporal sets of hyperion imagery 4 conclusions reproductive phase is clearly identified as the most sensitive phase in evaluating leaf water content of paddy crop through narrow band water indices hyperspectral indices particularly wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 showed strong correlation with lrwc at this phase moreover the narrow band index models are established in estimating lrwc of paddy crop from space platform hyperion imagery in an indian rice agriculture system the best vnir index models wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 well predicted the lrwc of paddy crop that varied from 60 21 to 90 45 58 58 to 85 67 and 49 08 to 90 40 respectively for winter rice agriculture system significantly the result confirmed that the predicted lrwc from vnir index models exhibited very good agreement with the observed in situ lrwc value that ranged from 60 64 to 91 82 for an indian rice agriculture system on the other hand wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 index models performed well in mapping of lrwc in an indian summer rice agriculture system from hyperion imagery with a very high accuracy the outcomes of hyperion imagery revealed that the spatial distribution of lrwc varied from 61 29 to 91 23 wbi 62 01 to 87 49 nwi 3 and 54 95 to 89 14 nwi 4 in summer rice agriculture system the findings of the results concluded that the above index models effectively performed in predicting the lrwc of paddy crop from hyperion imagery with a very close agreement with ground based lrwc value for an indian rice agriculture system however these index based predictive models need to be tested with more number of in situ data sets in different agro climatic regions for more reliability and better acceptance 
11176,leaf relative water content lrwc for paddy crop is a key component in evaluating crop growth present study aims to assess the variability of water stress in a rice agriculture system for summer rabi and winter kharif rice during pre monsoon and monsoon period respectively amongst the examined indices water band index wbi normalized water index 3 nwi 3 normalized water index 4 nwi 4 are considered to indicate water stress in paddy crop based on statistical performance of ground based hyperspectral data regression models are developed between each index and lrwc of paddy crop at three phases specifically the vegetative reproductive and ripening phases of paddy crop the result showed that the reproductive phase of paddy crop is the critical growth phase for the aforementioned indices which followed different linear and nonlinear relationships moreover mapping of lrwc of rice agriculture system from hyperspectral imagery is achieved by employing the best index models such as wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 the best estimates of lrwc at the reproductive phase for pre monsoon summer rice agriculture system exhibited wide variation from 61 29 to 91 23 wbi 62 01 to 87 49 nwi 3 and 54 95 to 89 14 nwi 4 on the other hand the best vnir index models wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 that well predicted the lrwc of paddy crop varied from 60 21 to 90 45 wbi 58 58 to 85 67 nwi 3 and 49 08 to 90 40 nwi 4 for winter rice agriculture system it is interesting to note that lrwc mapped from hyperion image has a good agreement with the observed in situ lrwc value 60 64 91 82 obtained for the rice varieties in an indian rice agriculture system this study will provide essential information to assess the paddy field heterogeneity in a rice agriculture system keywords water stress winter rice summer rice hyperion data narrow band water index leaf relative water content 1 introduction leaf relative water content lrwc serves as an important biophysical characteristic of an agricultural crop knowledge related to crop water content and its variation significantly contributes to accurately identifying the physiological status of the crop it can also aid useful information in drought monitoring assessment and thus assist in providing timely irrigation to the crop thus lrwc plays a very crucial role in improving crop health as well as crop yield on the other hand water happens to be a decisive component in rice cultivation as it plays a major role in the photosynthetic and metabolic processes of the rice plant influences chlorophyll production and mobility of fertilizer nutrient and hence undeniably affects rice yield gitelson et al 2005 law et al 2002 long et al 1996 porporato et al 2001 it is very difficult to quantify the crop water status using classical ground based sampling techniques as it is a time consuming laborious process and not feasible for agriculture of a larger dimension it can be better quantified through latest remote sensing techniques through hyperspectral air borne sensor hand held spectroradiometer and multispectral sensors cheng et al 2014 clevers et al 2010 de jong et al 2014 wang et al 2017 from the previous research study it has been reported that the nir region 750 1300 nm and the swir region 1300 2500 nm are greatly influenced by water content in the leaves leaf area index gerhards et al 2016 hunt et al 2011 luo et al 2016 ranjan et al 2015 and the leaf and canopy structure gao 1996 ranjan et al 2015 thenkabail et al 2014 zarco tejada et al 2003 furthermore ceccato et al 2001 identified that the combination of both nir and swir wavelengths produce better estimation of crop water content whereas ray et al 2006 demonstrated that the five best bands 540 610 630 700 and 1000 nm are sensitive in discriminating irrigation treatments additionally temperature narrow band vis nir formulations and chlorophyll fluorescence are strongly correlated to water stress at 747 760 762 and 780 nm wavebands liu et al 2004 zarco tejada et al 2012 to detect agricultural crop water status different indices such as water index wi normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference infrared index ndii and moisture stress index msi are derived using visible nir swir bands of the spectrum gao 1996 hardisky et al 1983 hunt and rock 1989 penuelas et al 1997 on utilization of spectroradiometric measurements ranjan et al 2015 inferred that msi ndii ndwi and normalized multiband drought index nmdi are the most precise and accurate prediction models for lrwc in wheat crop addition of blue band to vegetation index i e enhanced vegetation index evi exhibited better results than ndvi in detecting vegetation water condition although it does not include the shortwave bands that are more sensitive to vegetation water content zhao et al 2016 moreover many researchers demonstrated that the vnir based water index is increasingly employed in monitoring different agricultural crop water status at leaf and canopy levels dobrowski et al 2005 gutierrez et al 2010 liu et al 2004 marino et al 2014 serrano et al 2010 sun et al 2008 although previous studies have accounted for estimating the leaf water content of mostly wheat maize cotton crops now the question arises whether the proposed studies can be suitably used in estimating the lrwc of a really dynamic crop like paddy in indian climatic condition for precision farming furthermore crop chlorophyll pigment and genotype variation in a rice agriculture system may have an impact on rice lrwc therefore further extended research to estimate leaf water content for paddy rice is essential to make useful in the improvement of precision rice agriculture thus the present study envisages the detection of paddy crop water stress from space platform by employing different water indices primarily the performance of water indices to retrieve water content in rice leaf is examined and a relationship between the index and lrwc of rice from ground based hyperspectral measurements is established secondly the most appropriate narrow band water index regression models and the critical growth stage sensitive to the paddy crop water stress are derived in this study finally by using advanced remote sensing techniques different water index models are examined to generate water stress maps showing their spatial variation for summer rabi and winter kharif rice during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively in a rice agriculture system from high spectral resolution hyperion eo 1 imagery 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field sites in india rice is traditionally grown in two seasons as kharif winter rice and rabi summer rice during monsoon and pre monsoon seasons respectively states of assam and odisha which experience hot and humid climate prominently are engaged in rice cultivation for the present study two study sites were considered one in kamrup district of assam north east india and the other in cuttack district of odisha eastern india fig 1 the site located at gerua kamrup district of assam north east india was chosen as one of the study sites for winter rice agriculture system this is the experimental station of the regional rainfed lowland rice research station rrlrrs 26 15 18 84 n 91 33 50 68 e which was considered for winter rice cultivation in monsoon period fig 1 b it experiences a subtropical hot summer climate with an average monthly temperature variation of 11 7 c and it receives an average annual precipitation of 1722 mm the soil type of this area is classified as coarse loamy and it is located at an average elevation of 56 m above the mean sea level on the other hand the farmers agricultural farm fields in the district of cuttack odisha india 20 19 24 84 n 85 32 41 94 e with summer rice cultivation during pre monsoon period was considered as another study site fig 1 c this is an extensively rice cultivated area this area experiences a tropical wet and dry climate where temperatures may exceed 45 c in summer and may fall below 28 c in winter the average annual rainfall is around 1440 mm it is situated at an average elevation of 34 m above the mean sea level the soil is classified as typic tropaquepts as per the modern system of soil classification 2 2 ground based hyperspectral data collection for the present study in situ observations and space borne hyperspectral data are collected from two different study sites state of odisha was considered for pre monsoon summer rice study whereas assam was considered for monsoon winter rice study a new methodology has been adopted to establish the variability mapping of water content for rice agriculture system in 2014 in situ hyperspectral data were collected from an irrigated paddy field in rrlrrs assam for 24 rice varieties namely jaya parijat luit abhishek chandrama shabhagi dhan ranjit baismuthi cr dhan 601 akshya dhan chandan mahsuri tni nilanjana anjali bpt5204 ir64 tapaswini disang joymati vandana kolong naveen and no 15 the plots were prepared using conventional tillage methods to satisfy fertilizer requirement at this site urea was recommended to be applied in three splits i e half of nitrogen was suggested to be applied at the time of sowing and remaining in two equal splits the crop was provided with adequate amount of water by establishing pumping irrigation throughout the growing period paddy crop canopy spectra were acquired under cloud free clear sky conditions with a portable spectroradiometer fieldspec fr asd the spectral range and field of view of the sensor were 350 1050 nm and 25 respectively from each of the rice plots reflectance measurements were taken at a nadir looking angle from 90 cm above its canopy for every observation at least ten measurements spectral reflectance measurements were averaged as the final spectral reflectance representing each paddy field spectral reflectance was computed as the ratio of reflected radiance to incident radiance derived by a calibrated white reference inoue et al 2008 the spectroradiometric spectral reflectance was measured at a weekly interval starting from vegetative phase to ripening phase of the rice species 2 3 field campaign field campaigns were conducted to understand the field topography and obtain detailed information concerning agricultural inputs employed by farmers for the rice agriculture systems of the study sites from the field campaign conducted at rrlrrs assam during the monsoon period of the year 2014 it was found that here the farmers have not yet taken to mechanised cultivation and small holdings of farmers in general stand in the way of mechanised farming detailed information on cultivated rice varieties application of fertilizers and method of irrigation were collected based on the topography rice varieties like shabhagi dhan ranjit baismuthi anjali bpt5204 ir64 tapaswini joymati vandana luit and naveen were grown in the study site organic manure and urea was applied as per fertilizer requirement here in assam the paddy crop cycle was highly dependent on rainwater sometimes the water pumped from the brahmaputra riverbed was used to maintain standing water to a depth of 2 3 cm during monsoon period in the paddy field furthermore field campaign was conducted in the farmers agricultural fields at cuttack odisha during the pre monsoon period of the year 2016 in this campaign detailed information were collected through interaction with farmers regarding summer paddy crop varieties topographic conditions suited for summer rice cultivation application of fertilizers and mode of irrigation used in the agricultural farmland rice varieties such as khandagiri konark lalata laxmisagar naveen no 303 purusotum pratikhya and surendra were grown in this site with assured irrigation here number of small holdings of farmers were less as compared to the site in assam still the farmers were following mostly traditional method of cultivation though mechanised cultivation methods were also adopted to some extent the most important factor for summer rice production is availability of steady supply of water at early seedling stage with low temperature condition the summer rice cultivation in odisha is mainly controlled by the slope of the agricultural land according to which irrigation water is supplied here water from river bed and bore wells were used for adequate water supply throughout the cropping cycle mostly urea was applied as fertilizer in three splits in addition to organic farmyard manure in a similar way as mentioned for winter rice agriculture site 2 4 acquisition of space borne hyperspectral data hyperion sensor on board the earth observing 1 eo 1 mission is unique in the way that it maintains a high resolution hyperspectral imager capable of resolving wavelength range from 357 to 2576 nm spanning the vir nir and swir regions into 220 contiguous unique spectral bands of 10 nm resolution each hyperion can capture a surface area of 7 5 km by 100 km in a single image at a spatial resolution of 30 m ready information on a temporal scene for a certain location is not available therefore level 1 radiometrically corrected hyperion satellite data were requested for the study sites in assam and odisha under customers data acquisition requests dars scheme and downloaded from https eo1 gsfc nasa gov the details of acquired hyperion images scene characteristics of the study sites are listed in table 1 these images obtained from the hyperion sensor have to be pre processed carefully before analyzing them for any other application 2 4 1 hyperspectral data pre processing the radiometrically corrected image acquired from hyperion sensor eo 1 satellite covering the experimental site required careful processing to nullify the sensor noise it was processed by using remote sensing rs image processing software envi 4 5 the hyperspectral imagery pre processing includes rescaling abnormal pixels stripping cross track illumination correction elimination of non calibrated bad bands destripping minimum noise fraction transformation mnft prior to atmospheric and geometric correction here fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes flaash algorithm was implemented for atmospheric correction and to get geometrically corrected product l1gst hyperion data of the same area was also used at last a spatial subset was selected from the whole scene from each of the study sites for analysis 2 5 plant leaf sampling and leaf relative water content measurements the plant leaf samples were collected from the experimental study site in assam india leaf water content was measured for the 24 rice varieties during their vegetative reproductive and ripening phases from each experimental plot just after each canopy spectral reflectance measurement plant samples 7 15 plants plot were randomly selected plant leaves were removed from its stem for the measurement by standard procedures lrwc was calculated based on oven dry method pask et al 2012 values of fresh mass fm turgid mass tm and dry mass dm were determined to calculate lrwc using the following formula 1 lrwc fm dm tm dm 100 2 6 narrow band index approach to evaluate water stress from space platform the functional relationship between relative water content in leaves and spectrum reflectance in visible and nir regions provided a non destructive technique employing visible spectral reflectance for accurate assessment of lrwc frampton et al 2013 hill 2013 zygielbaum et al 2009 additionally water absorption bands are strongly correlated with narrow band reflectance and derivative spectra in the visible near infrared vnir and shortwave infrared swir sanches et al 2014 ullah et al 2012 it was proved to be

lrwc at all the three phases with nonlinear regression relation at vegetative phase having r2 0 739 and linear regression relation at reproductive and ripening phase of paddy crop with r2 values 0 819 and 0 601 respectively table 3 moreover the index ndvi did not perform well for paddy crop whereas it is interesting to note that satisfactory results for assessment of rice water content is observed only at reproductive and vegetative phases for rvi and fwbi respectively besides these nwi 1 and nwi 2 produced unsatisfactory results in predicting leaf water content for the three phases of rice

cultivation practice on the other hand from fig 8 c it is noticed that the nwi 4 model exhibited adequate findings with lrwc variation of 54 95 89 14 for the same agriculture area during pre monsoon period the estimated lrwc from the index models exhibited close field variation is clearly observed from these index models 3 3 3 validation of lrwc for the rice agriculture system hyperspectral imagery contains more than hundreds of narrowbands and provides additional information that multispectral data have missed these almost continuous spectral data have the potential for better differentiation and estimation of biophysical attributes for agricultural applications to provide a better understanding of the different index models that are developed for the estimation of the paddy crop leaf water content from hyperion data the validation procedure is employed the estimated lrwc from hyperion data is validated against ground based measurements of lrwc of paddy crop the validation outcomes for the lrwc mapping of paddy crop resulting from hyperion imagery with utilization of vnir narrow band index regression models are reported in table 5 it is found that the mean value of lrwc in summer rice is quite less than that of winter rice it is interesting to note that lrwc mapped from hyperion image has a good agreement with the observed in situ lrwc value obtained for the rice varieties from table 5 it is inferred that within the ground based lrwc value that ranged from 60 64 to 91 82 with a standard deviation of 1 274 the best vnir index models wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 well predicted the lrwc that varied from 60 21 to 90 45 58 58 to 85 67 and 49 08 to 90 40 respectively for the winter rice agriculture system obtained from hyperion imagery however it was not possible to synchronize hyperion findings with ground measurements of the summer rice agriculture system considering the observed lrwc of 24 rice varieties in the study area grown in a winter rice agriculture system these index models performed approximately in the same range of spatial distribution of lrwc for a summer rice agriculture system from hyperion imagery however the proposed methodology is limited to some extent due to availability of limited number of temporal sets of hyperion imagery 4 conclusions reproductive phase is clearly identified as the most sensitive phase in evaluating leaf water content of paddy crop through narrow band water indices hyperspectral indices particularly wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 showed strong correlation with lrwc at this phase moreover the narrow band index models are established in estimating lrwc of paddy crop from space platform hyperion imagery in an indian rice agriculture system the best vnir index models wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 well predicted the lrwc of paddy crop that varied from 60 21 to 90 45 58 58 to 85 67 and 49 08 to 90 40 respectively for winter rice agriculture system significantly the result confirmed that the predicted lrwc from vnir index models exhibited very good agreement with the observed in situ lrwc value that ranged from 60 64 to 91 82 for an indian rice agriculture system on the other hand wbi nwi 3 and nwi 4 index models performed well in mapping of lrwc in an indian summer rice agriculture system from hyperion imagery with a very high accuracy the outcomes of hyperion imagery revealed that the spatial distribution of lrwc varied from 61 29 to 91 23 wbi 62 01 to 87 49 nwi 3 and 54 95 to 89 14 nwi 4 in summer rice agriculture system the findings of the results concluded that the above index models effectively performed in predicting the lrwc of paddy crop from hyperion imagery with a very close agreement with ground based lrwc value for an indian rice agriculture system however these index based predictive models need to be tested with more number of in situ data sets in different agro climatic regions for more reliability and better acceptance

yield reductions across 60 of global bean production areas white et al 1991 about 90 of iran extends over arid and semi arid areas fao 2010 where drought stress represents an inevitable condition to be suffered by crops such as common bean drought is a major limiting factor for crop productivity worldwide jones and corlett 1992 so martinez et al 2007 that development of crops with increased tolerance to such stresses appears to be crucial for keeping yield in areas where dry seasons are common reduced water availability results in a complex set of responses including lower water potential of plant tissues which leads to a variety of modifications in different plant processes examples of these are growth inhibition stomatal closure reduced transpiration and photosynthetic rates and formation of radical scavenging compounds yordanov et al 2000 shao et al 2009 these responses depend on intensity of the stress the plant genotype and the plant developmental stage at stress incidence among other factors when it comes to drought resistance genotypic differences have been reported for common bean genotypes by ter√°n and singh 2002 who reported significantly lower seed yields for all common bean genotypes under drought stress conditions rather than non drought stress environment they showed that on average drought stress tended to reduce yield of common bean by 53 ter√°n and singh 2002 reported that drought stress decreased reproductive period in common bean reducing the number of days to maturity in contrary boutraa and sanders 2001 showed that water stress imposes no significant effect on time to maturity and time to flowering of common bean genotypes under water deficit conditions the reduction in water availability decreases leaf rwc and stomatal closure leading to a reduction of co2 availability and consequently lower photosynthesis rate an and wue bota et al 2004 high rwc values are indicative of a situation where tissues are able to take up and or hold more water than that taken by tissues with lower rwc rosales et al 2012 chlorophyll content of common bean is also reduced as a result of the degradation caused by drought conditions barrios and rodr√≠guez 1991 and is directly related to biomass accumulation a significant relationship among foliar greenness chlorophyll content and seed yield was previously detected in wheat triticum aestivum fischer 2001 water restriction can also affect stomatal conductance as rosales et al 2012 reported when plants were subjected to terminal drought a significant decrease occurred in the yield of common bean genotypes ctd is an appropriate index for determining the plant s water status and response to drought stress jackson et al 1981 blum et al 1982 idso 1982 it has been used in

katsura et al 2007 2008 based on monteith s principles monteith and moss 1977 total aboveground dry matter tadm is defined as tadm ir fri rue where ir is the incident radiation and fri is the fraction of radiation intercepted by the crop canopy when water stress occurs the relationships among these factors change in such a way that results in reduced crop s ability to capture light williams and boote 1995 under water stress conditions the fraction of intercepted par and leaf area index are used to evaluate the effects of drought stress on crops collino et al 2001 the present study was aimed at determining effects of deficit irrigation on yield physiology and biochemistry of two bean genotypes 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions two common bean genotypes were

for the homogeneity of variances bartlett 1947 all data were analyzed utilizing a sas proc glm statistical package sas 9 4 and the differences between the means were compared by slicing of irrigation genotype interaction p 0 05 3 results the effect of irrigation regime on seed yield chlorophyll content rwc wue wp pari and rue were highly significant also the effect of genotype on seed yield rwc wp and pari were highly significant the leaf greenness and rue affected significantly by genotype in contrast genotype was found to have no effect on wue interaction of irrigation regime and genotype had significant effect on seed yield chlorophyll rwc wue wp pari and rue table 3 seed yield g m 2 in 2015 was more than that in 2014 table 4 genotype ks21193 had higher seed yield under nds condition whereas under mds and sds conditions genotypes ks21193 was more affected with 65 9 and 89 6 of reduction in seed yield respectively it was while in both mds and sds conditions the genotype ks21486 was less affected showing only 13 9 and 54 4 of reduction in seed yield respectively life cycle of genotype ks21486 in all irrigation regimes and both years was shorter than ks21193 fig 2 under mds condition fully ripe was reached in ks21193 by 0 8 and 5 1 earlier than that under nds conditions in 2014 and 2015 respectively similarly in ks21486 ripening was occurrence earlier by 9 6 and 9 in 2014 and 2015 respectively under sds condition genotype ks21486 don t show changes in life cycle whereas genotype ks21193 showed life cycle reduction by 0 7 in 2015 reduction in water use was associated with decreased chlorophyll content spad table 4 reduction were 23 2 under mds condition and 42 6 under sds condition there was no significant difference between two genotypes under nds and mds conditions in terms of chlorophyll content whereas genotype ks21193 had more chlorophyll content under sds condition deficit irrigation decreased rwc in both genotypes so that under mds and sds conditions ksa21486 genotype had lower reductions in rwc reduced irrigation water resulted in lower sc before each irrigation but after irrigation sc increased in both genotypes fig 3 under mds condition sc of ks21193 reduced averagely by 16 8 2014 and 29 2015 whereas in this condition sc of ks21486 was reduced by 1 7 and 13 5 in 2014 and 2015 respectively also under sds condition sc reduction in ks21193 was 43 5 2014 and 44 2015 and in ks21486 was 32 9 2014 and 37 2015 in all irrigation regimes average sc of ks21486 at before irrigation was more than ks21193 fig 3 deficit irrigation reduced ctd in both genotype but reduction was more in ks21193 under mds and sds conditions ctd of genotype ks21193 reduced averagely by 5 6 and 9 6 c respectively mean ctd reduction in genotype ks21486 were showed 5 5 c under mds and 9 1 c under sds conditions also ctd was low and high before and after each irrigation respectively in both genotypes under mds and sds conditions even after irrigation ctd was lower than that before irrigation under nds condition in overall ctd of genotype ks21486 were more than genotype ks21193 in all irrigation regimes fig 4 deficit irrigation increased malondialdehyde mda hydrogen peroxide h2o2 super oxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat contents but by different amounts in two genotypes also mda h2o2 sod pod apx and cat were more at r7 pod formation stage rather than r5 pre flowering stage under nds condition mda and h2o2 did not change at r5 and r7 stages but under mds and sds condition both of mad and h2o2 were increased when compared to those under nds fig 5 larger increases in mad and h2o2 were detected in ks21193 under mds and sds conditions at both stages of measurement to assess the antioxidant response of these genotypes pod apx sod and cat activities were determined at r5 and r7 stages in both drought conditions tested increases in these enzymatic activities were detected in two common bean genotypes but increase was more in genotype ks21486 in both stage of measurements fig 6 the two genotypes showed variability in term of lai the deficit irrigation reduced lai of both genotypes although the decrease was lower in genotype ks21486 under mds and sds conditions but finally genotype ks21193 had more lai in all irrigation treatments fig 7 the pari reduced under deficit irrigation conditions ks21193 showed 23 8 and 41 8 under mds and sds conditions respectively also the pari in ks21486 were reduced by 27 under mds condition and 26 1 under sds condition the pari were not equal in two genotypes under all irrigation conditions so that ks21493 had more pari than genotype ks21486 table 4 the genotypes showed diverse responses to deficit irrigation in terms of rue g mj 1 intercepted par under mds condition rue of both genotype increased by 30 8 in genotype ks21193 and 29 5 in genotype ks21486 rue but reduced under sds condition so that reduction was 43 8 in genotype ks21193 and 25 in genotype ks21486 also rue values in 2015 were significantly higher than those in 2014 table 4 significant differences in wue and wp kg m 3 were observed between 2014 and 2015 under mds conditions wue increased in both genotype 23 in ks21193 and 44 1 in ks21486 while wue of two genotypes reduced under sds conditions 51 6 in ks21193 and 7 5 in ks21486 under mds conditions the genotypes had no equal responses to deficit irrigation in term of wp so that wp of genotype ks21193 reduced by 58 8 and wp of ks21486 increased by 31 4 in this condition under sds condition but wp of two genotype reduced by 84 3 and 23 9 in ks21193 and ks21486 respectively fig 8 4 discussion in order to improve common bean under drought stress condition further understanding of the mechanisms underlying drought resistance is needed for this purpose it is relevant to identify physiological traits related to drought stress resistance that could assist in the identification of mechanisms underlying these adaptation processes and in the selection of resistant genotypes results showed that the seed yields in 2015 were higher than 2014 table 4 evaluation of weather data showed that during the growing season in 2014 and 2015 the numbers of days during which the temperature has been above 35 c were 21 and 7 respectively fig 1 indicating more suitable temperature conditions in 2015 which contributed to higher seed yield in this year also in 2015 rainfall occurred table 2 during the grain feeling period and relative humidity in this period was more than 2014 fig 1 so these providing more favorable conditions for common bean growth in 2015 during flowering pod formation and early pod filling period the radiation was lower than 2014 fig 1 in lower radiation photorespiration and oxidative stress is low and condition is more favorable to produce higher seed yield drought stress decreased seed yield of both genotypes reduction in bean seed yield due to drought have also been reported in many other pieces of research ter√°n and singh 2002 rosales serna et al 2004 evaluation of red and common bean genotype under drought stress condition showed reduced seed yield for both genotypes but the reductions were not the same in genotypes reductions in seed yield of common bean genotypes were reported to range within 34 76 munoz perea et al 2007 in this experiment seed yield loss in drought stress conditions was lower in genotype ks21486 this genotype used stress escape mechanism and reduced its life span under mds condition in this regard the higher decline was associated to r6 r9 stage flowering to maturity in fact the plant accelerates the developmental stage to escape the drought while in ks21193 genotype the growing period duration was less affected by water shortages in this genotype the highest decline in the growing period duration was occurred before flowering stage v3 r6 genotype ks21193 failed to shorten the reproductive growth period and escape the drought stress it was found that under both mds and sds conditions the genotype ks21486 had the highest seed yield stability our results showed that deficit irrigation decreased leaf greenness indeed the decrease in chlorophyll content under water stress is a commonly observed phenomenon din et al 2011 the plant water status in hot pepper capsicum annum l also was reduced under deficit irrigation dorji et al 2005 it has been established that under drought stress condition osmotic compound concentration increases and intra cellular space minimize to better absorb water from soil blum 2005 in this study genotype ks21486 which showed the lower seed yield reductions under mds and sds treatments also showed the lower rwc reductions under mds and sds conditions table 4 indicating the ability of these genotypes to maintain water balance under these stress conditions the water deficit treatments reduced sc of both genotypes mpelasoka et al 2001 also observed that stomatal conductance was less in deficit irrigation rather than control irrigation treatment the low sc induced by water deficit leads to a decreased co2 availability which has a direct adverse effect on photosynthesis chaves et al 2009 our results showed that before irrigation ks21486 had the higher sc under all of the irrigation treatments in fact compared to other genotype genotypes ks21486 could do more transpiration under water deficit conditions maybe due to more efficient root systems under nds condition ctd was higher than those under mds and sds conditions balota et al 2008 also showed that mean ctd varied from negative values i e the canopy was warmer than air in dryland to positive values under irrigation as they reported the drought sensitive line consistently had the smallest ctd i e warmest canopy during midday also in dryland tolerant line had the coolest canopy and the largest seed yield our results also indicated genotype ks21486 in all irrigation treatments had higher ctd one of the most important of damage caused by drought stress is lipid peroxidation mainly by h2o2 and mda results showed that under water deficit condition h2o2 and mda in both genotypes increased but increase in genotype ks21486 was lower indicated this genotype is more tolerant to lipid peroxidation as complementary mechanisms to cope with reactive oxygen species ros accumulation in response to water deficit plant cells recourse to ros scavenging enzymes such as sod cat and apx and cat and a wide array of non enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbic acid flavonoids and phenolic compounds blokhina et al 2003 our results showed that the increases in pod sod apx and cat contents resulted in decreased yield reduction in fact under drought stress conditions plants tend to protect themselves by increasing antioxidant production lai and pari of both genotypes reduced by deficit irrigation but reduction was higher in genotype ks21193 the reduced greenness and lai in genotype ks21486 than genotype ks21193 under deficit irrigation caused ks21486 intercepted less par levels hence prevent or minimize the oxidative stress and photorespiration while more greenness and lai as well as more pari in genotype ks21193 involved more seed yield loss under water deficit conditions in fact it can be stated that more chlorophyll lai and consequently more pari is not very ideal under water stress condition and causes increased damage to the plant in the present study the genotypes showed diverse responses to different deficit irrigation levels in terms of rue so that under mds condition rue increased while under sds conditions rue decreased but neither increase nor decrease were not equal in two genotypes different responses of the genotypes depended on the ratio of dry matter to pari in fact both the amount of par interception and dry matter production decreased under drought stress conditions if the dry matter loss dominates the pari the rue would be reduced araus et al 2002 reported that rue may be increased by improving the distribution of par among various leaves as well as enhancing the photosynthesis performance under stress conditions many researchers have reported decreases in rue under drought stress conditions i e peanut haro et al 2008 and rape seed hamzei and soltani 2012 under mds condition wue of two genotypes increased but under sds condition wue decreased in both genotypes munoz perea et al 2007 also reported that on average wue values were higher in drought stressed environment rather than an environment of no drought stress our results also indicates that the superior performance of ks21486 under mds condition is a result of better water productivity suggesting that ks21486 is able to overcome the limitation in co2 diffusion through stomata probably by a more efficient co2 mesophyll diffusion and an effective co2 fixation bota et al 2004 chaves et al 2009 5 conclusions finally it can be stated that genotype ks21193 produces more grain yield under nds condition and is more suitable for cultivation than genotype ks21486 under non drought stress conditions however genotype ks21486 showed better performance during the growing season and seed yield stability since it is able to escape drought stress and tolerate water deficit conditions and ultimatelyshows less seed yield loss

yield reductions across 60 of global bean production areas white et al 1991 about 90 of iran extends over arid and semi arid areas fao 2010 where drought stress represents an inevitable condition to be suffered by crops such as common bean drought is a major limiting factor for crop productivity worldwide jones and corlett 1992 so martinez et al 2007 that development of crops with increased tolerance to such stresses appears to be crucial for keeping yield in areas where dry seasons are common reduced water availability results in a complex set of responses including lower water potential of plant tissues which leads to a variety of modifications in different plant processes examples of these are growth inhibition stomatal closure reduced transpiration and photosynthetic rates and formation of radical scavenging compounds yordanov et al 2000 shao et al 2009 these responses depend on intensity of the stress the plant genotype and the plant developmental stage at stress incidence among other factors when it comes to drought resistance genotypic differences have been reported for common bean genotypes by ter√°n and singh 2002 who reported significantly lower seed yields for all common bean genotypes under drought stress conditions rather than non drought stress environment they showed that on average drought stress tended to reduce yield of common bean by 53 ter√°n and singh 2002 reported that drought stress decreased reproductive period in common bean reducing the number of days to maturity in contrary boutraa and sanders 2001 showed that water stress imposes no significant effect on time to maturity and time to flowering of common bean genotypes under water deficit conditions the reduction in water availability decreases leaf rwc and stomatal closure leading to a reduction of co2 availability and consequently lower photosynthesis rate an and wue bota et al 2004 high rwc values are indicative of a situation where tissues are able to take up and or hold more water than that taken by tissues with lower rwc rosales et al 2012 chlorophyll content of common bean is also reduced as a result of the degradation caused by drought conditions barrios and rodr√≠guez 1991 and is directly related to biomass accumulation a significant relationship among foliar greenness chlorophyll content and seed yield was previously detected in wheat triticum aestivum fischer 2001 water restriction can also affect stomatal conductance as rosales et al 2012 reported when plants were subjected to terminal drought a significant decrease occurred in the yield of common bean genotypes ctd is an appropriate index for determining the plant s water status and response to drought stress jackson et al 1981 blum et al 1982 idso 1982 it has been used in cultivar comparison for water use pinter et al 1990 and tolerance to drought blum et al 1989 royo et al 2002 furthermore high values of ctd is a criterion for improving drought stress tolerance

katsura et al 2007 2008 based on monteith s principles monteith and moss 1977 total aboveground dry matter tadm is defined as tadm ir fri rue where ir is the incident radiation and fri is the fraction of radiation intercepted by the crop canopy when water stress occurs the relationships among these factors change in such a way that results in reduced crop s ability to capture light williams and boote 1995 under water stress conditions the fraction of intercepted par and leaf area index are used to evaluate the effects of drought stress on crops collino et al 2001 the present study was aimed at determining effects of deficit irrigation on yield physiology and biochemistry of two bean genotypes 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions two common bean genotypes were

for the homogeneity of variances bartlett 1947 all data were analyzed utilizing a sas proc glm statistical package sas 9 4 and the differences between the means were compared by slicing of irrigation genotype interaction p 0 05 3 results the effect of irrigation regime on seed yield chlorophyll content rwc wue wp pari and rue were highly significant also the effect of genotype on seed yield rwc wp and pari were highly significant the leaf greenness and rue affected significantly by genotype in contrast genotype was found to have no effect on wue interaction of irrigation regime and genotype had significant effect on seed yield chlorophyll rwc wue wp pari and rue table 3 seed yield g m 2 in 2015 was more than that in 2014 table 4 genotype ks21193 had higher seed yield under nds condition whereas under mds and sds conditions genotypes ks21193 was more affected with 65 9 and 89 6 of reduction in seed yield respectively it was while in both mds and sds conditions the genotype ks21486 was less affected showing only 13 9 and 54 4 of reduction in seed yield respectively life cycle of genotype ks21486 in all irrigation regimes and both years was shorter than ks21193 fig 2 under mds condition fully ripe was reached in ks21193 by 0 8 and 5 1 earlier than that under nds conditions in 2014 and 2015 respectively similarly in ks21486 ripening was occurrence earlier by 9 6 and 9 in 2014 and 2015 respectively under sds condition genotype ks21486 don t show changes in life cycle whereas genotype ks21193 showed life cycle reduction by 0 7 in 2015 reduction in water use was associated with decreased chlorophyll content spad table 4 reduction were 23 2 under mds condition and 42 6 under sds condition there was no significant difference between two genotypes under nds and mds conditions in terms of chlorophyll content whereas genotype ks21193 had more chlorophyll content under sds condition deficit irrigation decreased rwc in both genotypes so that under mds and sds conditions ksa21486 genotype had lower reductions in rwc reduced irrigation water resulted in lower sc before each irrigation but after irrigation sc increased in both genotypes fig 3 under mds condition sc of ks21193 reduced averagely by 16 8 2014 and 29 2015 whereas in this condition sc of ks21486 was reduced by 1 7 and 13 5 in 2014 and 2015 respectively also under sds condition sc reduction in ks21193 was 43 5 2014 and 44 2015 and in ks21486 was 32 9 2014 and 37 2015 in all irrigation regimes average sc of ks21486 at before irrigation was more than ks21193 fig 3 deficit irrigation reduced ctd in both genotype but reduction was more in ks21193 under mds and sds conditions ctd of genotype ks21193 reduced averagely by 5 6 and 9 6 c respectively mean ctd reduction in genotype ks21486 were showed 5 5 c under mds and 9 1 c under sds conditions also ctd was low and high before and after each irrigation respectively in both genotypes under mds and sds conditions even after irrigation ctd was lower than that before irrigation under nds condition in overall ctd of genotype ks21486 were more than genotype ks21193 in all irrigation regimes fig 4 deficit irrigation increased malondialdehyde mda hydrogen peroxide h2o2 super oxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat contents but by different amounts in two genotypes also mda h2o2 sod pod apx and cat were more at r7 pod formation stage rather than r5 pre flowering stage under nds condition mda and h2o2 did not change at r5 and r7 stages but under mds and sds condition both of mad and h2o2 were increased when compared to those under nds fig 5 larger increases in mad and h2o2 were detected in ks21193 under mds and sds conditions at both stages of measurement to assess the antioxidant response of these genotypes pod apx sod and cat activities were determined at r5 and r7 stages in both drought conditions tested increases in these enzymatic activities were detected in two common bean genotypes but increase was more in genotype ks21486 in both stage of measurements fig 6 the two genotypes showed variability in term of lai the deficit irrigation reduced lai of both genotypes although the decrease was lower in genotype ks21486 under mds and sds conditions but finally genotype ks21193 had more lai in all irrigation treatments fig 7 the pari reduced under deficit irrigation conditions ks21193 showed 23 8 and 41 8 under mds and sds conditions respectively also the pari in ks21486 were reduced by 27 under mds condition and 26 1 under sds condition the pari were not equal in two genotypes under all irrigation conditions so that ks21493 had more pari than genotype ks21486 table 4 the genotypes showed diverse responses to deficit irrigation in terms of rue g mj 1 intercepted par under mds condition rue of both genotype increased by 30 8 in genotype ks21193 and 29 5 in genotype ks21486 rue but reduced under sds condition so that reduction was 43 8 in genotype ks21193 and 25 in genotype ks21486 also rue values in 2015 were significantly higher than those in 2014 table 4 significant differences in wue and wp kg m 3 were observed between 2014 and 2015 under mds conditions wue increased in both genotype 23 in ks21193 and 44 1 in ks21486 while wue of two genotypes reduced under sds conditions 51 6 in ks21193 and 7 5 in ks21486 under mds conditions the genotypes had no equal responses to deficit irrigation in term of wp so that wp of genotype ks21193 reduced by 58 8 and wp of ks21486 increased by 31 4 in this condition under sds condition but wp of two genotype reduced by 84 3 and 23 9 in ks21193 and ks21486 respectively fig 8 4 discussion in order to improve common bean under drought stress condition further understanding of the mechanisms underlying drought resistance is needed for this purpose it is relevant to identify physiological traits related to drought stress resistance that could assist in the identification of mechanisms underlying these adaptation processes and in the selection of resistant genotypes results showed that the seed yields in 2015 were higher than 2014 table 4 evaluation of weather data showed that during the growing season in 2014 and 2015 the numbers of days during which the temperature has been above 35 c were 21 and 7 respectively fig 1 indicating more suitable temperature conditions in 2015 which contributed to higher seed yield in this year also in 2015 rainfall occurred table 2 during the grain feeling period and relative humidity in this period was more than 2014 fig 1 so these providing more favorable conditions for common bean growth in 2015 during flowering pod formation and early pod filling period the radiation was lower than 2014 fig 1 in lower radiation photorespiration and oxidative stress is low and condition is more favorable to produce higher seed yield drought stress decreased seed yield of both genotypes reduction in bean seed yield due to drought have also been reported in many other pieces of research ter√°n and singh 2002 rosales serna et al 2004 evaluation of red and common bean genotype under drought stress condition showed reduced seed yield for both genotypes but the reductions were not the same in genotypes reductions in seed yield of common bean genotypes were reported to range within 34 76 munoz perea et al 2007 in this experiment seed yield loss in drought stress conditions was lower in genotype ks21486 this genotype used stress escape mechanism and reduced its life span under mds condition in this regard the higher decline was associated to r6 r9 stage flowering to maturity in fact the plant accelerates the developmental stage to escape the drought while in ks21193 genotype the growing period duration was less affected by water shortages in this genotype the highest decline in the growing period duration was occurred before flowering stage v3 r6 genotype ks21193 failed to shorten the reproductive growth period and escape the drought stress it was found that under both mds and sds conditions the genotype ks21486 had the highest seed yield stability our results showed that deficit irrigation decreased leaf greenness indeed the decrease in chlorophyll content under water stress is a commonly observed phenomenon din et al 2011 the plant water status in hot pepper capsicum annum l also was reduced under deficit irrigation dorji et al 2005 it has been established that under drought stress condition osmotic compound concentration increases and intra cellular space minimize to better absorb water from soil blum 2005 in this study genotype ks21486 which showed the lower seed yield reductions under mds and sds treatments also showed the lower rwc reductions under mds and sds conditions table 4 indicating the ability of these genotypes to maintain water balance under these stress conditions the water deficit treatments reduced sc of both genotypes mpelasoka et al 2001 also observed that stomatal conductance was less in deficit irrigation rather than control irrigation treatment the low sc induced by water deficit leads to a decreased co2 availability which has a direct adverse effect on photosynthesis chaves et al 2009 our results showed that before irrigation ks21486 had the higher sc under all of the irrigation treatments in fact compared to other genotype genotypes ks21486 could do more transpiration under water deficit conditions maybe due to more efficient root systems under nds condition ctd was higher than those under mds and sds conditions balota et al 2008 also showed that mean ctd varied from negative values i e the canopy was warmer than air in dryland to positive values under irrigation as they reported the drought sensitive line consistently had the smallest ctd i e warmest canopy during midday also in dryland tolerant line had the coolest canopy and the largest seed yield our results also indicated genotype ks21486 in all irrigation treatments had higher ctd one of the most important of damage caused by drought stress is lipid peroxidation mainly by h2o2 and mda results showed that under water deficit condition h2o2 and mda in both genotypes increased but increase in genotype ks21486 was lower indicated this genotype is more tolerant to lipid peroxidation as complementary mechanisms to cope with reactive oxygen species ros accumulation in response to water deficit plant cells recourse to ros scavenging enzymes such as sod cat and apx and cat and a wide array of non enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbic acid flavonoids and phenolic compounds blokhina et al 2003 our results showed that the increases in pod sod apx and cat contents resulted in decreased yield reduction in fact under drought stress conditions plants tend to protect themselves by increasing antioxidant production lai and pari of both genotypes reduced by deficit irrigation but reduction was higher in genotype ks21193 the reduced greenness and lai in genotype ks21486 than genotype ks21193 under deficit irrigation caused ks21486 intercepted less par levels hence prevent or minimize the oxidative stress and photorespiration while more greenness and lai as well as more pari in genotype ks21193 involved more seed yield loss under water deficit conditions in fact it can be stated that more chlorophyll lai and consequently more pari is not very ideal under water stress condition and causes increased damage to the plant in the present study the genotypes showed diverse responses to different deficit irrigation levels in terms of rue so that under mds condition rue increased while under sds conditions rue decreased but neither increase nor decrease were not equal in two genotypes different responses of the genotypes depended on the ratio of dry matter to pari in fact both the amount of par interception and dry matter production decreased under drought stress conditions if the dry matter loss dominates the pari the rue would be reduced araus et al 2002 reported that rue may be increased by improving the distribution of par among various leaves as well as enhancing the photosynthesis performance under stress conditions many researchers have reported decreases in rue under drought stress conditions i e peanut haro et al 2008 and rape seed hamzei and soltani 2012 under mds condition wue of two genotypes increased but under sds condition wue decreased in both genotypes munoz perea et al 2007 also reported that on average wue values were higher in drought stressed environment rather than an environment of no drought stress our results also indicates that the superior performance of ks21486 under mds condition is a result of better water productivity suggesting that ks21486 is able to overcome the limitation in co2 diffusion through stomata probably by a more efficient co2 mesophyll diffusion and an effective co2 fixation bota et al 2004 chaves et al 2009 5 conclusions finally it can be stated that genotype ks21193 produces more grain yield under nds condition and is more suitable for cultivation than genotype ks21486 under non drought stress conditions however genotype ks21486 showed better performance during the growing season and seed yield stability since it is able to escape drought stress and tolerate water deficit conditions and ultimatelyshows less seed yield loss 
11178,return flows in irrigation systems are often reused contributing to overall efficiency to investigate the fate of return flows and the scale effects of reuses the swat soil and water assessment tool model was modified to better represent the characteristics of paddy rice irrigation systems which includes a simulation module for automatic multi source irrigation amsim the modified swat model was used to simulate the hydrological processes in the yangshudang ysd watershed of the zhanghe irrigation system zis in china furthermore we proposed a method to calculate the amounts of return flows and the reused amount based on the output of the model the sub basins nesting method was used to divide the study area into six scales we calculated the rainfall irrigation water reuse rates Œ∑ i p and the irrigation water reuse rates Œ∑ i at different scales and analyzed the changes of these two indicators over different scales the results revealed that the modified swat model succeeded in simulating hydrological processes in a paddy rice irrigation system Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i increased with the increase of scale Œ∑ i p was higher in the wet years and lower in the dry years while Œ∑ i was higher in the dry years and lower in the wet years the reason for increase of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i as the scales increases were due to the fact that the return flows was repeatedly intercepted by downstream paddy fields farm ponds and drainage channels at larger scales this reuse rates however reach the upper limit at a scale of 3500 ha after which Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i no longer increase keywords automatic multi source irrigation rainfall irrigation water reuse rate irrigation water reuse rate paddy 1 introduction the return flows in irrigation systems refer to the amounts of water that leave the irrigated fields and enter drainage channels ponds or other water storages in the form of surface runoff deep percolation lateral seepage etc after rainfall or irrigation which can then be reused for irrigation further downstream the return flows and their reuse are common phenomena in irrigation systems cui et al 2007 simons et al 2015 in recent years some scholars have proposed water use evaluation indicators for irrigation systems with consideration to the reuse of the return flows keller and keller 1995 perry 1999 campadelli et al 2007 liu et al 2013 cui et al 2014 various scholars have used simulation models to calculate these indicators at different scales to analyze the relation between these indicators and spatial scales and the underlining causes from the return flows and their reuse droogers and kite 2001 xie and cui 2010 additionally various scholars have investigated the scale effects of water saving irrigation in irrigation systems and demonstrated that the real water saving irrigation depends on the return flows and their reuse dong et al 2005 cui et al 2007 quantifying the reuse of the return flows and analyzing its scale effect are of great significance to understanding hydrological processes in irrigation system and the necessary infrastructure and management interventions for real water saving irrigation many different methods were proposed to estimate the return flows for example zulu et al 1996 used experimental data and a tank model to estimate the return flows in paddy fields the method required extensive field trials to obtain necessary data which is difficult to carry out at large scale cui et al 2005 and zhang and cui 2005 used a system dynamics model to estimate the return flows at field and medium small catchment scales which was still difficult to roll out to a large scale system such as an irrigation system or river basin because of the increasing complex internal hydraulic relationships and spatial heterogeneity mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 constructed a hierarchical model through binary recursive partitioning to predict the irrigation return flows chien and fang 2012 divided the return flows into the surface return flows and underground return flows and constructed a water balance model to estimate them separately ha et al 2017 estimated the irrigation return flows and their reuse potential by means of water balance calculations on site measurements and surveys additionally some scholars have proposed other methods to estimate and analyze the return flows such as stable isotope ratios and chloride mass balance hydraulic model ssarr model and field experiments kattan 2008 dewandel et al 2010 kang and park 2014 poch masseg√∫ et al 2014 most of these studies only involved the estimation of the return flows and focused less on the quantification of the reused return flows and their scale effects to analyze the reuse of return flows and its scale effect firstly we need to acquire water consumption and water balance data at different scales a distributed hydrological model is an effective tool that can make the best use of limited data to simulate the water consumption and water balance components moreover this kind of models can identify the water balance components at different scales xie and cui 2010 the swat model is a physically based distributed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 which has been used to model a wide range of situations such as water circulation in irrigation systems ahmad et al 2002 gosain et al 2005 ahmadzadeh et al 2015 chen et al 2017 however the hydrologic cycle of the irrigation system is more complex and varied than that of natural basins as it is also heavily influenced by irrigation and drainage practices wang and cui 2011 therefore to better simulate water cycles in the irrigation systems xie and cui 2011 modified the swat model in terms of evapotranspiration et in paddy fields and irrigation and drainage practices dai et al 2016 modified the swat model in the modules of the irrigation water movement and water cycle in paddy fields based on the hydrological characteristics of the paddy fields in the hilly regions of southern china additionally other scholars have also modified the swat model kang et al 2006 luo et al 2008 dechmi et al 2012 sakaguchi et al 2014 chen et al 2018 however these improvements did not involve consideration of multi source irrigation process which involves drawing water from multiple sources such as irrigation canals drainage and farm ponds to irrigate the same hydrologic response unit hru multi source irrigation is typical in southern china where many medium and small storages are connected through canals and drainage networks locally known as melons on a vine multi source irrigation is one of the main approaches towards reusing the return flows in such type of paddy rice irrigation systems therefore the swat model needs to be modified for effective representation of the hydrologic cycle and water management practices of the multi source irrigation areas with paddy rice in this study we aim to improve the swat model based on the characteristics of the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and propose a method to calculate the reused return flows based on the simulation results with the modified swat model moreover we analyzed the changes of the reuse of return flows over different scales and the causes of that through an application in the yangshudang ysd watershed in the zhanghe irrigation system zis of the hubei province in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the ysd watershed in the zis of the hubei province in china it is a relatively closed area of approximately 43 3 km2 and is enclosed by the third main canal of the zis the first tributary canal of the third main canal and a small branch canal as shown in fig 1 the study area has a subtropical continental climate with an annual average temperature of 17 c maximum temperature of 40 9 c and an annual mean rainfall of 821 mm the main land includes paddy fields dry lands forests and grasslands in which the paddy fields account for approximately 60 and the soil type is predominantly yellow brown earth paddy soil the study area is mainly planted with crops such as rice cotton and rapeseed the rice is mainly middle rice which is the main irrigated crop with an intermittent irrigation mode 2 2 swat model improvement this study integrated the improvement of the previous paddy rice modules xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 and added an amsim based on the characteristics of the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china the structure of amsim is shown in fig 2 clarification information regarding fig 2 is provided below 1 in the amsim the irrigation and drainage of the paddy field are controlled by three controlling depths guo 1997 namely h max and h min which are the maximum fitting depth and the minimum fitting depth after irrigation respectively and h p which is the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall that is the irrigation is triggered when the water depth in the paddy field is less than h min the irrigation water requirement namely the net amount of the water that needs to be poured into the field is the difference between h max and the current water depth in the paddy field 2 the water sources and their sequence should be assigned for hrus before the model runs the assignment is based on the sub basin and irrigation sources and their sequence is consistent for the hrus in the same sub basin for the multi source irrigation systems in southern china the possible water sources in each sub basin are the internal river channels ponds small and medium sized reservoirs the external river channels and large reservoirs usually the first water source is set as the internal river channels of the sub basin and the second water source is the internal ponds of the sub basin they are specified on the swat software interface while the small and medium sized reservoirs external river channels and large reservoirs are specified with additional input files 3 the amount of available irrigation water from the water sources refers to the net amount of water in the hru which is converted from the maximum gross amount of water in the water sources with consideration to the irrigation efficiency different calculation methods are used for different types of water sources as follows for river channels 1a a k w t r 86400 q min Œ≤ Œ∑ 0 for reservoirs or ponds 1b a k v o l Œ≤ Œ∑ 0 for external water sources outside of the basin 1c a k m where a k is the amount of available irrigation water from the water source m3 k is the water source sequence w t r is the current amount of water in the river channel which is simulated daily in the model so it can be used directly when calculating the available water for a river channel m3 q min is the minimum base flow of the river channel which can be obtained from the survey but if there is a lack of relevant information it can be set as the model default value m3 s 1 Œ≤ is the fraction of available water allowed to be used for irrigation which is used to limit irrigation amounts from the pond if the pond needs to retain some water for aquaculture or ecological landscapes and it is obtained according to the experiences of farmers and managers or determined when calibrating the model Œ∑ 0 is the traditional irrigation efficiency which is the ratio between the net irrigation amount and the gross irrigation water consumption without considering the reuse of return flows guo 1997 we can obtain it from the management department of irrigation systems v o l is the current water storage for a reservoir or pond which is calculated daily in the model and can be obtained directly m3 and m is the irrigation water requirement m3 4 when beginning to irrigate the crop for the first water source select the minimum value between the amount of the available irrigation water from the water source a 1 and the current irrigation water requirement m if the available water amount is insufficient the irrigation water deficit w d 1 will be calculated as shown in fig 2 then use the next water source for supplementary irrigation until the irrigation requirements are met or until the last water source is reached the actual net irrigation amount of each water source is divided by the traditional irrigation efficiency to obtain the gross irrigation water consumption for this water source other improvements include the improvement in the calculation of the water balance components in the paddy fields the addition of real time irrigation modules of ponds and the addition of canal water leakage calculations for more details please refer to the cited literatures xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 2 3 model setup based on the digital elevation model dem data with a 25 m resolution we selected the ysd reservoir as the outlet and divided the study area into 10 sub basins as shown in fig 1 in fact the river channels generated in the ysd watershed were mainly drainage channels 105 hrus were obtained through further division based on land use types soil type distribution and slope the modified swat model was used to establish a hydrological model for the study area according to the meteorological data pond parameters and other data in which the irrigation and drainage of the hrus covered by paddy rice were controlled by three controlling depths in the intermittent irrigation mode h max h min h p at the same time according to the conditions in the study area the irrigation water sources and the sequence for the hrus covered by paddy rice in each sub basin were set as follows the internal river channels of the sub basin internal ponds and zhanghe reservoir moreover the Œ∑ 0 in the ysd watershed was 0 80 2 4 model calibration and validation setting 2003 to 2004 as a warm up period we used the ysd watershed outlet observed daily discharge series in the paddy rice growth period to calibrate 2005 to 2007 and validate 2008 to 2009 the discharge via swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 the observed daily discharge series were observed at a temporary hydrometric station fig 1 after calibrating and achieving an acceptable simulation for the daily discharge in the calibration period the same modeling environment was applied in the validation period additionally the observed daily et data sets in the paddy rice growth period from 2007 to 2008 were used to verify the simulated et in a typical hru the observed daily et came from the field trials conducted at the tuanlin experimental station in the study area the typical hru was in sub basin no 3 where the tuanlin experimental station was located fig 1 in addition we compared the simulated agricultural irrigation water consumptions aiwcs from local water sources river channels and ponds and zhanghe reservoir in 2005 to 2008 with measured values the measured aiwcs provided by the management bureau of zis three evaluation criteria are used to evaluate the efficiency of the improved swat model the first is the coefficient of determination r2 which ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher value representing less error variance typically values larger than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 the second is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nes nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fit the 1 1 line ranging between and 1 if the value is closer to 1 the simulation is more efficient the third is the relative error re which shows the average tendency of the simulated value to be larger or smaller than the observed value gupta et al 1999 2 5 calculation of the return flows and their reuse in the irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china the return flows originate mainly from rainfall and irrigation the available return flows are defined as the produced return flows that can be reused for irrigation which meets the irrigation water quality standard the reused return flows are defined as the produced return flows that are actually reused over a certain scale Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i are used to represent the reuse rate of return flows in which the following relationship holds 2 Œ∑ i p r f r p i where Œ∑ i p is the rainfall irrigation water reuse rate over a certain scale r f r is the reused rainfall irrigation return flows m3 the rainfall irrigation return flows refer to the return flow produced by the combination of the rainfall and irrigation p is the total rainfall over this scale m3 and i is the total gross irrigation water consumption over this scale m3 3 Œ∑ i i r f r i where Œ∑ i is the irrigation water reuse rate over a certain scale i r f r is the reused irrigation return flows m3 and they are irrelevant to rainfall when both rainfall and irrigation exist the irrigation return flows need to be separated from the total return flows see section 2 5 2 it can be concluded that Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i must be calculated by quantifying the reuse of different types of return flows based on the simulated output of the modified swat model we propose a calculation method for the return flows and their reuse 2 5 1 reused rainfall irrigation return flows the return flows and their reuse are related to the spatial scale the sub basins are used as the analysis objects to determine r f r which is divided into two parts namely the amounts flowing into ponds r f p r and that flowing into river channels r f r r for the irrigation system the river channels also include the drainage channels at all levels 1 rainfall irrigation return flows into the ponds after rainfall or irrigation there will be surface runoff and lateral flow some of them will be intercepted by ponds which will be the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the ponds r f p in a sub basin the modified swat model can simulate and output the surface runoff and lateral flow intercepted by the ponds in each hru by summing these outputs of each hru in a sub basin we can obtain r f p in this sub basin as follows 4 r f p p n d l o s s l p n d l o s s where p n d l o s s is the surface runoff intercepted by the ponds m3 and l p n d l o s s is the lateral flow intercepted by the ponds m3 r f p r must be determined in conjunction with the irrigation water intake from the ponds i p n d that is r f p r takes the minimum value of i p n d and r f p calculated by eq 4 2 rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels r f r refer to the surface runoff and lateral flow into the river channels and to the underground return flows caused by the deep seepage occurring after rainfall or irrigation similarly by summing the surface runoff the lateral flow and underground return flows into the river channels of each hru in a sub basin which are simulated by the modified swat model we can obtain r f r in the sub basin as follows 5 r f r q d a y l a t q g w q where q d a y is the surface runoff into the river channels m3 l a t q is the lateral flow into the river channels m3 and g w q is the underground return flows into the river channels m3 r f r r must be determined in conjunction with the irrigation water intake from the rivers i r c h that is r f r r takes the minimum value of i r c h and r f p calculated by eq 5 as the river channels establish connections between the upstream and downstream sub basins when the r f r r is less than r f r in the upstream sub basins some of the return flows into the river channels of the upstream sub basins will flow out and be used downstream therefore the r f r in the downstream sub basins are as follows 6 r f r d o w n 2 r f r d o w n 1 r f r u p r f r r u p where r f r d o w n 2 is the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels in the downstream sub basins m3 r f r d o w n 1 is the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels which is formed in the downstream sub basin m3 r f r u p and r f r r u p represent the available and reused rainfall irrigation return flows in the upstream sub basin respectively m3 the r f r r in the downstream sub basin also takes the minimum value of the r f r d o w n 2 calculated by eq 6 and the irrigation water intake from the river channels i r c h d o w n for the entire basin r f r r is calculated from the upstream to the downstream by eqs 5 and 6 3 the total amount of reused rainfall irrigation return flows part 1 and 2 are used to calculate r f p r and r f r r thus the total r f r at a certain scale is as follows 7 r f r r f p i r r f r i r where i is the sub basin number of the sub basin included in this scale r f p i r and r f r i r are the reused rainfall irrigation return flows into the ponds and river channels respectively in the sub basin numbered i m3 2 5 2 reused irrigation return flows i r f r is calculated in the same way as r f r described previously the difference lies in the need to calculate the available irrigation return flows i r f produced by the irrigation of the hrus in the sub basin to determine the i r f in the sub basin the main difficulty is differentiating the return flows produced by the irrigation and rainfall when the rainfall and irrigation occur simultaneously it is difficult to implement the conventional methods of measurement and calculation in which the water balance components need to be monitored at each irrigation and rainfall over the research scale therefore based on the simulation results of the modified swat model this paper presents a method to determine the available irrigation return flows of the hru when both rainfall and irrigation exist simultaneously and the water is divided into irrigation return flows into the ponds and river channels respectively 1 available irrigation return flows into the ponds the rain falls directly into the fields because the ridges of fields occupy a relatively small proportion in the paddy fields and can be neglected if the sum of the irrigation and rainfall exceeds h p there will be surface runoff which will be partially intercepted by ponds moreover the paddy fields will have lateral flow which will also be partially intercepted by ponds the water intercepted by ponds results from the net irrigation and rainfall therefore through weight allocation between the net irrigation and rainfall the available irrigation return flows into the ponds i r f p can be obtained as follows 8 i r f p a i r d p a i r d p n d l o s s l p n d l o s s where p is the rainfall in the fields on the day of irrigation m3 a i r d is the net irrigation water m3 2 available irrigation return flows into the river channels similarly the surface runoff lateral flow and underground return flows from the paddy fields into the river channels generated by irrigation must also be separated from that generated collectively by rainfall and irrigation the surface runoff and lateral flow are generated both by the net irrigation and rainfall therefore the irrigation return flows for both factors can be obtained by the weight allocation between the net irrigation and rainfall as the water loss in the canal system will replenish the underground water and become a part of the underground return flows the underground return flows should be calculated by weight allocation between the amount of water taken from the water source and the rainfall the available irrigation return flows into the river channels i r f r can be calculated as follows 9 i r f r a i r d p a i r d q d a y l a t q a i r d Œ∑ 0 p a i r d Œ∑ 0 g w q eqs 8 and 9 apply to the condition of simultaneous rainfall and irrigation if there is only irrigation i r f can be obtained by setting p 0 if there is only rainfall the return flow can be obtained by setting a i r d 0 3 return flows availability part 1 and 2 can calculate the i r f when the rainfall and irrigation occur simultaneously and the rest of return flows are rainfall return flows r r f and two indicators are introduced to represent the return flows availability as follows 10a Œ± i i r f i 10b Œ± p r r f p where Œ± i is the percentage of the i r f in the gross irrigation water consumption over a certain scale and Œ± p is the percentage of the r r f in the rainfall over a certain scale 2 6 scales division to study the scale effect of the return flows reuse we needed multiple scales of the study area based on the sub basins in the study area fig 1 the study area was divided by the sub basins set where we used the main river channel as the main line to nest the corresponding sub basins from the upstream to the downstream and thus obtained six scales for the study area the areas of scales gradually increased until covering the entire ysd watershed as shown in table 1 this approach considers the hydraulic connections between the upstream and downstream sub basins and may conform to the law that the return flows are used on a larger scale dong et al 2005 cui et al 2006 accordingly this approach will facilitate the analysis of the scale effect which is exerted by the reuse return flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 model and method evaluation results we used the observed values to calibrate and validate the daily discharges in outlet of the ysd watershed and verified daily et in a typical hru in addition we compared the simulated aiwcs from different sources with the measured values the evaluation criteria were shown in table 2 the detailed validation process is omitted due to article length the results revealed that the modified swat model succeed in simulating hydrological processes in a paddy rice irrigation system that is to say the modified swat model was applicable to the water balance analysis and further analysis of trends of return flow reuses at different scales for the ysd watershed of the zis in addition cai et al 2007 selected a region nearby the tuanlin experimental station fig 1 for water balance observation in 2006 and the Œ± i and Œ± p were calculated according to the observed data to 20 7 and 27 1 respectively to verify if the method described in section 2 5 2 is reasonable we used this method to calculate the Œ± i and Œ± p of the no 3 sub basin where the tuanlin experimental station is located in 2006 the values were 23 5 and 26 6 respectively which are close to the values calculated according to observations therefore the method described in section 2 5 2 can be used to differentiate the return flows produced by the irrigation and rainfall 3 2 changes of reused return flows over different scales we explored the scale effect of the return flows reuse through the changes of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i over different scales we ranked the rainfall from large to small during the paddy rice growth period in the study area from 1973 to 2010 and calculated the rainfall frequency furthermore we analyzed the scale effects in the three hydrological years which were the wet year of 2004 rainfall frequency is 10 normal year of 2002 rainfall frequency is 50 and dry year of 2010 rainfall frequency is 90 we used the modified swat model to simulate the hydrological processes in the study area during the three hydrological years and used the amsim to simulate the amount of irrigation water taken from the river channels ponds and zhanghe reservoir at different scales in different hydrological years according to the simulation results we obtained the changes of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i over different scales in different hydrological years fig 3 based on the calculation method of reused return flows and the definitions of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i which have been described above by examining fig 3 the following aspects can be seen 1 in the three hydrological years Œ∑ i p gradually increased as the scale increased the increased amplitude decreases with the increase of the scale after a certain scale was reached approximately 3500 ha it tended towards stability at the same scale Œ∑ i p decreased gradually as the degree of drought increased 2 as the scale increased the change rule of Œ∑ i was basically the same as that of Œ∑ i p and in the wet year Œ∑ i decreased slightly after reaching a certain scale approximately 3500 ha in the different hydrological years Œ∑ i increased gradually as the degree of drought increased at the same scale 3 by comparing fig 3 a to b it can be seen that on the same scale Œ∑ i was higher than Œ∑ i p in the dry years while Œ∑ i was lower than Œ∑ i p in the remaining hydrological years except for the first scale in normal year to further analyze the reasons we chose Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i at the scale of the ysd watershed and divided them into two parts respectively as the following equations 11a Œ∑ i p Œ∑ i p r c h Œ∑ i p p n d 11b Œ∑ i Œ∑ i r c h Œ∑ i p n d where Œ∑ i p r c h is the percentage of r f r r in the rainfall and gross irrigation water consumption and Œ∑ i p p n d is the percentage of r f p r in the rainfall and gross irrigation water consumption Œ∑ i r c h and Œ∑ i p n d are the percentages of the reused irrigation return flows into the river channels and ponds respectively in the gross irrigation water consumption fig 4 shows the comparison between Œ∑ i p r c h and Œ∑ i r c h as well as the comparison between Œ∑ i p p n d and Œ∑ i p n d at the ysd watershed scale in the different hydrological years from fig 4 in the three hydrological years Œ∑ i r c h was lower than Œ∑ i p r c h and Œ∑ i p n d was lower than Œ∑ i p p n d in other words r f r was mainly the return flows into the ponds while i r f r was mainly the return flows into the river channels the main reason was that the various types of land would have surface runoff and lateral flow during rainfall and some of them could be intercepted by ponds most of this part of the return flows into the ponds could be used in subsequent paddy field irrigation however there was generally no irrigation on rainy days the formed return flows into the river channels were basically drained and rarely used for irrigation in terms of irrigation the paddy field irrigation rarely exceeded the field ridge the surface runoff did not occur so that the generated return flows into ponds were little with regard to the irrigation return flows into the drainage channels the farmers generally intercepted them and used them in the downstream fields in the dry years because of less rainfall during the paddy rice growth period the inflow in the irrigation system was mainly irrigation therefore the return flows into the ponds in the irrigation system were relatively little and the reused return flows were mainly the irrigation return flows into the river channels hence Œ∑ i was higher than Œ∑ i p in the wet years the rainfall during the paddy rice growth period was relatively large and the inflow to the irrigation system was dominated by rainfall the reused return flows were mainly the rainfall return flows into the ponds so Œ∑ i was lower than Œ∑ i p in the normal years the situation was halfway between the two conditions 3 3 factors affecting irrigation water reuses over different scales the above results revealed that obvious change characteristics of Œ∑ i and Œ∑ i p occurred as the scale increased taking Œ∑ i as an example the reasons for the occurrence of the scale effect were analyzed through introducing an indicator as follows 12 œÜ i r f r i r f where œÜ is the percentage of the reused irrigation return flows in the available irrigation return flows by combining eqs 3 10a and 12 the following equation can be derived 13 Œ∑ i Œ± i œÜ to analyze the change of Œ± i and œÜ with different scales we took the dry year 2010 as an example as shown in fig 5 Œ± i does not change with scales because i r f is mainly related to engineering condition water management level crop type soil type and other factors in the irrigation systems as these factors are similar at different scales Œ± i is also similar at different scales as the scale increases œÜ gradually increases at a decreasing increment and tends to stability afterwards because when the scale is small and as the scale increases the farmers will intercept the water in the drainages at an increasing number of positions or guide it towards the ponds for accumulation which results in more reused irrigation return flows from the river channels and ponds in the downstream field so that the value of œÜ increases after the scale reaches a certain value approximately 3500 ha because of the proximity to the outlet of the study area the field in which the farmers continue to intercept the drainage to irrigate is less hence œÜ becomes stable since Œ± i does not change with scale the change of Œ∑ i with scale occurs because œÜ increases with scale and tends towards stability the change in Œ∑ i p with scale has the same cause as the change of Œ∑ i with scale in this study we carried out an analytical calculation of Œ∑ i using the calculation method for the return flows and their reuse based on the modified swat model by combining Œ∑ i with Œ∑ 0 we could calculate the new irrigation efficiency for the irrigation systems with consideration to the reuse of return flows cui et al 2014 the equation is as follows 14 e i Œ∑ 0 1 Œ∑ i where e i is the new irrigation efficiency with consideration to the reuse of the return flows the meaning of the remaining symbols is the same as that mentioned previously e i can truly reflect the water management levels in the irrigation systems in addition the modified swat model can be used to simulate hydrological processes in irrigation system under different water saving scenarios then Œ∑ i and e i can be calculated the results can guide the water saving transformation in irrigation system the higher e i is the better the corresponding water saving scenario is 4 conclusions we added an amsim to the modified swat model for multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and the modified swat model was used to simulate the water cycling processes in a small watershed in the zis the model was calibrated and validated using the measured daily discharges collected in the ysd watershed during the paddy rice growth period from 2005 to 2009 in addition the measured daily et during the paddy rice growth period from 2007 to 2008 and the measured aiwcs from different water sources from 2005 to 2008 were used to verify the model the results showed that the modified model could effectively simulate the water cycling processes of multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice based on the modified swat model a calculation procedure was also developed to estimate return flows and their reuse in paddy irrigation systems with multiple water sources and the observed irrigation and rainfall return flows near sub basin of tuanlin experimental station in 2006 was used to verify this method the results showed that this method could effectively distinguish and quantitatively express the amount of irrigation and rainfall return flows in multi source irrigation systems in addition the analysis of the reuse of return flows in the ysd watershed and its scale effect revealed that Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i gradually increased as the scale increased and the increased amplitude decreases with the increase of the scale after reaching a certain scale approximately 3500 ha they tended towards stability Œ∑ i p was higher in the wet years and lower in the dry years while Œ∑ i was higher in the dry years and lower in the wet years the reason for the changes in Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i over different scales was that the return flows intercepted by the ponds and drainage channels were reused more and more with the increase of scale but they tended towards stability after a certain scale approximately 3500 ha acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc 51579184 we are grateful to the editor and the

11178,return flows in irrigation systems are often reused contributing to overall efficiency to investigate the fate of return flows and the scale effects of reuses the swat soil and water assessment tool model was modified to better represent the characteristics of paddy rice irrigation systems which includes a simulation module for automatic multi source irrigation amsim the modified swat model was used to simulate the hydrological processes in the yangshudang ysd watershed of the zhanghe irrigation system zis in china furthermore we proposed a method to calculate the amounts of return flows and the reused amount based on the output of the model the sub basins nesting method was used to divide the study area into six scales we calculated the rainfall irrigation water reuse rates Œ∑ i p and the irrigation water reuse rates Œ∑ i at different scales and analyzed the changes of these two indicators over different scales the results revealed that the modified swat model succeeded in simulating hydrological processes in a paddy rice irrigation system Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i increased with the increase of scale Œ∑ i p was higher in the wet years and lower in the dry years while Œ∑ i was higher in the dry years and lower in the wet years the reason for increase of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i as the scales increases were due to the fact that the return flows was repeatedly intercepted by downstream paddy fields farm ponds and drainage channels at larger scales this reuse rates however reach the upper limit at a scale of 3500 ha after which Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i no longer increase keywords automatic multi source irrigation rainfall irrigation water reuse rate irrigation water reuse rate paddy 1 introduction the return flows in irrigation systems refer to the amounts of water that leave the irrigated fields and enter drainage channels ponds or other water storages in the form of surface runoff deep percolation lateral seepage etc after rainfall or irrigation which can then be reused for irrigation further downstream the return flows and their reuse are common phenomena in irrigation systems cui et al 2007 simons et al 2015 in recent years some scholars have proposed water use evaluation indicators for irrigation systems with consideration to the reuse of the return flows keller and keller 1995 perry 1999 campadelli et al 2007 liu et al 2013 cui et al 2014 various scholars have used simulation models to calculate these indicators at different scales to analyze the relation between these indicators and spatial scales and the underlining causes from the return flows and their reuse droogers and kite 2001 xie and cui 2010 additionally various scholars have investigated the scale effects of water saving irrigation in irrigation systems and demonstrated that the real

balance components moreover this kind of models can identify the water balance components at different scales xie and cui 2010 the swat model is a physically based distributed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 which has been used to model a wide range of situations such as water circulation in irrigation systems ahmad et al 2002 gosain et al 2005 ahmadzadeh et al 2015 chen et al 2017 however the hydrologic cycle of the irrigation system is more complex and varied than that of natural basins as it is also heavily influenced by irrigation and drainage practices wang and cui 2011 therefore to better simulate water cycles in the irrigation systems xie and cui 2011 modified the swat model in terms of evapotranspiration et in paddy fields and irrigation and drainage practices dai et al 2016 modified the swat model in the modules of the irrigation water movement and water cycle in paddy fields based on the hydrological characteristics of the paddy fields in the hilly regions of southern china additionally other scholars have also modified the swat model kang et al 2006 luo et al 2008 dechmi et al 2012 sakaguchi et al 2014 chen et al 2018 however these improvements did not involve consideration of multi source irrigation process which involves drawing water from multiple sources such as irrigation canals drainage and farm ponds to irrigate the same hydrologic response unit hru multi source irrigation is typical in southern china where many medium and small storages are connected through canals and drainage networks locally known as melons on a vine multi source irrigation is one of the main approaches towards reusing the return flows in such type of paddy rice irrigation systems therefore the swat model needs to be modified for effective representation of the hydrologic cycle and water management practices of the multi source irrigation areas with paddy rice in this study we aim to improve the swat model based on the characteristics of the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and propose a method to calculate the reused return flows based on the simulation results with the modified swat model moreover we analyzed the changes of the reuse of return flows over different scales and the causes of that through an application in the yangshudang ysd watershed in the zhanghe irrigation system zis of the hubei province in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the ysd watershed in the zis of the hubei province in china it is a relatively closed area of approximately 43 3 km2 and is enclosed by the third main canal of the zis the first tributary canal of the third main canal and a small branch canal as shown in fig 1 the study area has a subtropical continental climate with an annual average temperature of 17 c maximum temperature of 40 9 c and an annual mean rainfall of 821 mm the main land includes paddy fields dry lands forests and grasslands in which the paddy fields account for approximately 60 and the soil type is predominantly yellow brown earth paddy soil the study area is mainly planted with crops such as rice cotton and rapeseed the rice is mainly middle rice which is the main irrigated crop with an intermittent irrigation mode 2 2 swat model improvement this study integrated the improvement of the previous paddy rice modules xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 and added an amsim based on the characteristics of the multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china the structure of amsim is shown in fig 2 clarification information regarding fig 2 is provided below 1 in the amsim the irrigation and drainage of the paddy field are controlled by three controlling depths guo 1997 namely h max and h min which are the maximum fitting depth and the minimum fitting depth after irrigation respectively and h p which is the maximum allowable depth of impoundment after rainfall that is the irrigation is triggered when the water depth in the paddy field is less than h min the irrigation water requirement namely the net amount of the water that needs to be poured into the field is the difference between h max and the current water depth in the paddy field 2 the water sources and their sequence should be assigned for hrus before the model runs the assignment is based on the sub basin and irrigation sources and their sequence is consistent for the hrus in the same sub basin for the multi source irrigation systems in southern china the possible water sources in each sub basin are the internal river channels ponds small and medium sized reservoirs the external river channels and large reservoirs usually the first water source is set as the internal river channels of the sub basin and the second water source is the internal ponds of the sub basin they are specified on the swat software interface while the small and medium sized reservoirs external river channels and large reservoirs are specified with additional input files 3 the amount of available irrigation water from the water sources refers to the net amount of water in the hru which is converted from the maximum gross amount of water in the water sources with consideration to the irrigation efficiency different calculation methods are used for different types of water sources as follows for river channels 1a a k w t r 86400 q min Œ≤ Œ∑ 0 for reservoirs or ponds 1b a k v o l Œ≤ Œ∑ 0 for external water sources outside of the basin 1c a k m where a k is the amount of available irrigation water from the water source m3 k is the water source sequence w t r is the current amount of water in the river channel which is simulated daily in the model so it can be used directly when calculating the available water for a river channel m3 q min is the minimum base flow of the river channel which can be obtained from the survey but if there is a lack of relevant information it can be set as the model default value m3 s 1 Œ≤ is the fraction of available water allowed to be used for irrigation which is used to limit irrigation amounts from the pond if the pond needs to retain some water for aquaculture or ecological landscapes and it is obtained according to the experiences of farmers and managers or determined when calibrating the model Œ∑ 0 is the traditional irrigation efficiency which is the ratio between the net irrigation amount and the gross irrigation water consumption without considering the reuse of return flows guo 1997 we can obtain it from the management department of irrigation systems v o l is the current water storage for a reservoir or pond which is calculated daily in the model and can be obtained directly m3 and m is the irrigation water requirement m3 4 when beginning to irrigate the crop for the first water source select the minimum value between the amount of the available irrigation water from the water source a 1 and the current irrigation water requirement m if the available water amount is insufficient the irrigation water deficit w d 1 will be calculated as shown in fig 2 then use the next water source for supplementary irrigation until the irrigation requirements are met or until the last water source is reached the actual net irrigation amount of each water source is divided by the traditional irrigation efficiency to obtain the gross irrigation water consumption for this water source other improvements include the improvement in the calculation of the water balance components in the paddy fields the addition of real time irrigation modules of ponds and the addition of canal water leakage calculations for more details please refer to the cited literatures xie and cui 2011 dai et al 2016 2 3 model setup based on the digital elevation model dem data with a 25 m resolution we selected the ysd reservoir as the outlet and divided the study area into 10 sub basins as shown in fig 1 in fact the river channels generated in the ysd watershed were mainly drainage channels 105 hrus were obtained through further division based on land use types soil type distribution and slope the modified swat model was used to establish a hydrological model for the study area according to the meteorological data pond parameters and other data in which the irrigation and drainage of the hrus covered by paddy rice were controlled by three controlling depths in the intermittent irrigation mode h max h min h p at the same time according to the conditions in the study area the irrigation water sources and the sequence for the hrus covered by paddy rice in each sub basin were set as follows the internal river channels of the sub basin internal ponds and zhanghe reservoir moreover the Œ∑ 0 in the ysd watershed was 0 80 2 4 model calibration and validation setting 2003 to 2004 as a warm up period we used the ysd watershed outlet observed daily discharge series in the paddy rice growth period to calibrate 2005 to 2007 and validate 2008 to 2009 the discharge via swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 the observed daily discharge series were observed at a temporary hydrometric station fig 1 after calibrating and achieving an acceptable simulation for the daily discharge in the calibration period the same modeling environment was applied in the validation period additionally the observed daily et data sets in the paddy rice growth period from 2007 to 2008 were used to verify the simulated et in a typical hru the observed daily et came from the field trials conducted at the tuanlin experimental station in the study area the typical hru was in sub basin no 3 where the tuanlin experimental station was located fig 1 in addition we compared the simulated agricultural irrigation water consumptions aiwcs from local water sources river channels and ponds and zhanghe reservoir in 2005 to 2008 with measured values the measured aiwcs provided by the management bureau of zis three evaluation criteria are used to evaluate the efficiency of the improved swat model the first is the coefficient of determination r2 which ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher value representing less error variance typically values larger than 0 5 are considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 the second is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nes nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fit the 1 1 line ranging between and 1 if the value is closer to 1 the simulation is more efficient the third is the relative error re which shows the average tendency of the simulated value to be larger or smaller than the observed value gupta et al 1999 2 5 calculation of the return flows and their reuse in the irrigation systems with paddy rice in southern china the return flows originate mainly from rainfall and irrigation the available return flows are defined as the produced return flows that can be reused for irrigation which meets the irrigation water quality standard the reused return flows are defined as the produced return flows that are actually reused over a certain scale Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i are used to represent the reuse rate of return flows in which the following relationship holds 2 Œ∑ i p r f r p i where Œ∑ i p is the rainfall irrigation water reuse rate over a certain scale r f r is the reused rainfall irrigation return flows m3 the rainfall irrigation return flows refer to the return flow produced by the combination of the rainfall and irrigation p is the total rainfall over this scale m3 and i is the total gross irrigation water consumption over this scale m3 3 Œ∑ i i r f r i where Œ∑ i is the irrigation water reuse rate over a certain scale i r f r is the reused irrigation return flows m3 and they are irrelevant to rainfall when both rainfall and irrigation exist the irrigation return flows need to be separated from the total return flows see section 2 5 2 it can be concluded that Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i must be calculated by quantifying the reuse of different types of return flows based on the simulated output of the modified swat model we propose a calculation method for the return flows and their reuse 2 5 1 reused rainfall irrigation return flows the return flows and their reuse are related to the spatial scale the sub basins are used as the analysis objects to determine r f r which is divided into two parts namely the amounts flowing into ponds r f p r and that flowing into river channels r f r r for the irrigation system the river channels also include the drainage channels at all levels 1 rainfall irrigation return flows into the ponds after rainfall or irrigation there will be surface runoff and lateral flow some of them will be intercepted by ponds which will be the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the ponds r f p in a sub basin the modified swat model can simulate and output the surface runoff and lateral flow intercepted by the ponds in each hru by summing these outputs of each hru in a sub basin we can obtain r f p in this sub basin as follows 4 r f p p n d l o s s l p n d l o s s where p n d l o s s is the surface runoff intercepted by the ponds m3 and l p n d l o s s is the lateral flow intercepted by the ponds m3 r f p r must be determined in conjunction with the irrigation water intake from the ponds i p n d that is r f p r takes the minimum value of i p n d and r f p calculated by eq 4 2 rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels r f r refer to the surface runoff and lateral flow into the river channels and to the underground return flows caused by the deep seepage occurring after rainfall or irrigation similarly by summing the surface runoff the lateral flow and underground return flows into the river channels of each hru in a sub basin which are simulated by the modified swat model we can obtain r f r in the sub basin as follows 5 r f r q d a y l a t q g w q where q d a y is the surface runoff into the river channels m3 l a t q is the lateral flow into the river channels m3 and g w q is the underground return flows into the river channels m3 r f r r must be determined in conjunction with the irrigation water intake from the rivers i r c h that is r f r r takes the minimum value of i r c h and r f p calculated by eq 5 as the river channels establish connections between the upstream and downstream sub basins when the r f r r is less than r f r in the upstream sub basins some of the return flows into the river channels of the upstream sub basins will flow out and be used downstream therefore the r f r in the downstream sub basins are as follows 6 r f r d o w n 2 r f r d o w n 1 r f r u p r f r r u p where r f r d o w n 2 is the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels in the downstream sub basins m3 r f r d o w n 1 is the available rainfall irrigation return flows into the river channels which is formed in the downstream sub basin m3 r f r u p and r f r r u p represent the available and reused rainfall irrigation return flows in the upstream sub basin respectively m3 the r f r r in the downstream sub basin also takes the minimum value of the r f r d o w n 2 calculated by eq 6 and the irrigation water intake from the river channels i r c h d o w n for the entire basin r f r r is calculated from the upstream to the downstream by eqs 5 and 6 3 the total amount of reused rainfall irrigation return flows part 1 and 2 are used to calculate r f p r and r f r r thus the total r f r at a certain scale is as follows 7 r f r r f p i r r f r i r where i is the sub basin number of the sub basin included in this scale r f p i r and r f r i r are the reused rainfall irrigation return flows into the ponds and river channels respectively in the sub basin numbered i m3 2 5 2 reused irrigation return flows i r f r is calculated in the same way as r f r described previously the difference lies in the need to calculate the available irrigation return flows i r f produced by the irrigation of the hrus in the sub basin to determine the i r f in the sub basin the main difficulty is differentiating the return flows produced by the irrigation and rainfall when the rainfall and irrigation occur simultaneously it is difficult to implement the conventional methods of measurement and calculation in which the water balance components need to be monitored at each irrigation and rainfall over the research scale therefore based on the simulation results of the modified swat model this paper presents a method to determine the available irrigation return flows of the hru when both rainfall and irrigation exist simultaneously and the water is divided into irrigation return flows into the ponds and river channels respectively 1 available irrigation return flows into the ponds the rain falls directly into the fields because the ridges of fields occupy a relatively small proportion in the paddy fields and can be neglected if the sum of the irrigation and rainfall exceeds h p there will be surface runoff which will be partially intercepted by ponds moreover the paddy fields will have lateral flow which will also be partially intercepted by ponds the water intercepted by ponds results from the net irrigation and rainfall therefore through weight allocation between the net irrigation and rainfall the available irrigation return flows into the ponds i r f p can be obtained as follows 8 i r f p a i r d p a i r d p n d l o s s l p n d l o s s where p is the rainfall in the fields on the day of irrigation m3 a i r d is the net irrigation water m3 2 available irrigation return flows into the river channels similarly the surface runoff lateral flow and underground return flows from the paddy fields into the river channels generated by irrigation must also be separated from that generated collectively by rainfall and irrigation the surface runoff and lateral flow are generated both by the net irrigation and rainfall therefore the irrigation return flows for both factors can be obtained by the weight allocation between the net irrigation and rainfall as the water loss in the canal system will replenish the underground water and become a part of the underground return flows the underground return flows should be calculated by weight allocation between the amount of water taken from the water source and the rainfall the available irrigation return flows into the river channels i r f r can be calculated as follows 9 i r f r a i r d p a i r d q d a y l a t q a i r d Œ∑ 0 p a i r d Œ∑ 0 g w q eqs 8 and 9 apply to the condition of simultaneous rainfall and irrigation if there is only irrigation i r f can be obtained by setting p 0 if there is only rainfall the return flow can be obtained by setting a i r d 0 3 return flows availability part 1 and 2 can calculate the i r f when the rainfall and irrigation occur simultaneously and the rest of return flows are rainfall return flows r r f and two indicators are introduced to represent the return flows availability as follows 10a Œ± i i r f i 10b Œ± p r r f p where Œ± i is the percentage of the i r f in the gross irrigation water consumption over a certain scale and Œ± p is the percentage of the r r f in the rainfall over a certain scale 2 6 scales division to study the scale effect of the return flows reuse we needed multiple scales of the study area based on the sub basins in the study area fig 1 the study area was divided by the sub basins set where we used the main river channel as the main line to nest the corresponding sub basins from the upstream to the downstream and thus obtained six scales for the study area the areas of scales gradually increased until covering the entire ysd watershed as shown in table 1 this approach considers the hydraulic connections between the upstream and downstream sub basins and may conform to the law that the return flows are used on a larger scale dong et al 2005 cui et al 2006 accordingly this approach will facilitate the analysis of the scale effect which is exerted by the reuse return flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 model and method evaluation results we used the observed values to calibrate and validate the daily discharges in outlet of the ysd watershed and verified daily et in a typical hru in addition we compared the simulated aiwcs from different sources with the measured values the evaluation criteria were shown in table 2 the detailed validation process is omitted due to article length the results revealed that the modified swat model succeed in simulating hydrological processes in a paddy rice irrigation system that is to say the modified swat model was applicable to the water balance analysis and further analysis of trends of return flow reuses at different scales for the ysd watershed of the zis in addition cai et al 2007 selected a region nearby the tuanlin experimental station fig 1 for water balance observation in 2006 and the Œ± i and Œ± p were calculated according to the observed data to 20 7 and 27 1 respectively to verify if the method described in section 2 5 2 is reasonable we used this method to calculate the Œ± i and Œ± p of the no 3 sub basin where the tuanlin experimental station is located in 2006 the values were 23 5 and 26 6 respectively which are close to the values calculated according to observations therefore the method described in section 2 5 2 can be used to differentiate the return flows produced by the irrigation and rainfall 3 2 changes of reused return flows over different scales we explored the scale effect of the return flows reuse through the changes of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i over different scales we ranked the rainfall from large to small during the paddy rice growth period in the study area from 1973 to 2010 and calculated the rainfall frequency furthermore we analyzed the scale effects in the three hydrological years which were the wet year of 2004 rainfall frequency is 10 normal year of 2002 rainfall frequency is 50 and dry year of 2010 rainfall frequency is 90 we used the modified swat model to simulate the hydrological processes in the study area during the three hydrological years and used the amsim to simulate the amount of irrigation water taken from the river channels ponds and zhanghe reservoir at different scales in different hydrological years according to the simulation results we obtained the changes of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i over different scales in different hydrological years fig 3 based on the calculation method of reused return flows and the definitions of Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i which have been described above by examining fig 3 the following aspects can be seen 1 in the three hydrological years Œ∑ i p gradually increased as the scale increased the increased amplitude decreases with the increase of the scale after a certain scale was reached approximately 3500 ha it tended towards stability at the same scale Œ∑ i p decreased gradually as the degree of drought increased 2 as the scale increased the change rule of Œ∑ i was basically the same as that of Œ∑ i p and in the wet year Œ∑ i decreased slightly after reaching a certain scale approximately 3500 ha in the different hydrological years Œ∑ i increased gradually as the degree of drought increased at the same scale 3 by comparing fig 3 a to b it can be seen that on the same scale Œ∑ i was higher than Œ∑ i p in the dry years while Œ∑ i was lower than Œ∑ i p in the remaining hydrological years except for the first scale in normal year to further analyze the reasons we chose Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i at the scale of the ysd watershed and divided them into two parts respectively as the following equations 11a Œ∑ i p Œ∑ i p r c h Œ∑ i p p n d 11b Œ∑ i Œ∑ i r c h Œ∑ i p n d where Œ∑ i p r c h is the percentage of r f r r in the rainfall and gross irrigation water consumption and Œ∑ i p p n d is the percentage of r f p r in the rainfall and gross irrigation water consumption Œ∑ i r c h and Œ∑ i p n d are the percentages of the reused irrigation return flows into the river channels and ponds respectively in the gross irrigation water consumption fig 4 shows the comparison between Œ∑ i p r c h and Œ∑ i r c h as well as the comparison between Œ∑ i p p n d and Œ∑ i p n d at the ysd watershed scale in the different hydrological years from fig 4 in the three hydrological years Œ∑ i r c h was lower than Œ∑ i p r c h and Œ∑ i p n d was lower than Œ∑ i p p n d in other words r f r was mainly the return flows into the ponds while i r f r was mainly the return flows into the river channels the main reason was that the various types of land would have surface runoff and lateral flow during rainfall and some of them could be intercepted by ponds most of this part of the return flows into the ponds could be used in subsequent paddy field irrigation however there was generally no irrigation on rainy days the formed return flows into the river channels were basically drained and rarely used for irrigation in terms of irrigation the paddy field irrigation rarely exceeded the field ridge the surface runoff did not occur so that the generated return flows into ponds were little with regard to the irrigation return flows into the drainage channels the farmers generally intercepted them and used them in the downstream fields in the dry years because of less rainfall during the paddy rice growth period the inflow in the irrigation system was mainly irrigation therefore the return flows into the ponds in the irrigation system were relatively little and the reused return flows were mainly the irrigation return flows into the river channels hence Œ∑ i was higher than Œ∑ i p in the wet years the rainfall during the paddy rice growth period was relatively large and the inflow to the irrigation system was dominated by rainfall the reused return flows were mainly the rainfall return flows into the ponds so Œ∑ i was lower than Œ∑ i p in the normal years the situation was halfway between the two conditions 3 3 factors affecting irrigation water reuses over different scales the above results revealed that obvious change characteristics of Œ∑ i and Œ∑ i p occurred as the scale increased taking Œ∑ i as an example the reasons for the occurrence of the scale effect were analyzed through introducing an indicator as follows 12 œÜ i r f r i r f where œÜ is the percentage of the reused irrigation return flows in the available irrigation return flows by combining eqs 3 10a and 12 the following equation can be derived 13 Œ∑ i Œ± i œÜ to analyze the change of Œ± i and œÜ with different scales we took the dry year 2010 as an example as shown in fig 5 Œ± i does not change with scales because i r f is mainly related to engineering condition water management level crop type soil type and other factors in the irrigation systems as these factors are similar at different scales Œ± i is also similar at different scales as the scale increases œÜ gradually increases at a decreasing increment and tends to stability afterwards because when the scale is small and as the scale increases the farmers will intercept the water in the drainages at an increasing number of positions or guide it towards the ponds for accumulation which results in more reused irrigation return flows from the river channels and ponds in the downstream field so that the value of œÜ increases after the scale reaches a certain value approximately 3500 ha because of the proximity to the outlet of the study area the field in which the farmers continue to intercept the drainage to irrigate is less hence œÜ becomes stable since Œ± i does not change with scale the change of Œ∑ i with scale occurs because œÜ increases with scale and tends towards stability the change in Œ∑ i p with scale has the same cause as the change of Œ∑ i with scale in this study we carried out an analytical calculation of Œ∑ i using the calculation method for the return flows and their reuse based on the modified swat model by combining Œ∑ i with Œ∑ 0 we could calculate the new irrigation efficiency for the irrigation systems with consideration to the reuse of return flows cui et al 2014 the equation is as follows 14 e i Œ∑ 0 1 Œ∑ i where e i is the new irrigation efficiency with consideration to the reuse of the return flows the meaning of the remaining symbols is the same as that mentioned previously e i can truly reflect the water management levels in the irrigation systems in addition the modified swat model can be used to simulate hydrological processes in irrigation system under different water saving scenarios then Œ∑ i and e i can be calculated the results can guide the water saving transformation in irrigation system the higher e i is the better the corresponding water saving scenario is 4 conclusions we added an amsim to the modified swat model for multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice and the modified swat model was used to simulate the water cycling processes in a small watershed in the zis the model was calibrated and validated using the measured daily discharges collected in the ysd watershed during the paddy rice growth period from 2005 to 2009 in addition the measured daily et during the paddy rice growth period from 2007 to 2008 and the measured aiwcs from different water sources from 2005 to 2008 were used to verify the model the results showed that the modified model could effectively simulate the water cycling processes of multi source irrigation systems with paddy rice based on the modified swat model a calculation procedure was also developed to estimate return flows and their reuse in paddy irrigation systems with multiple water sources and the observed irrigation and rainfall return flows near sub basin of tuanlin experimental station in 2006 was used to verify this method the results showed that this method could effectively distinguish and quantitatively express the amount of irrigation and rainfall return flows in multi source irrigation systems in addition the analysis of the reuse of return flows in the ysd watershed and its scale effect revealed that Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i gradually increased as the scale increased and the increased amplitude decreases with the increase of the scale after reaching a certain scale approximately 3500 ha they tended towards stability Œ∑ i p was higher in the wet years and lower in the dry years while Œ∑ i was higher in the dry years and lower in the wet years the reason for the changes in Œ∑ i p and Œ∑ i over different scales was that the return flows intercepted by the ponds and drainage channels were reused more and more with the increase of scale but they tended towards stability after a certain scale approximately 3500 ha acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc 51579184 we are grateful to the editor and the

11179,various crop growth models have been developed to simulate the crop development and were used to assess the effects of climate cultivation and irrigation methods to evaluate the feasibility of water driven model aquacrop in simulating crop development production and field water balance in paddy soil under drying wetting cycle condition the model was calibrated and validated based on data

rice has the second largest area of rice cultivation contributing to 18 8 of the world rice area and 28 1 of the global rice yields faostat 2014 traditionally rice paddy is submerged and maintains a water depth in most of the growth season which leads to large deep percolation and less efficient water consumption meanwhile china is one of the 13 water shortage countries improving the irrigation water use efficiency in rice production is an important issue especially in the circumstance of increasing water scarcity due to climate change to realize efficient utilization of water in rice production the information of rice evapotranspiration under different irrigation management practices is vital important generally crop evapotranspiration varied along with crop growth which is a complicated process influenced by climate soil texture ecological environment genetic and physiology traits and cultivation practice fleischer et al 2015 rivas and caselles 2004 other than field experiment crop model is also an important tool for understanding the crop response to field managements and climate conditions and offers a useful tool for irrigation scheduling gu et al 2017 maniruzzaman et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2017 a few crop models have been developed with dassat apsim ceres rice cropsyst oryza2000 and aquacrop as the well known models linker and ioslovich 2017 ojeda et al 2018 singh et al 2017 umair et al 2017 those crop models can be categorized into three groups namely radiation driven models carbon driven models and water driven models steduto 2003 aquacrop is a water driven model developed by fao which mainly focus on the available water in the root zone raes et al 2009 raes et al 2015 steduto et al 2009 compared with other models aquacrop only needs a few variables and input parameters which are easily available and it achieves a great balance between output accuracy simplicity and robustness steduto et al 2009 moreover it has been used to simulate crop growth biomass production and yield in a number of crops around the world such as potato razzaghi et al 2017 maize greaves and wang 2016 pea paredes and torres 2017 wheat iqbal et al 2014 for rice which might be cultivated under various water management practices aquacrop model was also used under flooding condition aquacrop performed well in simulating rice development biomass and yield lin et al 2012 saadati et al 2011 when it was under water stress or drying wetting cycles condition aquacrop performed well in simulating rice crop development and production amiri 2016 amiri et al 2015 maniruzzaman et al 2015 whereas few researches evaluated the ability of this model in simulating the water balance in rice paddies under drying wetting cycle condition maniruzzaman et al 2015 reported the seasonal values of evaporation transpiration and percolation other than crop growth in a drying wetting cycled paddy but failed to simulate the daily water balance process lin et al 2012 showed the results of soil moisture during drying period in rice field but failed to show more detailed information including flooding water depths after wetting events and daily evapotranspiration to our knowledge there are no results investigated the performance of aquacrop in simulating daily field water balance or process in detail meanwhile rice might suffer a certain degree of water stress in drying wetting cycle condition and water stress was an important factor which would have different effects on crop growth and its physiological characteristics in different growth stages zhao et al 2017 but information on the simulated water deficit coefficient and its impact on crop development were rarely discussed either for upland crops or rice therefore evaluating the performance of aquacrop in simulating both water dynamics and crop development in rice paddies under drying wetting cycles conditions is necessary to answer if the model of aquacrop performed well or not in various water management conditions based on data collected in eastern china from rice paddies under drying wetting cycle irrigation which was a high efficiency irrigation method for rice and widely used in many countries bouman et al 2007 the aquacrop version 5 0 was calibrated and validated to investigate if it performed well in simulating both crop development and daily field water balance and to investigate the water stress on rice growth under the drying wetting cycle condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and brief information about the experiment data during 2012 2013 rice season from kunshan irrigation drainage experiment station in jiangsu province 31 15 15 n 120 57 43 e were collected for model calibration and validation the experiment was conducted in 3 lysimeters the climate of the study area is subtropical monsoon with a mean air temperature of 15 5 average annual precipitation of 1100 mm and annual frost free days of 234 d the soil in lysimeters is dark yellow hydromorphic paddy soil the volumetric saturated soil water contents of 0 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm soil layers are 52 0 50 1 47 9 respectively table 1 shows the chemical and physical properties of the soil including bulk density texture field capacity and wilting points ph the contents of organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorus total potassium the lysimeters width length 2 0 m 2 5 m was bottom sealed to avoid the influence of rainfall a removable shelter was constructed which worked only on the rainy days and not affected the evaporation and transpiration when there was no rainfall the rice seedling of japoncia rice jia 04 33 was transplanted on june 28 in 2012 and june 25 in 2013 and was harvested in the later october the length of the growth period was 117 and 120 days respectively it was transplanted at the hill spacing of 25 cm 17 cm 3 4 pants per hill fertilizers were applied at nitrogen n 318 3 kg ha 1 phosphorus p2o5 45 kg ha 1 and potassium k2o 45 kg ha 1 according to the local cultivation practices rice was irrigated following the procedure of controlled irrigation ci xu et al 2017 in rice field under ci irrigation rice is submerged in 5 25 mm water depth in the period of recovery in other stages irrigation was applied only to saturate the soil and there is no flooding water in paddy field except during period for fertilizer and pesticides applications detailed information about the irrigation technique can be found in reference by xu et al 2017 since the lysimeters were bottom sealed subsurface drainage were controlled by matching the groundwater level with the field ground water level one day before in open field as listed in fig 1 near the lysimeter there were 13 and 14 drying wetting cycles for different treatments in 2012 and 2013 respectively accordingly there were 52 days under non flooding from transplanting to the end of milk maturity in 2012 and 49 days without flooding water in 2013 water balance components were measured in the lysimeter experiment including field water level soil moisture content ground water level subsurface drainage volume irrigation volume the water depth was measured daily using a vertical ruler at 8 00 clock in the morning when there was a water depth in the rice field and soil moisture content was measured by a time domain reflectometry equipment tdr usa with waveguides at the depth of 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm when there was no ponding water the ground water level and subsurface drainage volume 250 ml resolution equal to 0 05 mm in water depth were recorded by the groundwater level control and measurement system described by he et al 2014 the irrigation volume in each plot was recorded by water meter 100 ml resolution which was installed at the outlet of the water supply pipe the daily rice evapotranspiration et was computed by the water balance calculation within the bottom sealed lysimeter meteorological data including maximum minimum and average air temperature tmax tmin tmean wind speed at the 2 0 m height u2 average relative humidity rh precipitation p solar radiation rs during the crop growth period were recored hourly by an automatic meteorological station which was maintained following the surface meteorological observation standard of china meteorological administration daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by using the et0 calculator razzaghi et al 2017 distributed with the model based on the meteorological data other than water balance crop growth was measured including leaf area index lai biomass accumulation rice yields for lai measurement three plants were selected leaf length and width of each leaf was measured to calculate the lai by integrating every single leaf area biomass accumulation was measured from one replicate and grain yield was determined for other two replicated at harvest 1 l a i 0 7 œÅ i 1 3 1 n l i j b i j 3 where œÅ is the plant density which was calculated from the plant spacing n is the leaves number of each plant measured in the current research it was 5 or 10 in different crop growth period canopy coverage cc was determined by using the relationship between lai and cc hsiao et al 2009 which was also used by maniruzzaman et al 2015 2 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 l a i 1 2 based on soil moisture measured at non flooding days soil moisture deficit coefficient ks was

biomass and harvestable yield at daily step based on the available water as well as the field daily water balance in aquacrop two types of crop parameters were included conservative and non conservative the conservative parameters are those which was only determined by the crop type and did not change with the location field management climate and time default values can be used directly raes et al 2009 and non conservative parameters are those which should be calibrated and validated before used when the model of aquacrop was applied in alternative drying wetting conditions coefficients of water stress are important including water stress coefficient for leaf expansion ksexp for stomata kssto for senescence kssen and for pollination failure kspol the coefficients of ksexp kssto and kssen could be calculated by eq 4 and the kspol was determined by the relative depletion of soil moisture the water stress was also affected by crop transpiration rates in aquacrop the default value of upper threshold for et0 was 5 mm d 1 and it was adjusted according to the daily et0 in aqaucrop ksexp kssto and kssen were output and ks simulated was the product of ksexp kssto and kssen in current research 4 k s i 1 e d r e l i f s h a p e i 1 e f s h a p e 1 5 d r e l i 1 p l o w e r i d r t a w p l o w e r i p u p p e r i where ks was water stress coefficient and i was exp sto and sen drel is relative soil moisture depletion the fraction of water depleted relative to the total available water that the soil can hold fshape was the shape factor of the response curve between ks and drel and fshape was different for ksexp kssto and kssen dr was the water in root zoon depletion taw is the total available soil water which was the amount of water between field capacity and wilting point plower i is the maximum relative soil moisture depletion and pupper is the minimum one and p was also different for ksexp kssto and kssen for p is lower than pupper there was no water stress and if p is higher than plower that means the available soil moisture was exhausted by using aquacrop biomass production and the cumulative aboveground biomass b was calculated daily using eqs 6 and 7 based on the ration of daily crop transpiration tr over et0 and the normalized water productivity wp which express the aboveground dry matter g kg 1 produced per unit land area m2 or ha per unit of water transpired mm under non stressed condition and crop yield was determined by compiling the reference harvest index hi0 with the total aboveground biomass b and an adjustment factor fhi to reflect the influence of water stress the adjustment effect on hi0 might be different among crop growth stage for example water stress before flowering lead to increase in harvest index yet during yield formation period the restriction on vegetative growth caused by water stress lead to a positive impact on harvest index stomatal closure caused by water stress lead to a negative impact on harvest index 6 m k s b w p t r e t 0 7 b k s b w p t r e t 0 8 y f h i h i 0 b where m is the daily aboveground biomass ksb is the air temperature stress coefficient in aquacrop daily crop transpiration tr and interplant evaporation e was determined separately by using the eqs 9 and 10 raes et al 2009 the evaporation was computed according to the ritchie s two stages approach and influenced by the energy and the soil water availability kr was the evaporation reduction coefficient it was 1 when water was enough and declined which was smaller than 1 and as such reduced soil evaporation when insufficient water was available in the soil to respond to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and tr was affected by the soil water stress ks either water shortage or logging the simulation of tr was with the help of water stress coefficient for stomata closure kssto and water logging ksaer ksaer varies between the anaerobiosis point where ksaer is 1 and soil saturation where ksaer is 0 however the effects of water logging on rice would be none and the ksaer was set as 1 in current researches 9 t r c c k c t r x e t 0 10 e k r 1 c c k e x e t 0 11 c c c c 0 e t c g c

transpiration coefficient k r is the evaporation reduction coefficient kex is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient 2 3 model inputs the aquacop needs only a few inputs which are easily acquired the parameters include meteorology crop soil field management groundwater table the minimum effective root depth and the initial soil water depth or soil water content meteorological variables include maximum and minimum air temperature rainfall co2 concentration et0 in current research the default value of co2 concentration was used crop parameters include plant density plant date the water productivity normalized for et0 and atmospheric co2 concentration wp the soil parameters include soil texture saturated water content field capacity wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity field managements include irrigation method height of bund and irrigation record 2 4 model calibration and validation the aquacrop was calibrated based on data in 2012 and validated based on data in 2013 there were several conservative parameters in the aquacrop model such as base temperature tbase upper temperature tupper upper and lower threshold of soil water depletion pupper plower maximum crop transpiration coefficient kctr x water productivity normalized for et0 and co2 wp and parameters describe the effects of water stress among different crop growth stages for these parameters default values were used directly according to raes et al 2015 for non conservative values default values were used as the initial values and was adjusted in the process of calibration as listed in table 2 trial and error method was used to achieve the good match between simulated and measured canopy cover cc evapotranspiration et soil water moisture content aboveground biomass b and yield before model calibration days to recovery max canopy senescence and maturity since transplanting as well as the duration of flowering stage were determined according to field measurement listed in table 2 then initial canopy cover per unit land area cc0 and maximum canopy cover ccx were calibrated to estimate the cc curve steduto et al 2012 k ctr x and k e x was adjusted to guarantee the good match between measured and simulated et and soil water content rew was estimated according to allen et al 1998 and it was 9 mm according to xu et al 2017 parameters of wp and hi0 were calibrated by matching the observed biomass and yield 2 5 model evaluation to assess the goodness of fit of the model between observed and simulated values the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error rmsen the willmott index of agreement d willmott 1982 and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the model performance 13 r m s e i 1 n s i m i 2 n 0 5 14 r m s e

value m mean is mean of the measured value s mean is mean of the simulated value n is the number of data the rmsen shows the accuracy of the model and the deviation of the simulated and the mean of measured and the simulation is considered excellent when rmsen is less than 10 good when 10 rmsen 20 fair when 20 rmsen 30 and poor when larger than 30 jamieson et al 1991 d ranges from zero to 1 if it is approaching one indicating a better relationship between simulated and measured data 3 results and discussion 3 1 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency seasonal evapotranspiration et was 483 9 mm and 604 4 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively and compared to the results for traditional irrigation in eastern china by he et al 2016 et were reduced significantly p 0 05 with reduction of 34 1 and 18 6 in 2012 and 2013 respectively and et was approximately 520 544 mm in 2012 and 2013 for alternative of wetting and drying in bangladesh maniruzzaman et al 2015 alberto et al 2009 reported seasonal et of 500 and 534 mm which was similar with results in current study although it was slightly higher than that in eastern china and even higher et was reported by sudhir yadav et al 2011 with values of 749 911 mm and moratiel and martinez cob 2013 which reported et of 755 811 mm the wue was 1 54 kg m 3 and 1 15 kg m 3 in 2012 and 2013 respectively wue was significantly improved p 0 05 with increase of 43 9 and 18 6 yet as for crop yield yield in drying wetting cycle condition had a slightly reduction compared to that for traditional irrigation with 4 8 and 3 8 there was no statistical difference between yield for the two different irrigation method with a huge reduction of irrigation and similar results were also reported by maniruzzaman et al 2015 maniruzzaman et al 2015 also reported that yield would have a severe reduction caused by long time irrigation internal the results indicated that water stress caused by water deficit would reduce et effectively leading to a slightly reduction in yield and researches about minimize et without a huge reduction were necessary he et al 2016 reported the response of et and yield to different limited drainage level and find that et declined as the threshold of limited drainage level rised 3 2 crop parameterization the calibrated parameters in current research are presented in table 2 ccx was estimated as 97 which was reached at the 47 days after transplanting days for canopy senescence were 66 days after transplanting and flowering period was about 13 days these values were similar to those that reported by maniruzzaman et al 2015 in bangladesh who found that ccx was 92 97 and the time to maximum cc was 47 51 days since transplanting and time to start senescence was 67 71 days and length of flowering was 10 days k ctr x was calibrated as 1 50 and kex was 1 1 generally k ctrx was considered as conservative parameters with default value of 1 1 amiri 2016 maniruzzaman et al 2015 which did not change with cultivator and field management k ctrx was approximately equivalent to the base crop coefficient kcb in midseason steduto et al 2009 in current research k ctrx was much higher than the 1 10 raes et al 2015 and 1 15 allen et al 1998 for rice in the midseason it was similar to 1 52 which was validated by xu et al 2017 in drying wetting paddy field the high k ctrx or kcb in midseason might be ascribed to the extremely high air humidity in this region which leads to the decline of rate of water diffusion to air and a lower reference evapotranspiration and high rice yield with large plant density xu et al 2017 yet for k ex the calibrated value was the same to the default values in aquacrop the wp was calibrated as 12 g m 2 that was out of the wp range for c3 crops 15 20 g m 2 and lower than result of 19 g m 2 by amiri 2016 maniruzzaman et al 2015 and raes et al 2015 similar result was reported byaraya et al 2010 in aquacrop biomass was calculated by eq 5 based on tr and wp in current research et0 was small due to the high air humidity yet tr was large for high yield rice as a result wp was low hi0 was estimated as 42 which was in the range of 35 50 suggested by raes et al 2015 for rice and near the value of 43 by maniruzzaman et al 2015 in bangladesh 3 3 model performance 3 3 1 canopy cover the model simulates the cc well either for calibration and validation data generally the simulated cc matched measured cc well fig 2 the r2 for the linear relationship between the measured and simulated cc were 0 9664 and 0 9848 in 2012 and 2013 rmse were 3 61 and 4 21 rmsen were from 4 35 and 5 13 index of agreement d is larger than 0 98 for both years the error in cc simulation is lower than most results on the performance of aquacrop model on different crops amiri 2016 bello and walker 2017 malik et al 2017 paredes et al 2015 shrestha et al 2013 the performance in simulation of cc of rice was excellent according tojamieson et al 1991 in current research rice was transplanted the initial cc was about 6 at recovery stage yet the simulated cc was set as zero at the beginning it indicated the simulated cc in initial stage cannot match the real status in transplanted rice field although type of planting method was set as transplanted in the model similar result was also reported by bello and walker 2017 besides aquacrop model tends to overestimate cc in days prior to ccx fig 2 which was also reported by amiri 2016 and saadati et al 2011 in current research rice was cultivated under drying wetting cycle condition and that resulted in less tillers and low maximum leaf area index than in flooding which would cause a low cc due to the effects of water stress on rice leaf expansion and the possible reason for overestimation of cc might be that aquacrop failed to reveal effects of water stress on leaf expansion 3 3 2 aboveground biomass and yield aquacrop model provided a good match between simulated and measured aboveground biomass fig 3 although biomass was slightly overestimated in the middle stage of crop growth rmse rmsen and d was 0 52 t ha 1 7 74 and 0 998 in 2012 and was 0 61 t ha 1 9 52 and 0 996 in 2013 deviation between measured and simulated biomass were reported as 2 10 5 by paredes and torres 2017 error in biomass simulation was 26 and 9 4 maniruzzaman et al 2015 and saadati et al 2011 reported validated rmsen of biomass between simulated and measured biomass was 11 2 12 4 which was larger than that in current research the model performance in current research was acceptable and mostly better than those listed results furthermore biomass was slightly overestimated in the middle stage of crop growth in 2012 and 2013 in auqacrop biomass was determined by tr which was directly determined by cc which was overestimated in the middle stage to some extent water stress would have negative effects on biomass accumulation under drying wetting cycle condition paddy field daƒüdelen et al 2006 maniruzzaman et al 2015 and nikolaus 2013 also pointed a slight and systematic overestimation of biomass in bangladesh and benin meanwhile there were several factors influencing biomass accumulation such as pest disease and unpredictable anthropogenic impacts which might influence measured biomass negatively yet these were ignored in aquacrop rice yield was estimated as 6 351 t ha 1 in 2012 and 6 557 t ha 1 in 2013 it was overestimated by 2 80 and 3 26 respectively amiri 2016 reported that the error in yield simulation 16 39 for rice in iran the relative error in yield simulation for rice was gained between 0 2 and 7 8 saadati et al 2011 there were even larger errors in yield simulation for other crop under severe water stress such as wheat maize and barley araya et al 2010 greaves and wang 2016 mohammadi et al 2016 it was concluded that the performance of yield simulation was acceptable and even better than other researches for rice and other crops yet yield was slightly overestimated in both years which was similar with the simulation of cc and biomass yield was affected by water stress which might cause inhibition of stomata and pollination failure in drying wetting cycle condition paddy field the possible reason for this might be that it was failed to estimate water stress accurately amiri et al 2015 also reported that yield was overestimated in alternate wetting and drying condition when there were non severe water stress on rice and yield was underestimated when water stress had serve effects on rice development and yield formation 3 3 3 et generally speaking the aquacrop model simulated daily et with acceptable accuracy under drying wetting cycles rmses were 0 68 and 1 00 mm d 1 respectively in 2012 and 2013 and d was 0 976 and 0 936 in 2012 and 2013 and the rmsen ranges from 16 17 to 17 97 the simulated et matched well with the measured et according to jamieson et al 1991 the results is better than the result on rice by maniruzzaman et al 2015 or results on other crops heng et al 2009 montoya et al 2016 ran et al 2017 although the performance in simulating et was generally excellent according to jamieson et al 1991 it was found that et was underestimated or overestimated frequently during rice season fig 4 and most larger error between simulated and measured was found on the day irrigation supplied similar results were reported on maize and potato by katerji et al 2013 and montoya et al 2016 that might ascribed to the error in estimating crop coefficient in aquacrop the simulated crop coefficient did not match the measured crop coefficient very well fig 5 it was found that simulated crop coefficient was almost constant without peaks yet it was found varied greatly for the measured crop coefficient similar results were also reported on soybeans maize and barley paredes et al 2014 2015 pereira et al 2015 possible reasons of the pulses of crop coefficient in rice season might be the long intervals of irrigation which would increase the opportunity of soil to absorb heat and high soil moisture content in rice field would reduce the effects on reducing albedo of wet soil in drying wetting paddy field and high soil moisture content and would reduce the effects on reducing albedo of wet soil in drying wetting paddy field xu et al 2017 in aquacrop dual crop coefficient method was used to calculate evaporation and transpiration yet the method used in aquacrop was different from the method recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 the method used to calculate et in aquacrop payed more attention on effects of the crop development on crop evapotranspiration leading to few pulses in rice seasons and ignored the effects of wetting events and the meteorological condition yet pereira et al 2015 reported that dual crop coefficient developed by fao56 performed well in simulating the effects of wetting events and other factors which might lead to a dramatically increasement in crop coefficient than aquacrop and pereira et al 2015 also reported that the method used to estimate et should be improved and it was even pointed that the procedure of calculating evapotranspiration based on kc tr and cc curve should be revised with an approach similar to that adopted in fao 56 paredes et al 2014 3 3 4 field water balance fig 6 shows the simulated and measured soil moisture and flooding water depth for water depth the rmse were 6 60 mm and 7 99 mm respectively in2012 and 2013 d was 0 58 and 0 70 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for relative soil moisture content the rmse are 14 79 in 2012 and 14 81 in 2013 d was 0 58 and 0 59 in 2012 and 2013 respectively in flooded paddies with a constant percolation it was reported that aquacrop performed well in simulating seasonal field water balance maniruzzaman et al 2015 but they failed to illustrate the detailed information in simulating water dynamics in rice field when it comes to drying wetting cycle condition generally aquacrop could simulate the trend of the field water balance fig 6 it was found that this model worked well in simulating flooding water depth in recovery stage but flooding water depth and soil moisture content were underestimated in other stages the possible reasons of the underestimation might be the errors in simulation of percolation in current research the bottom of lysimeter was sealed and groundwater was adjusted to the field groundwater and the drainage was only lateral drainage and deep percolation was not included due to the sealed bottom in current research yet the boundary condition of sealed bottom couldn t be taken into account in aqucrop and the lateral drainage and deep percolation were both included in the output drainage flooding water depth field drain spacing and boundary condition also played important roles in percolation shi et al 2013 chen et al 1995 yet these factors were ignored by aquacrop eq 18 there should be some changes in the procedure of drainage water depth boundary condition and the field drain spacing when there was pipe drainage system in field should be taken into account in the procedure of percolation 17 Œ∏ i t œÑ Œ∏ s a t Œ∏ f c e Œ∏ i Œ∏ f c 1 e Œ∏ s a t Œ∏ f c 18 œÑ 0 866 k s a t 0

al 1995 and simulated by aquacrop were shown in fig 7 it was shown that ks was overestimated during the growth season although soil moisture water content simulated was lower than measured and this could explain the overestimation of cc biomass and yield due to the underestimation of effects of water stress the error in simulated and measured ks might be caused by the different method used the total available water taw in aquacrop was the water between field capacity and wilting point and water stress occurred when the soil moisture water content was lower than field capacity which was more suitable for upland crops yet the taw for paddy was different from that for upland crops and paddy was sensitive to water stress ks computed by mao et al 1995 was lower than 1 when the soil moisture content was lower than saturation and several researches pointed that the method by mao et al 1995 performed well in estimating water stress on paddy under drying wetting cycle condition xu et al 2017 considering high soil moisture in paddy field the procedure of calculating ks should be revised and method pointed by mao et al 1995 or a revised taw could be considered for accurate estimation of water stress 4 conclusion the aquacrop model version 5 0 was calibrated and validated for modelling both biomass production and field water balance for rice under drying wetting cycle conditions and seasonal evapotranspiration et was reduced significantly while the amount of irrigation was also reduced under drying wetting condition compared to that under traditional irrigation and the amount of seasonal et was similar to that in other parts of the world and even larger et was reported in other countries this model simulated rice canopy cover cc evapotranspiration et biomass and yield with an acceptable accuracy although these values were slightly overestimated during midseason yet flooding water depth and soil moisture content was underestimated in rice season except in recovery stage the method incorporated in this model estimating water deficit coefficient ks which was suitable for upland crop caused overestimation of ks although soil moisture content was underestimated crop coefficient fluctuated rarely after wetting events and there were few pulses during midseason due to the method used to estimate et in aquacrop considering the limitation of this model it is advisable to revise the procedure of calculating et and a method similar to dual crop coefficient method proposed by fao 56 could be used in auqacrop the method to estimate ks should be revised and it was advisable to revise total available water taw in paddy field and a method to calculate ks similar to mao et al 1995 was advisable to be used acknowledgements this research was financially supported by

11179,various crop growth models have been developed to simulate the crop development and were used to assess the effects of climate cultivation and irrigation methods to evaluate the feasibility of water driven model aquacrop in simulating crop development production and field water balance in paddy soil under drying wetting cycle condition the model was calibrated and validated based on data during 2012 2013 rice season in eastern china results showed that the accuracy of this model in simulating canopy cover cc evapotranspiration et biomass yield were generally acceptable with the root mean square of error rmse less than 10 for cc 1 0 mm for et 0 61t ha 1 for biomass and with relative deviation of 3 6 for yield meanwhile aquacrop tended to overestimate cc biomass and yield slightly during the midseason yet its performance in simulating soil moisture content was not as good as expected it tended to underestimate soil moisture with a rmse of 14 81 but overestimated the water

rice has the second largest area of rice cultivation contributing to 18 8 of the world rice area and 28 1 of the global rice yields faostat 2014 traditionally rice paddy is submerged and maintains a water depth in most of the growth season which leads to large deep percolation and less efficient water consumption meanwhile china is one of the 13 water shortage countries improving the irrigation water use efficiency in rice production is an important issue especially in the circumstance of increasing water scarcity due to climate change to realize efficient utilization of water in rice production the information of rice evapotranspiration under different irrigation management practices is vital important generally crop evapotranspiration varied along with crop growth which is a complicated process influenced by climate soil texture ecological environment genetic and physiology traits and cultivation practice fleischer et al 2015 rivas and caselles 2004 other than field experiment crop model is also an important tool for understanding the crop response to field managements and climate conditions and offers a useful tool for irrigation scheduling gu et al 2017 maniruzzaman et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2017 a few crop models have been developed with dassat apsim ceres rice cropsyst oryza2000 and aquacrop as the well known models linker and ioslovich 2017 ojeda et al 2018 singh et al 2017 umair et al 2017 those crop models can be categorized into three groups namely radiation driven models carbon driven models and water driven models steduto 2003 aquacrop is a water driven model developed by fao which mainly focus on the available water in the root zone raes et al 2009 raes et al 2015 steduto et al 2009 compared with other models aquacrop only needs a few variables and input parameters which are easily available and it achieves a great balance between output accuracy simplicity and robustness steduto et al 2009 moreover it has been used to simulate crop growth biomass production and yield in a number of crops around the world such as potato razzaghi et al 2017 maize greaves and wang 2016 pea paredes and torres 2017 wheat iqbal et al 2014 for rice which might be cultivated under various water management practices aquacrop model was also used under flooding condition aquacrop performed well in simulating rice development biomass and yield lin et al 2012 saadati et al 2011 when it was under water stress or drying wetting cycles condition aquacrop performed well in simulating rice crop development and production amiri 2016 amiri et al 2015 maniruzzaman et al 2015 whereas few researches evaluated the ability of this model in simulating the water balance in rice paddies under drying wetting cycle condition maniruzzaman et al 2015 reported the seasonal values of evaporation transpiration and percolation other than crop growth in a drying wetting cycled paddy but failed to simulate the daily water balance process lin et al 2012 showed the results of soil moisture during drying period in rice field but failed to show more detailed information including flooding water depths after wetting events and daily evapotranspiration to our knowledge there are no results investigated the performance of aquacrop in simulating daily field water balance or process in detail meanwhile rice might suffer a certain degree of water stress in drying wetting cycle condition and water stress was an important factor which would have different effects on crop growth and its physiological characteristics in different growth stages zhao et al 2017 but information on the simulated water deficit coefficient and its impact on crop development were rarely discussed either for upland crops or rice therefore evaluating the performance of aquacrop in simulating both water dynamics and crop development in rice paddies under drying wetting cycles conditions is necessary to answer if the model of aquacrop performed well or not in various water management conditions based on data collected in eastern china from rice paddies under drying wetting cycle irrigation which was a high efficiency irrigation method for rice and widely used in many countries bouman et al 2007 the aquacrop version 5 0 was calibrated and validated to investigate if it performed well in simulating both crop development and daily field water balance and to investigate the water stress on rice growth under the drying wetting cycle condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and brief information about the experiment data during 2012 2013 rice season from kunshan irrigation drainage experiment station in jiangsu province 31 15 15 n 120 57 43 e were collected for model calibration and validation the experiment was conducted in 3 lysimeters the climate of the study area is subtropical monsoon with a mean air temperature of 15 5 average annual precipitation of 1100 mm and annual frost free days of 234 d the soil in lysimeters is dark yellow hydromorphic paddy soil the volumetric saturated soil water contents of 0 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm soil layers are 52 0 50 1 47 9 respectively table 1 shows the chemical and physical properties of the soil including bulk density texture field capacity and wilting points ph the contents of organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorus total potassium the lysimeters width length 2 0 m 2 5 m was bottom sealed to avoid the influence of rainfall a removable shelter was constructed which worked only on the rainy days and not affected the evaporation and transpiration when there was no rainfall the rice seedling of japoncia rice jia 04 33 was transplanted on june 28 in 2012 and june 25 in 2013 and was harvested in the later october the length of the growth period was 117 and 120 days respectively it was transplanted at the hill spacing of 25 cm 17 cm 3 4 pants per hill fertilizers were applied at nitrogen n 318 3 kg ha 1 phosphorus p2o5 45 kg ha 1 and potassium k2o 45 kg ha 1 according to the local cultivation practices rice was irrigated following the procedure of controlled irrigation ci xu et al 2017 in rice field under ci irrigation rice is submerged in 5 25 mm water depth in the period of recovery in other stages irrigation was applied only to saturate the soil and there is no flooding water in paddy field except during period for fertilizer and pesticides applications detailed information about the irrigation technique can be found in reference by xu et al 2017 since the lysimeters were bottom sealed subsurface drainage were controlled by matching the groundwater level with the field ground water level one day before in open field as listed in fig 1 near the lysimeter there were 13 and 14 drying wetting cycles for different treatments in 2012 and 2013 respectively accordingly there were 52 days under non flooding from transplanting to the end of milk maturity in 2012 and 49 days without flooding water in 2013 water balance components were measured in the lysimeter experiment including field water level soil moisture content ground water level subsurface drainage volume irrigation volume the water depth was measured daily using a vertical ruler at 8 00 clock in the morning when there was a water depth in the rice field and soil moisture content was measured by a time domain reflectometry equipment tdr usa with waveguides at the depth of 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm when there was no ponding water the ground water level and subsurface drainage volume 250 ml resolution equal to 0 05 mm in water depth were recorded by the groundwater level control and measurement system described by he et al 2014 the irrigation volume in each plot was recorded by water meter 100 ml resolution which was installed at the outlet of the water supply pipe the daily rice evapotranspiration et was computed by the water balance calculation within the bottom sealed lysimeter meteorological data including maximum minimum and average air temperature tmax tmin tmean wind speed at the 2 0 m height u2 average relative humidity rh precipitation p solar radiation rs during the crop growth period were recored hourly by an automatic meteorological station which was maintained following the surface meteorological observation standard of china meteorological administration daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by using the et0 calculator razzaghi et al 2017 distributed with the model based on the meteorological data other than water balance crop growth was measured including leaf area index lai biomass accumulation rice yields for lai measurement three plants were selected leaf length and width of each leaf was measured to calculate the lai by integrating every single leaf area biomass accumulation was measured from one replicate and grain yield was determined for other two replicated at harvest 1 l a i 0 7 œÅ i 1 3 1 n l i j b i j 3 where œÅ is the plant density which was calculated from the plant spacing n is the leaves number of each plant measured in the current research it was 5 or 10 in different crop growth period canopy coverage cc was determined by using the relationship between lai and cc hsiao et al 2009 which was also used by maniruzzaman et al 2015 2 c c 1 005 1 exp 0 6 l a i 1 2 based on soil moisture measured at non flooding days soil moisture deficit coefficient ks was calculated according to equation by mao et al 1995 which was widely used in rice to assess the effects of water deficit xu et al 2017 lv et al 2018 3 k s 1 Œ∏ r Œ∏ r c 1 ln 1 100 Œ∏ r l n 101 Œ∏ r c 2

100 and 80 for paddy rice 2 2 aquacrop model aquacrop model combines four parts including the atmospheric crop development soil water balance and field management this model simulates the crop growth biomass and harvestable yield at daily step based on the available water as well as the field daily water balance in aquacrop two types of crop parameters were included conservative and non conservative the conservative parameters are those which was only determined by the crop type and did not change with the location field management climate and time default values can be used directly raes et al 2009 and non conservative parameters are those which should be calibrated and validated before used when the model of aquacrop was applied in alternative drying wetting conditions coefficients of water stress are important including water stress coefficient for leaf expansion ksexp for stomata kssto for senescence kssen and for pollination failure kspol the coefficients of ksexp kssto and kssen could be calculated by eq 4 and the kspol was determined by the relative depletion of soil moisture the water stress was also affected by crop transpiration rates in aquacrop the default value of upper threshold for et0 was 5 mm d 1 and it was adjusted according to the daily et0 in aqaucrop ksexp kssto and kssen were output and ks simulated was the product of ksexp kssto and kssen in current research 4 k s i 1 e d r e l i f s h a p e i 1 e f s h a p e 1 5 d r e l i 1 p l o w e r i d r t a w p l o w e r i p u p p e r i where ks was water stress coefficient and i was exp sto and sen drel is relative soil moisture depletion the fraction of water depleted relative to the total available water that the soil can hold fshape was the shape factor of the response curve between ks and drel and fshape was different for ksexp kssto and kssen dr was the water in root zoon depletion taw is the total available soil water which was the amount of water between field capacity and wilting point plower i is the maximum relative soil moisture depletion and pupper is the minimum one and p was also different for ksexp kssto and kssen for p is lower than pupper there was no water stress and if p is higher than plower that means the available soil moisture was exhausted by using aquacrop biomass production and the cumulative aboveground biomass b was calculated daily using eqs 6 and 7 based on the ration of daily crop transpiration tr over et0 and the normalized water productivity wp which express the aboveground dry matter g kg 1 produced per unit land area m2 or ha per unit of water transpired mm under non stressed condition and crop yield was determined by compiling the reference harvest index hi0 with the total aboveground biomass b and an adjustment factor fhi to reflect the influence of water stress the adjustment effect on hi0 might be different among crop growth stage for example water stress before flowering lead to increase in harvest index yet during yield formation period the restriction on vegetative growth caused by water stress lead to a positive impact on harvest index stomatal closure caused by water stress lead to a negative impact on harvest index 6 m k s b w p t r e t 0 7 b k s b w p t r e t 0 8 y f h i h i 0 b where m is the daily aboveground biomass ksb is the air temperature stress coefficient in aquacrop daily crop transpiration tr and interplant evaporation e was determined separately by using the eqs 9 and 10 raes et al 2009 the evaporation was computed according to the ritchie s two stages approach and influenced by the energy and the soil water availability kr was the evaporation reduction coefficient it was 1 when water was enough and declined which was smaller than 1 and as such reduced soil evaporation when insufficient water was available in the soil to respond to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and tr was affected by the soil water stress ks either water shortage or logging the simulation of tr was with the help of water stress coefficient for stomata closure kssto and water logging ksaer ksaer varies between the anaerobiosis point where ksaer is 1 and soil saturation where ksaer is 0 however the effects of water logging on rice would be none and the ksaer was set as 1 in current researches 9 t r c c k c t r x e t 0 10 e k r 1 c c k e x e t 0 11 c c c c 0 e t c g c

transpiration coefficient k r is the evaporation reduction coefficient kex is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient 2 3 model inputs the aquacop needs only a few inputs which are easily acquired the parameters include meteorology crop soil field management groundwater table the minimum effective root depth and the initial soil water depth or soil water content meteorological variables include maximum and minimum air temperature rainfall co2 concentration et0 in current research the default value of co2 concentration was used crop parameters include plant density plant date the water productivity normalized for et0 and atmospheric co2 concentration wp the soil parameters include soil texture saturated water content field capacity wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity field managements include irrigation method height of bund and irrigation record 2 4 model calibration and validation the aquacrop was calibrated based on data in 2012 and validated based on data in 2013 there were several conservative parameters in the aquacrop model such as base temperature tbase upper temperature tupper upper and lower threshold of soil water depletion pupper plower maximum crop transpiration coefficient kctr x water productivity normalized for et0 and co2 wp and parameters describe the effects of water stress among different crop growth stages for these parameters default values were used directly according to raes et al 2015 for non conservative values default values were used as the initial values and was adjusted in the process of calibration as listed in table 2 trial and error method was used to achieve the good match between simulated and measured canopy cover cc evapotranspiration et soil water moisture content aboveground biomass b and yield before model calibration days to recovery max canopy senescence and maturity since transplanting as well as the duration of flowering stage were determined according to field measurement listed in table 2 then initial canopy cover per unit land area cc0 and maximum canopy cover ccx were calibrated to estimate the cc curve steduto et al 2012 k ctr x and k e x was adjusted to guarantee the good match between measured and simulated et and soil water content rew was estimated according to allen et al 1998 and it was 9 mm according to xu et al 2017 parameters of wp and hi0 were calibrated by matching the observed biomass and yield 2 5 model evaluation to assess the goodness of fit of the model between observed and simulated values the root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error rmsen the willmott index of agreement d willmott 1982 and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate the model performance 13 r m s e i 1 n s i m i 2 n 0 5 14 r m s e

value m mean is mean of the measured value s mean is mean of the simulated value n is the number of data the rmsen shows the accuracy of the model and the deviation of the simulated and the mean of measured and the simulation is considered excellent when rmsen is less than 10 good when 10 rmsen 20 fair when 20 rmsen 30 and poor when larger than 30 jamieson et al 1991 d ranges from zero to 1 if it is approaching one indicating a better relationship between simulated and measured data 3 results and discussion 3 1 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency seasonal evapotranspiration et was 483 9 mm and 604 4 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively and compared to the results for traditional irrigation in eastern china by he et al 2016 et were reduced significantly p 0 05 with reduction of 34 1 and 18 6 in 2012 and 2013 respectively and et was approximately 520 544 mm in 2012 and 2013 for alternative of wetting and drying in bangladesh maniruzzaman et al 2015 alberto et al 2009 reported seasonal et of 500 and 534 mm which was similar with results in current study although it was slightly higher than that in eastern china and even higher et was reported by sudhir yadav et al 2011 with values of 749 911 mm and moratiel and martinez cob 2013 which reported et of 755 811 mm the wue was 1 54 kg m 3 and 1 15 kg m 3 in 2012 and 2013 respectively wue was significantly improved p 0 05 with increase of 43 9 and 18 6 yet as for crop yield yield in drying wetting cycle condition had a slightly reduction compared to that for traditional irrigation with 4 8 and 3 8 there was no statistical difference between yield for the two different irrigation method with a huge reduction of irrigation and similar results were also reported by maniruzzaman et al 2015 maniruzzaman et al 2015 also reported that yield would have a severe reduction caused by long time irrigation internal the results indicated that water stress caused by water deficit would reduce et effectively leading to a slightly reduction in yield and researches about minimize et without a huge reduction were necessary he et al 2016 reported the response of et and yield to different limited drainage level and find that et declined as the threshold of limited drainage level rised 3 2 crop parameterization the calibrated parameters in current research are presented in table 2 ccx was estimated as 97 which was reached at the 47 days after transplanting days for canopy senescence were 66 days after transplanting and flowering period was about 13 days these values were similar to those that reported by maniruzzaman et al 2015 in bangladesh who found that ccx was 92 97 and the time to maximum cc was 47 51 days since transplanting and time to start senescence was 67 71 days and length of flowering was 10 days k ctr x was calibrated as 1 50 and kex was 1 1 generally k ctrx was considered as conservative parameters with default value of 1 1 amiri 2016 maniruzzaman et al 2015 which did not change with cultivator and field management k ctrx was approximately equivalent to the base crop coefficient kcb in midseason steduto et al 2009 in current research k ctrx was much higher than the 1 10 raes et al 2015 and 1 15 allen et al 1998 for rice in the midseason it was similar to 1 52 which was validated by xu et al 2017 in drying wetting paddy field the high k ctrx or kcb in midseason might be ascribed to the extremely high air humidity in this region which leads to the decline of rate of water diffusion to air and a lower reference evapotranspiration and high rice yield with large plant density xu et al 2017 yet for k ex the calibrated value was the same to the default values in aquacrop the wp was calibrated as 12 g m 2 that was out of the wp range for c3 crops 15 20 g m 2 and lower than result of 19 g m 2 by amiri 2016 maniruzzaman et al 2015 and raes et al 2015 similar result was reported byaraya et al 2010 in aquacrop biomass was calculated by eq 5 based on tr and wp in current research et0 was small due to the high air humidity yet tr was large for high yield rice as a result wp was low hi0 was estimated as 42 which was in the range of 35 50 suggested by raes et al 2015 for rice and near the value of 43 by maniruzzaman et al 2015 in bangladesh 3 3 model performance 3 3 1 canopy cover the model simulates the cc well either for calibration and validation data generally the simulated cc matched measured cc well fig 2 the r2 for the linear relationship between the measured and simulated cc were 0 9664 and 0 9848 in 2012 and 2013 rmse were 3 61 and 4 21 rmsen were from 4 35 and 5 13 index of agreement d is larger than 0 98 for both years the error in cc simulation is lower than most results on the performance of aquacrop model on different crops amiri 2016 bello and walker 2017 malik et al 2017 paredes et al 2015 shrestha et al 2013 the performance in simulation of cc of rice was excellent according tojamieson et al 1991 in current research rice was transplanted the initial cc was about 6 at recovery stage yet the simulated cc was set as zero at the beginning it indicated the simulated cc in initial stage cannot match the real status in transplanted rice field although type of planting method was set as transplanted in the model similar result was also reported by bello and walker 2017 besides aquacrop model tends to overestimate cc in days prior to ccx fig 2 which was also reported by amiri 2016 and saadati et al 2011 in current research rice was cultivated under drying wetting cycle condition and that resulted in less tillers and low maximum leaf area index than in flooding which would cause a low cc due to the effects of water stress on rice leaf expansion and the possible reason for overestimation of cc might be that aquacrop failed to reveal effects of water stress on leaf expansion 3 3 2 aboveground biomass and yield aquacrop model provided a good match between simulated and measured aboveground biomass fig 3 although biomass was slightly overestimated in the middle stage of crop growth rmse rmsen and d was 0 52 t ha 1 7 74 and 0 998 in 2012 and was 0 61 t ha 1 9 52 and 0 996 in 2013 deviation between measured and simulated biomass were reported as 2 10 5 by paredes and torres 2017 error in biomass simulation was 26 and 9 4 maniruzzaman et al 2015 and saadati et al 2011 reported validated rmsen of biomass between simulated and measured biomass was 11 2 12 4 which was larger than that in current research the model performance in current research was acceptable and mostly better than those listed results furthermore biomass was slightly overestimated in the middle stage of crop growth in 2012 and 2013 in auqacrop biomass was determined by tr which was directly determined by cc which was overestimated in the middle stage to some extent water stress would have negative effects on biomass accumulation under drying wetting cycle condition paddy field daƒüdelen et al 2006 maniruzzaman et al 2015 and nikolaus 2013 also pointed a slight and systematic overestimation of biomass in bangladesh and benin meanwhile there were several factors influencing biomass accumulation such as pest disease and unpredictable anthropogenic impacts which might influence measured biomass negatively yet these were ignored in aquacrop rice yield was estimated as 6 351 t ha 1 in 2012 and 6 557 t ha 1 in 2013 it was overestimated by 2 80 and 3 26 respectively amiri 2016 reported that the error in yield simulation 16 39 for rice in iran the relative error in yield simulation for rice was gained between 0 2 and 7 8 saadati et al 2011 there were even larger errors in yield simulation for other crop under severe water stress such as wheat maize and barley araya et al 2010 greaves and wang 2016 mohammadi et al 2016 it was concluded that the performance of yield simulation was acceptable and even better than other researches for rice and other crops yet yield was slightly overestimated in both years which was similar with the simulation of cc and biomass yield was affected by water stress which might cause inhibition of stomata and pollination failure in drying wetting cycle condition paddy field the possible reason for this might be that it was failed to estimate water stress accurately amiri et al 2015 also reported that yield was overestimated in alternate wetting and drying condition when there were non severe water stress on rice and yield was underestimated when water stress had serve effects on rice development and yield formation 3 3 3 et generally speaking the aquacrop model simulated daily et with acceptable accuracy under drying wetting cycles rmses were 0 68 and 1 00 mm d 1 respectively in 2012 and 2013 and d was 0 976 and 0 936 in 2012 and 2013 and the rmsen ranges from 16 17 to 17 97 the simulated et matched well with the measured et according to jamieson et al 1991 the results is better than the result on rice by maniruzzaman et al 2015 or results on other crops heng et al 2009 montoya et al 2016 ran et al 2017 although the performance in simulating et was generally excellent according to jamieson et al 1991 it was found that et was underestimated or overestimated frequently during rice season fig 4 and most larger error between simulated and measured was found on the day irrigation supplied similar results were reported on maize and potato by katerji et al 2013 and montoya et al 2016 that might ascribed to the error in estimating crop coefficient in aquacrop the simulated crop coefficient did not match the measured crop coefficient very well fig 5 it was found that simulated crop coefficient was almost constant without peaks yet it was found varied greatly for the measured crop coefficient similar results were also reported on soybeans maize and barley paredes et al 2014 2015 pereira et al 2015 possible reasons of the pulses of crop coefficient in rice season might be the long intervals of irrigation which would increase the opportunity of soil to absorb heat and high soil moisture content in rice field would reduce the effects on reducing albedo of wet soil in drying wetting paddy field and high soil moisture content and would reduce the effects on reducing albedo of wet soil in drying wetting paddy field xu et al 2017 in aquacrop dual crop coefficient method was used to calculate evaporation and transpiration yet the method used in aquacrop was different from the method recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 the method used to calculate et in aquacrop payed more attention on effects of the crop development on crop evapotranspiration leading to few pulses in rice seasons and ignored the effects of wetting events and the meteorological condition yet pereira et al 2015 reported that dual crop coefficient developed by fao56 performed well in simulating the effects of wetting events and other factors which might lead to a dramatically increasement in crop coefficient than aquacrop and pereira et al 2015 also reported that the method used to estimate et should be improved and it was even pointed that the procedure of calculating evapotranspiration based on kc tr and cc curve should be revised with an approach similar to that adopted in fao 56 paredes et al 2014 3 3 4 field water balance fig 6 shows the simulated and measured soil moisture and flooding water depth for water depth the rmse were 6 60 mm and 7 99 mm respectively in2012 and 2013 d was 0 58 and 0 70 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for relative soil moisture content the rmse are 14 79 in 2012 and 14 81 in 2013 d was 0 58 and 0 59 in 2012 and 2013 respectively in flooded paddies with a constant percolation it was reported that aquacrop performed well in simulating seasonal field water balance maniruzzaman et al 2015 but they failed to illustrate the detailed information in simulating water dynamics in rice field when it comes to drying wetting cycle condition generally aquacrop could simulate the trend of the field water balance fig 6 it was found that this model worked well in simulating flooding water depth in recovery stage but flooding water depth and soil moisture content were underestimated in other stages the possible reasons of the underestimation might be the errors in simulation of percolation in current research the bottom of lysimeter was sealed and groundwater was adjusted to the field groundwater and the drainage was only lateral drainage and deep percolation was not included due to the sealed bottom in current research yet the boundary condition of sealed bottom couldn t be taken into account in aqucrop and the lateral drainage and deep percolation were both included in the output drainage flooding water depth field drain spacing and boundary condition also played important roles in percolation shi et al 2013 chen et al 1995 yet these factors were ignored by aquacrop eq 18 there should be some changes in the procedure of drainage water depth boundary condition and the field drain spacing when there was pipe drainage system in field should be taken into account in the procedure of percolation 17 Œ∏ i t œÑ Œ∏ s a t Œ∏ f c e Œ∏ i Œ∏ f c 1 e Œ∏ s a t Œ∏ f c 18 œÑ 0 866 k s a t 0

al 1995 and simulated by aquacrop were shown in fig 7 it was shown that ks was overestimated during the growth season although soil moisture water content simulated was lower than measured and this could explain the overestimation of cc biomass and yield due to the underestimation of effects of water stress the error in simulated and measured ks might be caused by the different method used the total available water taw in aquacrop was the water between field capacity and wilting point and water stress occurred when the soil moisture water content was lower than field capacity which was more suitable for upland crops yet the taw for paddy was different from that for upland crops and paddy was sensitive to water stress ks computed by mao et al 1995 was lower than 1 when the soil moisture content was lower than saturation and several researches pointed that the method by mao et al 1995 performed well in estimating water stress on paddy under drying wetting cycle condition xu et al 2017 considering high soil moisture in paddy field the procedure of calculating ks should be revised and method pointed by mao et al 1995 or a revised taw could be considered for accurate estimation of water stress 4 conclusion the aquacrop model version 5 0 was calibrated and validated for modelling both biomass production and field water balance for rice under drying wetting cycle conditions and seasonal evapotranspiration et was reduced significantly while the amount of irrigation was also reduced under drying wetting condition compared to that under traditional irrigation and the amount of seasonal et was similar to that in other parts of the world and even larger et was reported in other countries this model simulated rice canopy cover cc evapotranspiration et biomass and yield with an acceptable accuracy although these values were slightly overestimated during midseason yet flooding water depth and soil moisture content was underestimated in rice season except in recovery stage the method incorporated in this model estimating water deficit coefficient ks which was suitable for upland crop caused overestimation of ks although soil moisture content was underestimated crop coefficient fluctuated rarely after wetting events and there were few pulses during midseason due to the method used to estimate et in aquacrop considering the limitation of this model it is advisable to revise the procedure of calculating et and a method similar to dual crop coefficient method proposed by fao 56 could be used in auqacrop the method to estimate ks should be revised and it was advisable to revise total available water taw in paddy field and a method to calculate ks similar to mao et al 1995 was advisable to be used acknowledgements this research was financially supported by
