reveals that the integration of field data and its spatial distribution using remote sensing and gis techniques is a modern tool for the accurate evaluation of groundwater quality in the study area 2 study area the study area is madurai city tamil nadu fig 1 one of the famous historical and cultural cities in india it is located in south central tamil nadu is the second largest city after chennai and is the headquarters of madurai district in 2011 the jurisdiction of the madurai corporation was expanded from 72 wards to 100 wads covering area 151 sq km dividing into four regions zone i ii iii iv there has been rapid growth in madurai city since 1967 and it has gradually increased over the years in madurai and its surrounding areas most of the areas around madurai are least developed and are in the transformation stage it extended geographically from 9 50 north latitude to 10 00 north latitude and 78 02 east longitude to 78 12 east longitude and approximately 100 m above msl the terrain of the city is gradually sloped from the north to south and west to east the river vaigai is the prominent physical feature which bisects the city into north and south zones with the north sloped towards vaigai river and the south zone sloped away from the river the city became a municipality in 1867 and was upgraded as a corporation in 1971 after 104 years the corporation limit was extended from 52 18 km2 to 151 km2 in 2011 as per 2011 census the population of the city is 15 35 lakhs nic 2010 the area has been experiencing remarkable land cover changes due to urban expansion population pressure and various economic activities in recent years 3 methodology 3 1 preparation of parameters map using geospatial techniques in madurai city twenty groundwater samples were collected from selected wells by using a gps device the twenty observation wells used in the study is shown in fig 2 the groundwater samples were analysed by using standard testing procedures table 1 shows the analysis results of the water samples the water quality parameters more than the allowable limit recommended by bis standards bis is 10500 2012 are given in table 2 based on the analysis values the parameter maps were prepared by using arcgis software the parameter maps were shown in figs 3 7 3 2 computation of the water quality index wqi is a useful tool to measure the quality of groundwater for drinking purposes for computing the wqi parameter results of like ph ca 2 mg 2 th and cl were used table 1 wqi values are based on the relative weighted method acharyaz and sharma 2018 boufekane and saighi 2018 2019 deshmukh et al 2016 misaghi et al 2017 an arbitrary value between 2 and 5 is assigned for the rating scale the selection of values depends upon the significance of individual quality considerations in a comparative way horton 1965 ravikumar et al proposed a model for the wqi calculation was followed in this study 1 a weight wi were assigned to the water quality parameters based on their importance in the overall quality of water for drinking purposes the parameter ph and th have assigned to highest value 5 for its high impact on the groundwater quality and the value 2 was assigned to cl ca 2 mg 2 for its low impact on the groundwater quality 2 relative weight wi of the water quality parameter was computed using eq 1 table 3 1 w i w i n 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the weight of each parameter and n is no of parameters 3 a quality rating scale qi for each parameter is computed by dividing its concentration in each groundwater sample by its particular standard according to the guidelines laid down by bis and then the result was multiplied by 100 using eq 2 2 q i c i s i 100 where qi is the quality rating ci is the concentration of each chemical parameter in each water sample in mg l and si is the indian drinking water standard bis 10500 2012 for each chemical parameter in mg l except for ph then for deriving the wqi value the water quality sub index sii for each parameter is computed using eq 3 3 s i w i q i finally water quality sub index is used to calculate the wqi using eq 4 4 w q i i 1 n s i i where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter qi is the rating based on the concentration of ith parameter and n is the number of parameters 3 3 integration of wqi with gis the computed wqi values were connected with groundwater samples location by using gps then arcgis software is used to generate the groundwater quality parameter map by using idw method boufekane and saighi 2019 muzenda et al 2019 shakerkhatibi

12131,the present study evaluates the hydrochemistry of shallow groundwater and its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes in tarmiah district baghdad governorate iraq tarmiah is located in the north of baghdad and represents an important area for a study due to its human and agriculture activity in addition to lack of information twenty groundwater samples were collected from shallow tube wells and analyzed for various related physicochemical tests to produce the relevant piper diagram gibbs plot and schoeller index values piper diagram revealed that there is a broad variation in hydrochemical properties gibbs plot showed a remarkable impact on water chemistry due to evaporation the schoeller index values demonstrate that 60 of samples are with negative values which in turn show the disequilibrium in a chloro alkaline relationship while the rest 40 admit a direct base exchange reaction cation anion as a result of their positive values the hydrochemistry of the region is dominated by evaporation silicate and carbonate weathering to estimate whether the samples are drinkable or not water quality index wqi method was followed on the other hand magnesium hazard mh us salinity and wilcox diagrams were used as a relevant indication for irrigation usability the results have shown that the quarter of the samples were suitable for both studied purposes statistically the multivariate methods were used by applying q and r mode cluster analysis ca on the groundwater quality data the conclusion upon this was finding three kinds of pollution levels for the whole samples r mode ca revealed two main groups indicating that the study area is influenced by natural processes and anthropogenic sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords tarmiah district hydrochemistry groundwater quality cluster analysis 1 introduction the problem of water scarcity has been increased during the last decades over the world this problem is highly affecting the arid and semi arid areas and recognized in the middle east and north africa mena region allan 2002 although many large rivers are located in this region it is suffering from scarce water resources in addition to the struggles due to trans boundary water resources in the region droogers et al 2012 iraq is one of the most dependent countries on shared water resources from neighboring countries in which 60 8 of the total renewable water resources are originated outside the country borders as shown in fig 1 hameed et al 2019 furthermore in iraq water demand has been increased due to an increase in populations among the countries depicted in fig 1 iraq has the highest population growth rates almost 3 in 2017 hameed et al 2019 groundwater quality and its suitability for various usages such as irrigation and drinking still an issue of great vagueness along the iraqi map ismail et al 2019 in iraq the surface water is the main source for water supply agriculture and industry ismail et al 2014 2015 iraq known as mesopotamia has two main rivers tigris and euphrates which they originated from turkey early civilizations were found on these rivers banks the water quantity of these rivers is diminished due to the launch of the southeastern anatolia project gap in the seventies of the last century gap is a big turkish project that consists of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants and utilizes tigris and euphrates rivers water ismail et al 2019 the less water discharges in these rivers led to water quality deterioration especially the salinity of water which increased to 2 3 times zowain and ismail 2015 moreover climate change is another reason responsible for water quantity losses and quality deterioration ghalib 2017 in addition to the mismanagement of water resources due to the unstable situation of iraq after the last war in 2003 ghalib 2017 ismail et al 2018 according to the above there has been a tendency to use groundwater as an alternative source and especially for irrigation purpose ismail et al 2019 a lot of shallow wells have been drilled over iraq recently because of the water scarcity people started using these wells for irrigation purpose and even for drinking in some poor area ismail et al 2018 groundwater is a vital source in which more than one third of the world s population uses groundwater for drinking al ahmadi 2013 groundwater could overcome this water crisis and provide water for many uses in the arid and semi arid regions of the world including iraq in the arid and semi arid areas however groundwater could be polluted due to some anthropogenic activities such as a landfill natural processes like rock water interaction and evaporation can also change the quality of groundwater ismail et al 2015 the evaluation of groundwater quality is of prime importance in order to explore its hydrochemistry and suitability for drinking and irrigation this can be done by examining the major ions of water many interrelated processes control the groundwater quality knowing these aspects prior to water quality control and improvement are highly required in order to manage the water resources properly numerous studies have been carried out regarding groundwater quality and its chemistry in different parts over the world nagarajan et al 2010 wang et al 2011 umar and alam 2012 zhang et al 2012 nagaraju et al 2016 adimalla et al 2018 kawo and karuppannan 2018 jasrotia et al 2018 the present paper aimed at i determining the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater to understand the geochemical processes that regulate the water quality in the tarmiah district ii exploring the groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation in the studied area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tarmiah district is one of the six districts that surround baghdad the capital of iraq and located north of baghdad of about 50 km away fig 2 it lies between latitude 33 45 0 and 34 35 0 north and longitudes 43 5 0 and 44 25 0 east it links four iraqi governorates baghdad salah al din diyala and anbar the area is characterized by arable land and covers an area of about 443 km2 it has a population of about 91 000 mop 2007 the study area has arid or semi arid climate with an average rainfall of about 14 5 mm the air temperature exceeds 40 c in summer season june august and sometime reaches 48 c the maximum humidity percentage can reach up to 68 in winter whereas not more than 23 in summer mot 2010 moreover tarmiah is characterized by a suitable soil for planting and the geology of area represents a flood plain as shown in fig 3 which consists of quaternary deposits 2 2 sampling and analysis twenty groundwater samples were collected in 1 l sterilized polypropylene bottles from shallow tube wells during march 2015 the wells were continuously pumped for almost 10 min before sampling fig 2c shows the locations of sampling in the study area water quality parameters measured in the present study include ph total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride sulfate bicarbonate carbonate and nitrate the analyses were performed using standard methods recommended by the american public health association apha 2005 some parameters like ph and ec were measured in situ using portable device tds was determined using a temperature controlled oven method calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were determined titrimetrically by the edta method sodium na and potassium k were measured using the flame emission photometry chloride cl was determined by silver nitrate method sulfate so4 2 and nitrate nitrogen no3 were measured using spectrophotometric technique bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 were determined volumetrically by titration with hcl 2 3 cluster analysis cluster analysis ca is a group of multivariate statistical techniques and was used to evaluate the spatial variations among the twenty groundwater sampling sites ca can provide a better explanation of the relationship between the variables in the groundwater ismail et al 2014 hierarchical clustering was made using ward s method of linkage and squares euclidean distance method was used for determining similarity distance and illustrated by a dendrogram the geometric distance in the multidimensional space and is computed as singh et al 2008 1 distance x y i x i y i 2 1 2 ca requires water quality variables to fit to the normal distribution shapiro wilk test was used to check for normality distribution it was observed that only na mg2 and so4 2 were normally distributed therefore the original data of non normal distribution parameters were transformed in the form x log10 x after log transformation it was observed that all the parameters were normalized except hco3 and thus it was excluded q mode and r mode hierarchical ca were performed using ibm spss 25 for windows ismail et al 2018 2 4 spatial distribution of the chemical parameters the spatial distribution of the chemical parameters was investigated using the interpolation technique many methods of interpolation are available e g inverse distance weighting idw ordinary kriging ok and nearest neighbor interpolation in the present paper idw was used as it is based on distance weighting it determines cell values using a linear weighted combination set of sample points lepot et al 2017 idw was performed using arcgis software version 10 2 to identify the spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 cation anion balance the accuracy of complete chemical analysis of the groundwater samples in the study area is checked by calculating the cation anion balance using the following formula 2 cation anion balance t c c t c a t c c t c a 100 tcc is the total concentrations in milliequivalent per liter of cations calcium magnesium sodium and potassium tca is the total concentrations in milliequivalent per liter of anions chloride bicarbonate carbonate sulfate and nitrate the cation anion balance should be within the limit of 5 rao et al 2012 the cation anion balance value of this study were within the limit of 5 except for samples 7 12 11 16 6 27 and 19 9 46 3 2 general characteristics of groundwater and its hydrochemistry the results of the groundwater chemical composition are shown in table 1 the ph values of the groundwater in the study area varies between 7 11 and 7 72 with a mean value of 7 33 which indicates a slightly alkaline nature of groundwater in the study area the mean value of ec and tds in the study area were 3153 40 μs cm and 2673 45 mg l with a standard deviation of 2273 43 μs cm and 2556 68 mg l respectively table 1 the study area is characterized by a semi arid climate and thus the relatively high evaporation rate may be responsible for the enrichment of tds and ec similarly ismail et al 2018 have noticed such high concentration in the balad area located north of tarima district and state similar observation the mean value of the cations ca2 mg2 na and k ions in the study area were 183 25 84 6 298 4 and 14 87 mg l with a standard deviation of 171 03 58 78 216 80 and 28 18 mg l respectively ion exchange reaction was investigated using the chloro alkaline indices i e cai1 and cai2 schoeller 1965 the cai1 and cai2 were calculated using the following formulations 3 c a i 1 c l n a k c l 4 c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 n o 3 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter positive values of cai1 and cai2 indicate that na and k ions are exchanged with mg2 and ca2 ions in water negative values of these indices indicate that mg2 and ca2 ions are exchanged with na and k from rocks this indicates a chloro alkaline disequilibrium the schoeller indices values of groundwater samples in tarmia disrtrict showed 12 samples with negative value indicating the chloro alkaline disequilibrium the remaining 8 samples showed negative values indicating a direct base cation anion exchange reaction the mean value of the anions cl so4 2 hco3 and no3 ions in the study area were 390 35 658 35 251 75 and 3 73 mg l with a standard deviation of 286 60 483 57 187 00 and 2 33 mg l respectively carbonate co3 2 concentrations were zero in all groundwater samples table 1 hco3 can be introduced into the water naturally mainly by co2 dissolving carbonate containing minerals or be a result of the combination of co2 with rainwater ismail et al 2018 piper diagram was used to determine the hydrochemical evolution in the groundwater of the study area piper 1944 piper plot were performed using aquachem software version 2014 2 fig 4 it indicates that the groundwater samples are classified into two major water types mixed camgcl and cacl only one sample sample 15 was with nacl type these types suggest the mixing of high salinity water caused by surface water in addition to the great effects of the evaporates dispersed in the aquifer matrix the mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry was investigated using gibbs ratio gibbs 1970 this ratio can be used to explore the functional sources of dissolved chemical constituents gibbs plot is shown in fig 5 it revealed that 75 of the groundwater samples in the region were fallen in the evaporation dominance zone whereas the remaining percent of the samples were fallen in the rock dominance zone this observation suggests that the evaporation process is the major driving force controlling water chemistry hydrogeochemical processes in the study area were investigated using bivariate plots the contribution to silicate and carbonate weathering was assessed by plotting total concentrations of cations tcc versus ca2 mg2 and na k as shown in fig 6 a and b kumar et al 2008 das et al 2016 2017 it was observed that most of the groundwater samples were found to fall along and above the 1 2 line which indicates the dominance of silicate weathering whereas a few samples were fallen below this line show abundance of ca2 and mg2 which could be due to reverse ion exchange and carbonate minerals the same trend was found by das et al 2015 in jorhat district of assam india fig 6c shows the plot of na cl molar ratio versus ec if the na cl ratio is close to 1 this indicates halite dissolution na and cl will be equally released due to the process a ratio of na cl more than one higher na indicates that the silicate weathering is the dominant process a ratio of less than 1 higher cl indicate that the evaporation is the dominant process coupled with reverse ion exchange of na with ca2 das et al 2015 moreover the evaporation can be the dominant process that controlling water chemistry if the na cl ratio does not change with an increase in ec kumar et al 2006 according to fig 6c about 50 of the groundwater samples in the study area had almost fixed na cl ratio with the increase in ec in the present study both evaporation and silicate weathering are almost equally dominant in the study area fig 6d fig 6e shows that there is no relation was observed between k and no3 no3 concentrations were very low compared to k in the study area this indicates that the silicate weathering is the possible source of k while no3 is primarily due to anthropogenic activities das et al 2017 according to fig 6f a positive relationship is shown between cl and no3 this may indicate that both have come from similar origins such as anthropogenic sources fig 7 a shows the ca2 mg2 molar ratio of the groundwater samples in the study area this ratio gives an indication of the presence of calcite and dolomite dissolution kumar et al 2006 a ratio close to one indicates dolomite dissolution while ca2 mg2 ratios from 1 to 2 represent higher calcite dissolution silicate weathering and dissolution is the major process if ca2 mg2 ratio is above 2 it is observed that about 70 of the groundwater samples have ca mg ratio from 1 to 2 indicating that the calcite dissolution is more dominant than silicate weathering in the study area das et al 2016 fig 7b shows the plot of ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 it is clear that slightly more samples lie below the 1 1 line and thus reverse ion exchange was slightly more common in the study area fig 7c shows that ca2 mg2 increase with increasing salinity which could be further evidence of silicate weathering and an indication of ion exchange the plot of ca2 vs hco3 showed that most of the samples lie below the equalline fig 7d this indicates that the carbonate mineral calcite weathering also plays a role in the release of ca2 ions into the waters rather than carbonic acid silicate weathering the plot of so4 2 vs ca shows that there is an excess of so4 2 over ca2 a in the study area fig 7e it also shows that anhydrite or gypsum dissolution is the probable source of ca2 in the study area rather than calcite weathering mgbenu and egbueri 2019 fig 7f shows that the ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 vs cl increase with increasing salinity reddy et al 2010 thus ca2 and mg2 are not added at a much slower rate than hco3 throughout the year silicate weathering is the source of ca in the study area if the opposite had been observed calcite weathering would predominate 3 3 quality of groundwater for drinking the results of the study table 1 were compared with the drinking water standards of world health organization who 2011 and iraqi standards iqs 2009 and presented in table 2 only ph and no3 were within the prescribed limit in all groundwater samples indicating its suitability for drinking purpose other water quality parameters such as tds ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 were exceeding the prescribed limit in about 75 55 35 60 40 50 and 65 of the groundwater samples respectively table 2 the spatial distribution of ions concentration that exceeding the prescribed limit was prepared based on the drinking water standards of who 2011 and iqs 2009 and presented in fig 8 furthermore the quality of groundwater in the study area was also evaluated using the water quality index wqi technique wqi has been extensively used for evaluating the groundwater quality vasanthavigar et al 2010 rajankar et al 2011 nagaraju et al 2016 it includes four major steps measurement of each selected water quality parameter transform the measurement of water quality parameters into a dimensionless number quality rating assignment of weight to each water quality parameter according to its degree of importance for drinking water and finally aggregate the quality rating to obtain the final wqi value using suitable aggregation function the weight has been assigned to each water quality parameter according to nagaraju et al 2016 and presented in table 3 quality rating is computed from the following equation 5 q i 100 c i s where qi is the quality rating ci is the concentration of each water quality parameter mg l and si is the world health organization standard table 2 the final value of wqi is calculated from the following equation 6 w q i i 1 n w i q i the obtained value of wqi is classified according to the following categorization scheme excellent 50 good 50 100 poor 100 200 very poor 200 300 unsuitable 300 the wqi values of the groundwater samples in the study area vary between 23 7 and 391 4 with a mean value of 171 1 sixty percent of the groundwater samples have wqi values more than 100 suggesting that these groundwater are poor for drinking when considering about only their major ion concentrations groundwater samples 1 8 14 17 have wqi values less than 100 indicating excellent water for drinking groundwater samples 3 11 13 20 have wqi range from 50 to 100 indicating good water for drinking 3 4 quality of groundwater for irrigation ec is very important parameters for determining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation it was observed that about 40 of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation in the study area table 4 fifty percent of the samples were ranged from doubtful to permissible for irrigation and only 2 samples were good for irrigation groundwater suitability for irrigation based on ec in the study area is shown in fig 9 the groundwater quality of tarmiah is evaluated for irrigation purposes using us salinity diagram wilcox diagram and magnesium hazards mh for us salinity diagram proposed by the ussl 1954 sodium adsorption ratio sar is plotted against ec fig 10 the plot was performed using aquachem software version 2014 2 sar is calculated from the following formula 7 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter it was observed that 65 of the groundwater samples were fallen in the c4s1 c4s2 and c4s3 zone indicating that these groundwater samples are very poor if used for irrigation purpose twenty five percent of the groundwater samples were fallen in the c3s1 zone suggesting that these samples are moderate for irrigation this water can be used for irrigation in almost all types of soils with little danger of exchangeable sodium marghade et al 2012 furthermore only 2 samples 1 and 14 were fallen in the c2s1 zone which indicate good water for irrigation wilcox diagram was also used to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation sodium percentage na has been plotted versus ec wilcox 1955 fig 11 na is calculated from the following formula 8 n a n a k n a k c a 2 m g 2 100 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter it shows that almost 40 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation 25 of the samples are doubtful to unsuitable 15 of the samples are good to permissible 20 of the samples are very good to good na combined with hco3 and co3 2 can lead to the formation of alkaline soils while na combined with cl forms saline soils which affect the growth of plants mh has been proposed by szaboles and darab 1964 and is calculated using the following formula 9 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter the results revealed that 80 of the samples have a value of less than 50 indicating the water is suitable for irrigation while the remaining 20 of the samples have a value of more than 50 indicating the water is unsuitable for irrigation table 4 groundwater suitability for irrigation based on mh in the study area is shown in fig 12 the suitability of groundwater in the study area for drinking and irrigation purposes according to previous studied parameters is presented in table 5 3 5 cluster analysis ca the spatial variations among the sampling sites are evaluated using hierarchical ca and shown in fig 13 as a dendrogram it was observed that the groundwater samples were grouped into 2 clusters group 1 and group 2 group 1 represents 25 of the groundwater samples and corresponds to relatively high polluted sites group b was divided into 2 sub groups group 2a and group 2b group 2a represents 35 of the groundwater samples and corresponds to relatively moderate polluted sites group 2b represents 40 of the groundwater samples and corresponds to relatively less polluted sites the sampling sites are being agglomerated into a different level of pollution sites each cluster group contained samples spaced at its location fig 13 this suggests that anthropogenic activities may affect the quality of groundwater in the study area the r mode cluster analysis is shown in fig 14 it is obvious from this figure that all of the groundwater quality parameters can be subdivided into two main groups group 1 is ec tds ca2 cl ph no3 k mg2 and na and another group group 2 includes only so4 2 the presence of two distinct groups suggests that there may be two sets of influences that are affecting groundwater samples in the study area group 1 is most likely the effect of rock water interactions and evaporation so4 2 has grouped alone in group 2 and this may indicate that the so4 2 comes from different sources including anthropogenic activities such as the application of pesticides insecticides and fertilizers in irrigation farming especially the study area is characterized by arable land 4 conclusions in general this study revealed that the under focus area was in serious threat of pollution hydrochemistry of the samples that concluded by piper plot produced two kinds of water that is mixed camgcl and mixed cacl leading to find that high salinity mixing water was produced due to surface water and evaporation according to gibbs ratio 3 from every 4 of the groundwater samples were in the zone of evaporation dominance the other fourth was in the zone of rock dominance it is concluded that the evaporation has an extreme effect on groundwater chemistry sixty percent of the groundwater samples were with positive values of cai1 and cai2 in the reaction of ion exchange this leads to conclude that there is an exchange of na and k ions with mg 2 and ca 2 in water on the contrary the other 40 of samples were with negative values as a result of the exchange reaction of direct base cation anion generally the hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater in the study area is affected by evaporation silicate carbonate weathering and anthropogenic sources the evaporation and silicate weathering have the highest impact on the groundwater quality in the region according to who and iqs standards along with wqi only a quarter of the studied samples were drinkable in light of major ion exchange however further studies are required to evaluate important parameters such as silica and fluoride based on us salinity diagram wilcox diagram and mh six groundwater samples samples 1 3 8 13 14 and 17 can be used for irrigation three different pollution levels were present in hierarchical ca low moderate and high polluted sites in every location spaced samples contained in every cluster group this may be a direct result of anthropogenic action r mode ca showed two groups indicating that the study area is influenced by natural processes evaporation and silicate weathering and anthropogenic sources acknowledgement the authors are greatful to the general commission for groundwater for conducting the analyses in their laboratories and supplying the groundwater data used in this study 
12131,the present study evaluates the hydrochemistry of shallow groundwater and its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes in tarmiah district baghdad governorate iraq tarmiah is located in the north of baghdad and represents an important area for a study due to its human and agriculture activity in addition to lack of information twenty groundwater samples were collected from shallow tube wells and analyzed for various related physicochemical tests to produce the relevant piper diagram gibbs plot and schoeller index values piper diagram revealed that there is a broad variation in hydrochemical properties gibbs plot showed a remarkable impact on water chemistry due to evaporation the schoeller index values demonstrate that 60 of samples are with negative values which in turn show the disequilibrium in a chloro alkaline relationship while the rest 40 admit a direct base exchange reaction cation anion as a result of their positive values the hydrochemistry of the region is dominated by evaporation silicate and carbonate weathering to estimate whether the samples are drinkable or not water quality index wqi method was followed on the other hand magnesium hazard mh us salinity and wilcox diagrams were used as a relevant indication for irrigation usability the results have shown that the quarter of the samples were suitable for both studied purposes statistically the multivariate methods were used by applying q and r mode cluster analysis ca on the groundwater quality data the conclusion upon this was finding three kinds of pollution levels for the whole samples r mode ca revealed two main groups indicating that the study area is influenced by natural processes and anthropogenic sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords tarmiah district hydrochemistry groundwater quality cluster analysis 1 introduction the problem of water scarcity has been increased during the last decades over the world this problem is highly affecting the arid and semi arid areas and recognized in the middle east and north africa mena region allan 2002 although many large rivers are located in this region it is suffering from scarce water resources in addition to the struggles due to trans boundary water resources in the region droogers et al 2012 iraq is one of the most dependent countries on shared water resources from neighboring countries in which 60 8 of the total renewable water resources are originated outside the country borders as shown in fig 1 hameed et al 2019 furthermore in iraq water demand has been increased due to an increase in populations among the countries depicted in fig 1 iraq has the highest population growth rates almost 3 in 2017 hameed et al 2019 groundwater quality and its suitability for various usages such as irrigation and drinking still an issue of great vagueness along the iraqi map ismail et al 2019 in iraq the surface water is the main source for water supply agriculture and industry ismail et al 2014 2015 iraq known as mesopotamia has two main rivers tigris and euphrates which they originated from turkey early civilizations were found on these rivers banks the water quantity of these rivers is diminished due to the launch of the southeastern anatolia project gap in the seventies of the last century gap is a big turkish project that consists of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power plants and utilizes tigris and euphrates rivers water ismail et al 2019 the less water discharges in these rivers led to water quality deterioration especially the salinity of water which increased to 2 3 times zowain and ismail 2015 moreover climate change is another reason responsible for water quantity losses and quality deterioration ghalib 2017 in addition to the mismanagement of water resources due to the unstable situation of iraq after the last war in 2003 ghalib 2017 ismail et al 2018 according to the above there has been a tendency to use groundwater as an alternative source and especially for irrigation purpose ismail et al 2019 a lot of shallow wells have been drilled over iraq recently because of the water scarcity people started using these wells for irrigation purpose and even for drinking in some poor area ismail et al 2018 groundwater is a vital source in which more than one third of the world s population uses groundwater for drinking al ahmadi 2013 groundwater could overcome this water crisis and provide water for many uses in the arid and semi arid regions of the world including iraq in the arid and semi arid areas however groundwater could be polluted due to some anthropogenic activities such as a landfill natural processes like rock water interaction and evaporation can also change the quality of groundwater ismail et al 2015 the evaluation of groundwater quality is of prime importance in order to explore its hydrochemistry and suitability for drinking and irrigation this can be done by examining the major ions of water many interrelated processes control the groundwater quality knowing these aspects prior to water quality control and improvement are highly required in order to manage the water resources properly numerous studies have been carried out regarding groundwater quality and its chemistry in different parts over the world nagarajan et al 2010 wang et al 2011 umar and alam 2012 zhang et al 2012 nagaraju et al 2016 adimalla et al 2018 kawo and karuppannan 2018 jasrotia et al 2018 the present paper aimed at i determining the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater to understand the geochemical processes that regulate the water quality in the tarmiah district ii exploring the groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation in the studied area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tarmiah district is one of the six districts that surround baghdad the capital of iraq and located north of baghdad of about 50 km away fig 2 it lies between latitude 33 45 0 and 34 35 0 north and longitudes 43 5 0 and 44 25 0 east it links four iraqi governorates baghdad salah al din diyala and anbar the area is characterized by arable land and covers an area of about 443 km2 it has a population of about 91 000 mop 2007 the study area has arid or semi arid climate with an average rainfall of about 14 5 mm the air temperature exceeds 40 c in summer season june august and sometime reaches 48 c the maximum humidity percentage can reach up to 68 in winter whereas not more than 23 in summer mot 2010 moreover tarmiah is characterized by a suitable soil for planting and the geology of area represents a flood plain as shown in fig 3 which consists of quaternary deposits 2 2 sampling and analysis twenty groundwater samples were collected in 1 l sterilized polypropylene bottles from shallow tube wells during march 2015 the wells were continuously pumped for almost 10 min before sampling fig 2c shows the locations of sampling in the study area water quality parameters measured in the present study include ph total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride sulfate bicarbonate carbonate and nitrate the analyses were performed using standard methods recommended by the american public health association apha 2005 some parameters like ph and ec were measured in situ using portable device tds was determined using a temperature controlled oven method calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were determined titrimetrically by the edta method sodium na and potassium k were measured using the flame emission photometry chloride cl was determined by silver nitrate method sulfate so4 2 and nitrate nitrogen no3 were measured using spectrophotometric technique bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 were determined volumetrically by titration with hcl 2 3 cluster analysis cluster analysis ca is a group of multivariate statistical techniques and was used to evaluate the spatial variations among the twenty groundwater sampling sites ca can provide a better explanation of the relationship between the variables in the groundwater ismail et al 2014 hierarchical clustering was made using ward s method of linkage and squares euclidean distance method was used for determining similarity distance and illustrated by a dendrogram the geometric distance in the multidimensional space and is computed as singh et al 2008 1 distance x y i x i y i 2 1 2 ca requires water quality variables to fit to the normal distribution shapiro wilk test was used to check for normality distribution it was observed that only na mg2 and so4 2 were normally distributed therefore the original data of non normal distribution parameters were transformed in the form x log10 x after log transformation it was observed that all the parameters were normalized except hco3 and thus it was excluded q mode and r mode hierarchical ca were performed using ibm spss 25 for windows ismail et al 2018 2 4 spatial distribution of the chemical parameters the spatial distribution of the chemical parameters was investigated using the interpolation technique many methods of interpolation are available e g inverse distance weighting idw ordinary kriging ok and nearest neighbor interpolation in the present paper idw was used as it is based on distance weighting it determines cell values using a linear weighted combination set of sample points lepot et al 2017 idw was performed using arcgis software version 10 2 to identify the spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 cation anion balance the accuracy of complete chemical analysis of the groundwater samples in the study area is checked by calculating the cation anion balance using the following formula 2 cation anion balance t c c t c a t c c t c a 100 tcc is the total concentrations in milliequivalent per liter of cations calcium magnesium sodium and potassium tca is the total concentrations in milliequivalent per liter of anions chloride bicarbonate carbonate sulfate and nitrate the cation anion balance should be within the limit of 5 rao et al 2012 the cation anion balance value of this study were within the limit of 5 except for samples 7 12 11 16 6 27 and 19 9 46 3 2 general characteristics of groundwater and its hydrochemistry the results of the groundwater chemical composition are shown in table 1 the ph values of the groundwater in the study area varies between 7 11 and 7 72 with a mean value of 7 33 which indicates a slightly alkaline nature of groundwater in the study area the mean value of ec and tds in the study area were 3153 40 μs cm and 2673 45 mg l with a standard deviation of 2273 43 μs cm and 2556 68 mg l respectively table 1 the study area is characterized by a semi arid climate and thus the relatively high evaporation rate may be responsible for the enrichment of tds and ec similarly ismail et al 2018 have noticed such high concentration in the balad area located north of tarima district and state similar observation the mean value of the cations ca2 mg2 na and k ions in the study area were 183 25 84 6 298 4 and 14 87 mg l with a standard deviation of 171 03 58 78 216 80 and 28 18 mg l respectively ion exchange reaction was investigated using the chloro alkaline indices i e cai1 and cai2 schoeller 1965 the cai1 and cai2 were calculated using the following formulations 3 c a i 1 c l n a k c l 4 c a i 2 c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 n o 3 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter positive values of cai1 and cai2 indicate that na and k ions are exchanged with mg2 and ca2 ions in water negative values of these indices indicate that mg2 and ca2 ions are exchanged with na and k from rocks this indicates a chloro alkaline disequilibrium the schoeller indices values of groundwater samples in tarmia disrtrict showed 12 samples with negative value indicating the chloro alkaline disequilibrium the remaining 8 samples showed negative values indicating a direct base cation anion exchange reaction the mean value of the anions cl so4 2 hco3 and no3 ions in the study area were 390 35 658 35 251 75 and 3 73 mg l with a standard deviation of 286 60 483 57 187 00 and 2 33 mg l respectively carbonate co3 2 concentrations were zero in all groundwater samples table 1 hco3 can be introduced into the water naturally mainly by co2 dissolving carbonate containing minerals or be a result of the combination of co2 with rainwater ismail et al 2018 piper diagram was used to determine the hydrochemical evolution in the groundwater of the study area piper 1944 piper plot were performed using aquachem software version 2014 2 fig 4 it indicates that the groundwater samples are classified into two major water types mixed camgcl and cacl only one sample sample 15 was with nacl type these types suggest the mixing of high salinity water caused by surface water in addition to the great effects of the evaporates dispersed in the aquifer matrix the mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry was investigated using gibbs ratio gibbs 1970 this ratio can be used to explore the functional sources of dissolved chemical constituents gibbs plot is shown in fig 5 it revealed that 75 of the groundwater samples in the region were fallen in the evaporation dominance zone whereas the remaining percent of the samples were fallen in the rock dominance zone this observation suggests that the evaporation process is the major driving force controlling water chemistry hydrogeochemical processes in the study area were investigated using bivariate plots the contribution to silicate and carbonate weathering was assessed by plotting total concentrations of cations tcc versus ca2 mg2 and na k as shown in fig 6 a and b kumar et al 2008 das et al 2016 2017 it was observed that most of the groundwater samples were found to fall along and above the 1 2 line which indicates the dominance of silicate weathering whereas a few samples were fallen below this line show abundance of ca2 and mg2 which could be due to reverse ion exchange and carbonate minerals the same trend was found by das et al 2015 in jorhat district of assam india fig 6c shows the plot of na cl molar ratio versus ec if the na cl ratio is close to 1 this indicates halite dissolution na and cl will be equally released due to the process a ratio of na cl more than one higher na indicates that the silicate weathering is the dominant process a ratio of less than 1 higher cl indicate that the evaporation is the dominant process coupled with reverse ion exchange of na with ca2 das et al 2015 moreover the evaporation can be the dominant process that controlling water chemistry if the na cl ratio does not change with an increase in ec kumar et al 2006 according to fig 6c about 50 of the groundwater samples in the study area had almost fixed na cl ratio with the increase in ec in the present study both evaporation and silicate weathering are almost equally dominant in the study area fig 6d fig 6e shows that there is no relation was observed between k and no3 no3 concentrations were very low compared to k in the study area this indicates that the silicate weathering is the possible source of k while no3 is primarily due to anthropogenic activities das et al 2017 according to fig 6f a positive relationship is shown between cl and no3 this may indicate that both have come from similar origins such as anthropogenic sources fig 7 a shows the ca2 mg2 molar ratio of the groundwater samples in the study area this ratio gives an indication of the presence of calcite and dolomite dissolution kumar et al 2006 a ratio close to one indicates dolomite dissolution while ca2 mg2 ratios from 1 to 2 represent higher calcite dissolution silicate weathering and dissolution is the major process if ca2 mg2 ratio is above 2 it is observed that about 70 of the groundwater samples have ca mg ratio from 1 to 2 indicating that the calcite dissolution is more dominant than silicate weathering in the study area das et al 2016 fig 7b shows the plot of ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 it is clear that slightly more samples lie below the 1 1 line and thus reverse ion exchange was slightly more common in the study area fig 7c shows that ca2 mg2 increase with increasing salinity which could be further evidence of silicate weathering and an indication of ion exchange the plot of ca2 vs hco3 showed that most of the samples lie below the equalline fig 7d this indicates that the carbonate mineral calcite weathering also plays a role in the release of ca2 ions into the waters rather than carbonic acid silicate weathering the plot of so4 2 vs ca shows that there is an excess of so4 2 over ca2 a in the study area fig 7e it also shows that anhydrite or gypsum dissolution is the probable source of ca2 in the study area rather than calcite weathering mgbenu and egbueri 2019 fig 7f shows that the ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 vs cl increase with increasing salinity reddy et al 2010 thus ca2 and mg2 are not added at a much slower rate than hco3 throughout the year silicate weathering is the source of ca in the study area if the opposite had been observed calcite weathering would predominate 3 3 quality of groundwater for drinking the results of the study table 1 were compared with the drinking water standards of world health organization who 2011 and iraqi standards iqs 2009 and presented in table 2 only ph and no3 were within the prescribed limit in all groundwater samples indicating its suitability for drinking purpose other water quality parameters such as tds ca2 mg2 na k cl and so4 2 were exceeding the prescribed limit in about 75 55 35 60 40 50 and 65 of the groundwater samples respectively table 2 the spatial distribution of ions concentration that exceeding the prescribed limit was prepared based on the drinking water standards of who 2011 and iqs 2009 and presented in fig 8 furthermore the quality of groundwater in the study area was also evaluated using the water quality index wqi technique wqi has been extensively used for evaluating the groundwater quality vasanthavigar et al 2010 rajankar et al 2011 nagaraju et al 2016 it includes four major steps measurement of each selected water quality parameter transform the measurement of water quality parameters into a dimensionless number quality rating assignment of weight to each water quality parameter according to its degree of importance for drinking water and finally aggregate the quality rating to obtain the final wqi value using suitable aggregation function the weight has been assigned to each water quality parameter according to nagaraju et al 2016 and presented in table 3 quality rating is computed from the following equation 5 q i 100 c i s where qi is the quality rating ci is the concentration of each water quality parameter mg l and si is the world health organization standard table 2 the final value of wqi is calculated from the following equation 6 w q i i 1 n w i q i the obtained value of wqi is classified according to the following categorization scheme excellent 50 good 50 100 poor 100 200 very poor 200 300 unsuitable 300 the wqi values of the groundwater samples in the study area vary between 23 7 and 391 4 with a mean value of 171 1 sixty percent of the groundwater samples have wqi values more than 100 suggesting that these groundwater are poor for drinking when considering about only their major ion concentrations groundwater samples 1 8 14 17 have wqi values less than 100 indicating excellent water for drinking groundwater samples 3 11 13 20 have wqi range from 50 to 100 indicating good water for drinking 3 4 quality of groundwater for irrigation ec is very important parameters for determining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation it was observed that about 40 of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation in the study area table 4 fifty percent of the samples were ranged from doubtful to permissible for irrigation and only 2 samples were good for irrigation groundwater suitability for irrigation based on ec in the study area is shown in fig 9 the groundwater quality of tarmiah is evaluated for irrigation purposes using us

aquachem software version 2014 2 sar is calculated from the following formula 7 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter it was observed that 65 of the groundwater samples were fallen in the c4s1 c4s2 and c4s3 zone indicating that these groundwater samples are very poor if used for irrigation purpose twenty five percent of the groundwater samples were fallen in the c3s1 zone suggesting that these samples are moderate for irrigation this water can be used for irrigation in almost all types of soils with little danger of exchangeable sodium marghade et al 2012 furthermore only 2 samples 1 and 14 were fallen in the c2s1 zone which indicate good water for irrigation wilcox diagram was also used to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation sodium percentage na has been plotted versus ec wilcox 1955 fig 11 na is calculated from the following formula 8 n a n a k n a k c a 2 m g 2 100 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter it shows that almost 40 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation 25 of the samples are doubtful to unsuitable 15 of the samples are good to permissible 20 of the samples are very good to good na combined with hco3 and co3 2 can lead to the formation of alkaline soils while na combined with cl forms saline soils which affect the growth of plants mh has been proposed by szaboles and darab 1964 and is calculated using the following formula 9 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 where all values are expressed in milliequivalent per liter the results revealed that 80 of the samples have a value of less than 50 indicating the water is suitable for irrigation while the remaining 20 of the samples have a value of more than 50 indicating the water is unsuitable for irrigation table 4 groundwater suitability for irrigation based on mh in the study area is shown in fig 12 the suitability of groundwater in the study area for drinking and irrigation purposes according to previous studied parameters is presented in table 5 3 5 cluster analysis ca the spatial variations among the sampling sites are evaluated using hierarchical ca and shown in fig 13 as a dendrogram it was observed that the groundwater samples were grouped into 2 clusters group 1 and group 2 group 1 represents 25 of the groundwater samples and corresponds to relatively high polluted sites group b was divided into 2 sub groups group 2a and group 2b group 2a represents 35 of the groundwater samples and corresponds to relatively moderate polluted sites group 2b represents 40 of the groundwater samples and corresponds to relatively less polluted sites the sampling sites are being agglomerated into a different level of pollution sites each cluster group contained samples spaced at its location fig 13 this suggests that anthropogenic activities may affect the quality of groundwater in the study area the r mode cluster analysis is shown in fig 14 it is obvious from this figure that all of the groundwater quality parameters can be subdivided into two main groups group 1 is ec tds ca2 cl ph no3 k mg2 and na and another group group 2 includes only so4 2 the presence of two distinct groups suggests that there may be two sets of influences that are affecting groundwater samples in the study area group 1 is most likely the effect of rock water interactions and evaporation so4 2 has grouped alone in group 2 and this may indicate that the so4 2 comes from different sources including anthropogenic activities such as the application of pesticides insecticides and fertilizers in irrigation farming especially the study area is characterized by arable land 4 conclusions in general this study revealed that the under focus area was in serious threat of pollution hydrochemistry of the samples that concluded by piper plot produced two kinds of water that is mixed camgcl and mixed cacl leading to find that high salinity mixing water was produced due to surface water and evaporation according to gibbs ratio 3 from every 4 of the groundwater samples were in the zone of evaporation dominance the other fourth was in the zone of rock dominance it is concluded that the evaporation has an extreme effect on groundwater chemistry sixty percent of the groundwater samples were with positive values of cai1 and cai2 in the reaction of ion exchange this leads to conclude that there is an exchange of na and k ions with mg 2 and ca 2 in water on the contrary the other 40 of samples were with negative values as a result of the exchange reaction of direct base cation anion generally the hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater in the study area is affected by evaporation silicate carbonate weathering and anthropogenic sources the evaporation and silicate weathering have the highest impact on the groundwater quality in the region according to who and iqs standards along with wqi only a quarter of the studied samples were drinkable in light of major ion exchange however further studies are required to evaluate important parameters such as silica and fluoride based on us salinity diagram wilcox diagram and mh six groundwater samples samples 1 3 8 13 14 and 17 can be used for irrigation three different pollution levels were present in hierarchical ca low moderate and high polluted sites in every location spaced samples contained in every cluster group this may be a direct result of anthropogenic action r mode ca showed two groups indicating that the study area is influenced by natural processes evaporation and silicate weathering and anthropogenic sources acknowledgement the authors are greatful to the general commission for groundwater for conducting the analyses in their laboratories and supplying the groundwater data used in this study

potable water for the rural and interior areas of nation authors have developed the spherical basin solar still sbss with external parabolic reflector the sbss and parabolic reflector was fabricated from the galvanized iron g i sheet and anodized aluminum respectively the performance of sbss along with external parabolic reflector was evaluated to study the impact of different mass of water in basin the paper has been organized as section 1 represents the introduction literature review and research gap section 2 presents experimental setup and methodology section 3 presents the thermal analysis of sbss section 4 depicts the result and discussion section 5 presents conclusion of work 2 experimental setup and methodology 2 1 construction and working of sbss as shown in fig 1 sbss consists of lower hemisphere upper hemisphere inner channel and outer channel lower and upper hemisphere of sbss having 3 cm inner diameter was made up of 0 02 cm thick g i sheet the area of the upper and lower hemisphere was 28 27 cm2 external surface of solar still was painted with black colour to absorb the higher amount of incident solar energy the lower hemisphere of sbss acts as storage basin for the saline water receives the reflected radiation from the parabolic reflector and heats the water whereas upper hemisphere of sbss acts as a condenser unit outer channel was placed at the outer surface of sbss at an angle of 5 for the supply the saline water into lower basin a small passage was provided in lower basin at the bottom part of upper channel the function of outer channel was to collect the water sprayed on outer surface of upper hemisphere and supply it into the lower hemisphere through passage provided in sbss inner channel was placed on the inner surface of sbss at an angle of 5 opposite to that of outer channel the function of inner channel was to collect the condensed distilled water from the inner surface of upper hemisphere and supply it to outside of sbss due to gravity further the various identifications were marked at the inner surface of lower hemisphere to maintain the water level inside the lower hemisphere solar radiations reflected from the parabolic reflector had been concentrated at outer surface of lower hemisphere of sbss table 1 shows the specifications of parabolic reflector sk 14 fig 2 a represents the working principle of sbss with parabolic reflector saline water at atmospheric temperature is sprayed on the outer surface of the upper hemisphere which is collected by the outer channel due to the inclination provided to the outer channel collected water flows towards the lower portion of the channel by gravity through the small passage the collected water flows inside the lower basin the spray of saline water on the outer surface of upper hemisphere provides the condensing effect at the inner surface of the upper hemisphere solar radiations reflected by the parabolic reflector and concentrated at the surface of lower hemisphere of sbss thus the brackish water in the lower hemisphere of sbss receives the heat and is evaporated the water vapour gets in contact with inner surface of upper hemisphere where it condensed due to condensing effect provided by spray of saline water at atmospheric temperature on the outer surface of upper hemisphere the condensed distilled water at the inner surface of upper hemisphere is collected by the inner channel and come out due to inclination provided to inner channel by gravity fig 2 b represents the actual experimental setup of sbss along with parabolic reflector 2 2 experimental methodology and instrumentations the sbss was fabricated as per the dimensions mention in section 2 1 to study the effect of mass of saline water on the distillate yield the performance of sbss with parabolic reflector was evaluated at location 20 61 n 72 91 e elevation from mean sea level 17 m from 7 00 h to 19 00 h the experiments were carried out for the different mass such as 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l in lower hemisphere of sbss for the 5 days further aperture of parabolic reflector was oriented eastward during the morning duration whereas westward during the evening duration to receive the maximum solar radiations parabolic reflector was tracked manually on hourly basis solar radiation wind velocity distilled output ambient temperature temperature of the upper hemisphere facing towards sun and parabolic reflector inlet and outlet temperature of water temperature of the lower hemisphere facing towards the sun and parabolic reflector and temperature of water in lower hemisphere were measured on hourly basis the calibrated solar photovoltaic pv cell was utilized to measure the solar radiation solar pv cell having mono crystalline si cell with 4 4 cm2 area that was calibrated with the help of pyranometer the national center for photovoltaic research and education indian institute of technology bombay has supplied the calibrated solar pv cell as shown in fig 3 a solar radiations were recorded by keeping the solar pv cell in short circuiting mode on a horizontal surface fig 3 b shows the calibration curve among the solar cell current amp and solar irradiation on horizontal surface recorded by pyranometer w m2 the solar radiations are calculated as solar radiation w m2 2175 cell current amp am 4201 digital anemometer was utilized for measuring the wind velocity around the experimental setup the distillate yield was measured by the measuring cylinder to measure the temperature of various part pt 100 type temperature sensors with temperature indicator were utilized the quality of brackish water was measured using tds meter in terms of total dissolved solid tds during the experimentation constant quantity of saline water was maintained in the lower basin on hourly basis 3 thermal analysis of sbss thermal analysis of sbss has been presented in this section the assumptions for the analysis are temperature gradient along the thickness of sbss is neglected loss of condensed water and water vapour is negligible heat capacity of still is negligible due to the high convective loss other losses can be neglected 1 total solar radiation on

day 1 l on second day 2 l on third day 3 l on fourth day 4 l and on fifth day 5 l saline water was maintained in the basin of sbss the various parameters mentioned in section 2 2 were recorded on the hourly basis the tds of saline water was 3380 ppm before the distillation whereas tds of 115 ppm was achieved for the distilled water obtained from the still fig 4 a and 4 b fig 4 c and 4 d and fig 4 e represent the hourly variation in atmospheric temperature average water temperature in basin average temperature of lower hemisphere and average temperature of upper hemisphere for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l respectively the average temperature of water in lower hemisphere remains higher compared to the average temperature of upper hemisphere for the various water level thus the upper hemisphere acts as a condensing surface for the evaporated water the solar radiations reflected by the parabolic reflector were concentrated on the surface of lower hemisphere which faces towards the parabolic reflector therefore the variation was observed between the temperature of lower hemisphere facing towards the parabolic reflector and the temperature of lower hemisphere facing towards the sun hence the quite variation was observed in the average temperature of lower hemisphere for the various water mass further the average temperature of sbss depends on wind velocity around the still and the heat loss from the still the maximum temperature of lower hemisphere was achieved during the afternoon hours because of availability of maximum solar radiation the temperature of lower hemisphere facing the parabolic reflector was obtained higher till the afternoon than the temperatures of other part of still whereas during the evening duration temperature of brackish water inside the basin remains higher as the large amount of heat was transferred to the brackish water from the lower hemisphere fig 5 represents the variation in the wind velocity for the five days of experiment the variation in wind velocity was random as it is meteorological parameter the wind velocity was less during the morning hours therefore the lesser heat loss occurred from the sbss which results in higher temperature of sbss whereas after the noon wind velocity was higher that result in higher heat loss from the sbss therefore the temperature of sbss was lower further the solar radiations were lower during the evening hours that also results in lower temperature of sbss fig 6 a fig 6 b and 6 c fig 6 d and 6 e represent the hourly variation in solar radiation and the distillate output achieved from sbss for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water in the basin respectively the maximum hourly distilled output of 0 9551 l m2 1 1284 l m2 1 3371 l m2 1 3194 l m2and 1 3796 l m2 was obtained for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water in the basin respectively the maximum distillate yield was achieved during the peak sunshine hours of 12 00 h or 13 00 h of the day fig 7 represents the comparison of total daily distillate output obtained from the sbss the total daily distillate output of 3 5409 l m2 4 7860 l m2 6 7174 l m2 7 4744 l m2 and 8 2596 l m2 was obtained for 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water in the basin respectively 35 40 89 71 111 09 and 133 26 higher yield was obtained for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water mass in the basin compared to 1 l water mass in the basin respectively thus the maximum total daily distilled output was obtained for the 5 l saline water in the basin from the experiments it has found that the total daily distilled yield increases with the increase in amount of saline water in the basin the reason for getting the lesser distilled yield at the lower saline water mass may be after the reflection from the parabolic reflector solar radiations were concentrated at the lower hemisphere of the still that results in higher temperature further the lesser mass of brackish water in the basin resulted in the lower heat storage capacity thus the heat loss occur from the sbss to the atmosphere was higher compared to the heat delivered to the saline water at lower saline water mass which resulted in lower distilled yield further as the mass of saline water in basin increase heat storage capacity of saline water increases thus the amount of heat delivered to the brackish water in the basin was increased compared to the heat loss from the sbss which results in higher distillate yield from the experiments authors have observed that as the mass of brackish water in the basin increases the total daily distillate yield increase from the sbss fig 8 represents the comparison of efficiency for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l mass of brackish water in the basin of sbss the daily efficiency of 19 56 23 92 30 83 34 49 39 06 was obtained for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l water mass in the basin of sbss thus the increment in efficiency for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l water mass in basin was obtained 22 39 57 62 76 33 and 99 69 compared to 1 l water mass in basin respectively further from the literature it has been found that as the mass of water or depth increase in the basin the distillate yield from the various solar still decreases jani and modi 2019 kabeel et al 2012 modi et al 2018a modi and modi 2019 nafey et al 2000 whereas authors have achieved that as the saline water mass increases from 1 l to 5 l in the basin distillate yield increases for sbss from the experiment authors have obtained the maximum distillate yield and efficiency for the 5 l saline water mass in basin of the sbss with parabolic reflector thus the recommendation of author is that for the given capacity of sbss with parabolic reflector should be utilized with higher mass of saline water in the basin of still the important parameters affecting the performance of sbss are solar radiation wind velocity and surrounding temperature in the experiment higher distillate yield was achieved from the still during the duration of the higher solar radiation thus the range of solar radiation dni should be 1000 w m2 to 1200 w m2 with which the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated to achieve higher distillate yield from still however sbss with parabolic reflector can be operated at lower solar radiation dni with conciliation of distillate yield further the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated with lower wind velocity and the lower temperature difference between the still temperature and surrounding temperature to minimize the losses from the still thus by lowering the loss from still the distillate yield from the still can be increased due to the enhancement of heat transfer from the basin to saline water however the wind velocity and surrounding temperature are the meteorological parameter form the results of experimental location the range for surrounding temperature during the afternoon duration should be 35 c 40 c and the wind velocity should be 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s with which the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated to achieve the higher distillate yield from the still further the end users of developed sbss with parabolic reflector are the peoples living in the interior and arid area of region where the lack of potable water as well as the small scale industries which requires the fresh water for the operation 5 uncertainty and economic analysis 5 1 uncertainty analysis error can be expressed as the difference between the measured value and true value of parameter errors can be classified as 1 systematic error and 2 random error when the experiments are conducted with uniform conditions then the random errors are occurred but systematic errors remains unaltered the range of probabilistic values of physical parameter within which the real value of physical parameter lies is presented as uncertainty the standard uncertainty u can be calculated as kirkup and frenkel 2006 lira 2002 and shown in table 2 10 u a 3 where a accuracy of the instrument 5 2 economic analysis the total expense occurred in manufacturing the sbss along with parabolic reflector has been presented in table 3 the expense includes the cost of sbss cost of parabolic reflector and miscellaneous expense a payback period for the sbss can be calculated as mention below considering the cost of distilled water bottle is 20 per liter rate as per the indian market the total daily water distilled obtained was 2 335 l day 11 payback period capital cost cash flow 8500 20 2 335 182 days if an average yearly sunny days for the location 20 61 n 72 91 e is 250 days then the payback duration is 182 250 0 728 year 8 736 months 6 conclusion authors have developed and fabricated the sbss with parabolic reflector to study the influence of mass of brackish water in the basin the performance of sbss along with parabolic reflector was evaluated for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water mass in basin at location 20 61 n 72 91 e the daily distilled output of 3 5409 l m2 4 7860 l m2 6 7174 l m2 7 4744 l m2 and 8 2596 l m2 was obtained for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water mass in the basin respectively thus 35 40 89 71 111 09 and 133 26 higher yield was obtained for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l mass of brackish water in basin than the 1 l mass of brackish water in basin respectively the daily efficiency of sbss along with parabolic reflector was obtained 19 56 23 92 30 83 34 49 39 06 for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l saline water mass in basin thus the increment in efficiency for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l water mass in basin was obtained 22 39 57 62 76 33 and 99 69 compared to 1 l water mass in basin from the experimental results it has found that the distilled yield of the sbss along with parabolic reflector increases with the increase in mass of brackish water from 1 l to 5 l in basin the trend of increasing the distilled output with the increase in water mass may be due to reduction in heat losses from the system at higher water mass and increased heat absorption from the results obtained from the experiment to obtain the higher distillate yield the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated at higher solar radiation dni with

supply has no longer match the demands of these developments goh et al 2016 the earth s surface is covered by 70 of water 98 of that is in form of brackish water and 2 is in form of drinking water out of that 90 is ingrained in the glaciers sheikholeslami 2009 according to report of un nearly 7000 million people of 60 nations will face the shortage of water by 2050 under the lowest projection nearly 2000 million people in 48 nations will struggle for the water in 2050 united nations 2000 according to report of who 78 and 96 of countryside and urban populations had access of potable water on a global scale in the year 2006 respectively also mentioned that the potable water will unavailable to each human in 21st century therefore it is necessary to take action towards the supply of drinking water to everyone madhlopa 2009 the report of unicef and who joint monitoring program on progress on drinking water and sanitation 2012 for sanitation and water supply has mentioned that the drinking water has reached to nearly 89 population of world until 2010 as per the report the pure drinking water will reach to nearly 92 population of world by the 2015 therefore still around nearly 8 population of world is without access to potable water world health organization media centre 2012 millennium development goal mdg drinking water target met news releases geneva new york n d however according to the report of who 2017 2 1 billion people in world do not have access to safely managed water and 0 844 billion people do not have basic service for potable water 0 159 billion people consumes untreated surface water from resources such as irrigation channels rivers lakes and streams out of 0 159 billion people 0 150 billion peoples reside in rural areas joint monitoring programme jmp report 2017 thus an urge to transform the saline water into drinking water to supply the potable water to everyone the various techniques such as solar distillation electrodialysis vapour compression and reverse osmosis etc are utilized to get the drinking water from brackish water garg et al 1987 among the various techniques solar distillation is the simplest and feasible option for the desert areas coastal regions and remote locations as per the history of water desalination people have used the solar energy to obtain the drinking water from the seawater as per the narration given by the aristotle solar desalination was invented prior to the fourth century b c kalogirou 2009 the first recorded use of solar distillation is that of by the arab alchemists in 1551 and described by mouchot 1869 conventional solar still css has a lower distilled output therefore various researchers are attempting to increase the productivity of css the study on various configurations

and design parameters using two mathematical models they have studied the influence of water depth on the productivity of upper and lower basin of solar still using mathematical modelling with the optimum design parameter the daily output of 4 15 kg m2 and 6 kg m2 was obtained from single and double effect solar still respectively tarawneh and muafag 2007 have conducted an experiment on solar still with four different depth of water 5 mm 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm without cooling and with cooling of glass covers with the cooling of glass cover the productivity was increased by 23 and 19 for 0 5 cm and 4 cm water depth in basin respectively omara et al 2014 has utilized external and internal reflectors in stepped solar still and found that the productivity was enhanced by 125 omara et al 2014 have compared the performance of stepped solar still without and with internal reflector and found productivity increased by 75 and 57 compared to the css omara et al 2017 have reviewed the performance of solar still with reflector and concluded that the use of reflector enhances the performance of still tanaka and nakatake 2009a have theoretically analyzed the performance of a tilted

tanaka 2011 has theoretically obtained 13 higher distillate yield with the flat plate bottom reflector compared to conventional tilted wick estahbanati et al karimi estahbanati et al 2016 have experimentally and theoretically investigated the influence of internal reflectors on the performance of css they concluded that the efficiency of still enhanced by 18 with the front and side

reflector on side front and back wall of still chaouchi et al 2007 have designed and fabricated the small scale desalination unit with paraboloid concentrator they have theoretically and experimentally investigated the performance of unit in terms of distillate yield and absorber plate temperature gorjian et al 2014 have fabricated the stand alone point focus parabolic solar still the unit consists of a parabolic dish concentrator two axis sun tracker with programmable logic controllers and the two plate heat exchangers to preheat the saline water before entering the absorber situated at the focal point for the unit authors have obtained the yield of 5 12 kg in 7 h per day efficiency of 36 7 and highest hourly yield of 1 5 kg h dhiman 1988 has carried out a transient analysis for the spherical solar still and css and found that the spherical solar still gives 30 higher efficiency than the css jayaprakash et al 2009 have studied the effect of thickness of low density polyethylene ldpe cover on the performance of spherical solar still under the climate of coimbatore 11 n latitude authors have covered the spherical solar still with 0 176 mm and 0 107 mm thick ldpe they have found that the productivity is higher for lower thickness cover and the maximum efficiency obtained for the system was 22 karroute and chaker 2014 have studied the effect of spherical geometry on the heat transfer in solar still they observed that the spherical geometry has advantage of a larger condensation surface and can be put in any direction to catch maximum solar energy theoretical analysis was also carried out and found that the spherical geometry ameliorate yield by 32 47 for the same climate conditions due to the cooling on one side of glass cover under shadow internal and external reflectors were utilized to increase the distillate yield of css in literature further the theoretical studies were conducted to study the performance of spherical geometry solar still and compared with the performance of css authors have also noted that the spherical geometry solar still delivers a higher yield compared to css with the aim of providing the potable water for the rural and interior areas of nation authors have developed the spherical basin solar still sbss with external parabolic reflector the sbss and parabolic reflector was fabricated from the galvanized iron g i sheet and anodized aluminum respectively the performance of sbss along with external parabolic reflector was evaluated to study the impact of different mass of water in basin the paper has been organized as section 1 represents the introduction literature review and research gap section 2 presents experimental setup and methodology section 3 presents the thermal analysis of sbss section 4 depicts the result and discussion section 5 presents conclusion of work 2 experimental setup and methodology 2 1 construction and working of sbss as shown in fig 1 sbss consists of lower hemisphere upper hemisphere inner channel and outer channel lower and upper hemisphere of sbss having 3 cm inner diameter was made up of 0 02 cm thick g i sheet the area of the upper and lower hemisphere was 28 27 cm2 external surface of solar still was painted with black colour to absorb the higher amount of incident solar energy the lower hemisphere of sbss acts as storage basin for the saline water receives the reflected radiation from the parabolic reflector and heats the water whereas upper hemisphere of sbss acts as a condenser unit outer channel was placed at the outer surface of sbss at an angle of 5 for the supply the saline water into lower basin a small passage was provided in lower basin at the bottom part of upper channel the function of outer channel was to collect the water sprayed on outer surface of upper hemisphere and supply it into the lower hemisphere through passage provided in sbss inner channel was placed on the inner surface of sbss at an angle of 5 opposite to that of outer channel the function of inner channel was to collect the condensed distilled water from the inner surface of upper hemisphere and supply it to outside of sbss due to gravity further the various identifications were marked at the inner surface of lower hemisphere to maintain the water level inside the lower hemisphere solar radiations reflected from the parabolic reflector had been concentrated at outer surface of lower hemisphere of sbss table 1 shows the specifications of parabolic reflector sk 14 fig 2 a represents the working principle of sbss with parabolic reflector saline water at atmospheric temperature is sprayed on the outer surface of the upper hemisphere which is collected by the outer channel due to the inclination provided to the outer channel collected water flows towards the lower portion of the channel by gravity through the small passage the collected water flows inside the lower basin the spray of saline water on the outer surface of upper hemisphere provides the condensing effect at the inner surface of the upper hemisphere solar radiations reflected by the parabolic reflector and concentrated at the surface of lower hemisphere of sbss thus the brackish water in the lower hemisphere of sbss receives the heat and is evaporated the water vapour gets in contact with inner surface of upper hemisphere where it condensed due to condensing effect provided by spray of saline water at atmospheric temperature on the outer surface of upper hemisphere the condensed distilled water at the inner surface of upper hemisphere is collected by the inner channel and come out due to inclination provided to inner channel by gravity fig 2 b represents the actual experimental setup of sbss along with parabolic reflector 2 2 experimental methodology and instrumentations the sbss was fabricated as per the dimensions mention in section 2 1 to study the effect of mass of saline water on the distillate yield the performance of sbss with parabolic reflector was evaluated at location 20 61 n 72 91 e elevation from mean sea level 17 m from 7 00 h to 19 00 h the experiments were carried out for the different mass such as 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l in lower hemisphere of sbss for the 5 days further aperture of parabolic reflector was oriented eastward during the morning duration whereas westward during the evening duration to receive the maximum solar radiations parabolic reflector was tracked manually on hourly basis solar radiation wind velocity distilled output ambient temperature temperature of the upper hemisphere facing towards sun and parabolic reflector inlet and outlet temperature of water temperature of the lower hemisphere facing towards the sun and parabolic reflector and temperature of water in lower hemisphere were measured on hourly basis the calibrated solar photovoltaic pv cell was utilized to measure the solar radiation solar pv cell having mono crystalline si cell with 4 4 cm2 area that was calibrated with the help of pyranometer the national center for photovoltaic research and education indian institute of technology bombay has supplied the calibrated solar pv cell as shown in fig 3 a solar radiations were recorded by keeping the solar pv cell in short circuiting mode on a horizontal surface fig 3 b shows the calibration curve among the solar cell current amp and solar irradiation on horizontal surface recorded by pyranometer w m2 the solar radiations are calculated as solar radiation w m2 2175 cell current amp am 4201 digital anemometer was utilized for measuring the wind velocity around the experimental setup the distillate yield was measured by the measuring cylinder to measure the temperature of various part pt 100 type temperature sensors with temperature indicator were utilized the quality of brackish water was measured using tds meter in terms of total dissolved solid tds during the experimentation constant quantity of saline water was maintained in the lower basin on hourly basis 3 thermal analysis of sbss thermal analysis of sbss has been presented in this section the assumptions for the analysis are temperature gradient along the thickness of sbss is neglected loss of condensed water and water vapour is negligible heat capacity of still is negligible due to the high convective loss other losses can be neglected 1 total solar radiation on

day 1 l on second day 2 l on third day 3 l on fourth day 4 l and on fifth day 5 l saline water was maintained in the basin of sbss the various parameters mentioned in section 2 2 were recorded on the hourly basis the tds of saline water was 3380 ppm before the distillation whereas tds of 115 ppm was achieved for the distilled water obtained from the still fig 4 a and 4 b fig 4 c and 4 d and fig 4 e represent the hourly variation in atmospheric temperature average water temperature in basin average temperature of lower hemisphere and average temperature of upper hemisphere for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l respectively the average temperature of water in lower hemisphere remains higher compared to the average temperature of upper hemisphere for the various water level thus the upper hemisphere acts as a condensing surface for the evaporated water the solar radiations reflected by the parabolic reflector were concentrated on the surface of lower hemisphere which faces towards the parabolic reflector therefore the variation was observed between the temperature of lower hemisphere facing towards the parabolic reflector and the temperature of lower hemisphere facing towards the sun hence the quite variation was observed in the average temperature of lower hemisphere for the various water mass further the average temperature of sbss depends on wind velocity around the still and the heat loss from the still the maximum temperature of lower hemisphere was achieved during the afternoon hours because of availability of maximum solar radiation the temperature of lower hemisphere facing the parabolic reflector was obtained higher till the afternoon than the temperatures of other part of still whereas during the evening duration temperature of brackish water inside the basin remains higher as the large amount of heat was transferred to the brackish water from the lower hemisphere fig 5 represents the variation in the wind velocity for the five days of experiment the variation in wind velocity was random as it is meteorological parameter the wind velocity was less during the morning hours therefore the lesser heat loss occurred from the sbss which results in higher temperature of sbss whereas after the noon wind velocity was higher that result in higher heat loss from the sbss therefore the temperature of sbss was lower further the solar radiations were lower during the evening hours that also results in lower temperature of sbss fig 6 a fig 6 b and 6 c fig 6 d and 6 e represent the hourly variation in solar radiation and the distillate output achieved from sbss for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water in the basin respectively the maximum hourly distilled output of 0 9551 l m2 1 1284 l m2 1 3371 l m2 1 3194 l m2and 1 3796 l m2 was obtained for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water in the basin respectively the maximum distillate yield was achieved during the peak sunshine hours of 12 00 h or 13 00 h of the day fig 7 represents the comparison of total daily distillate output obtained from the sbss the total daily distillate output of 3 5409 l m2 4 7860 l m2 6 7174 l m2 7 4744 l m2 and 8 2596 l m2 was obtained for 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water in the basin respectively 35 40 89 71 111 09 and 133 26 higher yield was obtained for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water mass in the basin compared to 1 l water mass in the basin respectively thus the maximum total daily distilled output was obtained for the 5 l saline water in the basin from the experiments it has found that the total daily distilled yield increases with the increase in amount of saline water in the basin the reason for getting the lesser distilled yield at the lower saline water mass may be after the reflection from the parabolic reflector solar radiations were concentrated at the lower hemisphere of the still that results in higher temperature further the lesser mass of brackish water in the basin resulted in the lower heat storage capacity thus the heat loss occur from the sbss to the atmosphere was higher compared to the heat delivered to the saline water at lower saline water mass which resulted in lower distilled yield further as the mass of saline water in basin increase heat storage capacity of saline water increases thus the amount of heat delivered to the brackish water in the basin was increased compared to the heat loss from the sbss which results in higher distillate yield from the experiments authors have observed that as the mass of brackish water in the basin increases the total daily distillate yield increase from the sbss fig 8 represents the comparison of efficiency for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l mass of brackish water in the basin of sbss the daily efficiency of 19 56 23 92 30 83 34 49 39 06 was obtained for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l water mass in the basin of sbss thus the increment in efficiency for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l water mass in basin was obtained 22 39 57 62 76 33 and 99 69 compared to 1 l water mass in basin respectively further from the literature it has been found that as the mass of water or depth increase in the basin the distillate yield from the various solar still decreases jani and modi 2019 kabeel et al 2012 modi et al 2018a modi and modi 2019 nafey et al 2000 whereas authors have achieved that as the saline water mass increases from 1 l to 5 l in the basin distillate yield increases for sbss from the experiment authors have obtained the maximum distillate yield and efficiency for the 5 l saline water mass in basin of the sbss with parabolic reflector thus the recommendation of author is that for the given capacity of sbss with parabolic reflector should be utilized with higher mass of saline water in the basin of still the important parameters affecting the performance of sbss are solar radiation wind velocity and surrounding temperature in the experiment higher distillate yield was achieved from the still during the duration of the higher solar radiation thus the range of solar radiation dni should be 1000 w m2 to 1200 w m2 with which the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated to achieve higher distillate yield from still however sbss with parabolic reflector can be operated at lower solar radiation dni with conciliation of distillate yield further the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated with lower wind velocity and the lower temperature difference between the still temperature and surrounding temperature to minimize the losses from the still thus by lowering the loss from still the distillate yield from the still can be increased due to the enhancement of heat transfer from the basin to saline water however the wind velocity and surrounding temperature are the meteorological parameter form the results of experimental location the range for surrounding temperature during the afternoon duration should be 35 c 40 c and the wind velocity should be 0 5 m s to 1 5 m s with which the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated to achieve the higher distillate yield from the still further the end users of developed sbss with parabolic reflector are the peoples living in the interior and arid area of region where the lack of potable water as well as the small scale industries which requires the fresh water for the operation 5 uncertainty and economic analysis 5 1 uncertainty analysis error can be expressed as the difference between the measured value and true value of parameter errors can be classified as 1 systematic error and 2 random error when the experiments are conducted with uniform conditions then the random errors are occurred but systematic errors remains unaltered the range of probabilistic values of physical parameter within which the real value of physical parameter lies is presented as uncertainty the standard uncertainty u can be calculated as kirkup and frenkel 2006 lira 2002 and shown in table 2 10 u a 3 where a accuracy of the instrument 5 2 economic analysis the total expense occurred in manufacturing the sbss along with parabolic reflector has been presented in table 3 the expense includes the cost of sbss cost of parabolic reflector and miscellaneous expense a payback period for the sbss can be calculated as mention below considering the cost of distilled water bottle is 20 per liter rate as per the indian market the total daily water distilled obtained was 2 335 l day 11 payback period capital cost cash flow 8500 20 2 335 182 days if an average yearly sunny days for the location 20 61 n 72 91 e is 250 days then the payback duration is 182 250 0 728 year 8 736 months 6 conclusion authors have developed and fabricated the sbss with parabolic reflector to study the influence of mass of brackish water in the basin the performance of sbss along with parabolic reflector was evaluated for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water mass in basin at location 20 61 n 72 91 e the daily distilled output of 3 5409 l m2 4 7860 l m2 6 7174 l m2 7 4744 l m2 and 8 2596 l m2 was obtained for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l saline water mass in the basin respectively thus 35 40 89 71 111 09 and 133 26 higher yield was obtained for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l mass of brackish water in basin than the 1 l mass of brackish water in basin respectively the daily efficiency of sbss along with parabolic reflector was obtained 19 56 23 92 30 83 34 49 39 06 for the 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l saline water mass in basin thus the increment in efficiency for the 2 l 3 l 4 l and 5 l water mass in basin was obtained 22 39 57 62 76 33 and 99 69 compared to 1 l water mass in basin from the experimental results it has found that the distilled yield of the sbss along with parabolic reflector increases with the increase in mass of brackish water from 1 l to 5 l in basin the trend of increasing the distilled output with the increase in water mass may be due to reduction in heat losses from the system at higher water mass and increased heat absorption from the results obtained from the experiment to obtain the higher distillate yield the sbss with parabolic reflector should be operated at higher solar radiation dni with

12133,groundwater is a valued resource of limited extent both in quantity and in space in order to ensure its sustainable use appropriate evaluation of its availability is required this study aimed at solving groundwater problem fraught with uncertainty by considering recharge as uncertain input parameter the developed groundwater flow model was later calibrated using automatic calibration software pest within modflow environment head values from groundwater level measurement data were used as calibration targets the calibration resulted in normalised residual mean square nrms value of 1 828 mean error me of 0 999 m mean absolute error mae of 6 701 m root mean square error rmse of 8 499 m and correlation coefficient cor of 0 997 the field monitoring borehole dataset of 2011 was used to validate the model the validated model resulted in a root mean square error rmse of 8 601 m and nrms value of 1 85 which compares very well with the nrms value of the calibrated model whose value was 1 828 all set criteria were within acceptable limits for both calibrated and validated model thereafter stochastic uncertainty analyses were performed by randomly sampling recharge realization and running a series of monte carlo mc simulations ranging from 50 to a maximum of 1000 realization of recharge fields stochastic model results were compared to those of deterministic model groundwater potential results were compared for both deterministic and stochastic scenarios deterministic scenario resulted in groundwater potential value of 1122 92 mm3 year while stochastic scenario resulted in a value of 1137 61 mm3 year an increase of 14 7 mm3 year this implies that there is potential for more groundwater exploitation in the study area thus the developed stochastic model can be used as a decision support system dss for water resource management graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater flow model limpopo modelling modflow recharge uncertain 1 introduction groundwater has emerged as an extremely essential water resource and its increasing demand in agriculture domestic and industrial uses ranks it as a resource of strategic importance groundwater resources are dynamic in nature and affected by factors like growth of irrigation activities industrialization as well as urbanization for this reason monitoring and conserving this important resource is essential ketata et al 2011 moreover due to increasing population worldwide emphasis is put on this water resource owing to its threat of overexploitation and hence the need for sound groundwater management strategies this in turn requires a full consideration of groundwater in terms of sustainability of the resource stadler et al 2010 however long term availability of groundwater supplies for increasing populations can only be ensured if effective management schemes are developed and put into practice healey 2010 south africa s overall water consumption trend indicates that groundwater contributes only 15 of the total volume consumed dwaf 2002 however due to lack of perennial streams in the semi desert to desert parts two thirds of south africa s surface area is largely dependent on groundwater the total estimated volume of available groundwater resources in south africa is in the order of 10343 million m3 yr dwa 2010b however only about 4000 million m3 yr is being used this means that there is potential to considerably increase groundwater supplies in south africa assessment of groundwater involves numerous factors of which recharge is paramount for this reason determination of groundwater recharge has shifted from a basic problem to a vital and important issue in hydrogeological research for sustainable development of groundwater stoll 2012 this is because groundwater recharge estimation constitutes a primary step for most approaches used to evaluate and sustainably manage groundwater resources moreover with the increasing computation power and the wide accessibility of computers groundwater modelling has become a standard tool for modelling groundwater flow at present numerical modelling technology has become an essential method on groundwater research different numerical software have been developed based on different mathematical formulations and have been used widely such as finite element subsurface flow system feflow diersch 2009 visual modular three dimensional flow visual modflow visual modflow 2000 and processing modflow for window pmwin chiang 2005 of all these modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 has been used as a calculation program generally because of its simplicity modular program structure and separate package to resolve special hydrogeological problems khadri and pande 2016 in this study modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 was selected for modelling process because of the following reasons i modflow is widely used for groundwater flow in the area of hydrogeology ii it has been broadly tested successfully in various environments under different conditions and iii the model can simulate recharge discharge different flows and pollution transport more details of the model can be found in harbaugh et al 2000 it is worth noting that majority of numerical models still provide only deterministic predictions with no supplementary information on uncertainty predictions uncertainties in groundwater system may be attributed to lack of perfect knowledge about the aquifer intrinsic variability of system parameters both in space and time errors in historical data used to model the groundwater system incapacity to accurately predict future events such as water demand and other factors like economic factors of projects ndambuki 2001 the existence of uncertainties limits our ability to predict system behaviour with definitiveness under various decisions in literature several methodologies to account for uncertainties arising from inputs forcing data parameters and the definition of alternative conceptual models have been proposed beven and binley 1992 neuman 2003 poeter and anderson 2005 bredehoeft 2003 neuman 2003 as well as neuman and wierenga 2003 suggested that uncertainties in groundwater model predictions are largely dominated by uncertainty arising from conceptual models and that parametric uncertainty solely does not allow compensating for conceptual model uncertainty moreover rojas et al 2010 asserts that different external factors such as climatic conditions and groundwater abstraction policies increase the uncertainty in groundwater model predictions due to unknown future conditions in regard to uncertainties deterministic methods assume that all the input data are known without error this assumption is illogical since usually only a few set of data are available to define the current situation of the system with certainty ndambuki 2001 in this regard stochastic groundwater management that aims at treating uncertainty within decision oriented models in a logical and systematic manner which cannot be experienced in deterministic modelling approach is appropriate in stochastic groundwater problems monte carlo method is the most commonly used approach that solves problems with uncertain parameters this is due to the fact that the method is capable of working with many classes of uncertain parameters ndambuki 2001 according to neuman and wierenga 2003 this method is popular because it is straight forward and to some extent nonlinear however cooley 1997 has shown that for highly nonlinear models this type of monte carlo based presumption on predictions can be highly inaccurate and that a monte carlo based confidence interval can be as inaccurate as the linearized confidence interval beven 2008 visual claimed monte carlo mc simulation as an extremely flexible and robust sampling based method which is extensively used for uncertain problems in hydrological applications the uncertain parameters in the method are portrayed by probability distributions and in the situation of lack of enough information model parameters are assumed independent in the process random values of each of the uncertain parameters are generated according to their respective probability distributions and the model is run using each random sample in so doing samples of model outputs are generated giving statistics e g mean standard deviation skewness and estimated probability distribution of the model output can be determined pechlivanidis et al 2011 on the other hand mc method has its disadvantage in that a huge number of parameters are frequently required to consistently represent all probable results particularly when there are a number of random variables in as far as the current study is concerned the available reports dealing with estimation of recharge and development of groundwater flow models are deterministic in nature and do not take into account uncertainty factor these studies include wsm leshika consulting 2013 dwa 2010a naledzi waterworks 2016 shamuyarira 2017 barratt 2018 du toit et al 2012 as well as holland 2011 therefore this study aimed at using stochastic approach for groundwater flow modelling considering recharge as uncertain parameter 1 1 study area description the study area is situated in central limpopo south africa and covers an area of about 19188 km2 of the limpopo province fig 1 a shows the location of study area and nine demarcated districts which forms part of the study area the study area falls under limpopo water management area wma as reported by dwaf 2003 the mean annual precipitation map is in the range of 200 800 mm over most of the limpopo wma rainfall in the soutpansberg watershed ranges between 800 and 1200 mm per annum in this particular study the study area is defined as semi arid subtropical the summer s average temperature varies from 32 2 c to 27 3 c and winter temperature varies from 9 2 c to 4 3 c the mean annual rainfall of the study rainfall varies from 475 mm in the south east to 205 mm in the northern portions with mean of 453 mm as recorded at five stations found in the area fig 1b and c shows the distribution of five rainfall stations in the study area 1 1 1 geology and lithology of the study area the limpopo water management area lies beneath extensive diversity of different lithologies the northern side is dominated by faulted karoo strata with soutpansberg mountains consisting of soutpansberg group of rocks the south west side is dominated by large east west faults of waterberg group strata the south central part is underlain by basement gneisses i e the houtriver and goudplaats gneisses intruded by younger granite plutons i e the matlala and mashashane granites the six major lithostrata found in the study area are goudplaats hout river gneiss which covers about 12088 2 km2 48 7 of total area followed by letaba covering an area of 2705 5 km2 10 9 matlabas of 1635 3 km2 6 6 pietersburg of 913 0 km2 3 7 and malala drift gneiss of 866 9 km2 3 5 fig 2 a shows the summarized geology and lithology of the study area 1 1 2 surface hydrology and log test data the main river found in the study area is sand river the river flows from south of polokwane to the north through the soutpansberg mountain range inflowing into limpopo river dwaf 2003 the main tributaries of sand river are hout and brak rivers fig 2b shows the rivers found in the study area other surface hydrology found in study area includes dams namely glen alpine gert combrink chuniespoort and molepo dam log test data of 2000 2010 year acquired from groundwater resource information project grip limpopo and vsa leboa consulting pty ltd indicated that the area is generalized by regional confined aquifer under natural conditions groundwater drains through localized springs via fractures to the perennial tributaries from the soutpansberg rocks found in study area groundwater depth ranges from 23 to 291 m 1 1 3 soil of the study area the study area is composed of clay sandy clay loam and sandy loam soils as shown in fig 2c the percentage of the type of soil from the study area was 0 07 clay 79 7 sandy loam and 20 23 of sandy clay loam most parts of the study area are covered by sandy loam 19785 2 km2 followed by sandy clay loam 5030 6 km2 and clay 18 2 km2 this implies that the soil in the study area promotes recharge 1 1 4 land use cover of the study area the land use landcover lulc of the area provides essential indications of the extent of groundwater requirements and utilization groundwater recharge strongly depends on landuse cover of the study area bare land was found to be the dominant type of land use classified which covers about 31 4 of the total study area followed by build up areas with 16 0 while the least classified was dams which accounts for 0 2 during the classification among the water body classified were rivers sand river brak seepebana and houtriver and dams seshego chuenespoort nkumidamme and houtriver dam due to high percentage of agriculture land classified 21 2 it was assumed that infiltration percolates the aquifers through irrigation hence increases water storage in aquifers moreover the presence of water bodies in the study area could lead to loss of water through evaporation and discharge to aquifers fig 2d represent the landuse lover distribution of the study area 2 methodology the methodology followed will be presented in two sections as follows i methodology for the development of groundwater flow model using modflow and ii methodology for the development of stochastic model considering recharge as uncertain parameter 2 1 development of a distributed groundwater flow model of the study area the development of groundwater flow model was done through visual modflow 2000 software the model development consisted of a set of assumptions that simplified the real problem and came up with a conceptual model that was suitable in view of the objective of the modelling the aquifers within the model domain were complex and significantly difficult to define thus during the modelling process the weathered and fractured dolerite and the limestone units were combined to form a single aquifer system in order to accommodate the complexity of the real hydrogeological system some basic assumptions about the study area based on well log data were made as follows i the system was considered to be in a steady state throughout the year as we did not have enough groundwater level data to model the system dynamically ii the geological formations of concern were considered horizontal in extent thus groundwater flow direction was assumed essentially horizontal moreover the groundwater flow model was constructed for the computation of hydraulic head distribution thus minor variation is observed groundwater level in the study area indicates that hydraulic gradient do not change significantly with time hence the groundwater flow model was assumed to be under steady state condition hani et al 2007 2 1 1 model setup the aquifer model was discretized into 117 columns and 164 rows with grid cell size was 1000 m in both x and y directions site map of the study area processed in arcgis 10 5 1 was used to set boundaries of the model domain fig 2e a single model of confined aquifer layer of 60 m thickness was used to simulate flow of the study area 2 1 2 model inputs to set up the model three inputs packages were used in modflow including pumping and observation wells model properties and model boundary conditions pumping wells data was used to generate water levels during aquifer pumping with a total of 203 boreholes being captured in the model data processing was done through arcgis using extraction and clipping on geoprocessing tool and later imported in modflow through the import tool thirty observation wells were added in the model for the purpose of model calibration the choice of observation wells was based on i recent data availability ii completeness of the data and iii spatial distribution of the wells fig 3 a shows a flow chart of inputs and methodology followed in the model development important parameters that dictate the flow of water in aquifer includes hydraulic conductivity transmissivity initial head and storage the aquifer parameters data was obtained from well log data since the groundwater flow model was single layered only horizontal hydraulic conductivities were significant hydraulic conductivity was obtained from pumping test data it varies between 3 568 10 3 to 30 78 m d it was assigned in five distinct zones based on their geological formation and point hydraulic conductivities the storage coefficients and porosity values were according to the literature defined based on the aquifer type and soil lithology respectively due to presence of fracture faults heterogeneity and compartments nature of the study area hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer varied significantly moreover three types of boundary conditions were incorporated in this study which included constant head river and recharge the constant head was used to fix the head values thus acting as an infinite source of water entering the system or as infinite sink for water leaving the system a constant head boundary was assigned in the east and west where the groundwater levels along the boundary are assigned according to the data from a contour map of groundwater level for the year 2010 dirichlet boundary conditions fixed boundary condition were allocated within a minimum distance of 2 km from the closest pumping wells to this boundary condition a boundary located at a distance of 2 km will ensure that effect of pumping from the nearest well will not be felt at such a distance water bodies were modelled under specified head boundary condition since the aquifer is in direct contact with these surface water bodies the study area recharge polygon shape file map was imported in modflow under boundaries 2 1 3 pumping wells data the borehole abstraction data of pumping wells was obtained from groundwater resource information project grip limpopo database fig 3b shows the pumping wells distribution and their abstraction rates most wells in the study area have pumping rates of between 127 9 and 5 2 m3 d with a few having pumping rates of between 127 9 and 345 6 m3 d the rest have high pumping rates of between 846 72 and 2719 01 m3 d this yields can most probably be ascribed to a the possibility that these drainage paths follow subsurface geological structures b increased recharge is associated with surface drainage features and or c the presence of an alluvial aquifer or thicker weathered zone in these areas 2 1 4 model calibration and validation the objective of model performance assessment was to quantify how well numerical model simulates the physical system and to identify discrepancies in the model if any the calibration was performed using automatic calibration pest the parameter estimation model developed by doherty 2004 in order to assess the performance of the calibrated model the scatter diagrams mass balance flow direction together with the coefficient of determination were used to determine general agreement between predictions and observations the typical assessment methods of mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse were used to quantify the calibrated model error adopted from anderson and woessner 1992 and tsou et al 2006 normalised root mean square nrms error was adopted from coelho et al 2017 the me presenting the mean differences between observed heads and calculated head is shown in equation 1 1 me 1 n i 1 n h m h s i the mean absolute error mae refers to the mean of the absolute value of differences in observed heads and calculated heads equation 2 2 mae 1 n i 1 n h m h s i the root mean square error rmse is given by equation 3 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n h m h s i 2 0 5 equations 1 3 are adopted from anderson and woessner 1992 in equations 1 3 n is the number of observations hs the simulated head at well i l and hm is the measured head at well i l these equations were used to evaluate the calibrated model normalised root mean square nrms error adopted from coelho et al 2017 equation 4 is a representative measure of the fit than the standard rmse as it accounts for the scale of the potential range of data values 4 n r m s r m s x o b s m a x x o b s m i n where rms is a root mean square xobs max is maximum value of observed results xobs min is minimum value of observed results in this study the performance criteria was set in such a way that for rmse the collective effect should not be more than 10 m difference between the observed and calculated heads tsou et al 2006 and normalised root mean square nrms error should be less or equal to 10 coelho et al 2017 other studies that used these criteria s include loudyi 2005 as well as surinaidu et al 2014 model validation was performed using observed hydraulic head data for the year 2011 this year was selected because it had enough data which was required for validation process the output of the validation model simulated heads was compared with the observed heads and evaluated using the same performance measures explained above additionally movement of groundwater through aquifer system was evaluated through water balance calculations the fundamental principle for water balance is that sum of inputs less sum of outputs equals change in storage of the aquifer system the principle can be summarized by equation 5 as 5 δ s qin qout r eg qabs where δs is change in groundwater storage r is groundwater recharge from rainfall eg is loss to atmosphere through evaporation qin represent groundwater inflow from outside the system boundary qout is groundwater outflow from the system boundary and discharge to surface water bodies and qabs is groundwater abstraction through pumping wells 2 1 5 discussion of results the development of a distributed groundwater flow model for the study area aimed at providing information on the groundwater aquifer system as well as the water budget associated with it it also helped in understanding the behaviour of the groundwater system in response to stress due to groundwater abstractions the developed model can be used for management of groundwater through scenarios analysis which will aid in decision making 2 1 5 1 calibration results calibration of the models includes the refinement of initial input data with comparison of the calculated data from the model for this study hydraulics heads from groundwater level measurement data were used as comparable calibration values the target was to compare the hydraulic heads observed from site with simulated heads a total of 30 observation wells from groundwater resource information project grip database were selected for the calibration of the model calibration process was performed in five zones of hydraulic conductivities taking into consideration hydraulic conductivity as the parameter of interest initial and calibrated results are shown in table 1 a while the statistics of calibrated model is shown in table 1 b calibrated groundwater flow model yielded acceptable calibration statistics in line with targeted criteria the results show that nrms was 1 828 0 01828 m which is below 0 1 m as per set criteria the calculated linear correlation coefficient was 0 998 which indicates a high positive correlation between observed and simulated head values as reported by zheng and bennett 2002 well calibrated models are expected to have positive linear regression coefficients close to 1 hence this indicated that the groundwater model was well calibrated and thus can be used for predictions all other criteria were within predefined range moreover a scatter graph fig 3c was plotted to illustrate the comparison between observed and calculated heads the graph indicated a 95 confidence interval i e the interval where 95 of the total number of data points are expected to lie the scatter plot shows a good distribution of residual around zero the mean average of residuals is a simple measure of skewness from zero and indicates bias depending on the magnitude and direction of the mean away from zero the more closely the mean is to zero and more uniformly divided between positive and negative residual the less the model partiality a negative mean indicates underestimate simulated hydraulic heads less than observed and a positive mean imply overestimate simulated hydraulic heads greater than observed in summary assessment of the calibrated model results indicate that i the calculated errors were within acceptable range as per predefined error criteria and ii the difference between observed heads and simulated heads were within the pre established calibration criteria 2 1 5 2 model validation the groundwater flow model was validated using independent head measurements for the year 2011 groundwater levels at 30 monitoring wells were used as target for validation process the performance statistics for validated model are shown in table 1 c the validation model resulted in 1 850 of nrms which is slightly higher compared to calibrated model the linear correlation was calculated as 0 997 which indicates a high positive correlation between observed and simulated head values moreover most of the performance statistics for validation model were within acceptable set criteria the residuals obtained from validated model were distributed randomly around zero as shown in fig 3d which mean that the validated model yielded comparable water elevations for most of the wells in this study validation results fits very well with the calibrated ones this good agreement may be due to the dataset of 2011 used for this purpose it could be that if another dataset say a few years after 2011 was available and used the results might have been different this is because groundwater moves slowly and effects of pumping are only felt some years after pumping the reservoir in summary the calibrated and validated model can be used to derive components of groundwater budget and to estimate the response of the regional system to new stresses such as increased groundwater withdrawals due to increasing demand of water for the development of domestic agriculture and industrial these results may lead to sufficient information and water resource managers can use this information to make informed decisions when planning for future groundwater development 2 1 5 3 groundwater mass balance in this study groundwater mass balance was used to evaluate the groundwater components within the aquifer the principle behind groundwater mass balance is that a change in storage should be equal to the sum of difference between inflow and outflow in the system equation 5 the groundwater inflow to the study area includes recharge from rainfall indirect recharge from river water bodies leakages and groundwater inflows across the study area boundary the system loses water through well abstractions discharge to water bodies and outflow outside the study area boundary a summary of water balance for the study area is presented in table 1 d the total average base flow river leakage out from this water balance was found to be 127 3197 mm yr which is about 57 of study area runoff the results of river leakage could be due to the following i the river stage elevation was found to be lower than water level elevations observed in study area and ii the presence of perennial rivers flows in the catchment comes from groundwater discharge nevertheless detailed study is required to determine the characteristics of base flow in the study area groundwater abstraction through pumping wells was also established in the model simulation model obtained a total of 54729 m3 day 19 98 mm3 yr due to the fact that most wells are not monitored it was difficult to estimate the exact amount of water abstracted from the aquifer moreover the results indicated that there is an increase of abstraction rate of 0 22 mm3 yr compared by results reported at dwaf 2003 where by the total abstraction was estimated as 19 76 mm3 yr 2 1 6 limitation of the model the results of this model can be used to study the behaviour of the study area aquifer system against continuous exploitation the model may also be used to evaluate different management scenarios however since the model did not consider uncertainties in model parameters the model prediction should be taken as an approximation at this stage for this reason all model predictions should be expressed as a range of possible outcomes that reproduce the assumptions involved and uncertainty in model input data and parameter values in order to overcome the issue of uncertainties from developed model this study developed stochastic groundwater flow model considering recharge as uncertain parameter 2 2 development of stochastic model considering recharge as uncertain parameter the development of stochastic groundwater management model was aimed at treating uncertainty within decision oriented programmes which cannot be experienced in deterministic models stochastic solution methodology was done for purpose of solving groundwater flow problem section 2 1 through simulation considering recharge as uncertain parameter for purposes of clarity on how uncertainty was evaluated in the simulation model consider equation 6 6 s s d h d t d d x k x d h d x d d y k y d h d y d d z k z d h d z w 1 w 2 x y t where kx ky and kz hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes which are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h the potentiometric head l w volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water l3t 1 ss the specific storage of the porous material l 1 t time t equation 6 is deterministic in nature however since we appreciate the fact that recharge is not deterministic but depends on climate conditions which are themselves uncertain we need to regard it as uncertain and hence stochastic if we take recharge as uncertain μ equation 6 becomes equation 7 7 s s d h d t d d x k x d h d x d d y k y d h d y d d z k z d h d z w 1 w 2 x y t μ this is now a fairly complex equation to solve because the problem is not only heterogeneous and dynamic but also uncertain μ and hence stochastic its solution depends on the outcomes of realizations of the random values of recharge monte carlo mc technique was used to solve stochastic groundwater problem equation 7 to illustrate mc approach consider there exist a probability space ω f p where ω is a set of all possible outcomes f denotes a set of collection of all subsets of ω possible outcomes and p denotes a probability measure let s consider a random continuous variable vector x having probability mass function pmf or probability density function pdf f x which is greater than zero on a set of values x assuming that the mean values of realizations of the uncertain recharge μ of aquifer system denoted as μ such that μ ω where μ 1 2 and ω is the total possible number of realizations each realization μ leads to different groundwater flow simulation values hydraulic heads thus the expected value of a function g of x can be defined as 8 e g χ ω g x μ i d p μ it should be noted that to solve equation 8 to an exact solution is computationally impossible or prohibitively expensive normally a simple way is to revert to monte carlo numerical methods by assuming a set of finite independent identically distributed i i d samples of the n realizations this study assumed the n samples of x s x 1 x 2 x n and computed the mean of g x of the samples and then through the monte carlo method based on equation 8 estimated expected function e g x was as follows 9 g x 1 n i 1 n g x μ it was assumed that if the e g χ exists then based on the weak law of large numbers deviation that for any arbitrarily small equation 10 holds true 10 lim n p g x e g χ ε 0 this implies that as n gets equation 10 large there is probability that g x deviates from e g χ by very small number ε and that the deviation will be very small on the other hand based on the law of large numbers and central limits theorem which staes that as n gets large enough the function g n x estimated values i e mc procedure estimates it can be claimed that the estimated value shall be closer to e g χ value as required the flow chart of stochastic solution methodology for groundwater flow is shown in fig 4 a in this research the random numbers were generated using pseudo random number generators with mean recharge value μ of 105 mm yr and standard deviation σ of 58 matlab code procedure was written to perform mc simulation based on gaussian mixture models gm sampling procedure for realization mapping which uses expectation maximization em algorithm implement under matlab 2014a environment sets of random numbers were generated from this distribution and then used in groundwater flow simulation model to determine simulated hydraulic heads the procedure was repeated by generating more sets of possible outputs up to a maximum of 1000 realizations the number of recharge realizations varied from 50 100 300 500 800 and 1000 realizations the simulations were done until their mean hydraulic heads stabilized which was achieved between 700 and 1000 realizations 2 2 1 discussion of results stochastic uncertainty analyses were performed by randomly sampling recharge realization and running a series of monte carlo mc simulations a series of realization ranging from 50 to a maximum of 1000 realization of recharge fields were generated a series of mc experiments was done in order to determine the number of realizations for which the residual mean was insensitive to increasing number of realizations used fig 4b shows the results of number of realizations against residual mean the results demonstrate that the model started to stabilization at 700 realizations with residual mean of 0 302 m the results remained relatively unchanged up to 1000 realizations this implies that as the number of realization increases the model becomes stable thus 1000 realizations were used for the mc simulations another investigation done was to examine how the standard deviations of expected mean recharge performed with increasing number of realizations table 2 a the motive behind this investigation was to assess again if 1000 realizations would be enough to capture the recharge uncertainty and hence lead to solutions that are robust solutions that will not change with increasing number of realizations results in table 2a indicated that there is a considerable change of standard deviation from 50 realizations 0 743 mm to 1000 realizations 0 131 mm the results agree with the law of large numbers as illustrated in equation 9 moreover it is important to note that typical number of realizations required to give reliable statistical measures ranges between few tens and thousands according to ndambuki 2001 wagner et al 1994 wagner and gorelick 1989 furthermore ballio and guadagnini 2004 indicated that increasing the number of realizations from 1000 to 2000 has basically no effect on the overall convergence this implies that 1000 realizations were sufficient to propagate recharge uncertainty in the groundwater flow problem leading to solutions that are stable 2 2 1 1 comparison of deterministic and stochastic residual heads the residual heads difference between measured and simulated head of deterministic and stochastic model were compared in order to examine whether some areas of the model had biased results either too high or too low values this is because the closeness of fit between simulated and observed head are important in evaluating the appropriateness of the model in addressing groundwater management problems the residual mean calculated from deterministic model was 2 76 m while stochastic simulation had a residual mean of 0 82 m this indicate that the stochastic model reproduce the better residual head than deterministic models this observation has also reported by other studies such as pool et al 2015 and arlai et al 2006 this implies that by assuming recharge as deterministic one would get results that are optimistic i e results that promises more groundwater availability than one can actually get this situation can lead to destruction of the groundwater aquifer on the other hand stochastic results are less optimistic and hence cautious this means that by taking uncertainty in recharge into consideration the solutions obtained are more realistic and will protect the aquifer from overexploitation thus leading to sustainable groundwater management this is also confirmed by results shown in fig 4c which indicates that stochastic model simulated heads were lower than the observed head compared to deterministic model results this implies that the stochastic model can be used as an appropriate tool to manage the groundwater resources in the study area 2 2 1 2 comparison of net recharge of deterministic and stochastic simulations comparison of net recharge for both deterministic and stochastic simulations was done in this study net recharge represents the specified recharge values minus the calculated evapotranspiration net recharge for deterministic model resulted with 106 01 mm year 2033 mm3 yr and a standard deviation of 43 4 mm yr a stochastic model resulted with 109 2 mm year 2091 mm3 yr and a standard deviation of 39 mm yr these results suggests that as one move from deterministic to stochastic modelling the value of recharge tends to be better estimated with values higher than those of a deterministic case this finding is supported by study done by holman et al 2009 this in turn implies that there is more groundwater available for exploitation moreover the application of stochastic model in several studies showed improvement over deterministic models for example a study by joodavi et al 2017 used stochastic multi cell lumped parameter aquifer model that aimed to explicitly consider uncertainty in groundwater recharge the study applied monte carlo to solve the problem of recharge uncertainty the results revealed that the groundwater recharge values obtained from a monte carlo simulation were better than those obtained through deterministic approach similar results obtained from research done by ramakatsa 2019 indicated that the stochastic approach is realistically fit to model the flow of groundwater since it relies wholly on uncertainty which is expected to happen in nature due to heterogeneity of natural occurring geological processes 3 conclusion groundwater models are tools which are often used in studying groundwater flow systems these models have demonstrated to be significant tools for addressing a range of groundwater problems and supporting the decision making process a groundwater model is a simplified illustration of a more complex reality groundwater model has been conceptualized and developed using the lithologic information and similar aquifer parameters applicable for the study area understanding the conceptual model of the groundwater system is crucial to efficiently use the model as management tool groundwater flow modelling involves voluminous data thus accuracy of result depends on the availability of data on various input parameter in this study the simulation model was done for two purposes first the groundwater flow model deterministic was developed using modflow 2000 the development of a distributed groundwater flow model for the study area aimed at providing information on the groundwater aquifer system as well as the water budget associated with it the groundwater flow model was calibrated based on the available data the model results showed that the computed values were in good fitness of the measured data which indicate the model is reliable thus the developed groundwater flow model can be used to simulate future aquifer responses to changes in groundwater pumping rates hence acting as a decision support tool moreover the validated model can be used to develop sustainable groundwater scenarios and hence communicate results to public and decision makers later the developed model deterministic was used to solve stochastic solution considering recharge as uncertain parameter development of a stochastic solution methodology aimed at using stochastic methods to solve a groundwater flow problem considering recharge as uncertain hence stochastic stochastic model stochastic uncertainty analyses were performed by running a series of monte carlo mc simulations stochastic model results were compared to those of deterministic model in order to evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty in this case recharge on the groundwater flow simulation results the results suggest that if this information was to be used to design a groundwater management plan one would consider choosing stochastic model over deterministic one for management option deterministic models should be taken as starting point in the process of searching for better management solutions which recognizes the existence of uncertainty i e stochastic approach at the end these observations emphasize the use of stochastic model for groundwater management funding we would like to acknowledge

12133,groundwater is a valued resource of limited extent both in quantity and in space in order to ensure its sustainable use appropriate evaluation of its availability is required this study aimed at solving groundwater problem fraught with uncertainty by considering recharge as uncertain input parameter the developed groundwater flow model was later calibrated using automatic calibration software pest within modflow environment head values from groundwater level measurement data were used as calibration targets the calibration resulted in normalised residual mean square nrms value of 1 828 mean error me of 0 999 m mean absolute error mae of 6 701 m root mean square error rmse of 8 499 m and correlation coefficient cor of 0 997 the field monitoring borehole dataset of 2011 was used to validate the model the validated model resulted in a root mean square error rmse of 8 601 m and nrms value of 1 85 which compares very well with the nrms value of the calibrated model whose value was 1 828 all set criteria were within acceptable limits for both calibrated and validated model thereafter stochastic uncertainty analyses were performed by randomly sampling recharge realization and running a series of monte carlo mc simulations ranging from 50 to a maximum of 1000 realization of recharge fields stochastic model results were compared to those of deterministic model groundwater potential results were compared for both deterministic and stochastic scenarios deterministic scenario resulted in groundwater potential value of 1122 92 mm3 year while stochastic scenario resulted in a value of 1137 61 mm3 year an increase of 14 7 mm3 year this implies that there is potential for more groundwater exploitation in the study area thus the developed stochastic model can be used as a decision support system dss for water resource management graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater flow model limpopo modelling modflow recharge uncertain 1 introduction groundwater has emerged as an extremely essential water resource and its increasing demand in agriculture domestic and industrial uses ranks it as a resource of strategic importance groundwater resources are dynamic in nature and affected by factors like growth of irrigation activities industrialization as well as urbanization for this reason monitoring and conserving this important resource is essential ketata et al 2011 moreover due to increasing population worldwide emphasis is put on this water resource owing to its threat of overexploitation and hence the need for sound groundwater management strategies this in turn requires a full consideration of groundwater in terms of sustainability of the resource stadler et al 2010 however long term availability of groundwater supplies for increasing populations can only be ensured if effective management schemes are developed and put into practice healey 2010 south africa s overall water consumption trend indicates that groundwater contributes only 15 of the total volume consumed dwaf 2002 however due to lack of perennial streams in the semi desert to desert parts two thirds of south africa s surface area is largely dependent on groundwater the total estimated volume of available groundwater resources in south africa is in the order of 10343 million m3 yr dwa 2010b however only about 4000 million m3 yr is being used this means that there is potential to considerably increase groundwater supplies in south africa assessment of groundwater involves numerous factors of which recharge is paramount for this reason determination of groundwater recharge has shifted from a basic problem to a vital and important issue in hydrogeological research for sustainable development of groundwater stoll 2012 this is because groundwater recharge estimation constitutes a primary step for most approaches used to evaluate and sustainably manage groundwater resources moreover with the increasing computation power and the wide accessibility of computers groundwater modelling has become a standard tool for modelling groundwater flow at present numerical modelling technology has become an essential method on groundwater research different numerical software have been developed based on different mathematical formulations and have been used widely such as finite element subsurface flow system feflow diersch 2009 visual modular three dimensional flow visual modflow visual modflow 2000 and processing modflow for window pmwin chiang 2005 of all these modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 has been used as a calculation program generally because of its simplicity modular program structure and separate package to resolve special hydrogeological problems khadri and pande 2016 in this study modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 was selected for modelling process because of the following reasons i modflow is widely used for groundwater flow in the area of hydrogeology ii it has been broadly tested successfully in various environments under different conditions and iii the model can simulate recharge discharge different flows and pollution transport more details of the model can be found in harbaugh et al 2000 it is worth noting that majority of numerical models still provide only deterministic predictions with no supplementary information on uncertainty predictions uncertainties in groundwater system may be attributed to lack of perfect knowledge about the aquifer intrinsic variability of system parameters both in space and time errors in historical data used to model the groundwater system incapacity to accurately predict future events such as water demand and other factors like economic factors of projects ndambuki 2001 the existence of uncertainties limits our ability to predict system behaviour with definitiveness under various decisions in literature several methodologies to account for uncertainties arising from inputs forcing data parameters and the definition of alternative conceptual models have been proposed beven and binley 1992 neuman 2003 poeter and anderson 2005 bredehoeft 2003 neuman 2003 as well as neuman and wierenga 2003 suggested that uncertainties in groundwater model predictions are largely dominated by uncertainty arising from conceptual models and that parametric uncertainty solely does not allow compensating for conceptual model uncertainty moreover rojas et al 2010 asserts that different external factors such as climatic conditions and groundwater abstraction policies increase the uncertainty in groundwater model predictions due to unknown future conditions in regard to uncertainties deterministic methods assume that all the input data are known without error this assumption is illogical since usually only a few set of data are available to define the current situation of the system with certainty ndambuki 2001 in this regard stochastic groundwater management that aims at treating uncertainty within decision oriented models in a logical and systematic manner which cannot be experienced in deterministic modelling approach is appropriate in stochastic groundwater problems monte carlo method is the most commonly used approach that solves problems with uncertain parameters this is due to the fact that the method is capable of working with many classes of uncertain parameters ndambuki 2001 according to neuman and wierenga 2003 this method is popular because it is straight forward and to some extent nonlinear however cooley 1997 has shown that for highly nonlinear models this type of monte carlo based presumption on predictions can be highly inaccurate and that a monte carlo based confidence interval can be as inaccurate as the linearized confidence interval beven 2008 visual claimed monte carlo mc simulation as an extremely flexible and robust sampling based method which is extensively used for uncertain problems in hydrological applications the uncertain parameters in the method are portrayed by probability distributions and in the situation of lack of enough information model parameters are assumed independent in the process random values of each of the uncertain parameters are generated according to their respective probability distributions and the model is run using each random sample in so doing samples of model outputs are generated giving statistics e g mean standard deviation skewness and estimated probability distribution of the model output can be determined pechlivanidis et al 2011 on the other hand mc method has its disadvantage in that a huge number of parameters are frequently required to consistently represent all probable results particularly when there are a number of random variables in as far as the current study is concerned the available reports dealing with estimation of recharge and development of groundwater flow models are deterministic in nature and do not take into account uncertainty factor these studies include wsm leshika consulting 2013 dwa 2010a naledzi waterworks 2016 shamuyarira 2017 barratt 2018 du toit et al 2012 as well as holland 2011 therefore this study aimed at using stochastic approach for groundwater flow modelling considering recharge as uncertain parameter 1 1 study area description the study area is situated in central limpopo south africa and covers an area of about 19188 km2 of the limpopo province fig 1 a shows the location of study area and nine demarcated districts which forms part of the study area the study area falls under limpopo water management area wma as reported by dwaf 2003 the mean annual precipitation map is in the range of 200 800 mm over most of the limpopo wma rainfall in the soutpansberg watershed ranges between 800 and 1200 mm per annum in this particular study the study area is defined as semi arid subtropical the summer s average temperature varies from 32 2 c to 27 3 c and winter temperature varies from 9 2 c to 4 3 c the mean annual rainfall of the study rainfall varies from 475 mm in the south east to 205 mm in the northern portions with mean of 453 mm as recorded at five stations found in the area fig 1b and c shows the distribution of five rainfall stations in the study area 1 1 1 geology and lithology of the study area the limpopo water management area lies beneath extensive diversity of different lithologies the northern side is dominated by faulted karoo strata with soutpansberg mountains consisting of soutpansberg group of rocks the south west side is dominated by large east west faults of waterberg group strata the south central part is underlain by basement gneisses i e the houtriver and goudplaats gneisses intruded by younger granite plutons i e the matlala and mashashane granites the six major lithostrata found in the study area are goudplaats hout river gneiss which covers about 12088 2 km2 48 7 of total area followed by letaba covering an area of 2705 5 km2 10 9 matlabas of 1635 3 km2 6 6 pietersburg of 913 0 km2 3 7 and malala drift gneiss of 866 9 km2 3 5 fig 2 a shows the summarized geology and lithology of the study area 1 1 2 surface hydrology and log test data the main river found in the study area is sand river the river flows from south of polokwane to the north through the soutpansberg mountain range inflowing into limpopo river dwaf 2003 the main tributaries of sand river are hout and brak rivers fig 2b shows the rivers found in the study area other surface hydrology found in study area includes dams namely glen alpine gert combrink chuniespoort and molepo dam log test data of 2000 2010 year acquired from groundwater resource information project grip limpopo and vsa leboa consulting pty ltd indicated that the area is generalized by regional confined aquifer under natural conditions groundwater drains through localized springs via fractures to the perennial tributaries from the soutpansberg rocks found in study area groundwater depth ranges from 23 to 291 m 1 1 3 soil of the study area the study area is composed of clay sandy clay loam and sandy loam soils as shown in fig 2c the percentage of the type of soil from the study area was 0 07 clay 79 7 sandy loam and 20 23 of sandy clay loam most parts of the study area are covered by sandy loam 19785 2 km2 followed by sandy clay loam 5030 6 km2 and clay 18 2 km2 this implies that the soil in the study area promotes recharge 1 1 4 land use cover of the study area the land use landcover lulc of the area provides essential indications of the extent of groundwater requirements and utilization groundwater recharge strongly depends on landuse cover of the study area bare land was found to be the dominant type of land use classified which covers about 31 4 of the total study area followed by build up areas with 16 0 while the least classified was dams which accounts for 0 2 during the classification among the water body classified were rivers sand river brak seepebana and houtriver and dams seshego chuenespoort nkumidamme and houtriver dam due to high percentage of agriculture land classified 21 2 it was assumed that infiltration percolates the aquifers through irrigation hence increases water storage in aquifers moreover the presence of water bodies in the study area could lead to loss of water through evaporation and discharge to aquifers fig 2d represent the landuse lover distribution of the study area 2 methodology the methodology followed will be presented in two sections as follows i methodology for the development of groundwater flow model using modflow and ii methodology for the development of stochastic model considering recharge as uncertain parameter 2 1 development of a distributed groundwater flow model of the study area the development of groundwater flow model was done through visual modflow 2000 software the model development consisted of a set of assumptions that simplified the real problem and came up with a conceptual model that was suitable in view of the objective of the modelling the aquifers within the model domain were complex and significantly difficult to define thus during the modelling process the weathered and fractured dolerite and the limestone units were combined to form a single aquifer system in order to accommodate the complexity of the real hydrogeological system some basic assumptions about the study area based on well log data were made as follows i the system was considered to be in a steady state throughout the year as we did not have enough groundwater level data to model the system dynamically ii the geological formations of concern were considered horizontal in extent thus groundwater flow direction was assumed essentially horizontal moreover the groundwater flow model was constructed for the computation of hydraulic head distribution thus minor variation is observed groundwater level in the study area indicates that hydraulic gradient do not change significantly with time hence the groundwater flow model was assumed to be under steady state condition hani et al 2007 2 1 1 model setup the aquifer model was discretized into 117 columns and 164 rows with grid cell size was 1000 m in both x and y directions site map of the study area processed in arcgis 10 5 1 was used to set boundaries of the model domain fig 2e a single model of confined aquifer layer of 60 m thickness was used to simulate flow of the study area 2 1 2 model inputs to set up the model three inputs packages were used in modflow including pumping and observation wells model properties and model boundary conditions pumping wells data was used to generate water levels during aquifer pumping with a total of 203 boreholes being captured in the model data processing was done through arcgis using extraction and clipping on geoprocessing tool and later imported in modflow through the import tool thirty observation wells were added in the model for the purpose of model calibration the choice of observation wells was based on i recent data availability ii completeness of the data and iii spatial distribution of the wells fig 3 a shows a flow chart of inputs and methodology followed in the model development important parameters that dictate the flow of water in aquifer includes hydraulic conductivity transmissivity initial head and storage the aquifer parameters data was obtained from well log data since the groundwater flow model was single layered only horizontal hydraulic conductivities were significant hydraulic conductivity was obtained from pumping test data it varies between 3 568 10 3 to 30 78 m d it was assigned in five distinct zones based on their geological formation and point hydraulic conductivities the storage coefficients and porosity values were according to the literature defined based on the aquifer type and soil lithology respectively due to presence of fracture faults heterogeneity and compartments nature of the study area hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer varied significantly moreover three types of boundary conditions were incorporated in this study which included constant head river and recharge the constant head was used to fix the head values thus acting as an infinite source of water entering the system or as infinite sink for water leaving the system a constant head boundary was assigned in the east and west where the groundwater levels along the boundary are assigned according to the data from a contour map of groundwater level for the year 2010 dirichlet boundary conditions fixed boundary condition were allocated within a minimum distance of 2 km from the closest pumping wells to this boundary condition a boundary located at a distance of 2 km will ensure that effect of pumping from the nearest well will not be felt at such a distance water bodies were modelled under specified head boundary condition since the aquifer is in direct contact with these surface water bodies the study area recharge polygon shape file map was imported in modflow under boundaries 2 1 3 pumping wells data the borehole abstraction data of pumping wells was obtained from groundwater resource information project grip limpopo database fig 3b shows the pumping wells distribution and their abstraction rates most wells in the study area have pumping rates of between 127 9 and 5 2 m3 d with a few having pumping rates of between 127 9 and 345 6 m3 d the rest have high pumping rates of between 846 72 and 2719 01 m3 d this yields can most probably be ascribed to a the possibility that these drainage paths follow subsurface geological structures b increased recharge is associated with surface drainage features and or c the presence of an alluvial aquifer or thicker weathered zone in these areas 2 1 4 model calibration and validation the objective of model performance assessment was to quantify how well numerical model simulates the physical system and to identify discrepancies in the model if any the calibration was performed using automatic calibration pest the parameter estimation model developed by doherty 2004 in order to assess the performance of the calibrated model the scatter diagrams mass balance flow direction together with the coefficient of determination were used to determine general agreement between predictions and observations the typical assessment methods of mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse were used to quantify the calibrated model error adopted from anderson and woessner 1992 and tsou et al 2006 normalised root mean square nrms error was adopted from coelho et al 2017 the me presenting the mean differences between observed heads and calculated head is shown in equation 1 1 me 1 n i 1 n h m h s i the mean absolute error mae refers to the mean of the absolute value of differences in observed heads and calculated heads equation 2 2 mae 1 n i 1 n h m h s i the root mean square error rmse is given by equation 3 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n h m h s i 2 0 5 equations 1 3 are adopted from anderson and woessner 1992 in equations 1 3 n is the number of observations hs the simulated head at well i l and hm is the measured head at well i l these equations were used to evaluate the calibrated model normalised root mean square nrms error adopted from coelho et al 2017 equation 4 is a representative measure of the fit than the standard rmse as it accounts for the scale of the potential range of data values 4 n r m s r m s x o b s m a x x o b s m i n where rms is a root mean square xobs max is maximum value of observed results xobs min is minimum value of observed results in this study the performance criteria was set in such a way that for rmse the collective effect should not be more than 10 m difference between the observed and calculated heads tsou et al 2006 and normalised root mean square nrms error should be less or equal to 10 coelho et al 2017 other studies that used these criteria s include loudyi 2005 as well as surinaidu et al 2014 model validation was performed using observed hydraulic head data for the year 2011 this year was selected because it had enough data which was required for validation process the output of the validation model simulated heads was compared with the observed heads and evaluated using the same performance measures explained above additionally movement of groundwater through aquifer system was evaluated through water balance calculations the fundamental principle for water balance is that sum of inputs less sum of outputs equals change in storage of the aquifer system the principle can be summarized by equation 5 as 5 δ s qin qout r eg qabs where δs is change in groundwater storage r is groundwater recharge from rainfall eg is loss to atmosphere through evaporation qin represent groundwater inflow from outside the system boundary qout is groundwater outflow from the system boundary and discharge to surface water bodies and qabs is groundwater abstraction through pumping wells 2 1 5 discussion of results the development of a distributed groundwater flow model for the study area aimed at providing information on the groundwater aquifer system as well as the water budget associated with it it also helped in understanding the behaviour of the groundwater system in response to stress due to groundwater abstractions the developed model can be used for management of groundwater through scenarios analysis which will aid in decision making 2 1 5 1 calibration results calibration of the models includes the refinement of initial input data with comparison of the calculated data from the model for this study hydraulics heads from groundwater level measurement data were used as comparable calibration values the target was to compare the hydraulic heads observed from site with simulated heads a total of 30 observation wells from groundwater resource information project grip database were selected for the calibration of the model calibration process was performed in five zones of hydraulic conductivities taking into consideration hydraulic conductivity as the parameter of interest initial and calibrated results are shown in table 1 a while the statistics of calibrated model is shown in table 1 b calibrated groundwater flow model yielded acceptable calibration statistics in line with targeted criteria the results show that nrms was 1 828 0 01828 m which is below 0 1 m as per set criteria the calculated linear correlation coefficient was 0 998 which indicates a high positive correlation between observed and simulated head values as reported by zheng and bennett 2002 well calibrated models are expected to have positive linear regression coefficients close to 1 hence this indicated that the groundwater model was well calibrated and thus can be used for predictions all other criteria were within predefined range moreover a scatter graph fig 3c was plotted to illustrate the comparison between observed and calculated heads the graph indicated a 95 confidence interval i e the interval where 95 of the total number of data points are expected to lie the scatter plot shows a good distribution of residual around zero the mean average of residuals is a simple measure of skewness from zero and indicates bias depending on the magnitude and direction of the mean away from zero the more closely the mean is to zero and more uniformly divided between positive and negative residual the less the model partiality a negative mean indicates underestimate simulated hydraulic heads less than observed and a positive mean imply overestimate simulated hydraulic heads greater than observed in summary assessment of the calibrated model results indicate that i the calculated errors were within acceptable range as per predefined error criteria and ii the difference between observed heads and simulated heads were within the pre established calibration criteria 2 1 5 2 model validation the groundwater flow model was validated using independent head measurements for the year 2011 groundwater levels at 30 monitoring wells were used as target for validation process the performance statistics for validated model are shown in table 1 c the validation model resulted in 1 850 of nrms which is slightly higher compared to calibrated model the linear correlation was calculated as 0 997 which indicates a high positive correlation between observed and simulated head values moreover most of the performance statistics for validation model were within acceptable set criteria the residuals obtained from validated model were distributed randomly around zero as shown in fig 3d which mean that the validated model yielded comparable water elevations for most of the wells in this study validation results fits very well with the calibrated ones this good agreement may be due to the dataset of 2011 used for this purpose it could be that if another dataset say a few years after 2011 was available and used the results might have been different this is because groundwater moves slowly and effects of pumping are only felt some years after pumping the reservoir in summary the calibrated and validated model can be used to derive components of groundwater budget and to estimate the response of the regional system to new stresses such as increased groundwater withdrawals due to increasing demand of water for the development of domestic agriculture and industrial these results may lead to sufficient information and water resource managers can use this information to make informed decisions when planning for future groundwater development 2 1 5 3 groundwater mass balance in this study groundwater mass balance was used to evaluate the groundwater components within the aquifer the principle behind groundwater mass balance is that a change in storage should be equal to the sum of difference between inflow and outflow in the system equation 5 the groundwater inflow to the study area includes recharge from rainfall indirect recharge from river water bodies leakages and groundwater inflows across the study area boundary the system loses water through well abstractions discharge to water bodies and outflow outside the study area boundary a summary of water balance for the study area is presented in table 1 d the total average base flow river leakage out from this water balance was found to be 127 3197 mm yr which is about 57 of study area runoff the results of river leakage could be due to the following i the river stage elevation was found to be lower than water level elevations observed in study area and ii the presence of perennial rivers flows in the catchment comes from groundwater discharge nevertheless detailed study is required to determine the characteristics of base flow in the study area groundwater abstraction through pumping wells was also established in the model simulation model obtained a total of 54729 m3 day 19 98 mm3 yr due to the fact that most wells are not monitored it was difficult to estimate the exact amount of water abstracted from the aquifer moreover the results indicated that there is an increase of abstraction rate of 0 22 mm3 yr compared by results reported at dwaf 2003 where by the total abstraction was estimated as 19 76 mm3 yr 2 1 6 limitation of the model the results of this model can be used to study the behaviour of the study area aquifer system against continuous exploitation the model may also be used to evaluate different management scenarios however since the model did not consider uncertainties in model parameters the model prediction should be taken as an approximation at this stage for this reason all model predictions should be expressed as a range of possible outcomes that reproduce the assumptions involved and uncertainty in model input data and parameter values in order to overcome the issue of uncertainties from developed model this study developed stochastic groundwater flow model considering recharge as uncertain parameter 2 2 development of stochastic model considering recharge as uncertain parameter the development of stochastic groundwater management model was aimed at treating uncertainty within decision oriented programmes which cannot be experienced in deterministic models stochastic solution methodology was done for purpose of solving groundwater flow problem section 2 1 through simulation considering recharge as uncertain parameter for purposes of clarity on how uncertainty was evaluated in the simulation model consider equation 6 6 s s d h d t d d x k x d h d x d d y k y d h d y d d z k z d h d z w 1 w 2 x y t where kx ky and kz hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes which are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity lt 1 h the potentiometric head l w volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water l3t 1 ss the specific storage of the porous material l 1 t time t equation 6 is deterministic in nature however since we appreciate the fact that recharge is not deterministic but depends on climate conditions which are themselves uncertain we need to regard it as uncertain and hence stochastic if we take recharge as uncertain μ equation 6 becomes equation 7 7 s s d h d t d d x k x d h d x d d y k y d h d y d d z k z d h d z w 1 w 2 x y t μ this is now a fairly complex equation to solve because the problem is not only heterogeneous and dynamic but also uncertain μ and hence stochastic its solution depends on the outcomes of realizations of the random values of recharge monte carlo mc technique was used to solve stochastic groundwater problem equation 7 to illustrate mc approach consider there exist a probability space ω f p where ω is a set of all possible outcomes f denotes a set of collection of all subsets of ω possible outcomes and p denotes a probability measure let s consider a random continuous variable vector x having probability mass function pmf or probability density function pdf f x which is greater than zero on a set of values x assuming that the mean values of realizations of the uncertain recharge μ of aquifer system denoted as μ such that μ ω where μ 1 2 and ω is the total possible number of realizations each realization μ leads to different groundwater flow simulation values hydraulic heads thus the expected value of a function g of x can be defined as 8 e g χ ω g x μ i d p μ it should be noted that to solve equation 8 to an exact solution is computationally impossible or prohibitively expensive normally a simple way is to revert to monte carlo numerical methods by assuming a set of finite independent identically distributed i i d samples of the n realizations this study assumed the n samples of x s x 1 x 2 x n and computed the mean of g x of the samples and then through the monte carlo method based on equation 8 estimated expected function e g x was as follows 9 g x 1 n i 1 n g x μ it was assumed that if the e g χ exists then based on the weak law of large numbers deviation that for any arbitrarily small equation 10 holds true 10 lim n p g x e g χ ε 0 this implies that as n gets equation 10 large there is probability that g x deviates from e g χ by very small number ε and that the deviation will be very small on the other hand based on the law of large numbers and central limits theorem which staes that as n gets large enough the function g n x estimated values i e mc procedure estimates it can be claimed that the estimated value shall be closer to e g χ value as required the flow chart of stochastic solution methodology for groundwater flow is shown in fig 4 a in this research the random numbers were generated using pseudo random number generators with mean recharge value μ of 105 mm yr and standard deviation σ of 58 matlab code procedure was written to perform mc simulation based on gaussian mixture models gm sampling procedure for realization mapping which uses expectation maximization em algorithm implement under matlab 2014a environment sets of random numbers were generated from this distribution and then used in groundwater flow simulation model to determine simulated hydraulic heads the procedure was repeated by generating more sets of possible outputs up to a maximum of 1000 realizations the number of recharge realizations varied from 50 100 300 500 800 and 1000 realizations the simulations were done until their mean hydraulic heads stabilized which was achieved between 700 and 1000 realizations 2 2 1 discussion of results stochastic uncertainty analyses were performed by randomly sampling recharge realization and running a series of monte carlo mc simulations a series of realization ranging from 50 to a maximum of 1000 realization of recharge fields were generated a series of mc experiments was done in order to determine the number of realizations for which the residual mean was insensitive to increasing number of realizations used fig 4b shows the results of number of realizations against residual mean the results demonstrate that the model started to stabilization at 700 realizations with residual mean of 0 302 m the results remained relatively unchanged up to 1000 realizations this implies that as the number of realization increases the model becomes stable thus 1000 realizations were used for the mc simulations another investigation done was to examine how the standard deviations of expected mean recharge performed with increasing number of realizations table 2 a the motive behind this investigation was to assess again if 1000 realizations would be enough to capture the recharge uncertainty and hence lead to solutions that are robust solutions that will not change with increasing number of realizations results in table 2a indicated that there is a considerable change of standard deviation from 50 realizations 0 743 mm to 1000 realizations 0 131 mm the results agree with the law of large numbers as illustrated in equation 9 moreover it is important to note that typical number of realizations required to give reliable statistical measures ranges between few tens and thousands according to ndambuki 2001 wagner et al 1994 wagner and gorelick 1989 furthermore ballio and guadagnini 2004 indicated that increasing the number of realizations from 1000 to 2000 has basically no effect on the overall convergence this implies that 1000 realizations were sufficient to propagate recharge uncertainty in the groundwater flow problem leading to solutions that are stable 2 2 1 1 comparison of deterministic and stochastic residual heads the residual heads difference between measured and simulated head of deterministic and stochastic model were compared in order to examine whether some areas of the model had biased results either too high or too low values this is because the closeness of fit between simulated and observed head are important in evaluating the appropriateness of the model in addressing groundwater management problems the residual mean calculated from deterministic model was 2 76 m while stochastic simulation had a residual mean of 0 82 m this indicate that the stochastic model reproduce the better residual head than deterministic models this observation has also reported by other studies such as pool et al 2015 and arlai et al 2006 this implies that by assuming recharge as deterministic one would get results that are optimistic i e results that promises more groundwater availability than one can actually get this situation can lead to destruction of the groundwater aquifer on the other hand stochastic results are less optimistic and hence cautious this means that by taking uncertainty in recharge into consideration the solutions obtained are more realistic and will protect the aquifer from overexploitation thus leading to sustainable groundwater management this is also confirmed by results shown in fig 4c which indicates that stochastic model simulated heads were lower than the observed head compared to deterministic model results this implies that the stochastic model can be used as an appropriate tool to manage the groundwater resources in the study area 2 2 1 2 comparison of net recharge of deterministic and stochastic simulations comparison of net recharge for both deterministic and stochastic simulations was done in this study net recharge represents the specified recharge values minus the calculated evapotranspiration net recharge for deterministic model resulted with 106 01 mm year 2033 mm3 yr and a standard deviation of 43 4 mm yr a stochastic model resulted with 109 2 mm year 2091 mm3 yr and a standard deviation of 39 mm yr these results suggests that as one move from deterministic to stochastic modelling the value of recharge tends to be better estimated with values higher than those of a deterministic case this finding is supported by study done by holman et al 2009 this in turn implies that there is more groundwater available for exploitation moreover the application of stochastic model in several studies showed improvement over deterministic models for example a study by joodavi et al 2017 used stochastic multi cell lumped parameter aquifer model that aimed to explicitly consider uncertainty in groundwater recharge the study applied monte carlo to solve the problem of recharge uncertainty the results revealed that the groundwater recharge values obtained from a monte carlo simulation were better than those obtained through deterministic approach similar results obtained from research done by ramakatsa 2019 indicated that the stochastic approach is realistically fit to model the flow of groundwater since it relies wholly on uncertainty which is expected to happen in nature due to heterogeneity of natural occurring geological processes 3 conclusion groundwater models are tools which are often used in studying groundwater flow systems these models have demonstrated to be significant tools for addressing a range of groundwater problems and supporting the decision making process a groundwater model is a simplified illustration of a more complex reality groundwater model has been conceptualized and developed using the lithologic information and similar aquifer parameters applicable for the study area understanding the conceptual model of the groundwater system is crucial to efficiently use the model as management tool groundwater flow modelling involves voluminous data thus accuracy of result depends on the availability of data on various input parameter in this study the simulation model was done for two purposes first the groundwater flow model deterministic was developed using modflow 2000 the development of a distributed groundwater flow model for the study area aimed at providing information on the groundwater aquifer system as well as the water budget associated with it the groundwater flow model was calibrated based on the available data the model results showed that the computed values were in good fitness of the measured data which indicate the model is reliable thus the developed groundwater flow model can be used to simulate future aquifer responses to changes in groundwater pumping rates hence acting as a decision support tool moreover the validated model can be used to develop sustainable groundwater scenarios and hence communicate results to public and decision makers later the developed model deterministic was used to solve stochastic solution considering recharge as uncertain parameter development of a stochastic solution methodology aimed at using stochastic methods to solve a groundwater flow problem considering recharge as uncertain hence stochastic stochastic model stochastic uncertainty analyses were performed by running a series of monte carlo mc simulations stochastic model results were compared to those of deterministic model in order to evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty in this case recharge on the groundwater flow simulation results the results suggest that if this information was to be used to design a groundwater management plan one would consider choosing stochastic model over deterministic one for management option deterministic models should be taken as starting point in the process of searching for better management solutions which recognizes the existence of uncertainty i e stochastic approach at the end these observations emphasize the use of stochastic model for groundwater management funding we would like to acknowledge

12134,in colombia hydric resources research has focused mainly on surface water sources however the use and protection of groundwater has become important in regions where the access to surface water is difficult in the city of pereira colombia it is estimated that the population growth rate is of 0 47 per year growing from 457 667 inhabitants in 2011 to 481 080 inhabitants in 2020 facts like this have generated great interest in the study and protection of groundwater the objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of groundwater contamination in the aquifer of pereira within the limits of the urban expansion zone of the municipality of pereira colombian coffee growing region by determining the intrinsic vulnerability using the modified drastic method and the identification of anthropic threats in the study area according with the findings the moderate vulnerability class is the dominant one representing the 58 3 of the aquifer s area followed by high vulnerability class with 33 3 of the total area and the class of very high vulnerability with 8 3 of the area associated with a zone with high hydrogeological recharge conditions and shallow phreatic levels inadequate disposal of domestic wastewater the existence of hydrocarbon conduction pipes and agricultural activity were identified as the activities that generate a high threat of contamination finally the evaluation of the risk of contamination of the aquifer in the urban expansion zone through the superposition of maps of intrinsic vulnerability and anthropic threats allowed to differentiate the zones of the aquifer where groundwater presents a high risk of contamination the obtained results provide information for knowledge and sustainable management of the aquifer since it allows the delimitation of the areas where it s necessary to restrict the development of activities that deteriorate the quality of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater risk groundwater vulnerability drastic urban expansion groundwater contamination anthropic threats 1 introduction according to unesco 2018 more than 2 billion people in the world do not have access to safe drinking water and more than twice that number do not have access to safe sanitation besides as a consequence of the rapid growth of the world s population an increase of almost one third of the actual water demand is expected by the year 2050 kamble et al 2017 and ochoa et al 2017 affirm that the urbanization population growth and the increment of economic and productive activities are the main reasons for the affectation in terms of quantity and quality of surface and groundwater limiting the availability of the resource by quality worldwide about half of the water supply comes from deposits stored in aquifers with irrigation being the main use of groundwater unesco 2012 the availability of groundwater for different uses is particularly important in times of extreme climatic events which makes it a strategic resource within the framework of climate variability unesco 2012 kumar 2012 generally research has focused on surface water systems where the impacts of climate change could be more noticeable however it is necessary to study in depth how groundwater can respond to climate change in relation to its availability for different uses unesco 2015 although groundwater is considered an alternative resource the impact on its quality has become a global concern gleeson et al 2012 custodio 2014 united nations 2011 world water assessment program wwap 2015 the lack or inadequate operation and maintenance of sewerage and wastewater treatment systems powell et al 2003 and the expansion of the agricultural frontier have been recognized as the main anthropic activities that are affecting groundwater in terms of quality ruddiman 2013 palma et al 2015 these activities are related to urban areas and urban expansion areas without adequate sanitation and where multiple socioeconomic and productive activities are developed which generate different types of pollutants which within vulnerable hydrogeological environments reach saturated areas and adversely affect the quality of groundwater powell et al 2003 salman et al 2018 the increasing demand for residential industrial and agricultural uses has led to the depletion of groundwater and the decline in quality in many regions of the world kalhor et al 2019 according with the colombian ministry of environment and sustainable development mads 2014 although groundwater is not the main source of supply it is an important and practically the only alternative in areas where there is a scarcity of surface water in the city of pereira coffee growing region in colombia the local environmental protection agency carder 2007 found out that groundwater is mainly used in the urban expansion zones due to its access quality and low costs related to conduction and treatment which make it attractive especially for the commercial and industrial sectors located in these areas however urban expansion zones are located in the recharge zones of the aquifer the city of pereira has been developed in recent decades by a disorganized growth with urbanizations in the interior in the peripheries of the city and in suburban areas increasing threats associated with the alteration of the environmental structure of the territory soil and both superficial and groundwater pollution due to inadequate disposal of liquid and solid waste derived from the lack of home public service systems that are typical of urban areas gaviria 2009 as a way to have a better control carder formulated in 2007 the integrated groundwater management plan of pereira and dosquebradas carder 2007 and since that several studies have been developed to know the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system and its affectation in terms of quality and quantity due to the development of anthropic activities restrepo 2014 proposed the generation of knowledge by the integration of multiple areas such as integrated water resources management and risk management plus topics associated with vulnerability from a physical agricultural social economic and political perspective among others and through these intervention strategies or guidelines were proposed in social environmental planning and conservation scopes among others paredes et al 2016 related the advance in the first generated experiences in the knowledge of the groundwater resource of the city of pereira focusing on the determination of the impacts of urban growth and alternatives of groundwater management in the western expansion zone of the pereira municipality through the calculation of the monthly recharge of the aquifer using widely accepted hydrological models the analysis and selection of alternatives for the mitigation of impacts on the water quality of the aquifer and finally proposes operational and maintenance strategies for monitoring the recharge in the study zone 2 vision of the study the main vision of the study is to develop a management tool that will allow decision making to prevent groundwater pollution based on the aquifer contamination risk evaluation in the study area therefore in the present study threats or hazards derived from anthropic activities and intrinsic vulnerability to aquifer contamination were identified and the risk to groundwater contamination at the urban expansion zone in pereira colombia was evaluated the vulnerability assessment was carried out by applying the modified drastic method from the hydrogeological knowledge of the study area this method has the advantage that the variables used can be integrated and processed using a geographical information system gis 3 literature review in order to adequately manage groundwater resources vulnerability susceptibility and potential risk of contamination evaluation in aquifers becomes a key tool since it allows the decision makers to plan resource protection matzeu et al 2017 risk evaluation allows the identification of areas where aquifers are more vulnerable to degradation due to their hydrogeological characteristics and in addition the recognition of threats due to the development of socio economic activities in the territory in a risk evaluation where risk is defined as the relationship between hazard and vulnerability the combined qualification of possible noxiousness presented by a contamination source and the propagation possibility inwards and outwards the saturated area could be interpreted as groundwater contamination probability in both quantitative and qualitative terms depending on the method used johansson 1999 nixdorf et al 2017 the contamination risk in essence is the probability of a determined pollutant reaches the saturated area to exist risk it is necessary the presence of a polluting action or threat an objective to pollute saturated area and a connection route between them intrinsic vulnerability risks exist when these three components converge space temporarily igme 2007 vulnerability of aquifers to contamination is not a property that can be measured directly through the gathering of information in the field rather it is an idea based on the concept that some areas are more susceptible than others to the contamination of their underground water resources vrba and zaporozec 1994 in a simple way the vulnerability of groundwater resources is defined as ease with which a system can be altered by natural factors and human activity with little capacity of resilience the greater the degree of vulnerability the more difficult it is to promote the sustainable development of the aquifer wang et al 2012 the estimation of vulnerability to contamination of aquifers is a way to graphically synthesize the complex hydrogeological information in a more understandable way for environmental authorities scientists and the general public vulnerability maps are necessary in groundwater management programs because they identify the areas where the monitoring and protection of aquifers should be prioritized facilitate risk evaluation and it can also be an effective mean of education and awareness raising for users in general liggett and talwar 2009 several researchers have proposed methodologies to evaluate the vulnerability to contamination of aquifers in a general way it can be categorized into intrinsic vulnerability based on the geological hydrogeological and hydrological characteristics of the study area without considering the nature and the consequence of the pollutant and specific vulnerability which takes into account the inherent vulnerability and the property of the pollutant vrba and zaporozec 1994 gogu and dassargues 2000 there are several methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability and can be classified into three categories overlay index methods based on ratings and weights drastic god avi sintacs dristpi epik pi cop process based mathematical models gleams hydrus and statistical models however the methodology election depends mainly on the information s availability and the characteristics of the studied aquifer busico et al 2017 jarray et al 2017 jang et al 2017 jafari et al 2016 neshat and pradhan 2015 langrudi et al 2016 the overlay methods are based on the combination of different parameters and are used for the evaluation of the intrinsic vulnerability conditioned by the hydrogeological characteristics of the terrain where each parameter is quantitatively punctuated and they can be assigned different weighting values to determine the final result which is a numerical index of vulnerability mavdt 2010 among these the drastic index is one of the most used methods erazo and thompson 2013 li and merchant 2013 langrudi et al 2016 jang et al 2017 huan et al 2018 however it has also limitations such as assuming a constant range and weight of parameters for each region langrudi et al 2016 on the other hand the threats or hazards are related to potentially contaminating anthropic activities associated with urbanization processes in areas of urban expansion which are characterized by the development of new and diverse economic activities as the establishment of urban infrastructure and transportation and agricultural commercial and livestock activities among others aguilar 2006 according to nixdorf et al 2017 for a detailed evaluation of potential contamination threats in a determined aquifer the information on the contamination source and the characteristics of the contaminants must be taken into investigation but the difficulties found while obtaining these specific data lead many researchers to prefer an evaluation system based on indexes for determined hazards wang et al 2012 an approach usually applied to aquifers or small basins is to establish an inventory of possible danger source combined with weighting and rating schemes kuisi et al 2014 aliewi and al khatib 2015 the risk evaluation is carried out taking into account that it is a dynamic changing with the activity carried out and interactive changing depending on the protective measures lavell 2003 process and its knowledge becomes important since once the aquifer is polluted it is very difficult and expensive to restore it this is how risk management becomes a key factor allowing the prevention reduction and constant control of risk factors in society integrated to sustainable human economic environmental and territorial development narváez et al 2009 risk management is based on the identification of risk factors threat objective to pollute and vulnerability foster and hirata 1991 and their conformation processes including the social actors involved in their configuration this knowledge allows the construction of risk scenarios which may be of greater or lesser complexity incorporating attributes on the perception of impact high moderate low risk or on its temporality imminent medium or long term narváez et al 2009 4 materials y methods 4 1 location and hydrogeological characteristics of the study area the urban expansion zone is located on the western side of the urban area of the city of pereira colombia between latitudes 4820 and 4793 and longitudes 75 821 and 75 767 fig 1 with an area of 898 19 ha which corresponds to 62 92 of the total area of the municipality the zone located in an altitudinal range between 1100 and 1250 m a s l is situated in the recharge area of the pereira and dosquebradas aquifer system which was identified through the application of isotopic techniques rainwater infiltration from precipitation recorded from a theoretical height of 1500 m a s l to a defined regional base level in the cauca river was established as the main recharge mechanism therefore in the area of outcrop of the aquifer recharge occurs between 1200 and 1500 m a s l otálvaro 2007 with the different campaigns for measuring static levels in deep wells carried out since 2007 a trend in groundwater flows in the e w direction regionally consistent with surface flows was found the geological unit tqp denominated pereira formation where the aquifer is located is characterized by unconsolidated deposits volcanic ashes mudflow and piedmont deposits in its stratotype it consists of two sequences the upper one of volcanic ash that can reach a thickness greater than 35 m and the lower one by fluvial and glacial volcanic deposits ingeominas 1993 arias 2004 the pereira formation aquifer tqp was classified with low productivity levels finding values of specific capacity between 0 5 and 1 0 l s m however it is considered the one with the greatest hydrogeological interest since it has characteristics that allow the transportation and accumulation of groundwater it also has a large area and known thicknesses in some cases exceeding 300 m otálvaro et al 2009 regarding geomorphology the expansion zone is located in the geomorphological unit of the volcanic fluvial fan consisting of elongated mountains in the e w direction of broad semi flat peaks with semi concave long slopes and high slopes based on the application and integration of the obtained information from geophysical methods for the modeling of the subsoil stratigraphic columns raised in the deep wells of the area and vertical electrical soundings three levels of the pereira formation were defined at the first level ocher clay soil with thicknesses up to 19 m and high resistivity a second level consisting mostly of volcanic ash with average thicknesses of 30 m which can reach values up to 120 m according to magneto gravimetric models and a third level where debris flows pyroclastic flows conglomerates and sand clay matrix sand predominate with varying depths according to the underlying geology otálvaro et al 2009 in the expansion zone there is groundwater exploitation to meet the demand for different uses human and domestic industrial agricultural and recreational consumption among others during the inventory of groundwater points gwps carried out in 2012 and 2015 89 gwps were identified 86 reservoirs and 3 deep wells of which 44 were productive followed by 44 in reserve and finally 12 abandoned the above indicates that the resource is strategic in terms of demand for the study area carder 2007 the most representative land use is pasture mosaic with natural spaces that cover 50 9 of the total area followed by the discontinuous urban fabric with 18 5 bamboo forests with 8 67 and mosaic of pastures and crops 6 6 there is no detailed information on agricultural activities however during the gathering of primary information pineapple coffee citrus and sugarcane crops were identified among others 4 2 mapping groundwater vulnerability for the determination of the intrinsic vulnerability in the urban expansion zone the drastic method was applied the selection and application of the model was carried out based on the existing information for each of the variables required by the method and the scale of evaluation mavdt 2010 the selected method was adapted according to the needs of the research this model assumes that contaminants enter the system from the surface and that they move at the same speed as groundwater drastic considers seven variables depth depth of the water level recharge recharge aquifer aquifer lithology soil soil type topography topography maximum slope impact nature of the area not saturated and hydraulic conductivity permeability the method has been especially popular for assessing vulnerability in areas where agricultural activity is prominent in addition many variations of drastic have been proposed to adjust it to specific environmental conditions during the last 10 15 years several researchers have modified the original or generic drastic method by reallocating new values to the rating ranges relative weights and vulnerability classes and adding and or eliminating some of the factors machiwal et al 2018 as drastic cd secunda et al 1998 modify drastic klug 2009 drtic zhang et al 2009 drastic p mavdt 2010 and modified drastic sener and davraz 2013 among others the main advantage in using the drastic method to assess vulnerability to aquifer contamination is the flexibility to include or exclude model parameters depending on local conditions the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifers and the availability of data machiwal et al 2018 4 3 drastic method adaptation to adjust the drastic method to the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer in the urban expansion zone the variable a was reclassified aquifer s lithology and variable i nature of the unsaturated zone and the variable s soil was eliminated obtaining the modified method of acronym dratic the modifications are described below 4 3 1 reclassification of a aquifer s lithology the classification established by the drastic method for the variable a does not allow to evaluate representative elements of the study area such as clays according to kabbour et al 2004 the infiltration of contaminated water depends on the silt and clay content of the soils the richer in clay the soil is the less infiltration of liquid contaminants it will have due to the above the reclassification of the variable a was carried out in such a way that there was coherence with the lithology of the expansion zone 4 3 2 reclassification of i nature of the unsaturated zone the same reclassification of a was applied taking into account that for the two variables the same limitation was found and that the purpose of its evaluation is to determine the amount of percolating water that reaches the water table mavdt 2010 in addition when the aquifer is free it corresponds to the aquifer s own lithology martínez et al 1998 on the other hand in the lithological columns consulted no differences were established between the saturated and unsaturated zones therefore i was taken from the ground level to the water table and a from the water table to the depth of the groundwater points gwp that were taken into account for the application of the method 4 3 3 elimination of s soil the information for the application of the variable s is limited for the urban expansion zone the geology determined for the zone is homogeneous and corresponds to the formation tqp meaning it would have the same rating for the entire area which does not contribute significantly to the determination of vulnerability on the other hand one of the most common modifications for the method is the change of the variable soil to uses of the soil which is retaken for this investigation but not evaluated from the vulnerability of the aquifer but from the factor of anthropic threat based on the foregoing this variable was omitted for this study and it is assumed that it is included in the variable i 4 3 4 bases for the modification of the drastic method the purpose of the modified variables a i s is to evaluate the capacity of the porous and or fractured mean to transmit the contaminants mavdt 2010 from the above the reclassification table 1 was made taking into account the wentworth particle size scale the k permeability coefficient and the reclassification made by kabbour et al 2004 based on surface lithopedology studies and vertical electrical soundings 4 4 application process of the modified dratic method the procedure for the implementation of the method involved hydrogeological data collection secondary sources standardization and data digitization consolidation of tables that show the range of values of the studied parameters weight and rating creation of the raster layer using the kriging method of the arcgis 10 2 1 software which allows to process geographic information reclassification based on the values of the drastic methodology creation of thematic maps according to the weights of the modified dratic method and production of the final map of intrinsic vulnerability to pollution in the urban expansion zone based on calculations of the different mapped layers 4 5 anthropic threats identification regarding the determination of potentially polluting activities the main pollution mechanisms for groundwater were identified and grouped into 6 categories wells and reservoirs management solid waste management and disposal contamination by surface water sources management of hydrocarbons and toxic or hazardous substances management and disposal of wastewater agricultural production and land uses in addition parameters of analysis of the method pollutant origin and its surcharge hydraulically posh are taken as reference which enables an evaluation of the potential sources of contamination in three levels low medium and high and the guide to determine the risk of contamination of groundwater based on existing data foster and hirata 1988 primary information was collected through simple observation and semi structured interviews conducted with the key actors identified in the study area the tool for the collection of primary information was the national unique form for the inventory of groundwater points funias of the colombian institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam the colombian geological service cgs and the ministry of environment and sustainable development mads the secondary information was collected through bibliographic records from the official pages of the companies providing public services official publications the integrated groundwater management plan in pereira studies conducted by the water and sanitation research group gias technological university of pereira utp among other documents and degree works related to the study area 4 6 risk evaluation for groundwater contamination finally by overlapping the intrinsic vulnerability map of the aquifer and maps of the anthropogenic threats hazard maps were generated for aquifer contamination according to each type of threat wsp solid waste surface sources hydrocarbons and hazardous substances agricultural production and a classification of the identified social actors was elaborated qualifying their influence and taking into account the implementation of the proposed actions of each actor in the territory 5 results and discussion 5 1 intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer by contamination fig 2 shows the results of the evaluation of the parameters of the modified drastic method depth recharge lithology of the aquifer topography nature of the unsaturated zone and hydraulic conductivity dratic as shown in fig 2 the variable topography t represented the most critical condition in the evaluation of vulnerability by the score assigned during the qualification as well as the values obtained from surface water levels which correspond to levels of free aquifers which once contaminated could adversely affect the quality of the groundwater of deeper aquifers carder 2007 given the nature of the geological strata of the free aquifers they are more sensitive to the pollution generated by socioeconomic activities developed in the recharge zones fig 3 shows the vulnerability map to the contamination of the aquifer in the urban expansion zone generated from the parameters indicated in fig 2 in 58 3 of the total area mainly in the south eastern part has a moderate vulnerability while 33 3 of the area is classified as highly vulnerable and in an area that covers 8 3 of the study area there is a very high vulnerability to the northeast mainly associated with a high recharge area and surface water levels the results obtained in the map of intrinsic vulnerability to pollution allowed to identify the most susceptible areas before the input of polluting loads in the recharge zone therefore they are areas of special hydrogeological importance that are relevant for the definition of monitoring and control mechanism oriented to the protection of groundwater at the same time the vulnerability map is a planning tool for the sustainable management of aquifers in areas of urban expansion several researches at a global and national level have determined the intrinsic vulnerability to the contamination of aquifers applying the modified drastic method secunda et al 1998 added a new parameter to the model incorporating the agricultural use of the land for long periods of time the results obtained showed an acceptable degree of correspondence for the study area between the modified drastic drastic index and the high levels of nitrates found in groundwater by agricultural activities developed in the sharon region of israel klug 2009 modified the ranges of some factors of the drastic model in order to bring the assessment of the method closer with the local hydrogeological configurations of a county in houston the modification of the drastic model adapted to the local hydrogeological configurations and the combination of the use of systems of geographic information enabled the creation of a visual tool that would represent areas of risk wang et al 2007 used a modified version of the drastic model called dramic to assess the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution taking into account the hydrogeological conditions of most chinese cities from the original model the variables d r a and i were conserved the variable topography was not considered in the model the variable s was replaced by a variable m related to the thickness of the aquifer and the hydraulic conductivity of the of the aquifer was replaced in the evaluation by a new factor related to the impact of the pollutant c as a result a vulnerability map was generated using gis the areas of high vulnerability correlated adequately with the areas where organic pollutant concentrations were found in groundwater in china wu et al 2014 excluded drastic parameters t and c due to small differences in topography and low hydraulic gradient in the study area likewise khan et al 2014 eliminated the t parameter and modified drastic to the original drasic which was then coupled with other analytical information techniques to define different zones of vulnerability for the aquifers in the study area carder 2007 evaluated vulnerability to contamination through the god method for the pereira formation aquifer resulting in a medium vulnerability for the urban expansion zone being a score according to the results of the present study taking into account the variation of the method and the size of study areas the modifications made to the drastic method have made it possible to adjust the available information according to the conditions of the premises in addition they have proved to be a useful tool for assessing the specific vulnerability to the contamination of aquifers mainly due to the development of agricultural activities the original drastic has also been modified to take into account groundwater nitrate risk assessment from diffuse sources associated with agricultural activities therefore the method has taken the name of d drastic where d represents the dynamic nature of the soluble pollutants represented by the interactions between runoff soil unsaturated and groundwater machiwal et al 2018 in general all assessments of vulnerability to aquifer contamination by the drastic or modified drastic methods have resulted in maps with the delimitation of areas that require differential management some of them located in urban complexes urban expansion areas and areas with extensive development of agricultural activities given the growing demand for groundwater for various uses these assessments represent a challenge for environmental planners since actions are needed to protect the quality of groundwater and any assessment of vulnerability to contamination has uncertainties that depend on the criteria of the researcher and the information available nrc 1993 ríos and vélez 2008 and therefore the results will have to be validated and adjusted 5 2 anthropic threats identification fig 4 presents the results obtained from the classification of existing threats punctual and diffuse in general the threat of high pollution in the expansion area is mainly due to inadequate disposal of wastewater directly on the ground added to the sanitary conditions of the groundwater points however the determination of pollution levels and the nature of the pollutant would only be achieved through a detailed in situ study of the efficiency of the treatment of wastewater the high hydrocarbon threat is based on the nature of the activity but contingency plans and hydrocarbon leakage monitoring wells reduce this rating in the risk configuration the management of solid waste in the study area is adequate and represents a low threat the actors have a registry of waste or hazardous waste generators respel and therefore make the appropriate provision with external environmental managers the perception of groundwater held by the actors in the area is fundamental in taking corrective actions otherwise they can cause negative impacts becoming a potential threat of contamination for the aquifer in this study case it was found that 61 of the interviewed actors do not know the dynamics of groundwater even though 21 of those actors make use of this resource on the other hand 33 of the actors recognize sources of contamination for groundwater such as fuel filling stations tanks for fuel storage fumigation with agrochemicals and water puddles from saturated infiltration fields and old lagoons regarding the recognition of the importance of groundwater 73 identify the resource as a key aspect because shortage of water associated with climate variability and lack of aqueduct systems in some sectors however 70 consider that the resource is not reliable for human consumption 5 3 contamination risk evaluation fig 5 shows the hazard maps of the aquifer contamination in the urban expansion zone according to each type of threat groundwater point solid waste domestic wastewater surface sources hydrocarbons and hazardous substances and agricultural activities during the evaluation of aquifer contamination risk factors in the urban expansion zone it was found that industrial activities and oil pipelines constitute a risk scenario given that they can affect the quality of groundwater due to hydrocarbon leaks and storage of toxic and dangerous substances on the other hand there is no significant risk associated with the use of agrochemicals for agricultural activity however it is important in future studies to evaluate more accurately the behavior of this variable in the area through the monitoring of pollutants in groundwater since agriculture has been recognized as an activity that affects it in terms of quality and quantity according to spadotto et al 2004 among agricultural activities sugarcane and citrus fruits are those that make frequent and often incorrect use of agrochemicals and represent potential sources of contamination of agricultural soils surface and groundwater and in the study area there is knowledge of land uses with these crops the inadequate management of groundwater points presented a high risk in 12 5 of the 24 points evaluated in the field and an average risk in 45 8 of the points in the case of the inadequate management of solid waste there was a high risk in 10 7 of the points evaluated 28 points in total which are characterized by the manipulation of harmful substances while the discharge of wastewater to the soil presented a high risk in 38 2 of the points under study 34 points in total in the risk evaluation by surface sources the results obtained show discharges that form a low degree of aquifer contamination risk it should be noted that although this component was evaluated the relationship between the aquifer and the surface sources of the area has not yet been determined it is important to note that a vulnerability analysis is not so useful without a threat probability that allows a pre assessment of the risk of contamination even if it is not of a quantitative nature díaz 2005 several groundwater protection studies have assessed the risk of contamination using the mapping of intrinsic vulnerability by the drastic method combined with hazard mapping saidi et al 2011 different methodologies have been developed to determine the intrinsic vulnerability to groundwater contamination taking into account particular physical attributes of a given aquifer but they almost never address the impact of human activity costa et al 2019 which implies challenge for risk management with the obtained results from the pollution risk evaluation in the urban expansion zone there is an advance in the knowledge of the vulnerability based on the analysis of the hydrogeological conditions and characteristics of the aquifer and an approach to the configuration of threats or hazards by the multiple anthropic activities developed the information generated serves as a support to plan the urban development of the city towards these zones incorporating groundwater conservation strategies that allow guaranteeing the sustainability of the resource in terms of quality and quantity however it is necessary to validate these results by characterizing the activities which implies the measurement of quality data pollutant load evaluation and the detailed collection of information in the field torres et al 2014 in addition detailed investigations must be carried out that incorporate the implementation of monitoring and control programs for the quality of groundwater as proposed by foster and hirata 1988 it is also necessary to highlight that all the actions carried out for the conservation of the aquifer must be linked to awareness campaigns and environmental education to promote the change of attitude of the diverse actors related to the aquifer carder 2007 likewise it is important to evaluate other contamination risk conditions taking into account the characteristics of groundwater from both free and confined and semi confined aquifers given that their characteristics are different and require the application of differentiated methodologies this is because the main risk of shallow groundwater is contamination and not its exploitation as in the case with deep groundwater li et al 2018 6 conclusions the application of the drastic method is of great help in areas where there are not many hydrogeological data and dynamic and hydraulic characteristics of each geological formation and in turn can be adjusted to the conditions presented in the study area allowing a better evaluation of the intrinsic vulnerability to aquifer contamination the identification of anthropic threats is improved when the perception about the use of groundwater and the problematic that is generated around the subterranean hydric resource is taken into account by the key actors of the study area optimizing the corrective decision making otherwise they can become a potential and permanent threat of aquifer contamination the risk evaluation of groundwater contamination involves the integration of two different methodologies on one hand methodologies for the determination of the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer and on the other hand methodologies that identify threats or hazards derived from anthropic activities both provide a better approximation to the conditions of the aquifers studied and allow to determine the affectation probability in terms of groundwater quality in certain areas of the aquifer the risk of contamination reflects a high classification by wastewater due to the final disposition in the land inadequate maintenance and conditions of vulnerability of the aquifer which reflects the need to develop strategies to strengthen the systems of in situ disposition and implementation of wastewater treatment systems the evaluation of aquifer contamination risk allows on one hand to delimit and prioritize areas of special hydrogeological importance where it is necessary to restrict potentially polluting activities and at the same time support decision making in the adequate planning of urban areas and urban expansion to guarantee the permanence of groundwater with quality and quantity criteria

12134,in colombia hydric resources research has focused mainly on surface water sources however the use and protection of groundwater has become important in regions where the access to surface water is difficult in the city of pereira colombia it is estimated that the population growth rate is of 0 47 per year growing from 457 667 inhabitants in 2011 to 481 080 inhabitants in 2020 facts like this have generated great interest in the study and protection of groundwater the objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of groundwater contamination in the aquifer of pereira within the limits of the urban expansion zone of the municipality of pereira colombian coffee growing region by determining the intrinsic vulnerability using the modified drastic method and the identification of anthropic threats in the study area according with the findings the moderate vulnerability class is the dominant one representing the 58 3 of the aquifer s area followed by high vulnerability class with 33 3 of the total area and the class of very high vulnerability with 8 3 of the area associated with a zone with high hydrogeological recharge conditions and shallow phreatic levels inadequate disposal of domestic wastewater the existence of hydrocarbon conduction pipes and agricultural activity were identified as the activities that generate a high threat of contamination finally the evaluation of the risk of contamination of the aquifer in the urban expansion zone through the superposition of maps of intrinsic vulnerability and anthropic threats allowed to differentiate the zones of the aquifer where groundwater presents a high risk of contamination the obtained results provide information for knowledge and sustainable management of the aquifer since it allows the delimitation of the areas where it s necessary to restrict the development of activities that deteriorate the quality of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater risk groundwater vulnerability drastic urban expansion groundwater contamination anthropic threats 1 introduction according to unesco 2018 more than 2 billion people in the world do not have access to safe drinking water and more than twice that number do not have access to safe sanitation besides as a consequence of the rapid growth of the world s population an increase of almost one third of the actual water demand is expected by the year 2050 kamble et al 2017 and ochoa et al 2017 affirm that the urbanization population growth and the increment of economic and productive activities are the main reasons for the affectation in terms of quantity and quality of surface and groundwater limiting the availability of the resource by quality worldwide about half of the water supply comes from deposits stored in aquifers with irrigation being the main use of groundwater unesco 2012 the availability of groundwater for different uses is particularly important in times of extreme climatic events which makes it a strategic resource within the framework of climate variability unesco 2012 kumar 2012 generally research has focused on surface water systems where the impacts of climate change could be more noticeable however it is necessary to study in depth how groundwater can respond to climate change in relation to its availability for different uses unesco 2015 although groundwater is considered an alternative resource the impact on its quality has become a global concern gleeson et al 2012 custodio 2014 united nations 2011 world water assessment program wwap 2015 the lack or inadequate operation and maintenance of sewerage and wastewater treatment systems powell et al 2003 and the expansion of the agricultural frontier have been recognized as the main anthropic activities that are affecting groundwater in terms of quality ruddiman 2013 palma et al 2015 these activities are related to urban areas and urban expansion areas without adequate sanitation and where multiple socioeconomic and productive activities are developed which generate different types of pollutants which within vulnerable hydrogeological environments reach saturated areas and adversely affect the quality of groundwater powell et al 2003 salman et al 2018 the increasing demand for residential industrial and agricultural uses has led to the depletion of groundwater and the decline in quality in many regions of the world kalhor et al 2019 according with the colombian ministry of environment and sustainable development mads 2014 although groundwater is not the main source of supply it is an important and practically the only alternative in areas where there is a scarcity of surface water in the city of pereira coffee growing region in colombia the local environmental protection agency carder 2007 found out that groundwater is mainly used in the urban expansion zones due to its access quality and low costs related to conduction and treatment which make it attractive especially for the commercial and industrial sectors located in these areas however urban expansion zones are located in the recharge zones of the aquifer the city of pereira has been developed in recent decades by a disorganized growth with urbanizations in the interior in the peripheries of the city and in suburban areas increasing threats associated with the alteration of the environmental structure of the territory soil and both superficial and groundwater pollution due to inadequate disposal of liquid and solid waste derived from the lack of home public service systems that are typical of urban areas gaviria 2009 as a way to have a better control carder formulated in 2007 the integrated groundwater management plan of pereira and dosquebradas carder 2007 and since that several studies have been developed to know the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system and its affectation in terms of quality and quantity due to the development of anthropic activities restrepo 2014 proposed the generation of knowledge by the integration of multiple areas such as integrated water resources management and risk management plus topics associated with vulnerability from a physical agricultural social economic and political perspective among others and through these intervention strategies or guidelines were proposed in social environmental planning and conservation scopes among others paredes et al 2016 related the advance in the first generated experiences in the knowledge of the groundwater resource of the city of pereira focusing on the determination of the impacts of urban growth and alternatives of groundwater management in the western expansion zone of the pereira municipality through the calculation of the monthly recharge of the aquifer using widely accepted hydrological models the analysis and selection of alternatives for the mitigation of impacts on the water quality of the aquifer and finally proposes operational and maintenance strategies for monitoring the recharge in the study zone 2 vision of the study the main vision of the study is to develop a management tool that will allow decision making to prevent groundwater pollution based on the aquifer contamination risk evaluation in the study area therefore in the present study threats or hazards derived from anthropic activities and intrinsic vulnerability to aquifer contamination were identified and the risk to groundwater contamination at the urban expansion zone in pereira colombia was evaluated the vulnerability assessment was carried out by applying the modified drastic method from the hydrogeological knowledge of the study area this method has the advantage that the variables used can be integrated and processed using a geographical information system gis 3 literature review in order to adequately manage groundwater resources vulnerability susceptibility and potential risk of contamination evaluation in aquifers becomes a key tool since it allows the decision makers to plan resource protection matzeu et al 2017 risk evaluation allows the identification of areas where aquifers are more vulnerable to degradation due to their hydrogeological characteristics and in addition the recognition of threats due to the development of socio economic activities in the territory in a risk evaluation where risk is defined as the relationship between hazard and vulnerability the combined qualification of possible noxiousness presented by a contamination source and the propagation possibility inwards and outwards the saturated area could be interpreted as groundwater contamination probability in both quantitative and qualitative terms depending on the method used johansson 1999 nixdorf et al 2017 the contamination risk in essence is the probability of a determined pollutant reaches the saturated area to exist risk it is necessary the presence of a polluting action or threat an objective to pollute saturated area and a connection route between them intrinsic vulnerability risks exist when these three components converge space temporarily igme 2007 vulnerability of aquifers to contamination is not a property that can be measured directly through the gathering of information in the field rather it is an idea based on the concept that some areas are more susceptible than others to the contamination of their underground water resources vrba and zaporozec 1994 in a simple way the vulnerability of groundwater resources is defined as ease with which a system can be altered by natural factors and human activity with little capacity of resilience the greater the degree of vulnerability the more difficult it is to promote the sustainable development of the aquifer wang et al 2012 the estimation of vulnerability to contamination of aquifers is a way to graphically synthesize the complex hydrogeological information in a more understandable way for environmental authorities scientists and the general public vulnerability maps are necessary in groundwater management programs because they identify the areas where the monitoring and protection of aquifers should be prioritized facilitate risk evaluation and it can also be an effective mean of education and awareness raising for users in general liggett and talwar 2009 several researchers have proposed methodologies to evaluate the vulnerability to contamination of aquifers in a general way it can be categorized into intrinsic vulnerability based on the geological hydrogeological and hydrological characteristics of the study area without considering the nature and the consequence of the pollutant and specific vulnerability which takes into account the inherent vulnerability and the property of the pollutant vrba and zaporozec 1994 gogu and dassargues 2000 there are several methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability and can be classified into three categories overlay index methods based on ratings and weights drastic god avi sintacs dristpi epik pi cop process based mathematical models gleams hydrus and statistical models however the methodology election depends mainly on the information s availability and the characteristics of the studied aquifer busico et al 2017 jarray et al 2017 jang et al 2017 jafari et al 2016 neshat and pradhan 2015 langrudi et al 2016 the overlay methods are based on the combination of different parameters and are used for the evaluation of the intrinsic vulnerability conditioned by the hydrogeological characteristics of the terrain where each parameter is quantitatively punctuated and they can be assigned different weighting values to determine the final result which is a numerical index of vulnerability mavdt 2010 among these the drastic index is one of the most used methods erazo and thompson 2013 li and merchant 2013 langrudi et al 2016 jang et al 2017 huan et al 2018 however it has also limitations such as assuming a constant range and weight of parameters for each region langrudi et al 2016 on the other hand the threats or hazards are related to potentially contaminating anthropic activities associated with urbanization processes in areas of urban expansion which are characterized by the development of new and diverse economic activities as the establishment of urban infrastructure and transportation and agricultural commercial and livestock activities among others aguilar 2006 according to nixdorf et al 2017 for a detailed evaluation of potential contamination threats in a determined aquifer the information on the contamination source and the characteristics of the contaminants must be taken into investigation but the difficulties found while obtaining these specific data lead many researchers to prefer an evaluation system based on indexes for determined hazards wang et al 2012 an approach usually applied to aquifers or small basins is to establish an inventory of possible danger source combined with weighting and rating schemes kuisi et al 2014 aliewi and al khatib 2015 the risk evaluation is carried out taking into account that it is a dynamic changing with the activity carried out and interactive changing depending on the protective measures lavell 2003 process and its knowledge becomes important since once the aquifer is polluted it is very difficult and expensive to restore it this is how risk management becomes a key factor allowing the prevention reduction and constant control of risk factors in society integrated to sustainable human economic environmental and territorial development narváez et al 2009 risk management is based on the identification of risk factors threat objective to pollute and vulnerability foster and hirata 1991 and their conformation processes including the social actors involved in their configuration this knowledge allows the construction of risk scenarios which may be of greater or lesser complexity incorporating attributes on the perception of impact high moderate low risk or on its temporality imminent medium or long term narváez et al 2009 4 materials y methods 4 1 location and hydrogeological characteristics of the study area the urban expansion zone is located on the western side of the urban area of the city of pereira colombia between latitudes 4820 and 4793 and longitudes 75 821 and 75 767 fig 1 with an area of 898 19 ha which corresponds to 62 92 of the total area of the municipality the zone located in an altitudinal range between 1100 and 1250 m a s l is situated in the recharge area of the pereira and dosquebradas aquifer system which was identified through the application of isotopic techniques rainwater infiltration from precipitation recorded from a theoretical height of 1500 m a s l to a defined regional base level in the cauca river was established as the main recharge mechanism therefore in the area of outcrop of the aquifer recharge occurs between 1200 and 1500 m a s l otálvaro 2007 with the different campaigns for measuring static levels in deep wells carried out since 2007 a trend in groundwater flows in the e w direction regionally consistent with surface flows was found the geological unit tqp denominated pereira formation where the aquifer is located is characterized by unconsolidated deposits volcanic ashes mudflow and piedmont deposits in its stratotype it consists of two sequences the upper one of volcanic ash that can reach a thickness greater than 35 m and the lower one by fluvial and glacial volcanic deposits ingeominas 1993 arias 2004 the pereira formation aquifer tqp was classified with low productivity levels finding values of specific capacity between 0 5 and 1 0 l s m however it is considered the one with the greatest hydrogeological interest since it has characteristics that allow the transportation and accumulation of groundwater it also has a large area and known thicknesses in some cases exceeding 300 m otálvaro et al 2009 regarding geomorphology the expansion zone is located in the geomorphological unit of the volcanic fluvial fan consisting of elongated mountains in the e w direction of broad semi flat peaks with semi concave long slopes and high slopes based on the application and integration of the obtained information from geophysical methods for the modeling of the subsoil stratigraphic columns raised in the deep wells of the area and vertical electrical soundings three levels of the pereira formation were defined at the first level ocher clay soil with thicknesses up to 19 m and high resistivity a second level consisting mostly of volcanic ash with average thicknesses of 30 m which can reach values up to 120 m according to magneto gravimetric models and a third level where debris flows pyroclastic flows conglomerates and sand clay matrix sand predominate with varying depths according to the underlying geology otálvaro et al 2009 in the expansion zone there is groundwater exploitation to meet the demand for different uses human and domestic industrial agricultural and recreational consumption among others during the inventory of groundwater points gwps carried out in 2012 and 2015 89 gwps were identified 86 reservoirs and 3 deep wells of which 44 were productive followed by 44 in reserve and finally 12 abandoned the above indicates that the resource is strategic in terms of demand for the study area carder 2007 the most representative land use is pasture mosaic with natural spaces that cover 50 9 of the total area followed by the discontinuous urban fabric with 18 5 bamboo forests with 8 67 and mosaic of pastures and crops 6 6 there is no detailed information on agricultural activities however during the gathering of primary information pineapple coffee citrus and sugarcane crops were identified among others 4 2 mapping groundwater vulnerability for the determination of the intrinsic vulnerability in the urban expansion zone the drastic method was applied the selection and application of the model was carried out based on the existing information for each of the variables required by the method and the scale of evaluation mavdt 2010 the selected method was adapted according to the needs of the research this model assumes that contaminants enter the system from the surface and that they move at the same speed as groundwater drastic considers seven variables depth depth of the water level recharge recharge aquifer aquifer lithology soil soil type topography topography maximum slope impact nature of the area not saturated and hydraulic conductivity permeability the method has been especially popular for assessing vulnerability in areas where agricultural activity is prominent in addition many variations of drastic have been proposed to adjust it to specific environmental conditions during the last 10 15 years several researchers have modified the original or generic drastic method by reallocating new values to the rating ranges relative weights and vulnerability classes and adding and or eliminating some of the factors machiwal et al 2018 as drastic cd secunda et al 1998 modify drastic klug 2009 drtic zhang et al 2009 drastic p mavdt 2010 and modified drastic sener and davraz 2013 among others the main advantage in using the drastic method to assess vulnerability to aquifer contamination is the flexibility to include or exclude model parameters depending on local conditions the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifers and the availability of data machiwal et al 2018 4 3 drastic method adaptation to adjust the drastic method to the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer in the urban expansion zone the variable a was reclassified aquifer s lithology and variable i nature of the unsaturated zone and the variable s soil was eliminated obtaining the modified method of acronym dratic the modifications are described below 4 3 1 reclassification of a aquifer s lithology the classification established by the drastic method for the variable a does not allow to evaluate representative elements of the study area such as clays according to kabbour et al 2004 the infiltration of contaminated water depends on the silt and clay content of the soils the richer in clay the soil is the less infiltration of liquid contaminants it will have due to the above the reclassification of the variable a was carried out in such a way that there was coherence with the lithology of the expansion zone 4 3 2 reclassification of i nature of the unsaturated zone the same reclassification of a was applied taking into account that for the two variables the same limitation was found and that the purpose of its evaluation is to determine the amount of percolating water that reaches the water table mavdt 2010 in addition when the aquifer is free it corresponds to the aquifer s own lithology martínez et al 1998 on the other hand in the lithological columns consulted no differences were established between the saturated and unsaturated zones therefore i was taken from the ground level to the water table and a from the water table to the depth of the groundwater points gwp that were taken into account for the application of the method 4 3 3 elimination of s soil the information for the application of the variable s is limited for the urban expansion zone the geology determined for the zone is homogeneous and corresponds to the formation tqp meaning it would have the same rating for the entire area which does not contribute significantly to the determination of vulnerability on the other hand one of the most common modifications for the method is the change of the variable soil to uses of the soil which is retaken for this investigation but not evaluated from the vulnerability of the aquifer but from the factor of anthropic threat based on the foregoing this variable was omitted for this study and it is assumed that it is included in the variable i 4 3 4 bases for the modification of the drastic method the purpose of the modified variables a i s is to evaluate the capacity of the porous and or fractured mean to transmit the contaminants mavdt 2010 from the above the reclassification table 1 was made taking into account the wentworth particle size scale the k permeability coefficient and the reclassification made by kabbour et al 2004 based on surface lithopedology studies and vertical electrical soundings 4 4 application process of the modified dratic method the procedure for the implementation of the method involved hydrogeological data collection secondary sources standardization and data digitization consolidation of tables that show the range of values of the studied parameters weight and rating creation of the raster layer using the kriging method of the arcgis 10 2 1 software which allows to process geographic information reclassification based on the values of the drastic methodology creation of thematic maps according to the weights of the modified dratic method and production of the final map of intrinsic vulnerability to pollution in the urban expansion zone based on calculations of the different mapped layers 4 5 anthropic threats identification regarding the determination of potentially polluting activities the main pollution mechanisms for groundwater were identified and grouped into 6 categories wells and reservoirs management solid waste management and disposal contamination by surface water sources management of hydrocarbons and toxic or hazardous substances management and disposal of wastewater agricultural production and land uses in addition parameters of analysis of the method pollutant origin and its surcharge hydraulically posh are taken as reference which enables an evaluation of the potential sources of contamination in three levels low medium and high and the guide to determine the risk of contamination of groundwater based on existing data foster and hirata 1988 primary information was collected through simple observation and semi structured interviews conducted with the key actors identified in the study area the tool for the collection of primary information was the national unique form for the inventory of groundwater points funias of the colombian institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam the colombian geological service cgs and the ministry of environment and sustainable development mads the secondary information was collected through bibliographic records from the official pages of the companies providing public services official publications the integrated groundwater management plan in pereira studies conducted by the water and sanitation research group gias technological university of pereira utp among other documents and degree works related to the study area 4 6 risk evaluation for groundwater contamination finally by overlapping the intrinsic vulnerability map of the aquifer and maps of the anthropogenic threats hazard maps were generated for aquifer contamination according to each type of threat wsp solid waste surface sources hydrocarbons and hazardous substances agricultural production and a classification of the identified social actors was elaborated qualifying their influence and taking into account the implementation of the proposed actions of each actor in the territory 5 results and discussion 5 1 intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer by contamination fig 2 shows the results of the evaluation of the parameters of the modified drastic method depth recharge lithology of the aquifer topography nature of the unsaturated zone and hydraulic conductivity dratic as shown in fig 2 the variable topography t represented the most critical condition in the evaluation of vulnerability by the score assigned during the qualification as well as the values obtained from surface water levels which correspond to levels of free aquifers which once contaminated could adversely affect the quality of the groundwater of deeper aquifers carder 2007 given the nature of the geological strata of the free aquifers they are more sensitive to the pollution generated by socioeconomic activities developed in the recharge zones fig 3 shows the vulnerability map to the contamination of the aquifer in the urban expansion zone generated from the parameters indicated in fig 2 in 58 3 of the total area mainly in the south eastern part has a moderate vulnerability while 33 3 of the area is classified as highly vulnerable and in an area that covers 8 3 of the study area there is a very high vulnerability to the northeast mainly associated with a high recharge area and surface water levels the results obtained in the map of intrinsic vulnerability to pollution allowed to identify the most susceptible areas before the input of polluting loads in the recharge zone therefore they are areas of special hydrogeological importance that are relevant for the definition of monitoring and control mechanism oriented to the protection of groundwater at the same time the vulnerability map is a planning tool for the sustainable management of aquifers in areas of urban expansion several researches at a global and national level have determined the intrinsic vulnerability to the contamination of aquifers applying the modified drastic method secunda et al 1998 added a new parameter to the model incorporating the agricultural use of the land for long periods of time the results obtained showed an acceptable degree of correspondence for the study area between the modified drastic drastic index and the high levels of nitrates found in groundwater by agricultural activities developed in the sharon region of israel klug 2009 modified the ranges of some factors of the drastic model in order to bring the assessment of the method closer with the local hydrogeological configurations of a county in houston the modification of the drastic model adapted to the local hydrogeological configurations and the combination of the use of systems of geographic information enabled the creation of a visual tool that would represent areas of risk wang et al 2007 used a modified version of the drastic model called dramic to assess the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution taking into account the hydrogeological conditions of most chinese cities from the original model the variables d r a and i were conserved the variable topography was not considered in the model the variable s was replaced by a variable m related to the thickness of the aquifer and the hydraulic conductivity of the of the aquifer was replaced in the evaluation by a new factor related to the impact of the pollutant c as a result a vulnerability map was generated using gis the areas of high vulnerability correlated adequately with the areas where organic pollutant concentrations were found in groundwater in china wu et al 2014 excluded drastic parameters t and c due to small differences in topography and low hydraulic gradient in the study area likewise khan et al 2014 eliminated the t parameter and modified drastic to the original drasic which was then coupled with other analytical information techniques to define different zones of vulnerability for the aquifers in the study area carder 2007 evaluated vulnerability to contamination through the god method for the pereira formation aquifer resulting in a medium vulnerability for the urban expansion zone being a score according to the results of the present study taking into account the variation of the method and the size of study areas the modifications made to the drastic method have made it possible to adjust the available information according to the conditions of the premises in addition they have proved to be a useful tool for assessing the specific vulnerability to the contamination of aquifers mainly due to the development of agricultural activities the original drastic has also been modified to take into account groundwater nitrate risk assessment from diffuse sources associated with agricultural activities therefore the method has taken the name of d drastic where d represents the dynamic nature of the soluble pollutants represented by the interactions between runoff soil unsaturated and groundwater machiwal et al 2018 in general all assessments of vulnerability to aquifer contamination by the drastic or modified drastic methods have resulted in maps with the delimitation of areas that require differential management some of them located in urban complexes urban expansion areas and areas with extensive development of agricultural activities given the growing demand for groundwater for various uses these assessments represent a challenge for environmental planners since actions are needed to protect the quality of groundwater and any assessment of vulnerability to contamination has uncertainties that depend on the criteria of the researcher and the information available nrc 1993 ríos and vélez 2008 and therefore the results will have to be validated and adjusted 5 2 anthropic threats identification fig 4 presents the results obtained from the classification of existing threats punctual and diffuse in general the threat of high pollution in the expansion area is mainly due to inadequate disposal of wastewater directly on the ground added to the sanitary conditions of the groundwater points however the determination of pollution levels and the nature of the pollutant would only be achieved through a detailed in situ study of the efficiency of the treatment of wastewater the high hydrocarbon threat is based on the nature of the activity but contingency plans and hydrocarbon leakage monitoring wells reduce this rating in the risk configuration the management of solid waste in the study area is adequate and represents a low threat the actors have a registry of waste or hazardous waste generators respel and therefore make the appropriate provision with external environmental managers the perception of groundwater held by the actors in the area is fundamental in taking corrective actions otherwise they can cause negative impacts becoming a potential threat of contamination for the aquifer in this study case it was found that 61 of the interviewed actors do not know the dynamics of groundwater even though 21 of those actors make use of this resource on the other hand 33 of the actors recognize sources of contamination for groundwater such as fuel filling stations tanks for fuel storage fumigation with agrochemicals and water puddles from saturated infiltration fields and old lagoons regarding the recognition of the importance of groundwater 73 identify the resource as a key aspect because shortage of water associated with climate variability and lack of aqueduct systems in some sectors however 70 consider that the resource is not reliable for human consumption 5 3 contamination risk evaluation fig 5 shows the hazard maps of the aquifer contamination in the urban expansion zone according to each type of threat groundwater point solid waste domestic wastewater surface sources hydrocarbons and hazardous substances and agricultural activities during the evaluation of aquifer contamination risk factors in the urban expansion zone it was found that industrial activities and oil pipelines constitute a risk scenario given that they can affect the quality of groundwater due to hydrocarbon leaks and storage of toxic and dangerous substances on the other hand there is no significant risk associated with the use of agrochemicals for agricultural activity however it is important in future studies to evaluate more accurately the behavior of this variable in the area through the monitoring of pollutants in groundwater since agriculture has been recognized as an activity that affects it in terms of quality and quantity according to spadotto et al 2004 among agricultural activities sugarcane and citrus fruits are those that make frequent and often incorrect use of agrochemicals and represent potential sources of contamination of agricultural soils surface and groundwater and in the study area there is knowledge of land uses with these crops the inadequate management of groundwater points presented a high risk in 12 5 of the 24 points evaluated in the field and an average risk in 45 8 of the points in the case of the inadequate management of solid waste there was a high risk in 10 7 of the points evaluated 28 points in total which are characterized by the manipulation of harmful substances while the discharge of wastewater to the soil presented a high risk in 38 2 of the points under study 34 points in total in the risk evaluation by surface sources the results obtained show discharges that form a low degree of aquifer contamination risk it should be noted that although this component was evaluated the relationship between the aquifer and the surface sources of the area has not yet been determined it is important to note that a vulnerability analysis is not so useful without a threat probability that allows a pre assessment of the risk of contamination even if it is not of a quantitative nature díaz 2005 several groundwater protection studies have assessed the risk of contamination using the mapping of intrinsic vulnerability by the drastic method combined with hazard mapping saidi et al 2011 different methodologies have been developed to determine the intrinsic vulnerability to groundwater contamination taking into account particular physical attributes of a given aquifer but they almost never address the impact of human activity costa et al 2019 which implies challenge for risk management with the obtained results from the pollution risk evaluation in the urban expansion zone there is an advance in the knowledge of the vulnerability based on the analysis of the hydrogeological conditions and characteristics of the aquifer and an approach to the configuration of threats or hazards by the multiple anthropic activities developed the information generated serves as a support to plan the urban development of the city towards these zones incorporating groundwater conservation strategies that allow guaranteeing the sustainability of the resource in terms of quality and quantity however it is necessary to validate these results by characterizing the activities which implies the measurement of quality data pollutant load evaluation and the detailed collection of information in the field torres et al 2014 in addition detailed investigations must be carried out that incorporate the implementation of monitoring and control programs for the quality of groundwater as proposed by foster and hirata 1988 it is also necessary to highlight that all the actions carried out for the conservation of the aquifer must be linked to awareness campaigns and environmental education to promote the change of attitude of the diverse actors related to the aquifer carder 2007 likewise it is important to evaluate other contamination risk conditions taking into account the characteristics of groundwater from both free and confined and semi confined aquifers given that their characteristics are different and require the application of differentiated methodologies this is because the main risk of shallow groundwater is contamination and not its exploitation as in the case with deep groundwater li et al 2018 6 conclusions the application of the drastic method is of great help in areas where there are not many hydrogeological data and dynamic and hydraulic characteristics of each geological formation and in turn can be adjusted to the conditions presented in the study area allowing a better evaluation of the intrinsic vulnerability to aquifer contamination the identification of anthropic threats is improved when the perception about the use of groundwater and the problematic that is generated around the subterranean hydric resource is taken into account by the key actors of the study area optimizing the corrective decision making otherwise they can become a potential and permanent threat of aquifer contamination the risk evaluation of groundwater contamination involves the integration of two different methodologies on one hand methodologies for the determination of the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer and on the other hand methodologies that identify threats or hazards derived from anthropic activities both provide a better approximation to the conditions of the aquifers studied and allow to determine the affectation probability in terms of groundwater quality in certain areas of the aquifer the risk of contamination reflects a high classification by wastewater due to the final disposition in the land inadequate maintenance and conditions of vulnerability of the aquifer which reflects the need to develop strategies to strengthen the systems of in situ disposition and implementation of wastewater treatment systems the evaluation of aquifer contamination risk allows on one hand to delimit and prioritize areas of special hydrogeological importance where it is necessary to restrict potentially polluting activities and at the same time support decision making in the adequate planning of urban areas and urban expansion to guarantee the permanence of groundwater with quality and quantity criteria
