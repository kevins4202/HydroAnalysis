1925,flood control reservoirs are common in the u s and several are located in highly agricultural regions of the midwest in this study a mass balance of annual and seasonal no3 n concentration and load reductions was calculated for lake red rock a large flood control reservoir located on the des moines river downstream of the city of des moines iowa utilizing rare long term upstream and downstream no3 n monitoring records extending back in time 42 years and combining this with estimates from tributary inputs lake red rock reservoir was found to remove an average of 7 379 mg no3 n per year representing 12 4 of the no3 n inputs to the reservoir annual variations in no3 n loss rate varied considerably 2 9 to 41 3 and were significantly related to annual reservoir water retention time combining study results with literature data annual no3 n reduction in midwestern flood control reservoirs was logarithmically related to average annual water retention time although flood control reservoirs are designed primarily for flood protection manipulating the reservoirs to achieve longer water retention times particularly during periods of high no3 n concentrations and loads could be a

engineers usace 2016 with a primary purpose of flood risk reduction many of these reservoirs receive input flows containing high no3 n concentrations and loads the state of iowa has three large reservoirs constructed by the u s army corps of engineers in the 1950 s through the 1970 s including coralville lake reservoir on the iowa river and saylorville lake and lake red rock on the des moines river all of which were constructed for purposes including flood control low flow augmentation fish wildlife water supply and recreation usace 1999 water quality improvement was not explicitly considered a benefit of the reservoirs globally where no3 n load reductions in reservoirs have been measured effects have varied across landscapes regions and countries table 1 reservoir sizes reported in the literature ranged from less than 1 km2 to 375 km2 and depths ranged from less than 2 m to 28 m the percent no3 n reduction in reservoirs was often linked to water residence time and this varied from 2 days in a polish reservoir tomaszek and koszelink 2003 to 840 days in a small reservoir in semi arid kansas cunha et al 2014 among flood control reservoirs in the u s midwest stenback et al 2014 used mass balance calculations to report a no3 n mass loss of 4 9 over a 26 year measurement period in saylorville lake reservoir in central iowa in illinois david et al 2006 showed that about 58 of the total annual no3 n input to the lake shelbyville reservoir was removed over a 23 year period water residence times were considerably longer in lake shelbyville 131 days compared to saylorville lake reservoir 10 days shaughnessy et al 2019 reported that 50 7 of the no3 n mass was reduced in carlyle lake in southern illinois over a 2 year period in minnesota while lake pepin on the minnesota river is not technically a flood control reservoir mauer et al 1995 reported that the river lake reduced no3 n by 14 with an average water residence time of 23 days overall there is a lack of studies reporting no3 n mass reductions in flood control reservoirs draining intensely agricultural regions stenback et al 2014 this study was focused on quantifying the no3 n reductions in lake red rock a large flood control reservoir located about 30 km downstream of the city of des moines fig 1 with upstream and downstream water monitoring data extending back in time more than 40 years the reservoir offers a rare opportunity to evaluate temporal variations in annual and seasonal no3 n load reductions over an extended period of time the objectives of this study were to 1 estimate the annual mass of no3 n removed by lake red rock using mass balance calculations 2 evaluate seasonal mass loss and other inter annual patterns and 3 relate the lake red rock mass loss and residence times to other midwestern flood control reservoirs considering the number of flood control reservoirs in the highly agricultural midwest region it is important to account for their impacts on riverine no3 n loads in local and regional models and in statewide nutrient reduction strategies table 2 2 methods 2 1 site description and setting the des moines river drains a watershed of approximately 38 332 km2 flowing from the headwaters in minnesota through north central and southeastern iowa to its confluence with the mississippi river at keokuk fig 1 constructed in 1969 lake red rock is located on the des moines river in marion county in south central iowa approximately 230 km upstream from its confluence with the mississippi river at a normal pool elevation of 226 2 m above sea level the reservoir lake stores 233 million m3 of water for a distance of 29 km upstream from the dam at full flood stage 237 7 m the pool area is 272 4 km2 and extends 53 9 km above the dam and has a maximum depth of 16 7 m near the dam the major inflow approximately 95 to the reservoir is the des moines river although there are additional small rivers and creeks that discharge directly to the reservoir land use in the watershed is predominantly agricultural consisting of approximately 67 row crops of corn and soybeans downstream of the reservoir at ottumwa iowa fig 1 surface water

usgs gauge stations since 1985 with the river station at runnels 05487500 replaced by a station located approximately 3 km downstream at swan 05487520 in 2009 river flow at the two stations was considered equivalent in this study to extend the river discharge record back to 1978 corresponding to the start of water quality monitoring river discharge at swan was correlated to a longer discharge record available for the des moines river at des moines 05485500 and used to estimate incoming flows to the reservoir at swan from 1978 to 1985 r2 0 92 lake red rock discharges to the des moines river less than 1 km downstream of the dam and is monitored at a usgs gauge station near pella 05488110 the flow data at pella began in 1992 so pella flows from 1992 to 1978 were estimated by correlation to downstream flows at a usgs gauge at tracey 05488500 r2 0 99 water yields from land areas draining to lake red rock from the north and south were captured by representative river gauges at walnut creek and white breast creek respectively fig 1 walnut creek watershed 52 1 km2 occupies approximately 16 9 of the area draining from the north 307 9 km2 whereas white breast creek captures 71 4 land area from the south 1208 km2 daily walnut creek flows from 1995 to 2005 were reported by schilling and spooner 2006 and flows from 2007 to 2020 were measured by the usda see tomer et al 2019

concentrations have been monitored upstream and downstream of the reservoir by the army corps of engineers through a cooperative agreement with iowa state university des moines river water quality network or dmrwqn see lutz and steffen 2009 for details of the program upstream samples are collected from the des moines river near runnells dmrwqn site 5 and the downstream samples are collected from the des moines river near pella dmrwqn site 9 water samples have been collected on a weekly to monthly frequency with more frequent samples collected during spring and summer months when streamflow and no3 n concentrations are typically more variable sampling and analytical procedures were unchanged during the analysis period and are described by lutz and steffen 2009 briefly grab sampling was conducted at all river sites and water samples were filtered and acidified with sulfuric acid in the field and placed in polyethylene bottles for transport to the environmental engineering research laboratory at iowa state university where no3 n concentrations were quantified using the cadmium reduction method see apha 2005 from 1978 to 2019 more than 1000 samples from site 7 n 1059 and site 9 n 1029 were collected and analyzed for no3 n concentrations in the des moines river upstream and downstream of lake red rock unfortunately other n forms such as organic nitrogen on or ammonium were not measured as consistently as no3 n and thus our focus was on no3 n only other n forms would be needed for a complete n balance for the reservoir however the emphasis on quantifying no3 n reductions in this study aligns with the use of the des moines river as a drinking water source and meeting u s epa maximum contaminant levels for water supplies further nearly all greater than90 the nitrogen in the des moines river is in the no3 n form hansen et al 2015 although we focus on nox here we note that alternative forms of n particularly on are present and may contribute to downstream n export no3 n concentrations in walnut creek were monitored weekly to monthly from 1995 to 2005 as part of the walnut creek project associated with the neal smith national wildlife refuge schilling and spooner 2006 and daily from 2006 to 2019 using a nitratax sensor tomer et al 2019 monthly no3 n concentrations at white breast creek are measured by the iowa department of natural resources as part of their ambient monitoring program that began in 1999 and continues to date https programs iowadnr gov aquia daily no3 n loads at four monitoring sites swan pella walnut creek white breast creek were estimated using weighted regressions on time discharge and season with kalman filtering wrtds k and available discharge and concentration data lee et al 2019 zhang and hirsch 2019 the wrtds k model recently published improved the widely utilized wrtds model hirsch and de cicco 2015 by accounting for the autocorrelation structure of model residuals with the addition of a kalman filter zhang and hirsch 2019 among the monitoring sites the number of no3 n samples available for regression modeling varied from 260 white breast creek to 5387 walnut creek and the goodness of fit between measured and modeled data ranged from 0 53 to 0 83 table 1 the no3 n loads from tributary areas to red rock were scaled based on watershed area the proportion of each watershed within its total contributing tributary area was found and used to extrapolate no3 n loads with walnut creek representing the north daily walnut creek no3 n loads 5 91 and white breast creek from the south daily white breast no3 n loads 1 4 we also scaled the tributary loads by comparing the north and south loads to no3 n loads in the des moines river at swan upstream site over their periods of record daily north tributary loads were 2 of the loads at swan whereas the daily south tributary loads were less 1 2 together tributary loads contributed an average of 3 2 of the no3 n loads into the reservoir in this way we could estimate the total tributary load inputs in lake red rock back in time to 1978 when the dmrwqn began total time of 42 years fig 2 1 netload s w a n w a l n u t 5 91 w h i t e b r e a

during the 42 year period from 1978 to 2019 ranging from greater than 1 5 1010 m3 yr on three occasions peaking in 1993 during a major flood year to less than 2 109 m3 yr during drought years in 1988 89 2000 and 2012 fig 3 flow contributions from the des moines river dominated inflow discharge contributing an average of 94 33 of the flow into the reservoir compared to 1 52 and 4 15 from the north and south tributary areas precipitation into and evaporation from the water surface of the reservoir were minor components to the water balance of the reservoir averaging 1 0 and 2 3 respectively the annual water retention time in the reservoir ranged from 6 2 to 70 3 days and averaged 19 6 days fig 3 retention time was longer during low water years droughts and shorter during flood years and it was inversely correlated to inflow discharge r 0 55 p less than 0 001 annual outflow discharge from lake red rock was approximately 4 3 less than inflow contributions due mainly to evaporation losses from the surface area of the lake e g tian et al 2022 seasonally des moines river flow in lake red rock was greatest during the months of march to july each year and considerably lower early in the year and from august to december fig 4 on average the months of march to july contribute 68 7 of the annual flow to the reservoir average monthly outflow from the reservoir is closely correlated with inflow discharge with slight shift toward retention from july to august 3 2 no3 n concentrations no3 n concentrations in the des moines river upstream and downstream of lake red rock varied considerably from 1978 to 2019 fig 5 the mean and standard deviation for the site 7 concentrations upstream of reservoir were 6 35 3 13 mg l whereas the downstream concentration values site 9 were 5 74 2 76 mg l maximum no3 n concentrations were slightly higher at site 7 16 3 mg l than at site 9 15 6 mg l whereas minimum concentrations were often less than 1 mg l during late summer and fall periods at both locations based on the grab sampling data no3 n concentrations exceeded the mcl 10 mg l approximately 14 5 of the time at site 7 and 7 1 at site 9 overall for the entire period no3 n concentrations downstream of lake red rock were about 9 6 lower than incoming nitrate concentrations from the des moines river among the tributary contributions no3 n concentrations averaged 5 12 3 06 mg l n 5387 in walnut creek watershed north and were lower in white breast creek south averaging 0 89 0 85 mg l n 260 3 3 no3 n mass balance an annual no3 n mass balance of inputs and outputs to lake red rock was calculated and showed wide variability over a 42 year period fig 6 the annual input load from the des moines river and north and south tributaries averaged 59 400 mg and ranged from 3340 mg to 122 000 mg output no3 n load varied from 2 370 to 110 000 mg and averaged 52 100 mg during the 42 year period we estimated that 2 500 000 mg of no3 n entered the reservoir via the des moines river and tributaries and 2 190 000 mg no3 n left the reservoir through the outflow spillway near pella hence the reservoir removed 310 000 mg of no3 n during this time an average of 7 380 mg per year from the long term mass balance calculations 12 4 of the no3 n inputs to lake red rock were removed in the reservoir note that our estimate of no3 n loss did not include changes in reservoir storage but this term was found to be insignificant in another des moines river reservoir at saylorville less than0 1 stenback et al 2014 annual variations in no3 n loss rate varied considerably 2 9 to 41 3 and were significantly related to annual reservoir water retention time p less than 0 001 fig 7 annual retention times were often less than 25 days but occasionally extended beyond 40 days and when this occurred no3 n loss rates ranged from 22 to 41 no3 n mass loss and percent reductions related differently to inflow discharge to the reservoir fig 8 greater mass loss was associated with greater inflow discharge and loads but a higher percentage of no3 n loss was achieved when inflows to the reservoir were lower a mass balance of inputs and outputs to lake reservoir by month revealed a positive net no3 n mass into the reservoir during march to june more input than output and a negative mass balance in july and august fig 4 a smaller positive net balance returned in late fall the monthly patterns show the seasonal nature of no3 n mass reduction in lake red rock with high inputs loads of no3 n to the reservoir in late spring and early summer followed by a greater mass of no3 n discharged in late summer and early fall the loss rates in the fall were similar to the spring but the mass of n in the fall was much less fig 4 a time series of monthly net no3 n loads shows the oscillating nature of no3 n loss fig 4 while most months have load reductions fluctuating around net zero occasionally high net positive input loading months were closely followed high net negative loading months immediately afterward 4 discussion study results suggest that lake red rock is reducing inflow no3 n loads in the des moines river by a long term average of 12 4 per year this value is higher than a reduction of 4 9 reported for another flood control reservoir located on the same river upstream of the city of des moines saylorville lake stenback et al 2014 on the other hand a greater percentage of n loss was reported for the lake shelbyville impoundment on the kaskaskia river in an agricultural landscape in east central illinois david et al 2006 where approximately 58 of the nitrate inputs were removed in an average year much of the difference in no3 n loss rates can be traced to water retention time in the reservoirs fig 9 although the relation between water retention time and percent no3 n reduction was not significant for a population of reservoirs around the world with variable hydrologic conditions individual reservoirs reported in papers cited in table 1 the relation was highly significant r2 0 97 within a population of midwestern flood control reservoirs table 1 the 12 4 reduction in lake red rock falls within a logarithmic trend anchored by saylorville reservoir near the origin 9 7 days to 4 3 months at lake shelbyville and includes data from minnesota maurer et al 1995 and illinois shaughnessy et al 2019 the regional analysis was consistent with the best fit line through the annual variations of reduction within red rock reservoir fig 7 this implies long term consistency of the relation within and among midwestern flood control reservoirs however it is important to note that this long term value fluctuated considerably during the 42 year monitoring period the degree of fluctuation within red rock was not unusual as similar mass balance studies in midwestern reservoirs have shown variations over long periods of time stenback et al 2014 david et al 2006 for example long term mass loss in saylorville reservoir averaged 4 9 but it varied from negative mass loss in four years to greater than 25 in two years over a 26 year monitoring period stenback et al 2014 in illinois david et al 2006 reported a no3 n reduction of 58 but only as a long term mass balance average over 23 years caution is therefore needed when reporting no3 n mass reductions in reservoirs over short time periods of several years because mass loss and reductions can vary across droughts and flood periods the annual mass of no3 n reduced increased with annual water inflow but the percent reduction decreased fig 8 more than 10 000 mg of no3 n were removed during wet years but amounts were less than 5 000 mg during dry years conversely high retention times during dry years allowed for greater no3 n reduction as a function of incoming n a similar pattern was described by david et al 2006 and stenback et al 2014 in illinois and iowa reservoirs respectively prompting stenback et al 2014 to remark that a high percent loss does not necessarily translate to high mass loss overall the average annual no3 n load reduced in lake red rock 7 379 mg was higher than that measured in saylorville lake 1 346 mg and lake shelbyville 4900 mg similar effects of climate variations on n reduction efficiency have been observed in urban east coast u s watersheds bettez et al 2015 lake red rock located within the des moines river basin is well positioned to play a role in addressing serious and widespread no3 n impairments of the river no3 n concentrations in the des moines river entering lake red rock ranging up to 16 mg l typify values observed in water exported from row crops of corn and soybeans in the u s corn belt schilling et al 2012 david et al 1997 kladivko et al 2004 subsurface tile drainage dominates no3 n delivery pathways schilling et al 2019 and tile drainage water in the basin exceeds 10 mg l approximately 85 90 of the time schilling et al 2012 there is currently a total maximum daily load tmdl for the des moines river upstream of des moines for no3 n impairment of the drinking water supply that calls for a 34 4 reduction in no3 n loads in the river schilling and wolter 2009 downstream of red rock the city of ottumwa utilizes the des moines river as part of its water supply and exceeds the mcl nearly 10 of the time jones et al 2020 hence ongoing no3 n reductions occurring in lake red rock help to mitigate the drinking water impairments derived from nonpoint sources annual loading up to 107 000 mg has been measured in the des moines river near its confluence with the mississippi river jones et al 2017 with a long term average of 71 000 mg yr iowa dnr on average lake red rock removed approximately 11 of the annual no3 n load exported from the des moines river to the mississippi the average export load from the des moines river would be near 80 000 mg without load reductions occurring in lake red rock denitrification is considered to be the dominant n loss process in reservoirs stenback et al 2014 harrison et al 2009 david et al 2006 garnier et al 1999 saunders and kalff 2001 david et al 2006 scaled up direct measurements of denitrification rates from reservoir sediment and compared these values to measured mass balance n losses in the reservoir to suggest that denitrification could account for the entire n reduction in an illinois reservoir garnier et al 1999 estimated that denitrification represented 83 100 of the total no3 n reduction in three reservoirs in france in a unique study hansen et al 2016 used dynamic regression modeling of upstream downstream changes in key water quality surrogates ph hardness alkalinity and suspended solids to quantify the relative importance of various n reduction processes in the saylorville reservoir in iowa they estimated that denitrification was the dominant n loss process 60 9 followed by algal assimilation 37 9 and sedimentation 1 2 although some studies have shown sediment deposition to be an important total nitrogen tn reduction process kelly 2001 cole et al 2007 no3 n is highly soluble and not subject to significant sedimentation jansson et al 1994 on the other hand concentrations of tn which includes organic n in particulate form can be reduced substantially in wetlands lakes and reservoirs through sedimentation saunders and kalff 2001 harrison et al 2009 but sedimentation is considered to be an order of magnitude less than denitrification in wetlands van oostrom 1995 without a complete n balance for the reservoir we cannot rule out export of organic n with phytoplankton or release of ammonium from the bottom sediments chen et al 2020 but monitoring data nevertheless indicates the reservoir is serving to reduce no3 n concentrations and loads in lake red rock seasonal flow contributions and denitrification likely accounts for the seasonal pattern of no3 n mass balance and percent reductions fig 4 incoming river flows coupled with high no3 n concentrations deliver a large mass load of no3 n into the reservoir in the spring as water is stored behind the outlet in summer and early fall increased water retention time combined with higher water temperatures provide conditions needed for enhanced denitrification drake et al 2018 david et al 2006 however denitrification has been shown to remove no3 n in lentic systems year round even in cold climates harrison et al 2012 phipps and crumpton 1994 in a restored iowa oxbow lake no3 n reduction was 20 when assimilation was minimal but increased to 70 100 in august and september when water temperatures were higher and both assimilation and denitrification processes were active the late summer early fall time period also coincides with greater no3 n reduction in streams royer et al 2004 jones et al 2018 the temporal nature of inflows and outflows to a reservoir is very dynamic fig 4 and warrants careful consideration at a sub annual timeframe temporal variations of nutrients in a reservoir can be captured and modeled using time series methods schoch et al 2009 hansen et al 2015 provided the measurement data is on the same temporal resolution as the processes involved overall study results suggests that no3 n reductions in large flood control reservoirs could be increased if water retention time could be increased fig 8 although management of these reservoirs must strive to balance pool levels for flood control recreation and habitat management there could be future opportunities to manage reservoir pools to increase water retention time and increase no3 n reductions stenback et al 2014 noted that since midwestern flood control reservoirs are already part of the hydrologic system in midwestern landscapes no3 n reductions within them cannot be counted toward helping achieve state and federal reduction goals however the relation shown in fig 9 and hydraulic loading rates reported in stenback et al 2014 and david et al 2006 suggest that large flood control reservoirs within agricultural regions could be part of a portfolio of mitigation strategies to reduce downstream no3 n if reservoir operations could increase water retention times garnier et al 1999 used a coupled ecological and hydraulic model to explore the effect of reservoir management on n reductions and found that altering retention times had little effect on absolute amount of no3 n reduced on the other hand david et al 2006 suggested that the approach may be effective if retention times were maximized in late spring and early summer when the largest nitrate loads enter the reservoir ultimately for a control scheme to be implemented at lake red rock the u s army corps of engineers usace would need to balance potential no3 n reductions with the primary flood control purpose of the reservoir if incoming water were sufficiently retained to lengthen water residence time and reduce no3 n loads careful attention would need to be given to anticipating and forecasting future incoming flows to the reservoir so that flood storage volumes would not be adversely affected however results from this study suggest that given a willingness to manipulate reservoir discharge rates to lengthen water residence times downstream no3 n reductions may be achieved particularly during periods of high nitrate concentrations when downstream water supplies are most threatened the reservoir mass balance study reported herein has limitations that should be acknowledged first the no3 n our mass balance used estimated inputs from watershed tributaries flowing into lake red rock from the north walnut creek and south white breast creek to extrapolate inputs from the entire north and south tributary regions further since the monitoring records from these two watersheds did not extend back in time to the start of the des moines river acoe monitoring we used the ratio of inputs to the des moines river at des moines to estimate tributary inputs back to 1978 hence there were undoubtedly errors in the tributary contributions that affected the inflow amount of no3 n delivered to the reservoir however when monitoring data were available for the tributaries the contributions were relatively minor average of 3 4 likewise the mass balance did not consider inputs from precipitation or changes in reservoir storage these inputs were considered to be very minor in previous work at saylorville reservoir in iowa 0 2 stenback et al 2014 we used a load estimation software wrtds k lee et al 2019 to estimate daily inflow and outflow n loads from periodic grab sampling data which were then aggregated to a monthly and annual scale although no3 n concentrations are known to fluctuate at daily and sub daily scales e g feng et al 2013 jones et al 2017 the method of load estimation is an appropriate method for iowa rivers and more rigorous than simple linear interpolation schilling et al 2017 5 conclusions flood control reservoirs are common in the u s and several are located in highly agricultural regions of the midwest in this study we evaluated annual and seasonal no3 n load reductions in lake red rock a large flood control reservoir located on the des moines river downstream of the city of des moines utilizing rare long term upstream and downstream no3 n monitoring records extending back in time 42 years and combining this with estimates from tributary inputs an annual mass balance for the reservoir was calculated lake red rock reservoir removed an average of 7 379 mg no3 n per year representing 12 4 of the no3 n inputs to the reservoir study results from lake red rock were consistent with results from two of the best documented no3 n mass balance studies of reservoirs in the u s midwest at lake shelbyville in illinois david et al 2006 and saylorville reservoir in iowa stenback et al 2014 based on these studies and others a first order approximation of annual no3 n reduction in a midwestern flood control reservoir can be made using a logarithmic relation with residence time although flood control reservoirs are charged first and foremost with flood protection manipulating the reservoirs to achieve longer water retention times particularly during periods of high no3 n

engineers usace 2016 with a primary purpose of flood risk reduction many of these reservoirs receive input flows containing high no3 n concentrations and loads the state of iowa has three large reservoirs constructed by the u s army corps of engineers in the 1950 s through the 1970 s including coralville lake reservoir on the iowa river and saylorville lake and lake red rock on the des moines river all of which were constructed for purposes including flood control low flow augmentation fish wildlife water supply and recreation usace 1999 water quality improvement was not explicitly considered a benefit of the reservoirs globally where no3 n load reductions in reservoirs have been measured effects have varied across landscapes regions and countries table 1 reservoir sizes reported in the literature ranged from less than 1 km2 to 375 km2 and depths ranged from less than 2 m to 28 m the percent no3 n reduction in reservoirs was often linked to water residence time and this varied from 2 days in a polish reservoir tomaszek and koszelink 2003 to 840 days in a small reservoir in semi arid kansas cunha et al 2014 among flood control reservoirs in the u s midwest

showed that about 58 of the total annual no3 n input to the lake shelbyville reservoir was removed over a 23 year period water residence times were considerably longer in lake shelbyville 131 days compared to saylorville lake reservoir 10 days shaughnessy et al 2019 reported that 50 7 of the no3 n mass was reduced in carlyle lake in southern illinois over a 2 year period in minnesota while lake pepin on the minnesota river is not technically a flood control reservoir mauer et al 1995 reported that the river lake reduced no3 n by 14 with an average water residence time of 23 days overall there is a lack of studies reporting no3 n mass reductions in flood control reservoirs draining intensely agricultural regions stenback et al 2014 this study was focused on quantifying the no3 n reductions in lake red rock a large flood control reservoir located about 30 km downstream of the city of des moines fig 1 with upstream and downstream water monitoring data extending back in time more than 40 years the reservoir offers a rare opportunity to evaluate temporal variations in annual and seasonal no3 n load reductions over an extended period of time the objectives of this study were to 1 estimate the annual mass of no3 n removed by lake red rock using mass balance calculations 2 evaluate seasonal mass loss and other inter annual patterns and 3 relate the lake red rock mass loss and residence times to other midwestern flood control reservoirs considering the number of flood control reservoirs in the highly agricultural midwest region it is important to account for their

red rock is located on the des moines river in marion county in south central iowa approximately 230 km upstream from its confluence with the mississippi river at a normal pool elevation of 226 2 m

usgs gauge stations since 1985 with the river station at runnels 05487500 replaced by a station located approximately 3 km downstream at swan 05487520 in 2009 river flow at the two stations was considered equivalent in this study to extend the river discharge record back to 1978 corresponding to the start of water quality monitoring river discharge at swan was correlated to a longer discharge record available for the des moines river at des moines 05485500 and used to estimate incoming flows to the reservoir at swan from 1978 to 1985 r2 0 92 lake red rock discharges to the des moines river less than 1 km downstream of the dam and is monitored at a usgs gauge station near pella 05488110 the flow data at pella began in 1992 so pella flows from 1992 to 1978 were estimated by correlation to downstream flows at a usgs gauge at tracey 05488500 r2 0 99 water yields from land areas draining to lake red rock from the north and south were captured by representative river gauges

concentrations have been monitored upstream and downstream of the reservoir by the army corps of engineers through a cooperative agreement with iowa state university des moines river water quality network or dmrwqn see lutz and steffen 2009 for details of the program upstream samples are collected from the des moines river near runnells dmrwqn site 5 and the downstream samples are collected from the des moines river near pella dmrwqn site 9 water samples have been collected on a weekly to monthly frequency with more frequent samples collected during spring and summer months when streamflow and no3 n concentrations are typically more variable sampling and analytical procedures were unchanged during the analysis period and are described by lutz and steffen 2009 briefly grab sampling was conducted at all river sites and water samples were filtered and acidified with sulfuric acid in the field and placed in polyethylene bottles for transport to the environmental engineering research laboratory at iowa state university where no3 n concentrations were quantified using the cadmium reduction method see apha 2005 from 1978 to 2019 more than 1000 samples from site 7 n 1059 and site 9 n 1029 were collected and analyzed for no3 n concentrations in the des moines river upstream and downstream of lake red rock unfortunately other n forms such as organic nitrogen on or ammonium were not measured as consistently as no3 n and thus our focus was on no3 n only other n forms would be needed for a complete n balance for the reservoir however the emphasis on quantifying no3 n reductions in this study aligns with the use of the des moines river as a drinking water source and meeting u s epa maximum contaminant levels for water supplies further nearly all greater

downstream n export no3 n concentrations in walnut creek were monitored weekly to monthly from 1995 to 2005 as part of the walnut creek project associated with the neal smith national wildlife refuge schilling and spooner 2006 and daily from 2006 to 2019 using a nitratax sensor tomer et al 2019 monthly no3 n concentrations at white breast creek are measured by the iowa department of natural resources as part of their ambient monitoring program that began in 1999 and continues to date https programs iowadnr gov aquia daily no3 n loads at four monitoring sites swan pella walnut creek white

the wrtds k model recently published improved the widely utilized wrtds model hirsch and de cicco 2015 by accounting for the autocorrelation structure of model residuals with the addition of a kalman filter zhang and hirsch 2019 among the monitoring sites the number of no3 n samples available for regression modeling varied from 260 white breast creek to 5387 walnut creek and the goodness of fit between measured and modeled data ranged from 0 53 to 0 83 table 1 the no3 n loads from tributary areas to red rock were scaled based on watershed area the proportion of each watershed within its total contributing tributary area was found and used to extrapolate no3 n loads with walnut creek representing the north daily walnut creek no3 n loads 5 91 and white breast creek from the south daily white breast no3 n loads 1 4 we also scaled the tributary loads by comparing the north and south loads to no3 n loads in the des moines river at swan upstream site over their periods of record daily north tributary loads were 2 of the loads at swan whereas the daily south tributary loads were less 1 2 together tributary loads contributed an average of 3 2 of the no3 n loads into the reservoir in this way we could estimate the total tributary load inputs in lake red rock back in time to 1978 when the dmrwqn began total time of 42 years fig 2 1 netload s w a n w a l n u t 5 91 w h i t e b r e a

during the 42 year period from 1978 to 2019 ranging from greater than 1 5 1010 m3 yr on three occasions peaking in 1993 during a major flood year to less than 2 109 m3 yr during drought years in 1988 89 2000 and 2012 fig 3 flow contributions from the des moines river dominated inflow discharge contributing an average of 94 33 of the flow into the reservoir compared to 1 52 and 4 15 from the north and south tributary areas precipitation into and evaporation from the water surface of the reservoir were minor components to the water balance of the reservoir averaging 1 0 and 2 3 respectively the annual water retention time in the reservoir ranged from 6 2 to 70 3 days and averaged 19 6 days fig 3 retention time was longer during low water years droughts and shorter during flood years and it was inversely correlated to inflow discharge r 0 55 p less than 0 001 annual outflow discharge from lake red rock was approximately 4 3 less than inflow contributions due mainly to evaporation losses from the surface area of the lake e g tian et al 2022 seasonally des moines river flow in lake red rock was greatest during the months of march to july each year and considerably lower early in the year and from august to december fig 4 on average the months of march to july contribute 68 7 of the annual flow to the reservoir average monthly outflow from the reservoir is closely correlated with inflow discharge with slight shift toward retention from july to august 3 2 no3 n concentrations no3 n concentrations in the des moines river upstream and downstream of lake red rock varied considerably from 1978 to 2019 fig 5 the mean and standard deviation for the site 7 concentrations upstream of reservoir were 6 35 3 13 mg l whereas the downstream concentration values site 9 were 5 74 2 76 mg l maximum no3 n concentrations were slightly higher at site 7 16 3 mg l than at site 9 15 6 mg l whereas minimum concentrations were often less than 1 mg l during late summer and fall periods at both locations based on the grab sampling data no3 n concentrations exceeded the mcl 10 mg l approximately 14 5 of the time at site 7 and 7 1 at site 9 overall for the entire period no3 n concentrations downstream of lake red rock were about 9 6 lower than incoming nitrate concentrations from the des moines river among the tributary contributions no3 n concentrations averaged 5 12 3 06 mg l n 5387 in walnut creek watershed north and were lower in white breast creek south averaging 0 89 0 85 mg l n 260 3 3 no3 n mass balance an annual no3 n mass balance of inputs and outputs to lake red rock was calculated and showed wide variability over a 42 year period fig 6 the annual input load from the des moines river and north and south tributaries averaged 59 400 mg and ranged from 3340 mg to 122 000 mg output no3 n load varied from 2 370 to 110 000 mg and averaged 52 100 mg during the 42 year period we estimated that 2 500 000 mg of no3 n entered the reservoir via the des moines river and tributaries and 2 190 000 mg no3 n left the reservoir through the outflow spillway near pella hence the reservoir removed 310 000 mg of no3 n during this time an average of 7 380 mg per year from the long term mass balance calculations 12 4 of the no3 n inputs to lake red rock were removed in the reservoir note that our estimate of no3 n loss did not include changes in reservoir storage but this term was found to be insignificant in another des moines river reservoir at saylorville less than0 1 stenback et al 2014 annual variations in no3 n loss rate varied considerably 2 9 to 41 3 and were significantly related to annual reservoir water retention time p less than 0 001 fig 7 annual retention times were often less than 25 days but occasionally extended beyond 40 days and when this occurred no3 n loss rates ranged from 22 to 41 no3 n mass loss and percent reductions related differently to inflow discharge to the reservoir fig 8 greater mass loss was associated with greater inflow discharge and loads but a higher percentage of no3 n loss was achieved when inflows to the reservoir were lower a mass balance of inputs and outputs to lake reservoir by month revealed a positive net no3 n mass into the reservoir during march to june more input than output and a negative mass balance in july and august fig 4 a smaller positive net balance returned in late fall the monthly patterns show the seasonal nature of no3 n mass reduction in lake red rock with high inputs loads of no3 n to the reservoir in late spring and early summer followed by a greater mass of no3 n discharged in late summer and early fall the loss rates in the fall were similar to the spring but the mass of n in the fall was much less fig 4 a time series of monthly net no3 n loads shows the oscillating nature of no3 n loss fig 4 while most months have load reductions fluctuating around net zero occasionally high net positive input loading months were closely followed high net negative loading months immediately afterward 4 discussion study results suggest that lake red rock is reducing inflow no3 n loads in the des moines river by a long term average of 12 4 per year this value is higher than a reduction of 4 9 reported for another flood control reservoir located on the same river upstream of the city of des moines saylorville lake stenback et al 2014 on the other hand a greater percentage of n loss was reported for the lake shelbyville impoundment on the kaskaskia river in an agricultural landscape in east central illinois david et al 2006 where approximately 58 of the nitrate inputs were removed in an average year much of the difference in no3 n loss rates can be traced to water retention time in the reservoirs fig 9 although the relation between water retention time and percent no3 n reduction was not significant for a population of reservoirs around the world with variable hydrologic conditions individual reservoirs reported in papers cited in table 1 the relation was highly significant r2 0 97 within a population of midwestern flood control reservoirs table 1 the 12 4 reduction in lake red rock falls within a logarithmic trend anchored by saylorville reservoir near the origin 9 7 days to 4 3 months at lake shelbyville and includes data from minnesota maurer et al 1995 and illinois shaughnessy et al 2019 the regional analysis was consistent with the best fit line through the annual variations of reduction within red rock reservoir fig 7 this implies long term consistency of the relation within and among midwestern flood control reservoirs however it is important to note that this long term value fluctuated considerably during the 42 year monitoring period the degree of fluctuation within red rock was not unusual as similar mass balance studies in midwestern reservoirs have shown variations over long periods of time stenback et al 2014 david et al 2006 for example long term mass loss in saylorville reservoir averaged 4 9 but it varied from negative mass loss in four years to greater than 25 in two years over a 26 year monitoring period stenback et al 2014 in illinois david et al 2006 reported a no3 n reduction of 58 but only as a long term mass balance average over 23 years caution is therefore needed when reporting no3 n mass reductions in reservoirs over short time periods of several years because mass loss and reductions can vary across droughts and flood periods the annual mass of no3 n reduced increased with annual water inflow but the percent reduction decreased fig 8 more than 10 000 mg of no3 n were removed during wet years but amounts were less than 5 000 mg during dry years conversely high retention times during dry years allowed for greater no3 n reduction as a function of incoming n a similar pattern was described by david et al 2006 and stenback et al 2014 in illinois and iowa reservoirs respectively prompting stenback et al 2014 to remark that a high percent loss does not necessarily translate to high mass loss overall the average annual no3 n load reduced in lake red rock 7 379 mg was higher than that measured in saylorville lake 1 346 mg and lake shelbyville 4900 mg similar effects of climate variations on n reduction efficiency have been observed in urban east coast u s watersheds bettez et al 2015 lake red rock located within the des moines river basin is well positioned to play a role in addressing serious and widespread no3 n impairments of the river no3 n concentrations in the des moines river entering lake red rock ranging up to 16 mg l typify values observed in water exported from row crops of corn and soybeans in the u s corn belt schilling et al 2012 david et al 1997 kladivko et al 2004 subsurface tile drainage dominates no3 n delivery pathways schilling et al 2019 and tile drainage water in the basin exceeds 10 mg l approximately 85 90 of the time schilling et al 2012 there is currently a total maximum daily load tmdl for the des moines river upstream of des moines for no3 n impairment of the drinking water supply that calls for a 34 4 reduction in no3 n loads in the river schilling and wolter 2009 downstream of red rock the city of ottumwa utilizes the des moines river as part of its water supply and exceeds the mcl nearly 10 of the time jones et al 2020 hence ongoing no3 n reductions occurring in lake red rock help to mitigate the drinking water impairments derived from nonpoint sources annual loading up to 107 000 mg has been measured in the des moines river near its confluence with the mississippi river jones et al 2017 with a long term average of 71 000 mg yr iowa dnr on average lake red rock removed approximately 11 of the annual no3 n load exported from the des moines river to the mississippi the average export load from the des moines river would be near 80 000 mg without load reductions occurring in lake red rock denitrification is considered to be the dominant n loss process in reservoirs stenback et al 2014 harrison et al 2009 david et al 2006 garnier et al 1999 saunders and kalff 2001 david et al 2006 scaled up direct measurements of denitrification rates from reservoir sediment and compared these values to measured mass balance n losses in the reservoir to suggest that denitrification could account for the entire n reduction in an illinois reservoir garnier et al 1999 estimated that denitrification represented 83 100 of the total no3 n reduction in three reservoirs in france in a unique study hansen et al 2016 used dynamic regression modeling of upstream downstream changes in key water quality surrogates ph hardness alkalinity and suspended solids to quantify the relative importance of various n reduction processes in the saylorville reservoir in iowa they estimated that denitrification was the dominant n loss process 60 9 followed by algal assimilation 37 9 and sedimentation 1 2 although some studies have shown sediment deposition to be an important total nitrogen tn reduction process kelly 2001 cole et al 2007 no3 n is highly soluble and not subject to significant sedimentation jansson et al 1994 on the other hand concentrations of tn which includes organic n in particulate form can be reduced substantially in wetlands lakes and reservoirs through sedimentation saunders and kalff 2001 harrison et al 2009 but sedimentation is considered to be an order of magnitude less than denitrification in wetlands van oostrom 1995 without a complete n balance for the reservoir we cannot rule out export of organic n with phytoplankton or release of ammonium from the bottom sediments chen et al 2020 but monitoring data nevertheless indicates the reservoir is serving to reduce no3 n concentrations and loads in lake red rock seasonal flow contributions and denitrification likely accounts for the seasonal pattern of no3 n mass balance and percent reductions fig 4 incoming river flows coupled with high no3 n concentrations deliver a large mass load of no3 n into the reservoir in the spring as water is stored behind the outlet in summer and early fall increased water retention time combined with higher water temperatures provide conditions needed for enhanced denitrification drake et al 2018 david et al 2006 however denitrification has been shown to remove no3 n in lentic systems year round even in cold climates harrison et al 2012 phipps and crumpton 1994 in a restored iowa oxbow lake no3 n reduction was 20 when assimilation was minimal but increased to 70 100 in august and september when water temperatures were higher and both assimilation and denitrification processes were active the late summer early fall time period also coincides with greater no3 n reduction in streams royer et al 2004 jones et al 2018 the temporal nature of inflows and outflows to a reservoir is very dynamic fig 4 and warrants careful consideration at a sub annual timeframe temporal variations of nutrients in a reservoir can be captured and modeled using time series methods schoch et al 2009 hansen et al 2015 provided the measurement data is on the same temporal resolution as the processes involved overall study results suggests that no3 n reductions in large flood control reservoirs could be increased if water retention time could be increased fig 8 although management of these reservoirs must strive to balance pool levels for flood control recreation and habitat management there could be future opportunities to manage reservoir pools to increase water retention time and increase no3 n reductions stenback et al 2014 noted that since midwestern flood control reservoirs are already part of the hydrologic system in midwestern landscapes no3 n reductions within them cannot be counted toward helping achieve state and federal reduction goals however the relation shown in fig 9 and hydraulic loading rates reported in stenback et al 2014 and david et al 2006 suggest that large flood control reservoirs within agricultural regions could be part of a portfolio of mitigation strategies to reduce downstream no3 n if reservoir operations could increase water retention times garnier et al 1999 used a coupled ecological and hydraulic model to explore the effect of reservoir management on n reductions and found that altering retention times had little effect on absolute amount of no3 n reduced on the other hand david et al 2006 suggested that the approach may be effective if retention times were maximized in late spring and early summer when the largest nitrate loads enter the reservoir ultimately for a control scheme to be implemented at lake red rock the u s army corps of engineers usace would need to balance potential no3 n reductions with the primary flood control purpose of the reservoir if incoming water were sufficiently retained to lengthen water residence time and reduce no3 n loads careful attention would need to be given to anticipating and forecasting future incoming flows to the reservoir so that flood storage volumes would not be adversely affected however results from this study suggest that given a willingness to manipulate reservoir discharge rates to lengthen water residence times downstream no3 n reductions may be achieved particularly during periods of high nitrate concentrations when downstream water supplies are most threatened the reservoir mass balance study reported herein has limitations that should be acknowledged first the no3 n our mass balance used estimated inputs from watershed tributaries flowing into lake red rock from the north walnut creek and south white breast creek to extrapolate inputs from the entire north and south tributary regions further since the monitoring records from these two watersheds did not extend back in time to the start of the des moines river acoe monitoring we used the ratio of inputs to the des moines river at des moines to estimate tributary inputs back to 1978 hence there were undoubtedly errors in the tributary contributions that affected the inflow amount of no3 n delivered to the reservoir however when monitoring data were available for the tributaries the contributions were relatively minor average of 3 4 likewise the mass balance did not consider inputs from precipitation or changes in reservoir storage these inputs were considered to be very minor in previous work at saylorville reservoir in iowa 0 2 stenback et al 2014 we used a load estimation software wrtds k lee et al 2019 to estimate daily inflow and outflow n loads from periodic grab sampling data which were then aggregated to a monthly and annual scale although no3 n concentrations are known to fluctuate at daily and sub daily scales e g feng et al 2013 jones et al 2017 the method of load estimation is an appropriate method for iowa rivers and more rigorous than simple linear interpolation schilling et al 2017 5 conclusions flood control reservoirs are common in the u s and several are located in highly agricultural regions of the midwest in this study we evaluated annual and seasonal no3 n load reductions in lake red rock a large flood control reservoir located on the des moines river downstream of the city of des moines utilizing rare long term upstream and downstream no3 n monitoring records extending back in time 42 years and combining this with estimates from tributary inputs an annual mass balance for the reservoir was calculated lake red rock reservoir removed an average of 7 379 mg no3 n per year representing 12 4 of the no3 n inputs to the reservoir study results from lake red rock were consistent with results from two of the best documented no3 n mass balance studies of reservoirs in the u s midwest at lake shelbyville in illinois david et al 2006 and saylorville reservoir in iowa stenback et al 2014 based on these studies and others a first order approximation of annual no3 n reduction in a midwestern flood control reservoir can be made using a logarithmic relation with residence time although flood control reservoirs are charged first and foremost with flood protection manipulating the reservoirs to achieve longer water retention times particularly during periods of high no3 n concentrations and loads could be a strategy to alleviate impairments at downstream water suppliers and help state and federal agencies meet no3 n reduction goals credit authorship contribution

distribution monitoring zhang et al 2022 various spps have emerged since the commencement of the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission in 1997 pradhan et al 2022 although the advent of spps has benefited the growth of precipitation data application capabilities the study found that certain errors still exist compared to actual observations moazami et al 2022 precision biases in precipitation estimates derived from satellite data are caused by geography meteorology instruments or algorithms the direct application of these products will result in analytical uncertainty gunathilake et al 2020 lyu et al 2021 compromising the accuracy of use it is challenging to obtain reliable precipitation information in the study area and thus improve the spatial and temporal distribution monitoring capability to make spps more profoundly and consistently implemented researchers usually adopt merging correction procedures to improve the performance of the products eini et al 2021 lin et al 2022 tang et al 2020 data assimilation improves the accuracy of precipitation data obtained through remote sensing introducing different types of observations into the numerical model through data assimilation can improve remote sensing precipitation accuracy and data reliability lien et al 2016 however numerical simulation and remote sensing observation errors can affect data assimilation accuracy reichle et al 2021 in summary spps accuracy can be improved in two ways by analyzing the error spatio temporal characteristics of multi source spps improving precipitation performance by complementing the characteristic advantages among spps and by merging spps with ground observed precipitation the spps merging is based on the matching and optimizing of multiple products with varying spatial resolutions and accuracies resulting in appropriate precipitation state inference chen et al 2022 the merging of multi source remote sensing precipitation data may avoid the defects of a single remote sensing product and achieve the effect of complementary advantages through the integration of weight alignment among data ma et al 2018 merged precipitation products are typically generated using bayesian weighted fusion or probability density functions beck et al 2019 xu et al 2020 it should be noted that a global merging approach is difficult to propose due to the inconsistent accuracy level of spps awange et al 2019 therefore when merging correction studies targeted setting methods and parameters are required in conjunction with the test area characteristics ahmadi and rahimzadegan 2021 machine learning technology has been steadily applied to precipitation merging studies because of the benefit of extracting nonlinear feature information from image datasets machine learning approaches have been used for precipitation related applications baez villanueva et al 2020 chen et al 2021 ehsani et al 2022 which has helped improve precipitation merging accuracy it was proven that a double layer machine learning algorithm outperformed the standard regression method regarding precipitation merging accuracy zhang et al 2021 additionally machine learning combined with multi parameter fusion methods can potentially acquire precipitation information in complex terrain areas khan and bhuiyan 2021 nosratpour et al 2022 however machine learning is sensitive to the performance of input spps resulting in precipitation merging accuracy deviations guarascio et al 2022 to increase the precision of the merging model it is necessary to completely evaluate the accuracy status and differential characteristics of spps in the study area chen et al 2020 as well as to employ representative and reliable datasets precipitation data accuracy can be improved by combining remote sensing precipitation with ground observations to establish precipitation background fields and optimize merging relationships li et al 2022 in previous studies geostatistical and optimal interpolation methods were commonly used to analyze merging products yumnam et al 2022 such methods account for the geographic autocorrelation of precipitation with a good correction effect liu et al 2019 real time satellite precipitation data can be calibrated using the determined functional relationship between precipitation products and observation data bárdossy et al 2021 the correction methods have been tested in various areas beaufort et al 2019 wei et al 2022 and the findings show their potential to address the precipitation bias problem however these statistical methods ignore the heterogeneous relationship between precipitation and spatial environmental variables leading to overfitting and scale mismatch errors the geographically weighted regression gwr model has been proven to outperform multivariate regression methods in dealing with spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in precipitation arshad et al 2021 wang et al 2022 merging schemes integrating multiple spps and ground based data have attracted continuous attention with the goal of improving precipitation data accuracy such as determining which satellite products or technical solutions are more effective for precipitation performance furthermore how to merge multi source spps with ground based parameters to achieve accuracy improvement by controlling errors is also a study focus lei et al 2022 yu et al 2020 to address the above issues it is necessary to independently investigate acceptable algorithms for merging spps and ground correction parameters and then attempt to form an integrated study scheme since spps performance is highly regional quantitative comprehension of their accuracy features over a specific basin is limited therefore improving the spps accuracy by merging methods based on the comprehensive performance of multiple parameters and algorithms is vital this has practical implications for understanding the regional precipitation variability mechanisms and improving precipitation data application capabilities this study aims to design a merging precipitation generation scheme to improve the performance of precipitation data and solve the problem of regional precipitation information scarcity the input data of the scheme include multi source spps ground based observations and model climate data the merging precipitation scheme couples methods of machine learning geographic regression and bias correction multiple methods and data were combined to form merged results with high accuracy and high resolution furthermore the performance effects of the merged precipitation data are compared with the original spps an application analysis is also performed to comprehend the effectiveness of this merging precipitation scheme in the study basin this study adopts algorithm integration to generate a systematic merging precipitation scheme for small scale areas realizing the complementary advantages of multi source remote sensing precipitation data with varying accuracy and spatial resolution and providing an effective solution for obtaining high precision merged precipitation data 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the songhua river basin is located in northeastern china and spans 5 6 105 km2 fig 1 this basin s topography is complicated and diversified with mountainous and hilly areas accounting for 76 and plain areas accounting for 24 the songhua river the basin s main river is an international river that flows into the sea through the russian far east the main tributaries are the nenjiang hulan and woken rivers the songhua river basin has a continental monsoon climate with significant regional and seasonal variability in precipitation mountains receive more precipitation than plains and summer contributes to 70 of the annual precipitation heavy rainfall is prone to flood disasters damaging agriculture industry and shipping in the region faiz et al 2018 improving precipitation monitoring capacity and acquiring broad coverage and high precision precipitation data are critical to the study basin s food security and economic development 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite precipitation products imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm global precipitation measurement chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data and pdir now persiann precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks dynamic infrared rain rate were the spps used in this study daily precipitation datasets for these products were acquired for 2011 2018 the spps are introduced in detail as follows the satellite precipitation retrieval data imerg are jointly developed by nasa national aeronautics and space administration and jaxa japan aerospace exploration agency skofronick jackson et al 2017 imerg captures precipitation patterns with the gmi gpm microwave imager and measures three dimensional precipitation structure with the dpr dual frequency precipitation radar huffman et al 2020 imerg covers 60 s to 60 n and all longitudes with a spatial resolution of 0 1 imerg has numerous run versions and this study uses the final run data hereafter referred to as imerg fr the chc climate hazards center collaborated with the eros earth resources observation and science to develop chirps which provides a reliable dataset for precipitation trend analysis funatsu et al 2021 chirps has a spatial resolution of up to 0 05 and covers 50 s to 50 n and all longitudes chirps generates gridded time series precipitation products by combining the improved inverse distance weighting technique and cold cloud duration funk et al 2015 pdir now is a high resolution 0 04 product covering 60 s to 60 n and all longitudes developed by chrs center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing nguyen et al 2020 pdir now improves the cloud segmentation approach and extends the cloud classification system by using high frequency sampling infrared images to improve the algorithm s ability to distinguish different rainfall patterns 2 2 2 worldclim worldclim is a global meteorological and climate database with spatial resolutions ranging from 30 arc seconds approximately 1 km to 10 arc minutes approximately 18 km hijmans et al 2005 worldclim is generated by global climate models gcms and has been widely used in environmental agricultural and ecological studies poggio et al 2018 cross validation reveals that worldclim can efficiently control data uncertainties and well on a global scale with an average correlation of 0 91 for components fick and hijmans 2017 this study used 30 arc seconds of data including air temperature radiation wind speed and water vapor components 2 2 3 rain gauge data the daily precipitation data from rain gauges provided by the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn were used for the study area the rain gauge data were subjected to strict quality control and consistency checks before release rain gauge data are suitable for comparative studies on spps evaluation wang et al 2019 data with longitudinal and latitudinal offsets greater than 0 05 and annual or cumulative missing sequences more than 30 or 90 days were excluded in addition sites above 50 n were not used due to chirps coverage the actual number of valid rain gauges in the study is 39 3 methods 3 1 stacking algorithm for merging satellite precipitation data the stacking algorithm is an integrated model with hierarchical frameworks build a double layer machine learning scheme using the stacking algorithm zandi et al 2022 to obtain the final results substitute the original dataset for training in the first layer learner and then use the prediction results as a new training set to train the second layer learner the purpose of utilizing double layer learners is to assign different weights to the first layer s prediction outcomes in the second layer wolpert 1992 therefore the characteristics and advantages of each learner can be fully leveraged resulting in more accurate merging results the stacking algorithm can be applied to numerous learners tyralis et al 2019 in this study the stacking algorithm uses four types of learners to achieve the preliminary merging processing of precipitation data including random forest rf support vector machine svm chi squared automatic interaction detector chaid and back propagation bp neural network the input data of the stacking algorithm include satellite precipitation and worldclim data and the output is defined as preliminary merged precipitation pmp before training the network each machine learning method normalizes the input and output vectors to 1 1 this avoids the problems of slow convergence and long training time caused by inconsistent units or excessive ranges 3 2 geographically weighted regression for merging ground parameters the geographically weighted regression gwr model introduces spatial location change into the regression coefficient calculation effectively tackling spatial location variability gwr analyzes the geographical variation relationship between the independent variable pmp data and the dependent variable rain gauge observed precipitation using local regression chao et al 2018 through gwr processing geographic geographically merged precipitation gmp was obtained gwr spatial weights should be calculated by determining spatial distances the weighting matrix which reflects the spatial dependence in the data is the key to spatial weights the weighting matrix is computed depending on the type and bandwidth of the kernel function to influence the decay rate at spatial locations the gaussian kernel function was applied in this study whose weight has normal distribution properties and the bandwidth can flexibly adjust the neighborhood size therefore the gaussian kernel function can effectively handle outlier effects thus better capturing spatial heterogeneity gwr obtains the regression weight values by incorporating the rain gauge precipitation values and spatial location elements into the decay function based on the spatial relationship weights gwr calculates numerous spatial location parameters to generate the regression relationship which leads to modeling 1 y i β 0 u i v i j 1 k β j u i v i x ij ε i 2 β i u i v i x t w ij x 1 x t w ij y where u i v i represents the spatial location y i and x ij are the observations of the dependent and independent variables respectively β 0 β ij and ε i are the constant estimate parameter estimate and regression residual respectively β i is the local coefficient x and y are the matrices of explanatory and dependent variables respectively wij is the weight matrix to avoid collinearity or overfitting in the model s application gwr was generated using a stepwise regression procedure the parameters and simulated values passed the test at a significance level of 0 1 3 3 local intensity scaling for precipitation bias correction the local intensity scaling loci method compensates for the long term bias of simulated precipitation by utilizing the time varying properties of observed precipitation hence avoiding the problem of geographic scale differences yin et al 2021 the first step of loci for bias correction is to define the wet day thresholds the second step is to calculate the scaling factors according to these thresholds and adjust the wet day rainfall bias wet day thresholds are often set using annual seasonal or monthly calibrations annual calibration would smooth out the difference in thresholds between flood and non flood seasons for this study causing calibration uncertainty monthly calibration employs twenty four fitting parameters threshold and scaling factor for each month increasing the risk of overfitting based on the above considerations the wet day threshold for seasonal calibration was chosen to process the data further the wet day threshold was determined from geographically regressed precipitation data precipitation counts were tallied for each season and the wet day threshold values were calculated in the spring and winter precipitation occurrences are scarce and infrequent the precipitation occurrence threshold 0 10 mm was used as the wet day threshold during these seasons summer and autumn on the opposite side have a high precipitation frequency the wet day threshold was set at 0 77 mm when the percentage of precipitation events reached 87 41 in summer and 90 05 in autumn this threshold meets the wet day judgment criterion that triggers the majority of precipitation events in the summer and autumn the scaling factor is then calculated depending on the determined wet day thresholds the scaling factor s is the ratio of the observed precipitation intensity to the gmp data wet day threshold schmidli et al 2006 3 s p 0 p 0 p wdt p wdt p m p m p wdt p wdt where p 0 and p m are the daily precipitation from rain gauges and gmp and the angle bracket indicates the long term average p wdt is the wet day threshold the result of the bias correction for daily precipitation series p is obtained finally 4 p t max p wdt s p m t p wdt 0 3 4 study process and evaluation indices the key processes of the study are based on the stacking algorithm gwr and loci to obtain the final merged precipitation fmp through the validation analysis the precision control layer is imerg fr with the best performance the resolution control layer is pdir now with a spatial resolution of 0 04 and the transition layer is chirps three layer spps were constructed for precipitation merging the study process is shown in fig 2 first a sliding window was applied to the three layer spps since the spps spatial resolutions are inconsistent it is necessary to sequentially determine the correspondence between the three products in the spatial position to eliminate the scale error effect then the air temperature radiation wind speed and water vapor components from the worldclim data were acquired and combined with the stacking algorithm to compute the pmp data after that rain gauge data were introduced to collect precipitation elevation latitude and longitude information gwr was used to achieve accuracy adjustment for the pmp data finally the loci was used to eliminate precipitation errors and the fmp data were output the data from 2011 to 2016 were used as the training testing set for the merging scheme the data from 2017 and 2018 were used as the validation application set to test the simulation effect this study used twelve indices to evaluate the performance of merging procedures or results the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse were employed in both process methods and final results the mean absolute error mae and standard deviation std were used to examine the performance of the stacking algorithm the mean squared error mse and mean absolute percentage error mape were also employed for geographic merging evaluation when evaluating the merged precipitation results the relative error rb probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were used moreover the comprehensive indices nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient were utilized to compare and evaluate the performance of the original spps and the merged precipitation data at each stage of the study process the expressions ranges and ideal values of these evaluation indices are shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 performance evaluation of preliminary merged precipitation the stacking algorithm applied the spps and worldclim data from the training set as samples for model training to obtain the pmp data fig 3 the simulation results of each learner in the stacking algorithm demonstrated good merging performance the cc was generally higher than 0 95 the slope in the fitting formula was kept at 0 96 0 97 and the intercept was between 0 04 and 0 07 the rf and chaid simulation results were relatively poor as evidenced by the clear stratification and intermittency in these two outcomes the svm and bp produced better simulation results the model prediction was performed using the testing set after determining the optimal parameters of the stacking algorithm the evaluation indices of each learner in the first and second layers were compared table 2 from the first to the second layer the maximum and minimum errors converge more and the range of errors gradually shrinks according to statistics double layer training reduced the minimum error by 7 73 11 17 and the maximum error by 31 20 36 42 the double layer training also helped to control the learners mae and std reducing errors by an average of 13 80 and 14 44 the svm performed best reducing mae and std by 18 94 and 23 31 respectively this indicates that svm functions well when performing double layer machine learning rf did not show a significant reduction in error on the double layer learner although chaid and bp reduced the error to some extent after training the overall effect was still worse than that of svm svm offers advantages in tackling nonlinear and high dimensional regression problems and avoiding overfitting making spps and worldclim data merging effective as a result of synthesizing the fitting effect and error information of learners simulation results svm can be chosen as the best suited solution for the stacking algorithm learner in the study region the performance of the pmp data obtained by the stacking algorithm was compared to the spps during the 2017 validation period fig 4 a the high precipitation values of spps were all gathered south of the study area which was well reflected in the merged data imerg fr had heavy precipitation in the eastern region and this information was preserved in the merged data the high value precipitation of chirps in the southern region was preserved after merging and the precipitation detail in the northeast was enhanced the pmp had good noise suppression compared to pdir now which had image noise in the west of the study area the pmp data effectively integrate multi source spps accuracy performance and high resolution information since the chirps latitude range only extends to 50 n the pmp appeared to have vacant value in the north according to the study scheme the pmp was based on imerg fr with the addition of two other high spatial resolution products to construct the final presentation pattern therefore the pmp data were more inclined to imerg fr in spatial morphology as shown in fig 4 b by north south and west east oriented precipitation profiles the high value range of pmp was slightly less than that of imerg fr because the merged data included information from both chirps and pdir now despite some disparities between the merged data and imerg fr the spatial resolution of pmp improved over imerg fr during the validation application period pmp had a mean value of 1 87 mm while imerg fr had a slightly higher mean value of 1 93 mm the mean values of chirps and pdir now were 1 73 mm and 1 57 mm respectively it should be emphasized that the stacking algorithm processes the pmp with the purpose of merging and improving spatial resolution while maintaining satellite product correctness ground based observation merging and bias correction procedures must be combined to acquire more accurate precipitation data 4 2 result analysis of geographic merging and bias correction the gwr model was utilized to combine pmp with surface parameters to produce gmp outcomes the difference in seasonal precipitation was considered when attempting to improve the performance of precipitation data table 3 shows the error indices of the gwr model in each season mae mse and rmse deviated significantly in summer and mape had the highest deviation in spring with more frequent precipitation in summer and autumn the possibility of error between gmp and observed precipitation was high but the error amounted to a small fraction of the observed value spring and winter had relatively low errors because of the modest precipitation samples themselves however there were individual large error samples in spring and winter resulting in a greater error percentage than in summer and autumn table 3 reflects the difference in geographic merging accuracy for precipitation in different seasons and indicates the existence of seasonal precipitation distribution in the study basin the merged precipitation before and after gwr processing was compared to the observed precipitation to assess the effect of geographic merging on the precipitation accuracy improvement fig 5 after geographic merging the correlation of precipitation was improved and the cc increased by 1 18 4 46 in different seasons the correlation of gmp was good in spring and winter but moderate in summer and autumn when precipitation frequency was high the slope of the fitting function altered considerably in spring after geographic combining improving by 31 87 compared to before geographic merging the slope of the fitting function changed considerably in spring after geographic merging improving by 31 87 compared to before geographic merging the slope of the fitting function improved by 6 75 and 16 84 in summer and autumn respectively whereas it decreased by 11 52 in winter the intercepts of all seasonal fitting functions were closer to zero after geographic merging indicating that geographic merging may effectively control the errors in precipitation products the intercepts in summer and autumn decreased the most noticeably by 0 56 on average and those in spring and winter decreased by an average of 0 17 the geographic merging results outperformed the pmp data in all seasons and the ranges and mean values were closer to the observed precipitation by using loci bias correction processing the fmp data were output the relative errors between the merged precipitation and observations at the site location before and after the loci are shown in fig 6 a before loci the relative bias of the merged precipitation ranged from 0 08 to 16 49 after loci the range of relative bias was 0 05 9 69 the statistics showed that the average precipitation error of the sample sites after loci was reduced by 3 14 the loci correction effect was more prominent for the samples with greater errors among the observation samples used twenty samples had an error of less than 5 before loci and the average error after loci was reduced by 0 61 ten samples had an error of 5 10 before loci and the average error after loci was reduced by 3 12 and nine samples had an error greater than 10 before loci and the average error after loci was reduced by 5 48 geographic merging was handled in seasonal units therefore the deviation of merged precipitation processed by loci in different seasons was analyzed fig 6 b in spring and winter the precipitation variance was within 0 2 mm summer precipitation deviated by 1 2 mm whereas autumn precipitation deviated by 0 8 mm the mean deviations before and after loci were 0 07 mm and 0 04 mm in spring 0 31 mm and 0 18 mm in summer 0 17 mm and 0 10 mm in autumn and 0 04 mm and 0 03 mm in winter the precipitation deviation is further regulated after loci processing the amplitude of the deviation is lowered and the error range is convergent 4 3 comparative validation and case application of final merged precipitation the precipitation distribution of the fmp data in each season during the 2017 validation period is shown in fig 7 a there were apparent variances in the precipitation extent in different seasons in spring and winter the daily precipitation was low averaging 0 49 and 0 35 mm respectively in summer and autumn the daily precipitation increased significantly averaging 3 19 and 3 06 mm respectively this seasonal variability in precipitation corresponds to the actual condition according to fig 7 b the precipitation maintained a modest amplitude in all seasons except summer when the precipitation variability was substantial the distribution of high value precipitation varied by season as well high value precipitation gathered in the southern mountainous region during the summer scattered in the central region during the autumn and occurred in the eastern region during the winter and spring as indicated in fig 7 c the average daily precipitation in spring and winter had a high area proportion in the range of low values according to statistics 91 43 of the spring and 99 50 of the winter had average daily precipitation below 1 mm the average daily precipitation peaked at 3 05 mm in autumn the area proportion with average daily precipitation greater than 5 mm in summer was 10 65 a comparison of the evaluation indices of fmp and spps was performed table 4 overall fmp improved its cc from 0 63 to 0 68 for spps in the training testing period to greater than 0 80 in the validation application period the correlation between fmp and observations was clearly strengthened fmp in rmse and rb decreased by 1 71 mm and 0 08 mm compared to spps this indicates that the fmp error deviation relative to the observed precipitation has decreased fmp improved the pod average increase of 22 45 and controlled the far average decrease of 18 82 compared to spps strengthening the precipitation detection capability and reducing the false alarm ratio the improvement of fmp in the csi was apparent indicating that fmp can provide a more accurate reflection of precipitation performance than spps the differences in fmp performance during the training testing period and the validation application period were analyzed table 4 the cc difference was 0 05 and the rmse and rb differences were 0 51 mm and 0 05 mm respectively the pod and far change rates in the two periods were 3 34 and 1 55 respectively and the csi decreased by 5 26 from the training testing period to the validation application period according to the low degree of variation in the evaluation indices the fmp performance did not show significant deviations in different periods indicating that the generalization ability of the merging precipitation scheme in this study is robust the nse and kge were used to thoroughly analyze original spps process merged data pmp and gmp and final merged data fmp fig 8 as the merging process progressed from spps to fmp the nse and kge of precipitation data gradually improved the nse of fmp increased significantly compared to that of spps from 0 53 to 0 91 indicating that fmp performs well in capturing precipitation variability according to the kgb spps could be more biased the accuracy and reliability of fmp are improved over pmp and gmp the performance of fmp was evaluated and analyzed by comparing the observed precipitation during the 2018 application period four precipitation events were selected from june to september when precipitation frequently occurs in the study basin to demonstrate the spatial distribution pattern of fmp as seen in fig 9 fmp performed well during these precipitation events and its trend corresponded to the observed precipitation however underestimation still existed on several dates with heavy precipitation in the june precipitation event the fmp and observed precipitation trends were relatively consistent with averages of 7 12 mm and 7 25 mm respectively the greatest deviation occurred on june 18th with a difference of 1 89 mm in the july precipitation event the fmp and observed precipitation mean values were 6 73 mm and 7 16 mm respectively there was a significant difference 1 49 mm between the fmp and observed precipitation on july 17th in the august precipitation event the precipitation center appeared south of the basin the fmp and observed precipitation averaged 5 05 mm and 5 27 mm respectively the observed precipitation peaked on august 14th and fmp underestimated it with a discrepancy of 1 68 mm in the september precipitation event the mean values of merged and observed precipitation were 5 54 mm and 5 68 mm respectively the overall performance of the fmp data was satisfactory but precipitation events inaccuracies varied here the observed and merged precipitation data were acquired at the rain gauge locations and the error distributions are shown in fig 9 for the june precipitation event the errors mainly occurred in the middle southwest there were eight sites with errors of 5 10 and two with errors of 10 15 for the july precipitation event the errors mainly occurred in the north the number of sites with errors of 5 10 10 15 and greater than 15 was one one and eight respectively for the august precipitation event the errors were concentrated in the south with three sites having errors of 10 15 and five sites having errors of 5 10 five sites showed errors of 5 10 for the september precipitation event while the remaining sites had errors below 5 5 discussions 5 1 considerations in merging precipitation scheme design spps must be evaluated in merging precipitation schemes to avoid data redundancy there are numerous spps available and we prefer to collect release products with excellent resolution and long term stability the three layer spps architecture is intended to provide complementary advantages by considering the product differences in accuracy and spatial resolution the upper layer is the precision control layer the lower layer is the resolution control layer and the middle layer is the transition layer as a result the merged data s spatial resolution is improved while its accuracy is gradually controlled the spps used in the study basin were pre evaluated to compare their performance and characteristics to ensure the application s reliability and representativeness therefore the merged data s precipitation performance is guaranteed close to the precision control layer with imerg fr as the benchmark the spatial resolution is increased by combining the spatial resolution control layer with pdir now as the benchmark the input data do not contain rain gauge information for the stacking algorithm of merging precipitation processing on the one hand the stacking algorithm is designed to achieve the preliminary merging of precipitation products with high resolution or high accuracy to improve product performance on the other hand rain gauge information such as elevation latitude and longitude are fixed values that do not alter the time sequence thus adding these data to the learners will affect the accuracy of the merging outcomes the spps and worldclim data are time varying parameters that can be used suitably as training data in this study we investigated the importance ranking of input data for machine learners the input data chiprs ranked top among all learners as the transition layer of the three layer spps the importance of chiprs is undeniable functioning as a mutual adjustment of precipitation accuracy and resolution another precipitation product pdir now ranked second in importance in svm chaid and bp as well as third in rf water vapor data ranked second in rf third in chaid and bp as well as fourth in svm air temperature data ranked third fourth fourth and fifth in svm rf chaid and bp respectively the importance of radiation and wind speed data ranked low among the learners radiation data ranked third or second from the bottom and wind speed data was generally ranked lowest 5 2 validation of stacking algorithm and geographically weighted regression several learners are used in the stacking algorithm and the results have already been evaluated and analyzed however while building the stacking algorithm we must consider whether the trained model can perform well on new data for this purpose ten fold cross validation was performed to test learners accuracy ten fold cross validation treats all samples as training testing sets and each sample will be verified the correctness rate of the test results was counted to evaluate the learners accuracy fig 10 according to the test s accuracy results the learners are ranked as follows svm 98 22 bp 98 08 chaid and rf 97 07 rf and chaid were relatively inaccurate in the ninth 94 86 and fifth 95 44 tests bp and svm performed stably across tests correctness rates all over 96 although the correctness rates of each test varied the learners overall test performance was excellent to demonstrate the effectiveness of the gwr model on precipitation merging the traditional geographical adjustment model gam was used for comparison the gam realized the geographic merging processing of the pmp data by constructing functions of merged data and auxiliary geographic data the percentage errors between the two models and the observed precipitation were counted in seasonal units from spring to winter the errors of gwr were 3 47 1 58 1 40 and 2 88 respectively and the errors of gam were 8 39 2 80 1 64 and 5 56 respectively the errors of the two models are maintained at a low level by smoothing statistics for a large number of samples in the season the error is greater in spring and winter than in summer and autumn possibly because of the varied magnitudes of seasonal sample precipitation gwr considers the local effects of spatial objects and can detect non stationarity in spatial relationships which has obvious advantages over traditional regression methods according to the comparison results gwr outperforms the traditional gam 6 conclusion this study merged three satellite precipitation products spps with different spatial resolutions and accuracies to complement their advantages on this basis meteorological and surface parameters are combined to generate high precision and high resolution 0 04 merged precipitation data the merging scheme based on machine learning and geographic correction effectively considered precipitation probability and intensity and improved the accuracy of precipitation products in the regional basin the specific conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the learners obtain good simulation results using the stacking algorithm s double layer training the correlation coefficients are all above 0 95 and the mean absolute error and standard deviation are reduced by an average of 13 80 and 14 44 respectively the support vector machine shows the best simulation effect with the mean absolute error and standard deviation reduced by 18 94 and 23 31 respectively 2 the correlation coefficient cc between geographically merged data and observed precipitation increases from 0 88 to 0 91 in the merging correction of the geographically weighted regression the mean absolute error mae mean squared error mse mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean square error rmse had mean deviations of 0 15 mm 0 06 mm 12 77 and 0 20 mm respectively there are seasonal differences in these statistical indices 3 local intensity scaling processing improves the accuracy of merged precipitation data resulting in an average error reduction of 3 14 the merged precipitation data outperformed the original spps with the cc increasing by 0 19 the probability of detection pod increasing by 0 20 and the false alarm ratio far decreasing by 0 07 the merged precipitation data are stable in the validation application period indicating that the generalization ability of the merging precipitation scheme is robust 4 the comprehensive performance of merged precipitation is improved compared to the original spps the critical success index csi has increased from 0 50 to 0 69 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse has increased from 0 53 to 0 91 and the kling gupta efficiency kge has increased from 0 73 to 0 89 the merged precipitation data perform well under precipitation events and their variation trend is highly consistent with the observed precipitation the average difference is 0 24 mm due to the limitation of data acquisition relatively few observations were used in the study and the information quality of evaluation and correction could be improved the mixed meteorological conditions of clouds and ice might make satellite signal collection challenging resulting in uncertainties in the merging process in a follow up study more ground based observations are expected to be acquired to further investigate the reasons affecting the merging quality and generate more comprehensive findings credit authorship contribution statement

1926,global satellite precipitation products spps effectively obtain spatial precipitation information but frequently fail to meet application requirements in small scale areas due to low accuracy this study aims to design a merging precipitation scheme based on remote sensing and surface parameters to address the inaccuracy of regional precipitation the scheme data are based on daily imerg fr chirps and pdir now satellite precipitation products from 2011 to 2018 combined with worldclim model climate data and 39 rain gauge observations the scheme generates merged precipitation with high accuracy and high resolution 0 04 through the streamlined operation of multiple methods in the songhua river basin in northeast china first the stacking algorithm was employed to perform preliminary merging of spps and decrease data noise errors mean absolute error and standard deviation were reduced by 13 80 and 14 44 respectively second the correlation of merged and observed precipitation was improved by 1 18 4 46 in different seasons after geographically weighted regression finally the merged data were subjected to local intensity scaling which reduced the precipitation error by an average of 3 14 when compared to the original spps the final merged precipitation fmp improved the correlation increased by 0 19 and reduced the errors root mean square error and relative error decreased by 1 71 mm and 0 08 mm respectively fmp performed well under precipitation event cases with an average difference of 0 24 mm from observed precipitation the study realized the merging analysis of remote sensing precipitation data with varying precision and spatial resolution furthermore a systematic merging precipitation scheme coupled with multiple algorithms of machine learning geographic regression and mathematical statistics was formed this study provides a reference for merging precipitation at a regional scale which can be applied to other study areas as a process oriented scheme keywords remote sensing precipitation stacking algorithm geographically weighted regression local intensity scaling multi source data merging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to apparent issues such as geographic discontinuity and limited coverage ground based precipitation data are challenging to use effectively in some regions raj et al 2022 precipitation products delivered by satellite platforms have the features of spatial and temporal continuity as well as a broad observation range they can be used as an alternative or supplement for ground observed precipitation study on the applicability of satellite precipitation products spps in areas lacking ground based precipitation can enhance rainfall spatial and temporal distribution monitoring zhang et al 2022 various spps have emerged since the commencement of the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission in 1997 pradhan et al 2022 although the advent of spps has benefited the growth of precipitation data application capabilities the study found that certain errors still exist compared to actual observations moazami et al 2022 precision biases in precipitation estimates derived from satellite data are caused by geography meteorology instruments or algorithms the direct application of these products will result in analytical uncertainty gunathilake et al 2020 lyu et al 2021 compromising the accuracy of use it is challenging to obtain reliable precipitation information in the study area and thus improve the spatial and temporal distribution monitoring capability to make spps more profoundly and consistently implemented researchers usually adopt merging correction procedures to improve the performance of the products eini et al 2021 lin et al 2022 tang et al 2020 data assimilation improves the accuracy of precipitation data obtained through remote sensing introducing different types of observations into the numerical model through data assimilation can improve remote sensing precipitation accuracy and data reliability lien et al 2016 however numerical simulation and remote sensing observation errors can affect data assimilation accuracy reichle et al 2021 in summary spps accuracy can be improved in two ways by analyzing the error spatio temporal characteristics of multi source spps improving precipitation performance by complementing the characteristic advantages among spps and by merging spps with ground observed precipitation the spps merging is based on the matching and optimizing of multiple products with varying spatial resolutions and accuracies resulting in appropriate precipitation state inference chen et al 2022 the merging of multi source remote sensing precipitation data may avoid the defects of a single remote sensing product and achieve the effect of complementary advantages through the integration of weight alignment among data ma et al 2018 merged precipitation products are typically generated using bayesian weighted fusion or probability density functions beck et al 2019 xu et al 2020 it should be noted that a global merging approach is difficult to propose due to the inconsistent accuracy level of spps awange et al 2019 therefore when merging correction studies targeted setting methods and parameters are required in conjunction with the test area characteristics ahmadi and rahimzadegan 2021 machine learning technology has been steadily applied to precipitation merging studies because of the benefit of extracting nonlinear feature information from image datasets machine learning approaches have been used for precipitation related applications baez villanueva et al 2020 chen et al 2021 ehsani et al 2022 which has helped improve precipitation merging accuracy it was proven that a double layer machine learning algorithm outperformed the standard regression method regarding precipitation merging accuracy zhang et al 2021 additionally machine learning combined with multi parameter fusion methods can potentially acquire precipitation information in complex terrain areas khan and bhuiyan 2021 nosratpour et al 2022 however machine learning is sensitive to the performance of input spps resulting in precipitation merging accuracy deviations guarascio et al 2022 to increase the precision of the merging model it is necessary to completely evaluate the accuracy status and differential characteristics of spps in the study area chen et al 2020 as well as to employ representative and reliable datasets precipitation data accuracy can be improved by combining remote sensing precipitation with ground observations to establish precipitation background fields and optimize merging relationships li et al 2022 in previous studies geostatistical and optimal interpolation methods were commonly used to analyze merging products yumnam et al 2022 such methods account for the geographic autocorrelation of precipitation with a good correction effect liu et al 2019 real time satellite precipitation data can be calibrated using the determined functional relationship between precipitation products and observation data bárdossy et al 2021 the correction methods have been tested in various areas beaufort et al 2019 wei et al 2022 and the findings show their potential to address the precipitation bias problem however these statistical methods ignore the heterogeneous relationship between precipitation and spatial environmental variables leading to overfitting and scale mismatch errors the geographically weighted regression gwr model has been proven to outperform multivariate regression methods in dealing with spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in precipitation arshad et al 2021 wang et al 2022 merging schemes integrating multiple spps and ground based data have attracted continuous attention with the goal of improving precipitation data accuracy such as determining which satellite products or technical solutions are more effective for precipitation performance furthermore how to merge multi source spps with ground based parameters to achieve accuracy improvement by controlling errors is also a study focus lei et al 2022 yu et al 2020 to address the above issues it is necessary to independently investigate acceptable algorithms for merging spps and ground correction parameters and then attempt to form an integrated study scheme since spps performance is highly regional quantitative comprehension of their accuracy features over a specific basin is limited therefore improving the spps accuracy by merging methods based on the comprehensive performance of multiple parameters and algorithms is vital this has practical implications for understanding the regional precipitation variability mechanisms and improving precipitation data application capabilities this study aims to design a merging precipitation generation scheme to improve the performance of precipitation data and solve the problem of regional precipitation information scarcity the input data of the scheme include multi source spps ground based observations and model climate data the merging precipitation scheme couples methods of machine learning geographic regression and bias correction multiple methods and data were combined to form merged results with high accuracy and high resolution furthermore the performance effects of the merged precipitation data are compared with the original spps an application analysis is also performed to comprehend the effectiveness of this merging precipitation scheme in the study basin this study adopts algorithm integration to generate a systematic merging precipitation scheme for small scale areas realizing the complementary advantages of multi source remote sensing precipitation data with varying accuracy and spatial resolution and providing an effective solution for obtaining high precision merged precipitation data 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the songhua river basin is located in northeastern china and spans 5 6 105 km2 fig 1 this basin s topography is complicated and diversified with mountainous and hilly areas accounting for 76 and plain areas accounting for 24 the songhua river the basin s main river is an international river that flows into the sea through the russian far east the main tributaries are the nenjiang hulan and woken rivers the songhua river basin has a continental monsoon climate with significant regional and seasonal variability in precipitation mountains receive more precipitation than plains and summer contributes to 70 of the annual precipitation heavy rainfall is prone to flood disasters damaging agriculture industry and shipping in the region faiz et al 2018 improving precipitation monitoring capacity and acquiring broad coverage and high precision precipitation data are critical to the study basin s food security and economic development 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite precipitation products imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm global precipitation measurement chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data and pdir now persiann precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks dynamic infrared rain rate were the spps used in this study daily precipitation datasets for these products were acquired for 2011 2018 the spps are introduced in detail as follows the satellite precipitation retrieval data imerg are jointly developed by nasa national aeronautics and space administration and jaxa japan aerospace exploration agency skofronick jackson et al 2017 imerg captures precipitation patterns with the gmi gpm microwave imager and measures three dimensional precipitation structure with the dpr dual frequency precipitation radar huffman et al 2020 imerg covers 60 s to 60 n and all longitudes with a spatial resolution of 0 1 imerg has numerous run versions and this study uses the final run data hereafter referred to as imerg fr the chc climate hazards center collaborated with the eros earth resources observation and science to develop chirps which provides a reliable dataset for precipitation trend analysis funatsu et al 2021 chirps has a spatial resolution of up to 0 05 and covers 50 s to 50 n and all longitudes chirps generates gridded time series precipitation products by combining the improved inverse distance weighting technique and cold cloud duration funk et al 2015 pdir now is a high resolution 0 04 product covering 60 s to 60 n and all longitudes developed by chrs center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing nguyen et al 2020 pdir now improves the cloud segmentation approach and extends the cloud classification system by using high frequency sampling infrared images to improve the algorithm s ability to distinguish different rainfall patterns 2 2 2 worldclim worldclim is a global meteorological and climate database with spatial resolutions ranging from 30 arc seconds approximately 1 km to 10 arc minutes approximately 18 km hijmans et al 2005 worldclim is generated by global climate models gcms and has been widely used in environmental agricultural and ecological studies poggio et al 2018 cross validation reveals that worldclim can efficiently control data uncertainties and well on a global scale with an average correlation of 0 91 for components fick and hijmans 2017 this study used 30 arc seconds of data including air temperature radiation wind speed and water vapor components 2 2 3 rain gauge data the daily precipitation data from rain gauges provided by the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn were used for the study area the rain gauge data were subjected to strict quality control and consistency checks before release rain gauge data are suitable for comparative studies on spps evaluation wang et al 2019 data with longitudinal and latitudinal offsets greater than 0 05 and annual or cumulative missing sequences more than 30 or 90 days were excluded in addition sites above 50 n were not used due to chirps coverage the actual number of valid rain gauges in the study is 39 3 methods 3 1 stacking algorithm for merging satellite precipitation data the stacking algorithm is an integrated model with hierarchical frameworks build a double layer machine learning scheme using the stacking algorithm zandi et al 2022 to obtain the final results substitute the original dataset for training in the first layer learner and then use the prediction results as a new training set to train the second layer learner the purpose of utilizing double layer learners is to assign different weights to the first layer s prediction outcomes in the second layer wolpert 1992 therefore the characteristics and advantages of each learner can be fully leveraged resulting in more accurate merging results the stacking algorithm can be applied to numerous learners tyralis et al 2019 in this study the stacking algorithm uses four types of learners to achieve the preliminary merging processing of precipitation data including random forest rf support vector machine svm chi squared automatic interaction detector chaid and back propagation bp neural network the input data of the stacking algorithm include satellite precipitation and worldclim data and the output is defined as preliminary merged precipitation pmp before training the network each machine learning method normalizes the input and output vectors to 1 1 this avoids the problems of slow convergence and long training time caused by inconsistent units or excessive ranges 3 2 geographically weighted regression for merging ground parameters the geographically weighted regression gwr model introduces spatial location change into the regression coefficient calculation effectively tackling spatial location variability gwr analyzes the geographical variation relationship between the independent variable pmp data and the dependent variable rain gauge observed precipitation using local regression chao et al 2018 through gwr processing geographic geographically merged precipitation gmp was obtained gwr spatial weights should be calculated by determining spatial distances the weighting matrix which reflects the spatial dependence in the data is the key to spatial weights the weighting matrix is computed depending on the type and bandwidth of the kernel function to influence the decay rate at spatial locations the gaussian kernel function was applied in this study whose weight has normal distribution properties and the bandwidth can flexibly adjust the neighborhood size therefore the gaussian kernel function can effectively handle outlier effects thus better capturing spatial heterogeneity gwr obtains the regression weight values by incorporating the rain gauge precipitation values and spatial location elements into the decay function based on the spatial relationship weights gwr calculates numerous spatial location parameters to generate the regression relationship which leads to modeling 1 y i β 0 u i v i j 1 k β j u i v i x ij ε i 2 β i u i v i x t w ij x 1 x t w ij y where u i v i represents the spatial location y i and x ij are the observations of the dependent and independent variables respectively β 0 β ij and ε i are the constant estimate parameter estimate and regression residual respectively β i is the local coefficient x and y are the matrices of explanatory and dependent variables respectively wij is the weight matrix to avoid collinearity or overfitting in the model s application gwr was generated using a stepwise regression procedure the parameters and simulated values passed the test at a significance level of 0 1 3 3 local intensity scaling for precipitation bias correction the local intensity scaling loci method compensates for the long term bias of simulated precipitation by utilizing the time varying properties of observed precipitation hence avoiding the problem of geographic scale differences yin et al 2021 the first step of loci for bias correction is to define the wet day thresholds the second step is to calculate the scaling factors according to these thresholds and adjust the wet day rainfall bias wet day thresholds are often set using annual seasonal or monthly calibrations annual calibration would smooth out the difference in thresholds between flood and non flood seasons for this study causing calibration uncertainty monthly calibration employs twenty four fitting parameters threshold and scaling factor for each month increasing the risk of overfitting based on the above considerations the wet day threshold for seasonal calibration was chosen to process the data further the wet day threshold was determined from geographically regressed precipitation data precipitation counts were tallied for each season and the wet day threshold values were calculated in the spring and winter precipitation occurrences are scarce and infrequent the precipitation occurrence threshold 0 10 mm was used as the wet day threshold during these seasons summer and autumn on the opposite side have a high precipitation frequency the wet day threshold was set at 0 77 mm when the percentage of precipitation events reached 87 41 in summer and 90 05 in autumn this threshold meets the wet day judgment criterion that triggers the majority of precipitation events in the summer and autumn the scaling factor is then calculated depending on the determined wet day thresholds the scaling factor s is the ratio of the observed precipitation intensity to the gmp data wet day threshold schmidli et al 2006 3 s p 0 p 0 p wdt p wdt p m p m p wdt p wdt where p 0 and p m are the daily precipitation from rain gauges and gmp and the angle bracket indicates the long term average p wdt is the wet day threshold the result of the bias correction for daily precipitation series p is obtained finally 4 p t max p wdt s p m t p wdt 0 3 4 study process and evaluation indices the key processes of the study are based on the stacking algorithm gwr and loci to obtain the final merged precipitation fmp through the validation analysis the precision control layer is imerg fr with the best performance the resolution control layer is pdir now with a spatial resolution of 0 04 and the transition layer is chirps three layer spps were constructed for precipitation merging the study process is shown in fig 2 first a sliding window was applied to the three layer spps since the spps spatial resolutions are inconsistent it is necessary to sequentially determine the correspondence between the three products in the spatial position to eliminate the scale error effect then the air temperature radiation wind speed and water vapor components from the worldclim data were acquired and combined with the stacking algorithm to compute the pmp data after that rain gauge data were introduced to collect precipitation elevation latitude and longitude information gwr was used to achieve accuracy adjustment for the pmp data finally the loci was used to eliminate precipitation errors and the fmp data were output the data from 2011 to 2016 were used as the training testing set for the merging scheme the data from 2017 and 2018 were used as the validation application set to test the simulation effect this study used twelve indices to evaluate the performance of merging procedures or results the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse were employed in both process methods and final results the mean absolute error mae and standard deviation std were used to examine the performance of the stacking algorithm the mean squared error mse and mean absolute percentage error mape were also employed for geographic merging evaluation when evaluating the merged precipitation results the relative error rb probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were used moreover the comprehensive indices nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge coefficient were utilized to compare and evaluate the performance of the original spps and the merged precipitation data at each stage of the study process the expressions ranges and ideal values of these evaluation indices are shown in table 1 4 results 4 1 performance evaluation of preliminary merged precipitation the stacking algorithm applied the spps and worldclim data from the training set as samples for model training to obtain the pmp data fig 3 the simulation results of each learner in the stacking algorithm demonstrated good merging performance the cc was generally higher than 0 95 the slope in the fitting formula was kept at 0 96 0 97 and the intercept was between 0 04 and 0 07 the rf and chaid simulation results were relatively poor as evidenced by the clear stratification and intermittency in these two outcomes the svm and bp produced better simulation results the model prediction was performed using the testing set after determining the optimal parameters of the stacking algorithm the evaluation indices of each learner in the first and second layers were compared table 2 from the first to the second layer the maximum and minimum errors converge more and the range of errors gradually shrinks according to statistics double layer training reduced the minimum error by 7 73 11 17 and the maximum error by 31 20 36 42 the double layer training also helped to control the learners mae and std reducing errors by an average of 13 80 and 14 44 the svm performed best reducing mae and std by 18 94 and 23 31 respectively this indicates that svm functions well when performing double layer machine learning rf did not show a significant reduction in error on the double layer learner although chaid and bp reduced the error to some extent after training the overall effect was still worse than that of svm svm offers advantages in tackling nonlinear and high dimensional regression problems and avoiding overfitting making spps and worldclim data merging effective as a result of synthesizing the fitting effect and error information of learners simulation results svm can be chosen as the best suited solution for the stacking algorithm learner in the study region the performance of the pmp data obtained by the stacking algorithm was compared to the spps during the 2017 validation period fig 4 a the high precipitation values of spps were all gathered south of the study area which was well reflected in the merged data imerg fr had heavy precipitation in the eastern region and this information was preserved in the merged data the high value precipitation of chirps in the southern region was preserved after merging and the precipitation detail in the northeast was enhanced the pmp had good noise suppression compared to pdir now which had image noise in the west of the study area the pmp data effectively integrate multi source spps accuracy performance and high resolution information since the chirps latitude range only extends to 50 n the pmp appeared to have vacant value in the north according to the study scheme the pmp was based on imerg fr with the addition of two other high spatial resolution products to construct the final presentation pattern therefore the pmp data were more inclined to imerg fr in spatial morphology as shown in fig 4 b by north south and west east oriented precipitation profiles the high value range of pmp was slightly less than that of imerg fr because the merged data included information from both chirps and pdir now despite some disparities between the merged data and imerg fr the spatial resolution of pmp improved over imerg fr during the validation application period pmp had a mean value of 1 87 mm while imerg fr had a slightly higher mean value of 1 93 mm the mean values of chirps and pdir now were 1 73 mm and 1 57 mm respectively it should be emphasized that the stacking algorithm processes the pmp with the purpose of merging and improving spatial resolution while maintaining satellite product correctness ground based observation merging and bias correction procedures must be combined to acquire more accurate precipitation data 4 2 result analysis of geographic merging and bias correction the gwr model was utilized to combine pmp with surface parameters to produce gmp outcomes the difference in seasonal precipitation was considered when attempting to improve the performance of precipitation data table 3 shows the error indices of the gwr model in each season mae mse and rmse deviated significantly in summer and mape had the highest deviation in spring with more frequent precipitation in summer and autumn the possibility of error between gmp and observed precipitation was high but the error amounted to a small fraction of the observed value spring and winter had relatively low errors because of the modest precipitation samples themselves however there were individual large error samples in spring and winter resulting in a greater error percentage than in summer and autumn table 3 reflects the difference in geographic merging accuracy for precipitation in different seasons and indicates the existence of seasonal precipitation distribution in the study basin the merged precipitation before and after gwr processing was compared to the observed precipitation to assess the effect of geographic merging on the precipitation accuracy improvement fig 5 after geographic merging the correlation of precipitation was improved and the cc increased by 1 18 4 46 in different seasons the correlation of gmp was good in spring and winter but moderate in summer and autumn when precipitation frequency was high the slope of the fitting function altered considerably in spring after geographic combining improving by 31 87 compared to before geographic merging the slope of the fitting function changed considerably in spring after geographic merging improving by 31 87 compared to before geographic merging the slope of the fitting function improved by 6 75 and 16 84 in summer and autumn respectively whereas it decreased by 11 52 in winter the intercepts of all seasonal fitting functions were closer to zero after geographic merging indicating that geographic merging may effectively control the errors in precipitation products the intercepts in summer and autumn decreased the most noticeably by 0 56 on average and those in spring and winter decreased by an average of 0 17 the geographic merging results outperformed the pmp data in all seasons and the ranges and mean values were closer to the observed precipitation by using loci bias correction processing the fmp data were output the relative errors between the merged precipitation and observations at the site location before and after the loci are shown in fig 6 a before loci the relative bias of the merged precipitation ranged from 0 08 to 16 49 after loci the range of relative bias was 0 05 9 69 the statistics showed that the average precipitation error of the sample sites after loci was reduced by 3 14 the loci correction effect was more prominent for the samples with greater errors among the observation samples used twenty samples had an error of less than 5 before loci and the average error after loci was reduced by 0 61 ten samples had an error of 5 10 before loci and the average error after loci was reduced by 3 12 and nine samples had an error greater than 10 before loci and the average error after loci was reduced by 5 48 geographic merging was handled in seasonal units therefore the deviation of merged precipitation processed by loci in different seasons was analyzed fig 6 b in spring and winter the precipitation variance was within 0 2 mm summer precipitation deviated by 1 2 mm whereas autumn precipitation deviated by 0 8 mm the mean deviations before and after loci were 0 07 mm and 0 04 mm in spring 0 31 mm and 0 18 mm in summer 0 17 mm and 0 10 mm in autumn and 0 04 mm and 0 03 mm in winter the precipitation deviation is further regulated after loci processing the amplitude of the deviation is lowered and the error range is convergent 4 3 comparative validation and case application of final merged precipitation the precipitation distribution of the fmp data in each season during the 2017 validation period is shown in fig 7 a there were apparent variances in the precipitation extent in different seasons in spring and winter the daily precipitation was low averaging 0 49 and 0 35 mm respectively in summer and autumn the daily precipitation increased significantly averaging 3 19 and 3 06 mm respectively this seasonal variability in precipitation corresponds to the actual condition according to fig 7 b the precipitation maintained a modest amplitude in all seasons except summer when the precipitation variability was substantial the distribution of high value precipitation varied by season as well high value precipitation gathered in the southern mountainous region during the summer scattered in the central region during the autumn and occurred in the eastern region during the winter and spring as indicated in fig 7 c the average daily precipitation in spring and winter had a high area proportion in the range of low values according to statistics 91 43 of the spring and 99 50 of the winter had average daily precipitation below 1 mm the average daily precipitation peaked at 3 05 mm in autumn the area proportion with average daily precipitation greater than 5 mm in summer was 10 65 a comparison of the evaluation indices of fmp and spps was performed table 4 overall fmp improved its cc from 0 63 to 0 68 for spps in the training testing period to greater than 0 80 in the validation application period the correlation between fmp and observations was clearly strengthened fmp in rmse and rb decreased by 1 71 mm and 0 08 mm compared to spps this indicates that the fmp error deviation relative to the observed precipitation has decreased fmp improved the pod average increase of 22 45 and controlled the far average decrease of 18 82 compared to spps strengthening the precipitation detection capability and reducing the false alarm ratio the improvement of fmp in the csi was apparent indicating that fmp can provide a more accurate reflection of precipitation performance than spps the differences in fmp performance during the training testing period and the validation application period were analyzed table 4 the cc difference was 0 05 and the rmse and rb differences were 0 51 mm and 0 05 mm respectively the pod and far change rates in the two periods were 3 34 and 1 55 respectively and the csi decreased by 5 26 from the training testing period to the validation application period according to the low degree of variation in the evaluation indices the fmp performance did not show significant deviations in different periods indicating that the generalization ability of the merging precipitation scheme in this study is robust the nse and kge were used to thoroughly analyze original spps process merged data pmp and gmp and final merged data fmp fig 8 as the merging process progressed from spps to fmp the nse and kge of precipitation data gradually improved the nse of fmp increased significantly compared to that of spps from 0 53 to 0 91 indicating that fmp performs well in capturing precipitation variability according to the kgb spps could be more biased the accuracy and reliability of fmp are improved over pmp and gmp the performance of fmp was evaluated and analyzed by comparing the observed precipitation during the 2018 application period four precipitation events were selected from june to september when precipitation frequently occurs in the study basin to demonstrate the spatial distribution pattern of fmp as seen in fig 9 fmp performed well during these precipitation events and its trend corresponded to the observed precipitation however underestimation still existed on several dates with heavy precipitation in the june precipitation event the fmp and observed precipitation trends were relatively consistent with averages of 7 12 mm and 7 25 mm respectively the greatest deviation occurred on june 18th with a difference of 1 89 mm in the july precipitation event the fmp and observed precipitation mean values were 6 73 mm and 7 16 mm respectively there was a significant difference 1 49 mm between the fmp and observed precipitation on july 17th in the august precipitation event the precipitation center appeared south of the basin the fmp and observed precipitation averaged 5 05 mm and 5 27 mm respectively the observed precipitation peaked on august 14th and fmp underestimated it with a discrepancy of 1 68 mm in the september precipitation event the mean values of merged and observed precipitation were 5 54 mm and 5 68 mm respectively the overall performance of the fmp data was satisfactory but precipitation events inaccuracies varied here the observed and merged precipitation data were acquired at the rain gauge locations and the error distributions are shown in fig 9 for the june precipitation event the errors mainly occurred in the middle southwest there were eight sites with errors of 5 10 and two with errors of 10 15 for the july precipitation event the errors mainly occurred in the north the number of sites with errors of 5 10 10 15 and greater than 15 was one one and eight respectively for the august precipitation event the errors were concentrated in the south with three sites having errors of 10 15 and five sites having errors of 5 10 five sites showed errors of 5 10 for the september precipitation event while the remaining sites had errors below 5 5 discussions 5 1 considerations in merging precipitation scheme design spps must be evaluated in merging precipitation schemes to avoid data redundancy there are numerous spps available and we prefer to collect release products with excellent resolution and long term stability the three layer spps architecture is intended to provide complementary advantages by considering the product differences in accuracy and spatial resolution the upper layer is the precision control layer the lower layer is the resolution control layer and the middle layer is the transition layer as a result the merged data s spatial resolution is improved while its accuracy is gradually controlled the spps used in the study basin were pre evaluated to compare their performance and characteristics to ensure the application s reliability and representativeness therefore the merged data s precipitation performance is guaranteed close to the precision control layer with imerg fr as the benchmark the spatial resolution is increased by combining the spatial resolution control layer with pdir now as the benchmark the input data do not contain rain gauge information for the stacking algorithm of merging precipitation processing on the one hand the stacking algorithm is designed to achieve the preliminary merging of precipitation products with high resolution or high accuracy to improve product performance on the other hand rain gauge information such as elevation latitude and longitude are fixed values that do not alter the time sequence thus adding these data to the learners will affect the accuracy of the merging outcomes the spps and worldclim data are time varying parameters that can be used suitably as training data in this study we investigated the importance ranking of input data for machine learners the input data chiprs ranked top among all learners as the transition layer of the three layer spps the importance of chiprs is undeniable functioning as a mutual adjustment of precipitation accuracy and resolution another precipitation product pdir now ranked second in importance in svm chaid and bp as well as third in rf water vapor data ranked second in rf third in chaid and bp as well as fourth in svm air temperature data ranked third fourth fourth and fifth in svm rf chaid and bp respectively the importance of radiation and wind speed data ranked low among the learners radiation data ranked third or second from the bottom and wind speed data was generally ranked lowest 5 2 validation of stacking algorithm and geographically weighted regression several learners are used in the stacking algorithm and the results have already been evaluated and analyzed however while building the stacking algorithm we must consider whether the trained model can perform well on new data for this purpose ten fold cross validation was performed to test learners accuracy ten fold cross validation treats all samples as training testing sets and each sample will be verified the correctness rate of the test results was counted to evaluate the learners accuracy fig 10 according to the test s accuracy results the learners are ranked as follows svm 98 22 bp 98 08 chaid and rf 97 07 rf and chaid were relatively inaccurate in the ninth 94 86 and fifth 95 44 tests bp and svm performed stably across tests correctness rates all over 96 although the correctness rates of each test varied the learners overall test performance was excellent to demonstrate the effectiveness of the gwr model on precipitation merging the traditional geographical adjustment model gam was used for comparison the gam realized the geographic merging processing of the pmp data by constructing functions of merged data and auxiliary geographic data the percentage errors between the two models and the observed precipitation were counted in seasonal units from spring to winter the errors of gwr were 3 47 1 58 1 40 and 2 88 respectively and the errors of gam were 8 39 2 80 1 64 and 5 56 respectively the errors of the two models are maintained at a low level by smoothing statistics for a large number of samples in the season the error is greater in spring and winter than in summer and autumn possibly because of the varied magnitudes of seasonal sample precipitation gwr considers the local effects of spatial objects and can detect non stationarity in spatial relationships which has obvious advantages over traditional regression methods according to the comparison results gwr outperforms the traditional gam 6 conclusion this study merged three satellite precipitation products spps with different spatial resolutions and accuracies to complement their advantages on this basis meteorological and surface parameters are combined to generate high precision and high resolution 0 04 merged precipitation data the merging scheme based on machine learning and geographic correction effectively considered precipitation probability and intensity and improved the accuracy of precipitation products in the regional basin the specific conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the learners obtain good simulation results using the stacking algorithm s double layer training the correlation coefficients are all above 0 95 and the mean absolute error and standard deviation are reduced by an average of 13 80 and 14 44 respectively the support vector machine shows the best simulation effect with the mean absolute error and standard deviation reduced by 18 94 and 23 31 respectively 2 the

gupta efficiency kge has increased from 0 73 to 0 89 the merged precipitation data perform well under precipitation events and their variation trend is highly consistent with the observed precipitation the average difference is 0 24 mm due to the limitation of data acquisition relatively few observations were used in the study and the information quality of evaluation and correction could be improved the mixed meteorological conditions of clouds and ice might make satellite signal collection challenging resulting in uncertainties in the merging process in a follow up study more

1927,bias analysis is a significant component in the performance evaluation of satellite precipitation products spps and the relative bias rb is usually adopted as a key metric in all relative studies however when calculating the rb severe overestimation positive rb and underestimation negative rb with the opposite sign can be offset through summation when a small temporal scale changes to a large temporal scale and the final result will ignore the actual situation which weakens the validity and reliability of bias evaluation to solve the above problem the typhoon presenting capability tpc which consists of two metrics the presenting capability indicator pci and the bias type discriminant btd was developed as a new methodology for error evaluation during tropical cyclone events in this study by applying the tpc two quasi real time integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg products i e the early run and late run acquired during typhoon cempaka in july 2021 were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 underestimation of the precipitation by the two imerg products tended to occur at higher hourly rainfall intensities 2 mm at gauge scale and 100 mm at regional scale while overestimation occurred at lower intensities 2 the false alarm rate far and rb values were significantly higher in the pearl river delta prd than in other regions of the study area 3 through calculation of the tpc a positive and negative offset phenomenon was identified over the region around zhanjiang city in western guangdong by introducing the tpc for performance evaluation of imerg products during typhoon cempaka it was concluded that tpc is an advanced replacement of the rb for disclosing bias situations when adopting imerg to monitor and reconstruct typhoon processes keywords bias evaluation imerg typhoon presenting capability typhoon cempaka data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction tropical cyclones are extreme storms that frequently strike the coasts of the pacific atlantic and indian oceans emanuel 2005 typhoons are tropical cyclones generated in the south china sea or the western pacific and they frequently make landfall on the southeastern coast of china every year most of the precipitation in china s coastal area is caused by typhoon events zhou and wu 2019 excessive precipitation from typhoon activities often causes flooding resulting in economic losses and casualties wu et al 2020 tropical cyclones are worth exploring in the field of hydrometeorology traditional measurements of typhoon precipitation are obtained through ground observations but the density of the ground network cannot satisfy the requirements for monitoring and reconstructing typhoon movement on a wide regional scale in recent years the advent of high resolution satellite precipitation estimates has reduced the reliance on ground gauge data and satellite precipitation products spps have become an important supplement and potential alternative to traditional rainfall measurements su et al 2019 sunilkumar et al 2019 the family of spps consists of many members including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg as one of the most accurate providers of satellite precipitation measurements global precipitation measurement gpm project which was established by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa began releasing data in mid march of 2014 and is the successor of the trmm which was the first satellite rainfall project worldwide several studies have been conducted around the world on the application of tmpa or imerg data to monitor storms for example the bias detection correlation and error distribution of tmpa during six tropical related rainfall events tropical storms or hurricanes from 2002 to 2005 were analyzed over louisiana in the usa the results revealed that the tmpa products tend to overestimate low intensity rainfall and underestimate high intensity rainfall the tmpa has the potential to be a valuable source of high resolution rainfall information across many locations throughout the world that lack the capability to monitor tropical storms that make landfall habib et al 2009 during a 60 year return extreme precipitation storm on may 7 2017 the contingency hourly series of the area average precipitation occurrence and spatial distribution of the storm accumulated rainfall from imerg products were evaluated over guangdong in china the results revealed that imerg products generally capture the spatiotemporal patterns of storm accumulated rainfall but underestimate the storm accumulated precipitation zhang et al 2019 the performance of imerg products over four coastal provinces in eastern china during typhoon lekima 2019 was examined from three aspects 1 the results of the indices evaluation in time space and rainfall intensity 2 the precipitation characteristics over four provinces and 3 the spatial differences between the imerg products and rain gauge data during changes in wind speed when the typhoon landed the results revealed that as the release latency increased the precipitation retrieved by the imerg products increased and gradually approached the rain gauge observations the error was positively correlated with the precipitation intensity yu et al 2021 the results of the aforementioned studies demonstrate that it is valuable to apply imerg products to typhoon process monitoring spps should be regarded as having a good typhoon presenting capability tpc if they report precipitation estimates that are as robustly close to ground values as possible during strong storm events traditionally as a significant index for evaluating the difference between ground observations and satellite estimates the relative bias rb has been used to judge the amount of overestimation or underestimation based on its sign and value however there is an issue with the calculation of the rb which is referred to in this paper as the positive and negative offset phenomenon specifically the difference between satellite estimates and ground data may be very significant at some points during the typhoon s process indicating serious underestimation or overestimation these differences may have different signs because they belong to different types of bias as a result when calculating the rb throughout the entire research period the summation of the highly positive and negative values will result in a bias with a relatively low magnitude to avoid the positive and negative offset phenomenon which causes the difference to be smoothed and the real situation to be masked as the temporal scale increases the measurement of the tpc should preserve the differences between satellite estimates and ground data within each hour in this paper the tpc is quantified using a combination of two novel indices named the presenting capability indicator pci and the bias type discriminant btd the pci is calculated based on the concept of the critical precipitation value if the bias between the gridded estimates and ground observations exceeds a certain critical value at a certain hour the spp could be considered to be incapable of presenting the typhoon at that hour pci 0 when the deviation is 0 at a certain hour the satellite products can be considered to be exactly accurate in presenting the typhoon at that hour pci 1 therefore while the extreme values of the rb are not limited the pci should have thresholds with maximum and minimum values the btd is employed to judge the bias categories i e overestimation and underestimation in summary as a new perspective on bias evaluation the tpc measures the presentation of the typhoon process by the spps using score results during the research period in terms of the relationship between imerg data and typhoons there is a rapid short term demand for the ability to obtain precipitation data when adopting imerg for monitoring typhoons yu et al 2021 the imerg final run imerg fr may have a higher accuracy but its data release period is too long therefore to achieve the purpose of the examination of typhoon precipitation characteristics captured by imerg products the use of quasi real time imerg products in this study is a rational and meaningful choice typhoon cempaka number 2107 in 2021 was selected as the evaluation case it formed over the south china sea on july 18 2021 and influenced guangxi and guangdong in southern coastal china from july 19 to 23 2021 the typhoon s movement brought abundant precipitation to the area along its path five days july 19 to 23 2021 were chosen as the research period and the research area was the region in guangdong and guangxi south of 24 n 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in the southern coastal area of china including guangdong province and the guangxi zhuang autonomous region fig 1 the study area has a south subtropical monsoon climate and the number of days with a daily average temperature of 10 c is greater than 300 the study area is humid and rainy with an annual precipitation of 1400 2000 mm and it is the most vulnerable area to typhoons in china every summer 2 2 process of tropical cyclone movement the movement of typhoon cempaka as well as the locations of guangzhou yangjiang nanning zhanjiang city and quang ninh province is depicted in fig 1 d table 1 shows the classification of tropical cyclones and the corresponding wind speed scale defined by the china meteorological administration cma tropical depression cempaka formed near the south china sea at 06 00 on july 18 2021 and then it moved westward the cma upgraded tropical storm cempaka to a typhoon at 0 00 on july 19 at 13 50 on july 20 typhoon cempaka made landfall in the coastal area of yangjiang city southwestern guangdong province china the maximum wind speed was 33 m s when the typhoon landed and the wind speed scale was 12 typhoon the typhoon then moved westward through western guangdong and into guangxi when the typhoon approached nanning city in guangxi it began to turn toward the south and then it crossed quang ninh province in vietnam before reaching the beibu gulf the cma stopped observing typhoon cempaka at 12 00 on july 24 the track and wind speed of typhoon cempaka were obtained from the information on the official website of the national meteorological center of china https typhoon nmc cn web html 2 3 ground data hourly precipitation data utc time from rain gauge measurements were applied as the observation data there were 85 gauges at chinese national level ground meteorological stations in the research area fig 1 c these rainfall data are available from the national meteorological information centre of china http data cma cn and these data were subjected to strict quality control and have a high accuracy and reliability wang et al 2019b 2 4 imerg data imerg is a level 3 product of the gpm and is based on the gpm constellation of passive microwave sensors low earth orbit satellites and infrared sensors geostationary satellites the core satellite of the gpm constellation carries more powerful sensors dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and a gpm microwave imager gmi for improving light rainfall and snowfall detection and imerg measurements skofronick jackson et al 2017 imerg precipitation products can be classified into three datasets early run imerg er with a release latency of 4 h late run imerg lr with a release latency of 14 h and final run imerg fr with a release latency of 3 5 months according to the characteristics of the three products the imerg er and imerg lr can be considered to be quasi real time multi satellite products that is imerg er only employs forward morphing while imerg lr uses both forward and backward morphing the imerg fr is a post real time satellite gauge product fused with high resolution spatial and temporal precipitation observation data and it has been calibrated using gauge data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc huffman et al 2020 in this study imerg er and imerg lr were chosen imerg data can be downloaded from https gpm nasa gov data access downloads gpm for these two imerg products the selected field was the precipitationcal which is the complete estimate that most users want to access the data type was the half hour estimate to ensure the temporal unity of the ground and satellite data two half hourly precipitation estimates were accumulated into an hourly imerg estimate 3 methodology 3 1 traditional evaluation metrics in this study six types of performance evaluation metrics were adopted table 2 presents the equations and perfect values of the three voluminal metrics i e the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and relative bias rb and three categorical metrics i e the probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and critical success index csi in table 2 gd denotes the ground data while se denotes the satellite precipitation estimates h is the number of hit events for which both the reference and target datasets detect positive precipitation m is the number of missed events for which the reference dataset detects precipitation but the target dataset does not and f is the number of false alarms which is inversely related to m the values of h f and m vary as the precipitation threshold changes and the calculation of h f and m must be done under a certain precipitation threshold according to the cumulative precipitation within 24 h the precipitation level scheme is divided into six levels by the cma light rain 0 1 9 9 mm moderate rain 10 24 9 mm heavy rain 25 49 9 mm rainstorm 50 99 9 mm heavy rainstorm 100 249 9 mm and extra heavy rainstorm greater than 250 mm this scheme has been widely used in the relevant studies yang et al 2020 yu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 by adopting the above standard an hourly rainfall threshold can be determined daily rainfall is divided by the number of hours and it is considered to choose a value that ends in 5 or 0 after the decimal point near the calculation result 0 1 mm the lower bound of light rain which is not divided by 24 because of the tiny value 0 5 mm roughly corresponding to 10 mm day 1 mm roughly corresponding to 25 mm day 2 5 mm roughly corresponding to 50 mm day and 4 mm roughly corresponding to 100 mm day in the study five rainfall thresholds hourly rainfall is 0 1 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 4 0 mm are introduced the cc presents linear consistency between the ground datasets and spps the rb is used for measuring the extent of overestimation and underestimation of precipitation the rmse represents the dispersion degree of the dataset reflecting the overall error level of imerg products the pod means the fraction of the ground precipitation accurately detected by the spp the far reflects the ratio of satellite detected precipitation events but is not reported by the ground gauges the csi represents the overall detection capability of the spp the range of the cc pod far and csi is from 0 to 1 the taylor diagram can provide a concise statistical summary of how well different the spps and rain gauges match each other in terms of their correlation their root mean square error and the ratio of their variances taylor 2001 the variables introduced in the taylor diagram are listed in table 3 in table 3 to isolate the differences in the patterns from the differences in the means of the two precipitation fields obtained from the ground data and imerg estimates the rmse can be resolved into two components the overall bias ob and the centered root mean square error crmse the rmse approaches 0 as the two patterns become more alike however for a given crmse value it is impossible to determine how much of the error is due to a difference in the structure and phase and how much is simply due to a difference in the amplitude of the variation taylor 2001 in conclusion the crmse cc and standard deviation sd of the spps are the three statistics presented in the diagram the cc is a dimensionless statistic therefore non dimensionalization must be performed in order before these three statistics can be plotted on one graph the crmse and sd of the spp are normalized using the sd of the ground data 3 2 spatiotemporal scales three spatial scales grid scale gauge scale and regional scale and three temporal scales hourly scale daily scale and entire period scale are designed in this paper the grid scale means that all of the spp grids are analyzed in the research area at the gauge scale the ground data from each gauge are compared with the spp estimates from the grid where the gauge is located the regional scale means that the ground data from all of the rain gauges in the research area are put into one group the hourly scale means that the same hour is studied on all of the days during the study period the daily scale refers to one day in the period the entire period scale means that all of the hours in the study period are accumulated into one sequence 3 2 1 grid scale and spatial interpolation one of the intractable issues for evaluation at the grid scale is the spatial mismatch between the satellite precipitation estimates and the ground based observations zhang et al 2020a theoretically very dense gauge networks can capture the spatial patterns of precipitation well at the regional scale in reality rain gauges are usually sparsely and unevenly distributed zhang et al 2020b this difference needs to be processed using an artificial operation under this condition the spatial distribution of the precipitation is usually obtained by combining an interpolation method with ground rainfall observations huang et al 2019 based on the previous studies chiaravalloti et al 2018 paredes trejo et al 2019 tang et al 2016 an acceptable method is to interpolate the data from rain gauges points to the grids when analyzing the spatial distribution of the precipitation to minimize the defects of the interpolation method and give full play to the advantages of the interpolation method in terms of visualization the interpolation is only used to display the spatial distribution of the ground precipitation this only involves qualitative analysis of the spatial distribution of the precipitation kriging interpolation has become increasingly preferred because it takes into account the spatial correlation between neighboring observations and the desired location where the estimation is to be made adhikary et al 2016 thus the ordinary kriging ok method is adopted in this paper to interpolate the ground precipitation into 0 1 grids at the grid scale the problems encountered after adopting this method will be described in more detail in the discussion section 3 2 2 typhoon rain band determination in this paper to present the precipitation variation in the area where the precipitation process is deeply influenced by the typhoon movement the rain gauges in the principal typhoon rain band are selected fig 2 in detail by calculating the radius of the maximum wind speed which is a variable related to the wind speed and latitude willoughby and rahn 2004 the typhoon rain band in that circle can be determined the formula is as follows 1 r 46 29 e x p 0 0153 v max 0 0166 φ where v max is the maximum wind speed and φ is the latitude the determination of r is based solely on the data that has been subjected to quality control screening the limitations of this approach lie in the approximate normality of the parameters which may lead to underestimation of the actual variance it also fails to capture the full range of the variability of the eye size in nature willoughby and rahn 2004 however the main purpose of this section is not to study the determination of the typhoon rain band but rather to use the relevant formula to determine the gauge stations that must separately show the hourly precipitation variations during typhoon cempaka although the above formula has some drawbacks it is feasible to use it to obtain a rough estimation of the typhoon s core area the wind speed data for typhoon cempaka were obtained from the typhoon network website of the cma https typhoon nmc cn web html 3 3 new methodology for bias evaluation the pci can be discussed at each of the three temporal scales entire period one day and one hour the pci focuses on the magnitude of the deviation which ranges from 0 to 1 the btd focuses on the determination of the overestimation or underestimation and its value can only be 1 or 1 representing underestimation or overestimation respectively the tpc is a comprehensive index that combines the pci and btd and it is discussed at the entire period scale 3 3 1 presenting capability indicator the critical precipitation value pc ritical is an important concept in the calculation of the pci when the difference between the satellite estimates and ground data is greater than the critical value the pci is equal to 0 the degree of acceptance in terms of the typhoon presentation ability of the spps can be flexibly adjusted according to the accuracy requirements in different types of relevant studies that is p critical can be selected in countless ways to satisfy different demands in this paper we select four critical values as case representatives of different accuracy requirements for the spp to present the typhoon movement this does not mean that the critical precipitation value can only be set as these four fixed values the detailed information is presented in table 4 in table 4 the maximum difference between the satellite estimates and the ground observations for the two imerg products at the entire period scale is 58 mm in addition two concepts also need to be introduced when calculating the pci invalid and valid rainfall hours invalid rainfall hours mean that both the rain gauges and spps reported zero rainfall values during these hours while valid rainfall hours mean that the rain gauges and or spps reported rainfall non zero values during these hours only the pci during valid rainfall hours is calculated in this paper because the zero rainfall values during invalid hours do not necessarily reflect the actual rainfall situation thus the condition that the ground precipitation and the spp estimate are both 0 at the same time must be excluded in the pci calculation the expression of the pci at the hourly scale pci j is as follows 2 p c i j 1 s e g d p critical s e j g d j p critical s e 0 o r g d 0 0 s e j g d j p critical where se and gd are the spp estimates and ground data respectively j denotes the jth hour of the day and j ranges from 1 to 24 the maximum pci at an hour is 1 and the minimum is 0 if it rains for 24 h in a day the pci on the daily scale is accumulated from the pci of each hour however if it only rains for a few hours in a day the pci calculated on the daily scale by directly adding up the pci of each valid rainfall hour is not rational the pci value when the number of valid rainfall hours is 24 is definitely higher than that when the number of valid rainfall hours is 24 under this algorithm but the former is not necessarily better for typhoon presentation that is a unified standard should be considered in the expression of the pci on the daily scale if both the spp and rain gauge report values of 0 throughout the entire day the number of invalid rainfall hours is 24 it is uncertain to analyze the typhoon presenting capability under this condition and the pci of this day should be a null value based on the conditions above the expression of the pci on the daily scale pci i is as follows 3 p c i i 1 s j 1 s p c i j where s is the number of valid precipitation hours in a day and j denotes the j th valid precipitation hour of that day j ranges from 1 to s i denotes the ith day of the entire research period containing valid rainfall hours the maximum pci at the daily scale is 1 the maximum value is not affected by the number of valid rainfall hours and it is only related to the performance of the spps themselves the research periods of the different typhoon processes correspond to different days to maintain unity the maximum pci during all of the typhoon movements is set to 1 only days with valid precipitation hours are considered in the pci calculation on the entire period scale and the expression is as follows 4 p c i 1 t i 1 t p c i i where t is the number of days with valid precipitation hours and i denotes the ith day with valid precipitation hours during the entire period 3 3 2 bias type discriminant the btd can assist the pci in determining the ability of imerg precipitation products to present a typhoon because it provides the type of bias the bias between the spp estimates and the ground precipitation data can be classified into two types overestimation and underestimation the btd assumes that the determination of the type of bias is controlled by two factors one is the number of positive and negative estimated rainfall events and the other one is the magnitude of the positive and negative bias based on this premise there are three situations for the calculation of the btd and the formulas are as follows 5 b t d sgn k 1 n d k r b 0 s g n n d 0 n d 0 r b 0 n d 0 n d 0 s g n l 1 0 5 n d l 2 m 1 0 5 n d m 2 r b 0 n d 0 n d 0 where d se gd is the difference between the spp precipitation estimates and the ground rainfall data at a certain hour n is the total number of hours at the selected temporal scale k denotes the kth hour in the series at the selected temporal scale n is the number of events with d greater than 0 or d 0 among all of the hours at the selected temporal scale l and m denote the lth and mth hours in the series of events with d greater than 0 and d 0 at the selected temporal scale respectively if the rb is not 0 it is easy to conclude that the type of bias is overestimation or underestimation it is controlled by the magnitude if the rb is 0 it is difficult to determine the type of bias according to the magnitude the number of positive and negative estimated rainfall events can be compared to determine the type of bias the most special situation is when the number of positive estimated rainfall events is equal to the number of negative estimated rainfall events i e rb 0 in this situation the square of the difference between the spp estimates and the ground rainfall data is used for the comparison the results of the btd have only two values 1 and 1 which indicate underestimation and overestimation respectively 3 3 3 typhoon presenting capability the coupling of the pci and btd leads to the final calculation formula of the tpc the formula for calculating the tpc is as follows 6 t p c btd 1 p c i r b 0 b t d p c i 1 r b 0 the relationships between the pci btd and tpc are shown in fig 3 a when rb 0 it is not significant to determine the type of bias according to the sign of the difference between the satellite estimates and the ground observations hence the area fig 3 a enclosed by the tpc values of 1 to 1 and all of the pci values is defined as the fuzzy zone when rb 0 the type of bias can be significantly determined and the corresponding area in fig 3 a is defined as the significant zone the tpc ranges from 2 to 2 2 tpc 0 indicates underestimation and 0 tpc 2 indicates overestimation tpc 0 and tpc 2 indicate a perfect presenting capability i e no bias the tpc and rb are compared in fig 3 b 4 result 4 1 comparison of precipitation measurements from rain gauges and satellite precipitation products 4 1 1 grid scale fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the daily and 5 day ground precipitation data recorded by the rain gauges and imerg on july 19 the precipitation was intensively distributed in the coastal area of guangdong while a gauge in western guangxi also recorded heavy rainfall the accumulated daily precipitation on the leizhou peninsula and in the estuary area of the pearl river delta were underestimated and overestimated by the imerg respectively fig 4 1 on july 20 the area with heavy rainfall in guangdong expanded and the area where the typhoon made landfall corresponded to daily imerg estimates of greater than 100 mm the daily precipitation was still underestimated by imerg over the leizhou peninsula but two quasi real time products overestimated the precipitation over the region around yangjiang city where typhoon cempaka landed fig 4 2 on july 21 heavy rainfall occurred in both southern guangxi and southern guangdong and the area around nanning city had daily imerg estimates of greater than 100 mm the precipitation underestimation on the leizhou peninsula was significantly improved however the precipitation was overestimated near nanning city and it was underestimated in western guangdong north of the typhoon s path and the coastal and inland regions of guangxi fig 4 3 on july 22 the precipitation was intense in western guangxi and there was precipitation underestimation in the coastal and some inland regions of guangxi fig 4 4 on july 23 moderate rainfall was observed in the area close to the beibu gulf and slight underestimation occurred in the border region between guangxi and vietnam fig 4 5 in the area with daily rainfall estimates of greater than 100 mm the magnitude of the overestimation was greater for the imerg lr than for the imerg er in general the imerg quasi real time products showed the migration of the core area of the heavy rainfall and the spatial distribution of the rainfall during the movement of typhoon cempaka but they still had limitations in accurately quantifying the rainfall this result is consistent with the conclusion that the capability of the imerg to reproduce the spatial precipitation pattern and volume is enhanced but it has limitations in detecting extreme events fang et al 2019 the performances of all of the spps tended to decrease as the extreme precipitation threshold increased aghakouchak et al 2011 li et al 2020 discrepancy between the ground observations and gridded precipitation estimates is inevitable due to the existence of factors such as the atmospheric conditions latitude and underlying surface li et al 2012 peng et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 4 1 2 gauge scale sixteen rain gauges in the typhoon core area were selected as representatives the hourly precipitation variation during the 5 day study period at these stations is displayed in fig 5 when the hourly precipitation intensity was greater than 2 mm h 1 the two imerg products underestimated the precipitation in some hours at all of the rain gauge locations furthermore the precipitation was overestimated when the hourly precipitation intensity was greater than 2 mm h 1 however at 50 of the gauges a c d h j m n and p the precipitation was overestimated by the imerg products during a certain hour when the rainfall intensity was greater than 4 mm h 1 the occurrence and magnitude of the rainfall underestimation at the gauges around the typhoon s eye after the typhoon made landfall were significantly higher than at the gauges located farther inland two important thresholds that reflect the transition in the type of bias at a single rain gauge may be 2 mm h 1 and 4 mm h 1 this result is similar to those of other studies on the performance of imerg products during typhoon processes during typhoon lekima six gpm based near real time precipitation estimates underestimated the precipitation at higher rainfall rates 4 mm h 1 and overestimated it at lower rates 2 mm h 1 qi et al 2021 the underestimation at higher rainfall rates especially for typhoon rainfall may be an intrinsic feature among current satellite precipitation estimates yong et al 2016 which is probably associated with the weak linkage between the cloud top temperature and convective storms hamada et al 2014 4 1 3 regional scale at the regional scale the imerg products can basically present the change trend of the ground precipitation observations fig 6 the precipitation curves of the imerg er and imerg lr exhibit very similar trends for these two imerg products the overestimation primarily occurred in the early stage of the typhoon movement july 19 to 20 while the underestimation primarily occurred in the late stage of the typhoon movement july 22 to 23 both overestimation and underestimation occurred on july 21 when the total precipitation measured on the ground during a certain hour was greater than 100 mm the two imerg products always underestimated the rainfall during that hour in this study area it was found that a rainfall intensity of 100 mm h 1 may be the turning point at which imerg quasi real time products transition from overall overestimation to underestimation this finding provides further evidence that satellite precipitation estimates tend to overestimate low intensity precipitation and underestimate high intensity precipitation under low rainfall intensities the volume of the hourly precipitation recorded by the gauges only makes a very small contribution to the total regional ground precipitation during that hour however the gridded estimates overestimate the rainfall and thus in terms of the accumulated rainfall from all of the gauges the final result of the imerg products will be higher than the total ground rainfall under high rainfall intensities owing to the underestimation of the precipitation by the imerg the volume of the hourly precipitation of the imerg products only makes a very small contribution to the total regionally estimated precipitation during that hour abundant rainfall is observed over the ground gauge so the final result of the imerg products will be lower than the total ground rainfall 4 2 analysis of evaluation metrics 4 2 1 detection capability fig 7 displays three categorical metrics of each gauge under four thresholds on the entire period scale table 5 presents the pod far and csi values for the imerg er and imerg lr on the regional scale in fig 7 if the pod or csi value is 0 then the value of h is 0 if the pod or far value is 1 then the value of m or h is 0 a null value indicates that the denominator of the metric is 0 for example the null value of the csi indicates that h f and m are all equal to 0 null values occurred at many gauges when the threshold was set to 4 mm h 1 so the spatial distribution of the three metrics for this threshold is not shown for the two imerg products both the pod and far were quite high around the pearl river delta while the csi values were relatively low the csi values were higher in the southern coastal region than in the other regions in the study area the differences between the distributions of the three metrics for the imerg er and the imerg lr were very small as can be seen from table 5 as the threshold increased the pod and csi decreased while the far increased under the threshold corresponding to a very high hourly precipitation intensity 4 mm h 1 the pod and csi values of the two imerg quasi real time products were extremely low while the far values were extremely high for the thresholds 2 5 mm the imerg lr had higher pod and far values than the imerg er and the imerg er had a higher csi value than the imerg lr these results show that the typhoon detection capability of the imerg products exhibited regional characteristics in guangdong province on the daily scale fig 8 shows the three categorical metrics for each day for the two imerg products under five thresholds from july 22 to 23 the pod gradually decreased while the far significantly increased and the csi decreased july 23 corresponded to the lowest amount of rainfall in the entire study area and the pod and csi values were the lowest among the 5 days with the decline in the power of typhoon cempaka the number of rainfall events decreased and the detection performances of the imerg quasi real time products also decreased on the hourly scale fig 9 displays the trends of the three categorical metrics for the two imerg products over 24 h the pod remained stable at around 0 8 when the threshold was set at a low rainfall intensity when the threshold was 2 5 mm h 1 the pod values of the two imerg products decreased to the lowest values around 12 00 and the pod of the imerg er also decreased significantly at around 16 00 when the threshold was 4 0 mm h 1 the pod values changed sharply for the far and csi the far reached the maximum value and the csi reached the minimum value around midday under the five rainfall thresholds the csi values of the two imerg products were very close during each hour when the threshold was 4 0 mm h 1 the far values of the two imerg products were significantly different during some hours as was previously discussed it was found that during the 24 hour period analyzed the extreme values of the three categorical metrics occurred at 12 00 a similar result was also reported in a study on the diurnal variability of imerg products over china li et al 2018 according to this study severe bias of the extreme rainfall occurred between 20 00 and 22 00 beijing time or 12 00 to 14 00 utc time which was likely influenced by the less accurate cross track passive microwave sensor sources the values of the evaluation metrics fluctuated at the hourly scale indicating that the performance of the imerg varies between day and night a probable explanation for this is that the different types of precipitation clouds dominate during the day and night and remote sensors generally have discrepant detection abilities for them kummerow et al 2001 in the future diurnal cycle or sub daily corrections could be introduced into the imerg algorithm to improve this situation 4 2 2 correlation and error on the entire period scale fig 10 shows the cc rb and rmse for each gauge in the pearl river delta the gauges near the estuary of the pearl river had higher cc values while the gauges near the delta s margin had lower cc values in the 0 0 2 and 0 4 0 6 intervals the proportion of the cc for the imerg er was lower than that for the imerg lr however in the 0 2 0 4 interval the opposite situation occurred the rmses of the gauges around the typhoon s path were higher than those of the other gauges the two imerg products had a similar distribution of proportions in the rmse intervals the high positive rb values occurred around guangzhou city in the pearl river delta regarding the underestimation the imerg er had a higher proportion than the imerg lr these results indicate that the performances of the imerg products are influenced by the urban environment of the metropolises in the pearl river delta fig 11 presents the taylor diagram of the three datasets during each day and the entire period in fig 11 the correlation was lower on july 23 than on other dates while cc was around 0 4 on other dates in addition the sd and crmse values of the two products were the highest on july 23 by comparing the two imerg products it was found that the values of the three metrics from the taylor diagram for the two imerg quasi real time products were very close on july 20 and the imerg lr only had a lower sd than the imerg er on july 22 the imerg er had a better overall performance than the imerg lr on most dates during the entire period of typhoon cempaka this finding supports the viewpoint that the imerg er aims to provide information for short term applications while the imerg lr is appropriate for daily and longer applications zhang et al 2019 for studying typhoon movements the imerg er is a better choice than the imerg lr due to its shorter latency on the hourly scale fig 12 presents the trends of the three statistical metrics for the two imerg products over 24 h the cc remained at a relatively low value during the daytime and increased significantly at 18 00 the magnitude of the rb was higher during midday 10 00 to 14 00 than at other times and the rmse was the highest at 14 00 as shown in fig 9 the less inaccurate cross track passive microwave sensor sources cause significant bias from 12 00 to 14 00 utc time li et al 2018 both the cc and rb values of the imerg er and imerg lr were different at 1 00 3 00 5 00 16 00 17 00 and 20 00 while their rmse values were different at 5 00 10 00 11 00 13 00 and 17 00 4 3 evaluation of imerg products on typhoon presenting capability fig 13 shows the distribution of the btd and the proportion of overestimation according to the magnitude and number of events the distribution of the btd was the same as that of the sign of the rb value btd 1 overestimation mainly occurred in the pearl river delta the proportion of overestimated events was greater than 50 for all of the gauges but the magnitude of the underestimation was dominant greater than 50 at some gauges this suggests that a relatively small number of underestimated events corresponded to a relatively large number of magnitudes the imerg tended to underestimate rainfall more seriously at these gauges causing the btd to be 1 it was also found that the proportion of overestimation according to the magnitude was greater than 50 in the pearl river delta and the area around zhanjiang city however the proportion of overestimation according to the event number was significantly higher in the pearl river delta greater than90 than in the region around zhanjiang city there were more underestimated events around zhanjiang city these results further reveal the existence of the positive and negative offset phenomenon proposed in this paper according to fig 13 the rb values of all of the gauge stations were not zero during the entire typhoon movement period thus in this study all of the tpcs were in the significant zone with values ranging from 2 to 1 or from 1 to 2 the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the tpc for different critical values are presented in fig 14 the tpc distribution when pc ritical is equal to 5 or 10 mm is relatively uniform while the tpc distribution when pc ritical is equal to 1 or 58 mm is concentrated in a very narrow interval which is not conducive to better analysis of the typhoon presenting capability this paper only presents the results of the tpc when pc ritical is 5 or 10 mm when the typhoon s eye was close to the coastline and then made landfall in the southwest coastal area of guangdong from july 19 to july 20 the gauges with lower pci values were primarily located in the pearl river delta and the coastal area of guangdong fig 15 1 and 2 on july 21 the pci values at most of the gauges in both guangdong and guangxi decreased fig 15 3 however some of the gauges in western guangdong still had relatively low pci values on july 22 when the typhoon eye was in guangxi fig 15 4 on july 23 the typhoon moved into the beibu gulf and thus its influence over china weakened null values of the pci occurred at most of the gauges in the pearl river delta except for the gauges located in the estuary of the pearl river fig 15 5 during the entire period the high pci values tended to occur at the inland gauges while the low pci values tended to occur along the coastline of guangdong with the south china sea by comparing the two imerg products it was found that the pci of the imerg lr was higher than that of the imerg er at many of the gauges however the types of bias of the two imerg products were also opposite at some of the gauges at some of the gauges the btd of the imerg er was 1 i e underestimation while the btd of the imerg lr was 1 i e overestimation in fig 15 6 tpc values of 1 btd 1 occurred at the gauges in the pearl river delta and the region around zhanjiang city in guangdong while tpc values of 1 btd 1 occurred at the gauges in western guangdong in guangxi the distribution of the tpc values of 1 and 1 was not very regular the above results show that relatively low positive tpc values in red and orange occurred in the region around zhanjiang city and in guangzhou city however in fig 10 the positive rb values at the gauges around zhanjiang city were relatively low 0 rb 1 and the positive rb values at the gauges around guangzhou city were significantly higher rb 2 than those at other locations the differences between the values of the two indicators used for bias evaluation in these two regions were closely related to the fact that the positive and negative offset phenomenon is considered in the calculation of the tpc but not in the calculation of the rb 5 discussion 5 1 error after adopting the interpolation method an inherent defect of spatial interpolation is that in areas where there are no ground observations the data are obtained according to a given mathematical rule precipitation is a variable with very high temporal and spatial variability it is difficult to represent the real situation using the same set of interpolating algorithms to present the precipitation field in different regions however the implementation of high density ground stations is also difficult the interpolation method still needs to be adopted but the obvious problems with the interpolation results also need to be discussed fig 4 1 shows that in the western part of the study area there was a prominent bulls eye effect which was primarily caused by interpolation of the ground data if only one point in a point network corresponds to an extreme value the interpolation results will contain concentric circles centered on the extreme value point the spatial distribution of the precipitation estimated using the two imerg products demonstrates that an effective rainfall event did occur in the region around the bulls eye and the value of the rain gauge was significantly higher than that of the imerg precipitation estimates locally strong convective rainfall with a short duration at this rain gauge may be the reason why the center of the bulls eye corresponds to such a high daily rainfall and the interpolation amplified this phenomenon showing the error of the ground rainfall distribution and the obvious difference from the real situation 5 2 regional characteristics of the spatial distribution for metrics as can be seen from figs 7 and 10 the gauges in the pearl river delta corresponded to the relatively high far values positive rb values and the low csi values in addition on july 23 fig 15 5 the pci around the marginal area of the pearl river delta was zero while the pci had a non zero value around guangzhou city which is the core area of the pearl river delta based on the premise that the typhoon s eye was located far away from the pearl river delta rainfall was only recorded in the core area of the pearl river delta guangzhou metropolis the central pearl river delta the largest urban agglomeration in china with many metropolises and a dense population experienced strong spatiotemporal variations and more precipitation than the surrounding areas wang et al 2018 previous study reported that the imerg overestimates the precipitation over the central pearl river delta the urban environment on the positive side can generate short duration heavy precipitation and causes an uneven spatial rainfall distribution over the pearl river delta wang et al 2019a typhoon movements always bring heavy rainfall with a high intensity when coupled with the conditions of the urban environment the imerg products currently do have powerful capabilities in this area 5 3 comparison of tpc and rb figs 10 and 15 show that the magnitudes of the tpc values were very similar in the area around zhanjiang city and in the pearl river delta but there was an obvious discrepancy in the rb values indicating that the positive and negative offset phenomenon which was identified based on the results presented in fig 13 occurred for the gauges around zhanjiang city this finding illustrates the importance of the tpc in optimizing the error evaluation method during the typhoon process based on the results of the rb calculations the imerg quasi real time products performed poorly in the pearl river delta however based on the tpc calculations both the regions surrounding guangzhou and zhanjiang city corresponded to relatively weak typhoon presentation capabilities the introduction of the tpc effectively avoids the real situation of deviation being ignored due to the positive and negative offset phenomenon in the calculation of the rb and it also retains the type of bias which can be identified from the sign of the rb regarding the performance evaluation of the data for typhoon cempaka there was no instance when the tpc plotted within the fuzzy zone although on the hourly scale the value of the gauge data was equal to that of the imerg estimate the difference is 0 during 28 rainfall events it is difficult to conclude that the magnitude of the overestimation is equal to that of the underestimation at a large temporal scale in addition it is also currently difficult to completely eliminate the error between the gridded estimates and the ground data during the entire research period thus the fuzzy zone and the significant zone are only a theoretical division and the tpc value should be in the significant zone in most actual cases with the accuracy improvement of spps it is still possible to discuss the situation of the tpc in the fuzzy area in the future 6 conclusions using hourly ground measurements from 85 gauges in 2 provinces in southern coastal china in this study a new bias evaluation methodology the typhoon presenting capability tpc was developed then the tpc was used to evaluate the performances of two imerg quasi real time products during typhoon cempaka from july 19 to 23 2021 first the spatiotemporal characteristics of the precipitation at the grid and regional scales were analyzed during each day and the entire research period then several statistical and categorical metrics were calculated to analyze the rainfall detection correlation and error situation of the imerg products finally the tpc as well as the pci and btd was analyzed and the tpc and rb were compared the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 in terms of precipitation characteristics the imerg quasi real time products can capture the spatial distribution of and temporal variations in the ground rainfall caused by typhoon cempaka but underestimation of the precipitation easily occurred for rainfall intensities of greater than 2 mm h 1 and overestimation occurred for lower rainfall intensities 2 based on the calculation results of evaluation metrics the far and rb of the gauges were higher in the pearl river delta than in other regions 3 on july 19 and 20 the lower pci values were concentrated in the pearl river delta and the coastal area of guangdong the pci values around the marginal pearl river delta were zero while the pci values around the central pearl river delta were non zero on july 23 throughout the entire study period the btd values were 1 at the gauges in western guangdong the positive tpc values were primarily distributed in the region around zhanjiang city on the eastern coast of the leizhou peninsula and in guangzhou city in the central pearl river delta 4 by comparing the differences between the tpc and rb it was found that the tpc values around zhanjiang city were similar to those around guangzhou city but the positive rb around the former were significantly lower than those around the latter the rb values calculated for the gauges around zhanjiang city did not reflect the actual bias situation due to the positive and negative offset but the actual bias was reflected by the calculated tpc values the tpc makes up for the shortcomings of the rb while retaining

1927,bias analysis is a significant component in the performance evaluation of satellite precipitation products spps and the relative bias rb is usually adopted as a key metric in all relative studies however when calculating the rb severe overestimation positive rb and underestimation negative rb with the opposite sign can be offset through summation when a small temporal scale changes to a large temporal scale and the final result will ignore the actual situation which weakens the validity and reliability of bias evaluation to solve the above problem the typhoon presenting capability tpc which consists of two metrics the presenting capability indicator pci and the bias type discriminant btd was developed as a new methodology for error evaluation during tropical cyclone events in this study by applying the tpc two quasi real time integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg products i e the early run and late run acquired during typhoon cempaka in july 2021 were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 underestimation of the precipitation by the two imerg products tended to occur at higher hourly rainfall intensities 2 mm at gauge scale and 100 mm at regional scale while overestimation occurred at lower intensities 2 the false alarm rate far and rb values were significantly higher in the pearl river delta prd than in other regions of the study area 3 through calculation of the tpc a positive and negative offset phenomenon was identified over the region around zhanjiang city in western guangdong by introducing the tpc for performance evaluation of imerg products during typhoon cempaka it was concluded that tpc is an advanced replacement of the rb for disclosing bias situations when adopting imerg to monitor and reconstruct typhoon processes keywords bias evaluation imerg typhoon presenting capability typhoon cempaka data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction tropical cyclones are extreme storms that frequently strike the coasts of the pacific atlantic and indian oceans emanuel 2005 typhoons are tropical cyclones generated in the south china sea or the western pacific and they frequently make landfall on the southeastern coast of china every year most of the precipitation in china s coastal area is caused by typhoon events zhou and wu 2019 excessive precipitation from typhoon activities often causes flooding resulting in economic losses and casualties wu et al 2020 tropical cyclones are worth exploring in the field of hydrometeorology traditional measurements of typhoon precipitation are obtained through ground observations but the density of the ground network cannot satisfy the requirements for monitoring and reconstructing typhoon movement on a wide regional scale in recent years the advent of high resolution satellite precipitation estimates has reduced the reliance on ground gauge data and satellite precipitation products spps have become an important supplement and potential alternative to traditional rainfall measurements su et al 2019 sunilkumar et al 2019 the family of spps consists of many members including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg as one of the most accurate providers of satellite precipitation measurements global precipitation measurement gpm project which was established by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa began releasing data in mid march of 2014 and is the successor of the trmm which was the first satellite rainfall project worldwide several studies have been conducted around the world on the application of tmpa or imerg data to monitor storms for example the bias detection correlation and error distribution of tmpa during six tropical related rainfall events tropical storms or hurricanes from 2002 to 2005 were analyzed over louisiana in the usa the results revealed that the tmpa products tend to overestimate low intensity rainfall and underestimate high intensity rainfall the tmpa has the potential to be a valuable source of high resolution rainfall information across many locations throughout the world that lack the capability to monitor tropical storms that make landfall habib et al 2009 during a 60 year return extreme precipitation storm on may 7 2017 the contingency hourly series of the area average precipitation occurrence and spatial distribution of the storm accumulated rainfall from imerg products were evaluated over guangdong in china the results revealed that imerg products generally capture the spatiotemporal patterns of storm accumulated rainfall but underestimate the storm accumulated precipitation zhang et al 2019 the performance of imerg products over four coastal provinces in eastern china during typhoon lekima 2019 was examined from three aspects 1 the results of the indices evaluation in time space and rainfall intensity 2 the precipitation characteristics over four provinces and 3 the spatial differences between the imerg products and rain gauge data during changes in wind speed when the typhoon landed the results revealed that as the release latency increased the precipitation retrieved by the imerg products increased and gradually approached the rain gauge observations the error was positively correlated with the precipitation intensity yu et al 2021 the results of the aforementioned studies demonstrate that it is valuable to apply imerg products to typhoon process monitoring spps should be regarded as having a good typhoon presenting capability tpc if they report precipitation estimates that are as robustly close to ground values as possible during strong storm events traditionally as a significant index for evaluating the difference between ground observations and satellite estimates the relative bias rb has been used to judge the amount of overestimation or underestimation based on its sign and value however there is an issue with the calculation of the rb which is referred to in this paper as the positive and negative offset phenomenon specifically the difference between satellite estimates and ground data may be very significant at some points during the typhoon s process indicating serious underestimation or overestimation these differences may have different signs because they belong to different types of bias as a result when calculating the rb throughout the entire research period the summation of the highly positive and negative values will result in a bias with a relatively low magnitude to avoid the positive and negative offset phenomenon which causes the difference to be smoothed and the real situation to be masked as the temporal scale increases the measurement of the tpc should preserve the differences between satellite estimates and ground data within each hour in this paper the tpc is quantified using a combination of two novel indices named the presenting capability indicator pci and the bias type discriminant btd the pci is calculated based on the concept of the critical precipitation value if the bias between the gridded estimates and ground observations exceeds a certain critical value at a certain hour the spp could be considered to be incapable of presenting the typhoon at that hour pci 0 when the deviation is 0 at a certain hour the satellite products can be considered to be exactly accurate in presenting the typhoon at that hour pci 1 therefore while the extreme values of the rb are not limited the pci should have thresholds with maximum and minimum values the btd is employed to judge the bias categories i e overestimation and underestimation in summary as a new perspective on bias evaluation the tpc measures the presentation of the typhoon process by the spps using score results during the research period in terms of the relationship between imerg data and typhoons there is a rapid short term demand for the ability to obtain precipitation data when adopting imerg for monitoring typhoons yu et al 2021 the imerg final run imerg fr may have a higher accuracy but its data release period is too long therefore to achieve the purpose of the examination of typhoon precipitation characteristics captured by imerg products the use of quasi real time imerg products in this study is a rational and meaningful choice typhoon cempaka number 2107 in 2021 was selected as the evaluation case it formed over the south china sea on july 18 2021 and influenced guangxi and guangdong in southern coastal china from july 19 to 23 2021 the typhoon s movement brought abundant precipitation to the area along its path five days july 19 to 23 2021 were chosen as the research period and the research area was the region in guangdong and guangxi south of 24 n 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in the southern coastal area of china including guangdong province and the guangxi zhuang autonomous region fig 1 the study area has a south subtropical monsoon climate and the number of days with a daily average temperature of 10 c is greater than 300 the study area is humid and rainy with an annual precipitation of 1400 2000 mm and it is the most vulnerable area to typhoons in china every summer 2 2 process of tropical cyclone movement the movement of typhoon cempaka as well as the locations of guangzhou yangjiang nanning zhanjiang city and quang ninh province is depicted in fig 1 d table 1 shows the classification of tropical cyclones and the corresponding wind speed scale defined by the china meteorological administration cma tropical depression cempaka formed near the south china sea at 06 00 on july 18 2021 and then it moved westward the cma upgraded tropical storm cempaka to a typhoon at 0 00 on july 19 at 13 50 on july 20 typhoon cempaka made landfall in the coastal area of yangjiang city southwestern guangdong province china the maximum wind speed was 33 m s when the typhoon landed and the wind speed scale was 12 typhoon the typhoon then moved westward through western guangdong and into guangxi when the typhoon approached nanning city in guangxi it began to turn toward the south and then it crossed quang ninh province in vietnam before reaching the beibu gulf the cma stopped observing typhoon cempaka at 12 00 on july 24 the track and wind speed of typhoon cempaka were obtained from the information on the official website of the national meteorological center of china https typhoon nmc cn web html 2 3 ground data hourly precipitation data utc time from rain gauge measurements were applied as the observation data there were 85 gauges at chinese national level ground meteorological stations in the research area fig 1 c these rainfall data are available from the national meteorological information centre of china http data cma cn and these data were subjected to strict quality control and have a high accuracy and reliability wang et al 2019b 2 4 imerg data imerg is a level 3 product of the gpm and is based on the gpm constellation of passive microwave sensors low earth orbit satellites and infrared sensors geostationary satellites the core satellite of the gpm constellation carries more powerful sensors dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and a gpm microwave imager gmi for improving light rainfall and snowfall detection and imerg measurements skofronick jackson et al 2017 imerg precipitation products can be classified into three datasets early run imerg er with a release latency of 4 h late run imerg lr with a release latency of 14 h and final run imerg fr with a release latency of 3 5 months according to the characteristics of the three products the imerg er and imerg lr can be considered to be quasi real time multi satellite products that is imerg er only employs forward morphing while imerg lr uses both forward and backward morphing the imerg fr is a post real time satellite gauge product fused with high resolution spatial and temporal precipitation observation data and it has been calibrated using gauge data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc huffman et al 2020 in this study imerg er and imerg lr were chosen imerg data can be downloaded from https gpm nasa gov data access downloads gpm for these two imerg products the selected field was the precipitationcal which is the complete estimate that most users want to access the data type was the half hour estimate to ensure the temporal unity of the ground and satellite data two half hourly precipitation estimates were accumulated into an hourly imerg estimate 3 methodology 3 1 traditional evaluation metrics in this study six types of performance evaluation metrics were adopted table 2 presents the equations and perfect values of the three voluminal metrics i e the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and relative bias rb and three categorical metrics i e the probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and critical success index csi in table 2 gd denotes the ground data while se denotes the satellite precipitation estimates h is the number of hit events for which both the reference and target datasets detect positive precipitation m is the number of missed events for which the reference dataset detects precipitation but the target dataset does not and f is the number of false alarms which is inversely related to m the values of h f and m vary as the precipitation threshold changes and the calculation of h f and m must be done under a certain precipitation threshold according to the cumulative precipitation within 24 h the precipitation level scheme is divided into six levels by the cma light rain 0 1 9 9 mm moderate rain 10 24 9 mm heavy rain 25 49 9 mm rainstorm 50 99 9 mm heavy rainstorm 100 249 9 mm and extra heavy rainstorm greater than 250 mm this scheme has been widely used in the relevant studies yang et al 2020 yu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 by adopting the above standard an hourly rainfall threshold can be determined daily rainfall is divided by the number of hours and it is considered to choose a value that ends in 5 or 0 after the decimal point near the calculation result 0 1 mm the lower bound of light rain which is not divided by 24 because of the tiny value 0 5 mm roughly corresponding to 10 mm day 1 mm roughly corresponding to 25 mm day 2 5 mm roughly corresponding to 50 mm day and 4 mm roughly corresponding to 100 mm day in the study five rainfall thresholds hourly rainfall is 0 1 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 4 0 mm are introduced the cc presents linear consistency between the ground datasets and spps the rb is used for measuring the extent of overestimation and underestimation of precipitation the rmse represents the dispersion degree of the dataset reflecting the overall error level of imerg products the pod means the fraction of the ground precipitation accurately detected by the spp the far reflects the ratio of satellite detected precipitation events but is not reported by the ground gauges the csi represents the overall detection capability of the spp the range of the cc pod far and csi is from 0 to 1 the taylor diagram can provide a concise statistical summary of how well different the spps and rain gauges match each other in terms of their correlation their root mean square error and the ratio of their variances taylor 2001 the variables introduced in the taylor diagram are listed in table 3 in table 3 to isolate the differences in the patterns from the differences in the means of the two precipitation fields obtained from the ground data and imerg estimates the rmse can be resolved into two components the overall bias ob and the centered root mean square error crmse the rmse approaches 0 as the two patterns become more alike however for a given crmse value it is impossible to determine how much of the error is due to a difference in the structure and phase and how much is simply due to a difference in the amplitude of the variation taylor 2001 in conclusion the crmse cc and standard deviation sd of the spps are the three statistics presented in the diagram the cc is a dimensionless statistic therefore non dimensionalization must be performed in order before these three statistics can be plotted on one graph the crmse and sd of the spp are normalized using the sd of the ground data 3 2 spatiotemporal scales three spatial scales grid scale gauge scale and regional scale and three temporal scales hourly scale daily scale and entire period scale are designed in this paper the grid scale means that all of the spp grids are analyzed in the research area at the gauge scale the ground data from each gauge are compared with the spp estimates from the grid where the gauge is located the regional scale means that the ground data from all of the rain gauges in the research area are put into one group the hourly scale means that the same hour is studied on all of the days during the study period the daily scale refers to one day in the period the entire period scale means that all of the hours in the study period are accumulated into one sequence 3 2 1 grid scale and spatial interpolation one of the intractable issues for evaluation at the grid scale is the spatial mismatch between the satellite precipitation estimates and the ground based observations zhang et al 2020a theoretically very dense gauge networks can capture the spatial patterns of precipitation well at the regional scale in reality rain gauges are usually sparsely and unevenly distributed zhang et al 2020b this difference needs to be processed using an artificial operation under this condition the spatial distribution of the precipitation is usually obtained by combining an interpolation method with ground rainfall observations huang et al 2019 based on the previous studies chiaravalloti et al 2018 paredes trejo et al 2019 tang et al 2016 an acceptable method is to interpolate the data from rain gauges points to the grids when analyzing the spatial distribution of the precipitation to minimize the defects of the interpolation method and give full play to the advantages of the interpolation method in terms of visualization the interpolation is only used to display the spatial distribution of the ground precipitation this only involves qualitative analysis of the spatial distribution of the precipitation kriging interpolation has become increasingly preferred because it takes into account the spatial correlation between neighboring observations and the desired location where the estimation is to be made adhikary et al 2016 thus the ordinary kriging ok method is adopted in this paper to interpolate the ground precipitation into 0 1 grids at the grid scale the problems encountered after adopting this method will be described in more detail in the discussion section 3 2 2 typhoon rain band determination in this paper to present the precipitation variation in the area where the precipitation process is deeply influenced by the typhoon movement the rain gauges in the principal typhoon rain band are selected fig 2 in detail by calculating the radius of the maximum wind speed which is a variable related to the wind speed and latitude willoughby and rahn 2004 the typhoon rain band in that circle can be determined the formula is as follows 1 r 46 29 e x p 0 0153 v max 0 0166 φ where v max is the maximum wind speed and φ is the latitude the determination of r is based solely on the data that has been subjected to quality control screening the limitations of this approach lie in the approximate normality of the parameters which may lead to underestimation of the actual variance it also fails to capture the full range of the variability of the eye size in nature willoughby and rahn 2004 however the main purpose of this section is not to study the determination of the typhoon rain band but rather to use the relevant formula to determine the gauge stations that must separately show the hourly precipitation variations during typhoon cempaka although the above formula has some drawbacks it is feasible to use it to obtain a rough estimation of the typhoon s core area the wind speed data for typhoon cempaka were obtained from the typhoon network website of the cma https typhoon nmc cn web html 3 3 new methodology for bias evaluation the pci can be discussed at each of the three temporal scales entire period one day and one hour the pci focuses on the magnitude of the deviation which ranges from 0 to 1 the btd focuses on the determination of the overestimation or underestimation and its value can only be 1 or 1 representing underestimation or overestimation respectively the tpc is a comprehensive index that combines the pci and btd and it is discussed at the entire period scale 3 3 1 presenting capability indicator the critical precipitation value pc ritical is an important concept in the calculation of the pci when the difference between the satellite estimates and ground data is greater than the critical value the pci is equal to 0 the degree of acceptance in terms of the typhoon presentation ability of the spps can be flexibly adjusted according to the accuracy requirements in different types of relevant studies that is p critical can be selected in countless ways to satisfy different demands in this paper we select four critical values as case representatives of different accuracy requirements for the spp to present the typhoon movement this does not mean that the critical precipitation value can only be set as these four fixed values the detailed information is presented in table 4 in table 4 the maximum difference between the satellite estimates and the ground observations for the two imerg products at the entire period scale is 58 mm in addition two concepts also need to be introduced when calculating the pci invalid and valid rainfall hours invalid rainfall hours mean that both the rain gauges and spps reported zero rainfall values during these hours while valid rainfall hours mean that the rain gauges and or spps reported rainfall non zero values during these hours only the pci during valid rainfall hours is calculated in this paper because the zero rainfall values during invalid hours do not necessarily reflect the actual rainfall situation thus the condition that the ground precipitation and the spp estimate are both 0 at the same time must be excluded in the pci calculation the expression of the pci at the hourly scale pci j is as follows 2 p c i j 1 s e g d p critical s e j g d j p critical s e 0 o r g d 0 0 s e j g d j p critical where se and gd are the spp estimates and ground data respectively j denotes the jth hour of the day and j ranges from 1 to 24 the maximum pci at an hour is 1 and the minimum is 0 if it rains for 24 h in a day the pci on the daily scale is accumulated from the pci of each hour however if it only rains for a few hours in a day the pci calculated on the daily scale by directly adding up the pci of each valid rainfall hour is not rational the pci value when the number of valid rainfall hours is 24 is definitely higher than that when the number of valid rainfall hours is 24 under this algorithm but the former is not necessarily better for typhoon presentation that is a unified standard should be considered in the expression of the pci on the daily scale if both the spp and rain gauge report values of 0 throughout the entire day the number of invalid rainfall hours is 24 it is uncertain to analyze the typhoon presenting capability under this condition and the pci of this day should be a null value based on the conditions above the expression of the pci on the daily scale pci i is as follows 3 p c i i 1 s j 1 s p c i j where s is the number of valid precipitation hours in a day and j denotes the j th valid precipitation hour of that day j ranges from 1 to s i denotes the ith day of the entire research period containing valid rainfall hours the maximum pci at the daily scale is 1 the maximum value is not affected by the number of valid rainfall hours and it is only related to the performance of the spps themselves the research periods of the different typhoon processes correspond to different days to maintain unity the maximum pci during all of the typhoon movements is set to 1 only days with valid precipitation hours are considered in the pci calculation on the entire period scale and the expression is as follows 4 p c i 1 t i 1 t p c i i where t is the number of days with valid precipitation hours and i denotes the ith day with valid precipitation hours during the entire period 3 3 2 bias type discriminant the btd can assist the pci in determining the ability of imerg precipitation products to present a typhoon because it provides the type of bias the bias between the spp estimates and the ground precipitation data can be classified into two types overestimation and underestimation the btd assumes that the determination of the type of bias is controlled by two factors one is the number of positive and negative estimated rainfall events and the other one is the magnitude of the positive and negative bias based on this premise there are three situations for the calculation of the btd and the formulas are as follows 5 b t d sgn k 1 n d k r b 0 s g n n d 0 n d 0 r b 0 n d 0 n d 0 s g n l 1 0 5 n d l 2 m 1 0 5 n d m 2 r b 0 n d 0 n d 0 where d se gd is the difference between the spp precipitation estimates and the ground rainfall data at a certain hour n is the total number of hours at the selected temporal scale k denotes the kth hour in the series at the selected temporal scale n is the number of events with d greater than 0 or d 0 among all of the hours at the selected temporal scale l and m denote the lth and mth hours in the series of events with d greater than 0 and d 0 at the selected temporal scale respectively if the rb is not 0 it is easy to conclude that the type of bias is overestimation or underestimation it is controlled by the magnitude if the rb is 0 it is difficult to determine the type of bias according to the magnitude the number of positive and negative estimated rainfall events can be compared to determine the type of bias the most special situation is when the number of positive estimated rainfall events is equal to the number of negative estimated rainfall events i e rb 0 in this situation the square of the difference between the spp estimates and the ground rainfall data is used for the comparison the results of the btd have only two values 1 and 1 which indicate underestimation and overestimation respectively 3 3 3 typhoon presenting capability the coupling of the pci and btd leads to the final calculation formula of the tpc the formula for calculating the tpc is as follows 6 t p c btd 1 p c i r b 0 b t d p c i 1 r b 0 the relationships between the pci btd and tpc are shown in fig 3 a when rb 0 it is not significant to determine the type of bias according to the sign of the difference between the satellite estimates and the ground observations hence the area fig 3 a enclosed by the tpc values of 1 to 1 and all of the pci values is defined as the fuzzy zone when rb 0 the type of bias can be significantly determined and the corresponding area in fig 3 a is defined as the significant zone the tpc ranges from 2 to 2 2 tpc 0 indicates underestimation and 0 tpc 2 indicates overestimation tpc 0 and tpc 2 indicate a perfect presenting capability i e no bias the tpc and rb are compared in fig 3 b 4 result 4 1 comparison of precipitation measurements from rain gauges and satellite precipitation products 4 1 1 grid scale fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the daily and 5 day ground precipitation data recorded by the rain gauges and imerg on july 19 the precipitation was intensively distributed in the coastal area of guangdong while a gauge in western guangxi also recorded heavy rainfall the accumulated daily precipitation on the leizhou peninsula and in the estuary area of the pearl river delta were underestimated and overestimated by the imerg respectively fig 4 1 on july 20 the area with heavy rainfall in guangdong expanded and the area where the typhoon made landfall corresponded to daily imerg estimates of greater than 100 mm the daily precipitation was still underestimated by imerg over the leizhou peninsula but two quasi real time products overestimated the precipitation over the region around yangjiang city where typhoon cempaka landed fig 4 2 on july 21 heavy rainfall occurred in both southern guangxi and southern guangdong and the area around nanning city had daily imerg estimates of greater than 100 mm the precipitation underestimation on the leizhou peninsula was significantly improved however the precipitation was overestimated near nanning city and it was underestimated in western guangdong north of the typhoon s path and the coastal and inland regions of guangxi fig 4 3 on july 22 the precipitation was intense in western guangxi and there was precipitation underestimation in the coastal and some inland regions of guangxi fig 4 4 on july 23 moderate rainfall was observed in the area close to the beibu gulf and slight underestimation occurred in the border region between guangxi and vietnam fig 4 5 in the area with daily rainfall estimates of greater than 100 mm the magnitude of the overestimation was greater for the imerg lr than for the imerg er in general the imerg quasi real time products showed the migration of the core area of the heavy rainfall and the spatial distribution of the rainfall during the movement of typhoon cempaka but they still had limitations in accurately quantifying the rainfall this result is consistent with the conclusion that the capability of the imerg to reproduce the spatial precipitation pattern and volume is enhanced but it has limitations in detecting extreme events fang et al 2019 the performances of all of the spps tended to decrease as the extreme precipitation threshold increased aghakouchak et al 2011 li et al 2020 discrepancy between the ground observations and gridded precipitation estimates is inevitable due to the existence of factors such as the atmospheric conditions latitude and underlying surface li et al 2012 peng et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 4 1 2 gauge scale sixteen rain gauges in the typhoon core area were selected as representatives the hourly precipitation variation during the 5 day study period at these stations is displayed in fig 5 when the hourly precipitation intensity was greater than 2 mm h 1 the two imerg products underestimated the precipitation in some hours at all of the rain gauge locations furthermore the precipitation was overestimated when the hourly precipitation intensity was greater than 2 mm h 1 however at 50 of the gauges a c d h j m n and p the precipitation was overestimated by the imerg products during a certain hour when the rainfall intensity was greater than 4 mm h 1 the occurrence and magnitude of the rainfall underestimation at the gauges around the typhoon s eye after the typhoon made landfall were significantly higher than at the gauges located farther inland two important thresholds that reflect the transition in the type of bias at a single rain gauge may be 2 mm h 1 and 4 mm h 1 this result is similar to those of other studies on the performance of imerg products during typhoon processes during typhoon lekima six gpm based near real time precipitation estimates underestimated the precipitation at higher rainfall rates 4 mm h 1 and overestimated it at lower rates 2 mm h 1 qi et al 2021 the underestimation at higher rainfall rates especially for typhoon rainfall may be an intrinsic feature among current satellite precipitation estimates yong et al 2016 which is probably associated with the weak linkage between the cloud top temperature and convective storms hamada et al 2014 4 1 3 regional scale at the regional scale the imerg products can basically present the change trend of the ground precipitation observations fig 6 the precipitation curves of the imerg er and imerg lr exhibit very similar trends for these two imerg products the overestimation primarily occurred in the early stage of the typhoon movement july 19 to 20 while the underestimation primarily occurred in the late stage of the typhoon movement july 22 to 23 both overestimation and underestimation occurred on july 21 when the total precipitation measured on the ground during a certain hour was greater than 100 mm the two imerg products always underestimated the rainfall during that hour in this study area it was found that a rainfall intensity of 100 mm h 1 may be the turning point at which imerg quasi real time products transition from overall overestimation to underestimation this finding provides further evidence that satellite precipitation estimates tend to overestimate low intensity precipitation and underestimate high intensity precipitation under low rainfall intensities the volume of the hourly precipitation recorded by the gauges only makes a very small contribution to the total regional ground precipitation during that hour however the gridded estimates overestimate the rainfall and thus in terms of the accumulated rainfall from all of the gauges the final result of the imerg products will be higher than the total ground rainfall under high rainfall intensities owing to the underestimation of the precipitation by the imerg the volume of the hourly precipitation of the imerg products only makes a very small contribution to the total regionally estimated precipitation during that hour abundant rainfall is observed over the ground gauge so the final result of the imerg products will be lower than the total ground rainfall 4 2 analysis of evaluation metrics 4 2 1 detection capability fig 7 displays three categorical metrics of each gauge under four thresholds on the entire period scale table 5 presents the pod far and csi values for the imerg er and imerg lr on the regional scale in fig 7 if the pod or csi value is 0 then the value of h is 0 if the pod or far value is 1 then the value of m or h is 0 a null value indicates that the denominator of the metric is 0 for example the null value of the csi indicates that h f and m are all equal to 0 null values occurred at many gauges when the threshold was set to 4 mm h 1 so the spatial distribution of the three metrics for this threshold is not shown for the two imerg products both the pod and far were quite high around the pearl river delta while the csi values were relatively low the csi values were higher in the southern coastal region than in the other regions in the study area the differences between the distributions of the three metrics for the imerg er and the imerg lr were very small as can be seen from table 5 as the threshold increased the pod and csi decreased while the far increased under the threshold corresponding to a very high hourly precipitation intensity 4 mm h 1 the pod and csi values of the two imerg quasi real time products were extremely low while the far values were extremely high for the thresholds 2 5 mm the imerg lr had higher pod and far values than the imerg er and the imerg er had a higher csi value than the imerg lr these results show that the typhoon detection capability of the imerg products exhibited regional characteristics in guangdong province on the daily scale fig 8 shows the three categorical metrics for each day for the two imerg products under five thresholds from july 22 to 23 the pod gradually decreased while the far significantly increased and the csi decreased july 23 corresponded to the lowest amount of rainfall in the entire study area and the pod and csi values were the lowest among the 5 days with the decline in the power of typhoon cempaka the number of rainfall events decreased and the detection performances of the imerg quasi real time products also decreased on the hourly scale fig 9 displays the trends of the three categorical metrics for the two imerg products over 24 h the pod remained stable at around 0 8 when the threshold was set at a low rainfall intensity when the threshold was 2 5 mm h 1 the pod values of the two imerg products decreased to the lowest values around 12 00 and the pod of the imerg er also decreased significantly at around 16 00 when the threshold was 4 0 mm h 1 the pod values changed sharply for the far and csi the far reached the maximum value and the csi reached the minimum value around midday under the five rainfall thresholds the csi values of the two imerg products were very close during each hour when the threshold was 4 0 mm h 1 the far values of the two imerg products were significantly different during some hours as was previously discussed it was found that during the 24 hour period analyzed the extreme values of the three categorical metrics occurred at 12 00 a similar result was also reported in a study on the diurnal variability of imerg products over china li et al 2018 according to this study severe bias of the extreme rainfall occurred between 20 00 and 22 00 beijing time or 12 00 to 14 00 utc time which was likely influenced by the less accurate cross track passive microwave sensor sources the values of the evaluation metrics fluctuated at the hourly scale indicating that the performance of the imerg varies between day and night a probable explanation for this is that the different types of precipitation clouds dominate during the day and night and remote sensors generally have discrepant detection abilities for them kummerow et al 2001 in the future diurnal cycle or sub daily corrections could be introduced into the imerg algorithm to improve this situation 4 2 2 correlation and error on the entire period scale fig 10 shows the cc rb and rmse for each gauge in the pearl river delta the gauges near the estuary of the pearl river had higher cc values while the gauges near the delta s margin had lower cc values in the 0 0 2 and 0 4 0 6 intervals the proportion of the cc for the imerg er was lower than that for the imerg lr however in the 0 2 0 4 interval the opposite situation occurred the rmses of the gauges around the typhoon s path were higher than those of the other gauges the two imerg products had a similar distribution of proportions in the rmse intervals the high positive rb values occurred around guangzhou city in the pearl river delta regarding the underestimation the imerg er had a higher proportion than the imerg lr these results indicate that the performances of the imerg products are influenced by the urban environment of the metropolises in the pearl river delta fig 11 presents the taylor diagram of the three datasets during each day and the entire period in fig 11 the correlation was lower on july 23 than on other dates while cc was around 0 4 on other dates in addition the sd and crmse values of the two products were the highest on july 23 by comparing the two imerg products it was found that the values of the three metrics from the taylor diagram for the two imerg quasi real time products were very close on july 20 and the imerg lr only had a lower sd than the imerg er on july 22 the imerg er had a better overall performance than the imerg lr on most dates during the entire period of typhoon cempaka this finding supports the viewpoint that the imerg er aims to provide information for short term applications while the imerg lr is appropriate for daily and longer applications zhang et al 2019 for studying typhoon movements the imerg er is a better choice than the imerg lr due to its shorter latency on the hourly scale fig 12 presents the trends of the three statistical metrics for the two imerg products over 24 h the cc remained at a relatively low value during the daytime and increased significantly at 18 00 the magnitude of the rb was higher during midday 10 00 to 14 00 than at other times and the rmse was the highest at 14 00 as shown in fig 9 the less inaccurate cross track passive microwave sensor sources cause significant bias from 12 00 to 14 00 utc time li et al 2018 both the cc and rb values of the imerg er and imerg lr were different at 1 00 3 00 5 00 16 00 17 00 and 20 00 while their rmse values were different at 5 00 10 00 11 00 13 00 and 17 00 4 3 evaluation of imerg products on typhoon presenting capability fig 13 shows the distribution of the btd and the proportion of overestimation according to the magnitude and number of events the distribution of the btd was the same as that of the sign of the rb value btd 1 overestimation mainly occurred in the pearl river delta the proportion of overestimated events was greater than 50 for all of the gauges but the magnitude of the underestimation was dominant greater than 50 at some gauges this suggests that a relatively small number of underestimated events corresponded to a relatively large number of magnitudes the imerg tended to underestimate rainfall more seriously at these gauges causing the btd to be 1 it was also found that the proportion of overestimation according to the magnitude was greater than 50 in the pearl river delta and the area around zhanjiang city however the proportion of overestimation according to the event number was significantly higher in the pearl river delta greater than90 than in the region around zhanjiang city there were more underestimated events around zhanjiang city these results further reveal the existence of the positive and negative offset phenomenon proposed in this paper according to fig 13 the rb values of all of the gauge stations were not zero during the entire typhoon movement period thus in this study all of the tpcs were in the significant zone with values ranging from 2 to 1 or from 1 to 2 the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the tpc for different critical values are presented in fig 14 the tpc distribution when pc ritical is equal to 5 or 10 mm is relatively uniform while the tpc distribution when pc ritical is equal to 1 or 58 mm is concentrated in a very narrow interval which is not conducive to better analysis of the typhoon presenting capability this paper only presents the results of the tpc when pc ritical is 5 or 10 mm when the typhoon s eye was close to the coastline and then made landfall in the southwest coastal area of guangdong from july 19 to july 20 the gauges with lower pci values were primarily located in the pearl river delta and the coastal area of guangdong fig 15 1 and 2 on july 21 the pci values at most of the gauges in both guangdong and guangxi decreased fig 15 3 however some of the gauges in western guangdong still had relatively low pci values on july 22 when the typhoon eye was in guangxi fig 15 4 on july 23 the typhoon moved into the beibu gulf and thus its influence over china weakened null values of the pci occurred at most of the gauges in the pearl river delta except for the gauges located in the estuary of the pearl river fig 15 5 during the entire period the high pci values tended to occur at the inland gauges while the low pci values tended to occur along the coastline of guangdong with the south china sea by comparing the two imerg products it was found that the pci of the imerg lr was higher than that of the imerg er at many of the gauges however the types of bias of the two imerg products were also opposite at some of the gauges at some of the gauges the btd of the imerg er was 1 i e underestimation while the btd of the imerg lr was 1 i e overestimation in fig 15 6 tpc values of 1 btd 1 occurred at the gauges in the pearl river delta and the region around zhanjiang city in guangdong while tpc values of 1 btd 1 occurred at the gauges in western guangdong in guangxi the distribution of the tpc values of 1 and 1 was not very regular the above results show that relatively low positive tpc values in red and orange occurred in the region around zhanjiang city and in guangzhou city however in fig 10 the positive rb values at the gauges around zhanjiang city were relatively low 0 rb 1 and the positive rb values at the gauges around guangzhou city were significantly higher rb 2 than those at other locations the differences between the values of the two indicators used for bias evaluation in these two regions were closely related to the fact that the positive and negative offset phenomenon is considered in the calculation of the tpc but not in the calculation of the rb 5 discussion 5 1 error after adopting the interpolation method an inherent defect of spatial interpolation is that in areas where there are no ground observations the data are obtained according to a given mathematical rule precipitation is a variable with very high temporal and spatial variability it is difficult to represent the real situation using the same set of interpolating algorithms to present the precipitation field in different regions however the implementation of high density ground stations is also difficult the interpolation method still needs to be adopted but the obvious problems with the interpolation results also need to be discussed fig 4 1 shows that in the western part of the study area there was a prominent bulls eye effect which was primarily caused by interpolation of the ground data if only one point in a point network corresponds to an extreme value the interpolation results will contain concentric circles centered on the extreme value point the spatial distribution of the precipitation estimated using the two imerg products demonstrates that an effective rainfall event did occur in the region around the bulls eye and the value of the rain gauge was significantly higher than that of the imerg precipitation estimates locally strong convective rainfall with a short duration at this rain gauge may be the reason why the center of the bulls eye corresponds to such a high daily rainfall and the interpolation amplified this phenomenon showing the error of the ground rainfall distribution and the obvious difference from the real situation 5 2 regional characteristics of the spatial distribution for metrics as can be seen from figs 7 and 10 the gauges in the pearl river delta corresponded to the relatively high far values positive rb values and the low csi values in addition on july 23 fig 15 5 the pci around the marginal area of the pearl river delta was zero while the pci had a non zero value around guangzhou city which is the core area of the pearl river delta based on the premise that the typhoon s eye was located far away from the pearl river delta rainfall was only recorded in the core area of the pearl river delta guangzhou metropolis the central pearl river delta the largest urban agglomeration in china with many metropolises and a dense population experienced strong spatiotemporal variations and more precipitation than the surrounding areas wang et al 2018 previous study reported that the imerg overestimates the precipitation over the central pearl river delta the urban environment on the positive side can generate short duration heavy precipitation and causes an uneven spatial rainfall distribution over the pearl river delta wang et al 2019a typhoon movements always bring heavy rainfall with a high intensity when coupled with the conditions of the urban environment the imerg products currently do have powerful capabilities in this area 5 3 comparison of tpc and rb figs 10 and 15 show that the magnitudes of the tpc values were very similar in the area around zhanjiang city and in the pearl river delta but there was an obvious discrepancy in the rb values indicating that the positive and negative offset phenomenon which was identified based on the results presented in fig 13 occurred for the gauges around zhanjiang city this finding illustrates the importance of the tpc in optimizing the error evaluation method during the typhoon process based on the results of the rb calculations the imerg quasi real time products performed poorly in the pearl river delta however based on the tpc calculations both the regions surrounding guangzhou and zhanjiang city corresponded to relatively weak typhoon presentation capabilities the introduction of the tpc effectively avoids the real situation of deviation being ignored due to the positive and negative offset phenomenon in the calculation of the rb and it also retains the type of bias which can be identified from the sign of the rb regarding the performance evaluation of the data for typhoon cempaka there was no instance when the tpc plotted within the fuzzy zone although on the hourly scale the value of the gauge data was equal to that of the imerg estimate the difference is 0 during 28 rainfall events it is difficult to conclude that the magnitude of the overestimation is equal to that of the underestimation at a large temporal scale in addition it is also currently difficult to completely eliminate the error between the gridded estimates and the ground data during the entire research period thus the fuzzy zone and the significant zone are only a theoretical division and the tpc value should be in the significant zone in most actual cases with the accuracy improvement of spps it is still possible to discuss the situation of the tpc in the fuzzy area in the future 6 conclusions using hourly ground measurements from 85 gauges in 2 provinces in southern coastal china in this study a new bias evaluation methodology the typhoon presenting capability tpc was developed then the tpc was used to evaluate the performances of two imerg quasi real time products during typhoon cempaka from july 19 to 23 2021 first the spatiotemporal characteristics of the precipitation at the grid and regional scales were analyzed during each day and the entire research period then several statistical and categorical metrics were calculated to analyze the rainfall detection correlation and error situation of the imerg products finally the tpc as well as the pci and btd was analyzed and the tpc and rb were compared the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 in terms of precipitation characteristics the imerg quasi real time products can capture the spatial distribution of and temporal variations in the ground rainfall caused by typhoon cempaka but underestimation of the precipitation easily occurred for rainfall intensities of greater than 2 mm h 1 and overestimation occurred for lower rainfall intensities 2 based on the calculation results of evaluation metrics the far and rb of the gauges were higher in the pearl river delta than in other regions 3 on july 19 and 20 the lower pci values were concentrated in the pearl river delta and the coastal area of guangdong the pci values around the marginal pearl river delta were zero while the pci values around the central pearl river delta were non zero on july 23 throughout the entire study period the btd values were 1 at the gauges in western guangdong the positive tpc values were primarily distributed in the region around zhanjiang city on the eastern coast of the leizhou peninsula and in guangzhou city in the central pearl river delta 4 by comparing the differences between the tpc and rb it was found that the tpc values around zhanjiang city were similar to those around guangzhou city but the positive rb around the former were significantly lower than those around the latter the rb values calculated for the gauges around zhanjiang city did not reflect the actual bias situation due to the positive and negative offset but the actual bias was reflected by the calculated tpc values the tpc makes up for the shortcomings of the rb while retaining

1928,rainfall erosivity is a key factor that influences soil erosion by water rain gauge measurements are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity however long term gauge records with sub hourly resolutions are lacking in large parts of the world satellite observations provide spatially continuous estimates of rainfall but they are subject to biases that affect estimates of rainfall erosivity

retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg and mean annual rainfall erosivity from the global rainfall erosivity database gloreda stations n 3286 we used a residual based merging scheme to integrate gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity with gloreda using geographically weighted regression gwr the accuracy of the gwr based merging scheme was evaluated with a 10 fold cross validation against gloreda stations based on gpm imerg only the global mean annual rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 1173 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with a standard deviation of 1736 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the mean value estimated via gpm imerg merged with gloreda was 2020 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with a standard deviation of 3415 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 overall gpm imerg only estimates underestimated rainfall erosivity

haregeweyn et al 2023 recent predictions have shown that soil erosion by water may increase globally because of climate change by 30 66 between 2015 and 2070 borrelli et al 2020 rainfall erosivity is among the important drivers of soil erosion because it influences the detachment breakdown and transport of soil particles soil erosion models such as the universal soil loss equation wischmeier and

extreme rainfall events are typically rare events of short duration the reliability of rainfall erosivity estimations declines as the temporal resolution decreases panagos et al 2016 yue et al 2020 traditionally rain gauges provide a direct and the most reliable measure of rainfall however conventional gauge measurements with sub hourly resolutions are rarely available especially in developing countries panagos et al 2017 meira et al 2022 moreover conventional rain gauges provide point scale measurements and thus can only represent a geographically limited area of observation because rainfall erosivity can have large spatial variability the use of point scale data to represent areal rainfall erosivity can result in the loss of some spatial variability past research that relied on gauge measurements applied spatial interpolation of point data to estimate rainfall erosivity in ungauged areas e g bonilla and vidal 2011 meusburger et al 2012 panagos et al 2015a 2017 ballabio et al 2017 however the interpolated rainfall erosivity values can have a large degree of uncertainty especially in areas where rain gauges are sparsely located angulo martínez et al 2009 besides rainfall

developments have offered satellite based rainfall estimates with both high temporal and spatial resolutions e g sun et al 2018 huffman et al 2019 in addition satellite based rainfall estimates have near global coverage relatively long term data and are available free of charge at short latency due to these advantages satellite based rainfall estimates have become promising alternatives especially in areas where analysis of rainfall erosivity is compromised by the limited availability of gauge measurements such as in africa south america and asia in recent years significant efforts have been underway to model rainfall erosivity based on satellite rainfall datasets at national e g kim et al 2020 chen et al 2021 das et al 2022 regional fenta et al 2017 2020a haregeweyn et al 2017

vrieling et al 2010 diodato et al 2013 haregeweyn et al 2017 chen et al 2021 but some have used 30 min rainfall data from the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph kim et al 2020 bezak

influence the accuracy of rainfall erosivity estimates merging satellite based estimates with gauge data can help leverage their complementary strengths the accuracy of gauge measurements and spatial

merging rainfall that fall into two categories global and local global merging schemes use a smoothing function without considering the spatial differences in relationships between rainfall data sources e g probability density function xie et al 2017 linear weighted combination woldemeskel et al 2013 mean bias correction lekula et al 2018 however relationships can vary significantly over

gwr based merging scheme to effectively enhance the quality of rainfall data e g hu et al 2015 chao et al 2018 gebremedhin et al 2021 the goal of this study was to advance the modeling of global rainfall erosivity by integrating satellite based erosivity estimates with gauge data to this end we employed a first approach to analyze global rainfall erosivity based on the new generation gpm imerg long term 2001 2020 rainfall data at a temporal resolution of 30 min and spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 we then improved the gpm imerg based global rainfall erosivity estimates by merging with global rainfall erosivity database gloreda station data panagos et al 2017 through a residual based merging scheme using gwr the specific objectives were to i develop a new global rainfall erosivity map based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda ii evaluate the performance of the gwr based merging method based on the gloreda data and iii identify areas prone to soil erosion by water through a coupled mapping of erosivity density ed and mean annual rainfall the findings of this study can enhance our understanding of the global patterns of rainfall erosivity and contribute to improving soil erosion modeling 2 data sources and methods 2 1 gpm imerg recent advances in the accessibility of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite rainfall data have enabled global scale hydrological investigations in particular the global precipitation measurement gpm mission has set the standard for a new generation of satellite based global rainfall estimates gpm is jointly developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa hou et al 2014 building upon the success of trmm launched in november 1997 the gpm placed in orbit in february 2014 mission is designed to unify and advance rainfall estimates from a constellation of satellites the trmm satellite and gpm serve as reference standards for combining all the passive microwave pmw and geosynchronous infrared ir based rainfall estimates in their respective eras three noteworthy advancements of the gpm over trmm have been i an increase of the orbital inclination angle from 35 to 65 to enable coverage of additional climate zones ii inclusion of the first space borne dual frequency precipitation radar with ku band 13 6 ghz and ka band 35 5 ghz and iii inclusion of high frequency channels 165 5 and 183 3 ghz in the gpm microwave imager that fundamentally improve its rainfall retrieval skills the new level 3 products of gpm imerg have been published with three latencies gpm imerg early 4 h latency gpm imerg late 14 h latency and gpm imerg final 3 5 months latency huffman et al 2019 the gpm imerg early and late rainfall data are climatologically gauge calibrated the global precipitation climatology center gpcc monthly gauge data are used to bias correct the gpm imerg final data the gpm imerg data reprocessed from the trmm gpm constellation dating back to mid 2000 are available at 30 min daily and monthly temporal resolutions and 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution huffman et al 2019 in this study we used the latest version v06 gpm imerg final 30 min estimates of rainfall rates mm h 1 from 1 january 2001 to 31 december 2020 the data were downloaded from the gpm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm over the fully global domain 90 n s details of the gpm imerg algorithm and product description have been provided by hou et al 2014 and huffman et al 2019 2 2 gloreda gloreda was developed using high temporal resolution station data to provide the first map of global rainfall erosivity panagos et al 2017 gloreda is the outcome of a thorough effort to collect high temporal resolution 1 min to 60 min rainfall data from all possible countries across different climatic and geographic regions the number of years of data ranged from 5 to 52 and most of the data covered the years 2000 to 2010 panagos et al 2017 the number of gloreda stations varied greatly among continents europe with 48 of the total dataset made the largest contribution followed by asia and the middle east 34 of the total dataset south america and africa had the lowest number of gloreda stations 5 of the total dataset the gloreda data for north america and the caribbean were collected from 146 stations the majority of which were in the united states there were marked differences in the geographical distribution of gloreda stations across continents stations in europe north america and oceania were relatively well distributed geographically but those in africa and south america were clustered overall the gloreda stations were well distributed over different levels of rainfall erosivity panagos et al 2017 panagos et al 2017 have developed a global map of rainfall erosivity at 0 01 0 01 resolution based on gloreda and gaussian process regression this study used annual rainfall erosivity data from both the gloreda stations as well as the global map of rainfall erosivity we used 3286 gloreda stations that fell within the 0 1 0 1 grid cells of gpm imerg data for the global land areas the gloreda station data and the global rainfall erosivity map were accessed on request from the european soil data centre a data repository of the european commission joint research centre https esdac jrc ec europa eu 2 3 chelsa climatologies at high resolution for the earth s land surface areas chelsa is a global climate dataset of mean monthly and annual temperature and rainfall karger et al 2017 the bias corrected climatic reanalysis interim era interim global circulation model https www ecmwf int en research climate reanalysis era interim was used to generate chelsa at 0 01 0 01 resolution through a quasi mechanistic statistical downscaling the bias correction method for the rainfall time series against gpcc https www dwd de en ourservices gpcc gpcc html and global historical climate network https www ncdc noaa gov ghcnm integrates the influence of orographic predictors such as valley exposition wind fields and boundary layer height karger et al 2017 the original quasi mechanistic statistical downscaling method has been improved in the current version chelsa 1 2 to produce more accurate estimations of rainfall and temperature improvements in the current version include the computation of annual rainfall for the climatologies and the bias correction which incorporates gpcc data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 compared to rainfall data from other datasets e g worldclim chelsa s rainfall estimations are more accurate karger et al 2017 we used mean annual rainfall data 1979 2013 downloaded from the chelsa website https chelsa climate org karger et al 2017 karger et al 2018 2 4 calculation of rainfall erosivity rainfall erosivity is the erosive power of rainfall to cause soil erosion which accounts for the combined effects of the rainfall intensity duration and magnitude wischmeier and smith 1978 the mean annual rainfall erosivity for each 0 1 0 1 grid cell of 30 min gpm imerg data mm h 1 was computed as the product of the kinetic energy of a rainfall event and its maximum 30 min intensity i30 brown and foster 1987 1 r 1 n i 1 n j 1 k e i 30 j where r is the mean annual rainfall erosivity mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 n is the number of years of gpm imerg data k is the number of erosive events in year i and ei30 is the rainfall erosivity of event j the event rainfall erosivity index ei30 mj mm ha 1 h 1 is defined as follows 2 ei 30 r 1 m e r v r j i 30 j where er is the specific kinetic energy of rainfall mj ha 1 mm 1 vr is the rainfall volume mm of a rainfall event for the rth period having m parts and i30 is the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity mmh 1 of the rainfall event j the specific kinetic energy of rainfall er was computed based on a rainfall intensity energy equation proposed by brown and foster 1987 because panagos et al 2017 also applied this equation to develop gloreda 3 e r 0 29 1 0 72 e x p 0 05 i r where ir is the rainfall intensity mm hr 1 for the rth period identification of erosive events j is necessary to compute rainfall erosivity for each gpm imerg grid cell renard et al 1997 proposed three criteria for identifying an erosive event i an event has at least 12 7 mm of cumulative rainfall or ii an event has at least one peak that is 12 7 mm or larger for a 30 min period within the event and iii an event with less than 12 7 mm of rainfall in a 6 h period is applied to divide a longer rainfall event into two events the assumption used to determine the threshold value of 12 7 mm was that events with less than 12 7 mm of rainfall would not significantly affect the annual rainfall erosivity this assumption was corroborated by lu and yu 2002 who have shown that using a threshold of 0 mm instead of 12 7 mm resulted in an increase of the rainfall erosivity by only 3 5 the erosive event criteria and the rainfall erosivity equations were formulated based on over 10 000 plot years of data brown and foster 1987 renard et al 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 2 5 merging gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with gloreda the residual based merging approach applied in this study followed a two source i e satellite and gauge rainfall merging scheme hu et al 2015 the background field was the gpm imerg based estimations of mean annual rainfall erosivity the residual field was calculated using residuals while taking the effects of the predictor variables into consideration the residual was computed as the difference between the mean annual rainfall erosivity estimates of the gpm imerg and gloreda stations the merged rainfall erosivity rf was a function of the erosivity estimates from the gpm imerg rs and the gloreda data rg 4 r f r s f r g r s the function f rg rs represents the residual to be corrected in the gpm imerg rainfall erosivity estimates solved through mathematical methods following the work of hu et al 2015 the gwr brunsdon et al 1996 was used to estimate the residual field f rg rs as 5 f r g r s i β i 0 k 1 n β ik x ik ε i where f r g r s i is the residual at grid cell i βi0 is the constant regression coefficient intercept n is the number of predictor variables xik is thekth explanatory variable at grid celli βik is the correspondingkth regression coefficient at grid celli andε i is the random error at grid cell i eq 5 describes the non stationary relationship between the residual field and predictor variables and can be written using matrix multiplication as follows 6 y x β ε where is the symbol for matrix multiplication ε is the error vector and x and β are the two matrices for the predictor variables and local regression coefficients respectively the local regression coefficients at grid celliwere estimated using a weighted least squares approach brunsdon et al 1996 as follows 7 β i x t w i x 1 x t w i y where β i is an n 1 vector of theregression coefficient at grid cell i xt is the transpose of x and wi is the spatial weight matrix computed using weighting functions based on the proximities of grid cellito its m neighboring gauges for observation at grid cell i the β i based estimates were computed as follows 8 y i x i x t w i x 1 x t w i y theneighborhood parameter was set based on the distance band the optimal bandwidth was determined automatically by the akaike information criterion fotheringham et al 2003 gwr applies a geographical weighting to the observations used in each of the local regression equations gwr assumes that observations that are closer to the regression point have more weight in the regression equation than observations farther away the weights were determined using a kernel which used a distance decay function for the spatial weight matrix the adaptive kernel was used because the distribution of gloreda stations varied spatially fig 1 we used agaussianweighting scheme because it avoids local collinearity a well known problem in gwr the weight using the gaussian kernel distance decay function was computed as follows 9 w ij e x p 1 2 d ij b 2 where wij is the weight of observation j for observation i dij is the distance between observation i and j and b is the bandwidth distance the local regression coefficients for each grid cell of the gpm imerg were estimated based on eq 7 substituting these coefficients into eq 5 resulted in the residual field at each grid cell of the gpm imerg finally the residual based merged mean annual rainfall erosivity was produced based on eq 4 we used the mean annual rainfall 1979 2013 from the chelsa database as an independent predictor variable to estimate the residual field the chelsa database has other potential predictor variables e g average minimum and maximum monthly rainfall rainfall during the wettest and driest month rainfall during the wettest and driest quarter but those variables were strongly correlated with the mean annual rainfall elevation was not included as a predictor variable because it was already used in chelsa to correct the orographic effects karger et al 2017 for the gpm imerg and chelsa data a projected coordinate system with a resolution of 10 10 km was used to enhance the computational efficiency of gwr the standardized residual of the gwr model fig s1 showed that the analysis was not much affected by outliers in the gloreda the performance of the residual based merging scheme was evaluated against gloreda station data panagos et al 2017 using k fold cross validation k 10 this approach involved randomly splitting the gloreda data into k 10 mutually exclusive folds of approximately equal size subsequently k 10 iterations of training and validation were performed during each iteration one of the k folds was treated as a validation set while the model was fitted on the remaining k 1 folds the cross validation estimate of accuracy was the average of all the iterations the random sampling was stratified by continent to ensure that each fold had the same proportion of gloreda stations across continents to avoid sampling of multiple gloreda stations per pixel of gpm imerg the distance between the sampling points was set to be 10 km the accuracy of the merging scheme was evaluated based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse the nse showed how well the plot of the gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity versus gloreda station data fit the 1 1 line whereas the pbias and rmse were metrics of the mean residual and spread of the residual respectively moriasi et al 2007 in addition we compared the gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with the gloreda interpolated data panagos et al 2017 at continental koppen geiger climate zone beck et al 2018 and river basin lehner and grill 2013 scales the gloreda interpolated data were projected and aggregated by mean value to 10 10 km to conform to the spatial resolution of the gpm imerg data comparisons at global continental climate zone and river basin scales were made using the projected and aggregated gloreda interpolated data fig 1 illustrates the main steps used to merge rainfall erosivity estimates from gpm imerg with gloreda station data 2 6 calculation of erosivity density the amount of rainfall and its erosivity vary over space and time relatively long term rainfall data are required for an accurate assessment of rainfall erosivity to cope with a lack of long term data foster et al 2008 have proposed the concept of erosivity density ed a function of rainfall erosivity and rainfall depth as a more stable erosivity index the ed strongly depends on rainfall intensity and the number of erosive events foster et al 2008 high ed values indicate the occurrence of intense rainstorms over an area foster et al 2008 kinnell 2010 the prevalence of potentially high runoff shown by regions with very high ed values suggests that these regions are more prone to floods dabney et al 2011 the ed shows the rainfall erosivity per unit of rainfall and is expressed as follows foster et al 2008 kinnell 2010 10 ed r p where ed is the erosivity density mj ha 1 h 1 r is the mean annual rainfall erosivity mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda and p is the mean annual rainfall mm yr 1 from chelsa to identify erosion prone areas we used a coupled mapping of ed and mean annual rainfall panagos et al 2015b datasets of ed and mean annual rainfall were classified into five categories using quantile classification for both ed and mean annual rainfall the five quantiles represented very low q1 low q2 moderate q3 high q4 and very high q5 classes we combined these five categories of ed and mean annual rainfall into 25 new categories the overall susceptibility to soil erosion was then mapped using the 25 categories the most susceptible areas were those with very high ed values and very low mean annual rainfall as well as areas with very high ed values and very high mean annual rainfall panagos et al 2015b areas with very low to low ed could be considered less erosion prone despite having high mean annual rainfall rainfall erosivity and ed statistics presented in section 3 were extracted from maps with a resolution of 10 10 km 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of global rainfall erosivity based on gpm imerg only fig 2 a the global mean annual rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 1173 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with a standard deviation sd of 1736 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 2 b the global mean annual rainfall erosivity was 2020 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 3415 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the fact that the global mean annual rainfall erosivity from gpm imerg merged with gloreda was 1 7 times the gpm imerg only estimate implied that the rainfall erosivity estimated by only satellites was a marked underestimate a ratio map of gpm imerg merged with gloreda to gpm imerg only fig s2 revealed substantial underestimation of the mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only over large parts of the globe except for europe and northern africa compared to gpm imerg merged with gloreda gpm imerg only slightly overestimated the mean annual rainfall erosivity over large swaths of europe fig s2 consistent with our results the gloreda based mean annual rainfall erosivity estimates panagos et al 2017 were 1 65 times for the united states kim et al 2020 and 1 8 times globally bezak et al 2022 the cmorph based erosivity estimates over europe i e without russia cmorph overestimated the mean annual rainfall erosivity compared to gloreda interpolated bezak et al 2022 based on the quantile map of rainfall erosivity derived from gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 2 b the 50th percentile median of the global rainfall erosivity was 1050 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 whereas the 20th percentile 20 of the erosivity values was lower than 200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the 80th percentile the highest 20 of the erosivity values was higher than 5500 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 overall the spatial distribution of global rainfall erosivity was highly variable very high rainfall erosivity was estimated for south america southeast asia central and western africa central america and the caribbean very low rainfall erosivity was found predominantly in northern africa the middle east central asia and northern europe fig 2 the global rainfall erosivity spatial patterns fig 2 agreed well with previous studies e g panagos et al 2017 bezak et al 2022 that have reported very high rainfall erosivity in south america southeast asia central africa and the caribbean countries visual comparison of the spatial distribution of global rainfall erosivity fig 2 with regional scale erosivity maps reported for africa e g diodato et al 2013 vrieling et al 2010 eastern africa fenta et al 2017 the united states kim et al 2020 and india das et al 2022 revealed a high degree of agreement consistent with our results fig 2 high rainfall erosivity 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 has been reported over central and western africa and the ethiopian highlands diodato et al 2013 vrieling et al 2010 fenta et al 2017 as well as western india das et al 2022 the spatial distribution of very high rainfall erosivity fig 2 corresponds well with the spatial distribution of high intensity rainfall events reported by zipser et al 2006 who have found that extreme rainfall events are more frequent over central south america the caribbean central and western africa and southeast asia 3 2 evaluation of gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates the gpm imerg based global rainfall erosivity estimates of this study were evaluated through i a point to pixel comparison using the mean annual rainfall erosivity values of the gloreda stations panagos et al 2017 and ii a cross scale global continental climate zone and river basin scale comparison with the mean annual rainfall erosivity map produced based on interpolation of the gloreda station data panagos et al 2017 3 2 1 evaluation using gloreda station data merging rainfall erosivity estimates from gpm imerg with gloreda using gwr substantially improved the accuracy of global rainfall erosivity estimates the improvement was evidenced by the higher nse 0 83 lower pbias 2 4 and lower rmse 1122 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 compared with the gpm imerg only rainfall erosivity estimates nse 0 51 pbias 27 8 and rmse 1730 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 we investigated the performance of gwr based merging scheme under different rain gauge density the accuracy of rainfall erosivity estimates from gpm imerg merged with gloreda generally improved in regions with relatively high density of gloreda stations europe north america asia and oceania nse 0 81 pbias 1 9 and rmse 1030 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in regions where the density of gloreda stations was sparse africa and south america the accuracy of gwr based merging scheme decreased nse 0 81 pbias 6 4 and rmse 1769 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 we found that gpm imerg only underestimated mean annual rainfall erosivity the underestimation was more severe in the highland stations elevation 1500 m fig s3 we also observed that the underestimation of rainfall erosivity by the gpm imerg only tended to increase with increasing rainfall erosivity fig s4 the greatest underestimations were apparent at stations where annual rainfall erosivity values exceeded 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the gpm imerg only estimates overestimated mean annual rainfall erosivity at stations with erosivity values less than 1000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig s4 it is worth noting that the gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda considerably reduced the rainfall erosivity bias from the gpm imerg only estimates fig s4 comparison of mean annual rainfall from gloreda stations with gpm imerg showed that gpm imerg underestimated rainfall fig s5 a the underestimation was greater at the highland stations fig s5 b several studies have evaluated the performance of the gpm imerg rainfall estimates at local regional e g manz et al 2017 navarro et al 2019 palomino ángel et al 2019 shawky et al 2019 yang et al 2020 and global derin et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 wang and yong 2020 scales on the one hand gpm imerg overestimated low rainfall intensity events derin et al 2019 palomino ángel et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 shawky et al 2019 wang and yong 2020 pmw algorithms have limitations to properly differentiate between raining clouds and surfaces that produce a microwave signature like that of rainfall wang et al 2009 sand and snow surfaces could therefore be confused with rainfall signatures which are specific to pmw algorithms e g wang et al 2009 this could result in overestimation of rainfall by gpm imerg the other possibility is that the rainfall detected aloft by the satellite may evaporate before reaching the ground especially in dry areas dinku et al 2011 pradhan et al 2022 yang et al 2020 leading to overestimation of rainfall overestimation of rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only in areas of relatively low erosivity values less than1000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig s4 is likely caused by overestimation of low rainfall intensity events on the other hand gpm imerg based rainfall estimates underestimated high rainfall intensity events derin et al 2019 navarro et al 2019 palomino ángel et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 shawky et al 2019 the underestimation of high rainfall events was worse for highland regions than for lowlands pradhan et al 2022 the underestimation of high rainfall events by the gpm imerg was likely attributable to i underestimation of high intensity rainfall because rainfall is averaged over a pixel area and such rainfall eventsare commonly observed over spatial domains smaller than the pixel size of the gpm imerg manz et al 2017 ii gpm imerg may not accurately estimate rainfall from warm rain processes especially in mountainous areas because the tendency of the cloud top temperature to be warmer than the rainfall detection thresholds leads to underestimation of rainfall derin et al 2019 navarro et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 and iii rainfall underestimation may be caused by the low sampling frequency of the satellite which causes gpm imerg based rainfall estimates to miss short duration high intensity rainfall events pradhan et al 2022 the marked underestimation of rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only especially in regions of relatively high erosivity values 2000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig s4 is likely the result of underestimation of high rainfall intensity events 3 2 2 comparison with gloreda interpolated data comparison at global scale fig 3 shows comparison at the global scale taking ratio of rainfall erosivity estimates of gpm imerg merged with gloreda to gloreda interpolated panagos et al 2017 relatively better agreement between the two rainfall erosivity estimates was observed mainly in high rainfall erosivity areas including southeastern north america central africa central south america southern asia and sizable parts of australia figs 3 s6 regions of better agreement between rainfall erosivity estimates of gpm imerg merged with gloreda and gloreda interpolated covered ca 25 of the global land area figs 3 s6 in these regions the mean rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 2935 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 3250 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 by both gpm imerg merged with gloreda and gloreda interpolated rainfall erosivity estimated by gpm imerg merged with gloreda was higher than gloreda interpolated for ca 42 of the global land area figs 3 s6 these areas include large parts of north america northern and southern parts of south america the sahel in africa central asia eastern russia southeastern asia and southern australia figs 3 s6 in areas where erosivity estimates by gpm imerg merged with gloreda were higher figs 3 s6 the mean rainfall erosivity estimated by gpm imerg merged with gloreda was 2530 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 4160 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 whereas the one estimated by gloreda interpolated was 1370 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 2270 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 regions where gloreda interpolated rainfall erosivity estimates were higher than gpm imerg merged with gloreda were found mainly in low rainfall erosivity areas of northern and southern africa middle east northern europe northwestern china and large parts of mongolia figs 3 s6 these regions cover ca 33 of the global land area figs 4 s6 the mean rainfall erosivity estimated for these regions was 1190 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 2280 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 by gloreda interpolated and 670 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 1560 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 by gpm imerg merged with gloreda comparison at continental scale at the continental scale gpm imerg only substantially underestimated the mean annual rainfall erosivity fig 4 whereas rainfall erosivity estimated based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda agreed better with the erosivity estimates of panagos et al 2017 this better agreement demonstrated the improvement in rainfall erosivity estimates that resulted from the gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda the largest differences were observed for africa gpm imerg only and south america gpm imerg only and gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 4 relatively better agreement between the gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated map was found for europe and to some extent for north america and asia fig 4 where the networks of stations were relatively dense the difference between the gpm imerg only and gloreda was partly attributable to the density of stations used by gloreda panagos et al 2017 and partly to the rainfall underestimation by gpm imerg as discussed in section 3 2 1 in line with our results fig 4 bezak et al 2022 and kim et al 2020 have reported large differences between satellite based rainfall erosivity estimates and gloreda estimates based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 4 south america experienced the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity of 6521 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and high spatial variability sd 4569 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 this high erosivity was followed by africa 3214 sd 3993 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 asia 2272 sd 4137 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 oceania 1941 sd 2720 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and north america 1794 sd 2019 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the mean annual rainfall erosivity for europe was the lowest among the continents 325 sd 492 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the 80th percentiles highest 20 of the mean annual rainfall erosivities were 9200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the northern part of south america 7800 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in central and western africa 5300 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in southeast asia and 3200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the northern part of oceania and southwestern north america fig s7 comparison by climate zones comparison at the climate zone level fig 5 revealed relatively large underestimation of mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only in tropical and temperate climates where erosivity is high over large areas fig s8 in climate zones with low rainfall erosivity arid cold and polar the differences between gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated panagos et al 2017 mean annual rainfall erosivity were found to be smaller fig 5 the gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda substantially reduced the differences between gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated rainfall erosivity estimates fig 5 climate zone level estimates of mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 5 showed that regions with tropical climate experience the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity of 8625 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 4709 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by regions with temperate climates 4248 sd 3079 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 this pattern is likely attributable to the occurrence of frequent intense rainfall events especially in tropical regions zipser et al 2006 previous global regional scale studies e g bezak et al 2022 kim et al 2020 panagos et al 2017 das et al 2022 have also reported high rainfall erosivity for regions with tropical and temperate climates the lowest rainfall erosivity as expected was estimated for arid climate 726 sd 998 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by cold climate 796 sd 987 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and polar climate 1189 sd 1609 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 zones quantile maps fig s8 showed that the 80th percentile highest 20 of the mean annual rainfall erosivity values exceeded 11 800 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in equatorial tropical regions 6300 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in temperate climates 1400 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in arid climates and 1000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in cold climates comparison at river basin scale figure s9 a compares mean annual rainfall erosivity estimates for 244 river basins extracted from the hydrosheds third level global catchment boundaries fig s9 b lehner and grill 2013 a comparison between gpm imerg only and gloreda fig s9 a revealed that gpm imerg only markedly underestimated

gpm imerg only fig s9 a for rainfall erosivity values above 11 000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the fact that gpm imerg merged with gloreda estimates exceeded gloreda interpolated estimates panagos et al 2017 fig s9 a was likely attributable to the effect of interpolation which tends to smooth the extreme values hofstra et al 2010 figure s9 a indicates that the uncertainty increases for river basins with high rainfall erosivity values further comparison of the rainfall erosivity estimates was made for 10 major river basins figs 6 s10 selected on the basis of their susceptibility to soil erosion yang et al 2003 fig 6 shows a large underestimation of mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only in river basins where rainfall erosivity is relatively high e g amazon congo mekong the mean annual rainfall erosivity difference between the gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated estimates was smaller in river basins characterized by relatively low rainfall erosivity e g amur huang he fig 6 the considerable improvement of rainfall erosivity estimates for all the major river basins by integration of the gpm imerg with gloreda was evidenced by the reduced discrepancy between the gpm imerg merged with gloreda and gloreda interpolated estimates fig 6 based on the gpm imerg merged with the gloreda fig 6 the amazon experienced the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity 9736 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and sd of 4155 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by the congo 8192 sd 1878 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and mekong 6416 sd 4219 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the lowest mean annual rainfall erosivity was estimated for huang he 707 sd 564 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by the amur 765 sd 310 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the quantile maps fig s11 showed that the 80th percentiles highest 20 of the mean annual rainfall erosivity were 12 900 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the northwestern amazon 9900 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the central congo and southwestern mekong 5200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in southern and western nile and central and western ganges and 4500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in southwestern mississippi and yangtze fig s12 shows that although the amazon congo and mekong basins are subject to high rainfall erosivity they are experiencing relatively low rates of soil loss likely due to better vegetation forest cover in high erosivity areas borrelli et al 2017 moderately high rainfall erosivity fig s12 resulted in relatively high rates of soil loss in the ganges indus nile and yangtze basins likely because of the presence of mountainous areas and intensively cultivated croplands in the high population regions of these basins yang et al 2003 borrelli et al 2017 fenta et al 2020b 2021 elnashar et al 2021 it is worth noting that rainfall erosivity indicates spatial differences in the erosive power of rainfall but does not necessarily indicate where soil erosion occurs soil erosion modeling thus integrates rainfall erosivity with other soil erosion factors such as soil topography land cover and management practices wischmeier and smith 1978 renard et al 1997 3 3 erosivity density the global mean of the ed was 1 9 mj ha 1 h 1 with an sd of 2 mj ha 1 h 1 an ed that exceeded 1 mj ha 1 h 1 indicated that the rainfall in the area was characterized by intense rainstorms of short duration whereas an ed of less than 1 mj ha 1 h 1 indicated the prevalence of low rainfall intensity events in the area fig 7 a foster et al 2008 have demonstrated that ed values are directly related to the 30 min maximum rainfall intensity dabney et al 2011 have predicted higher runoff and flood risk for areas with ed values that exceed 3 mj ha 1 h 1 large parts of south america central and western africa madagascar northern australia southeastern asia the southwestern us and the caribbean are characterized by high ed erosivity values in those areas are more than three times the mean annual rainfall fig 7 a in contrast the relatively low ed over large parts of europe northern parts of north america northern and southern parts of africa the middle east and southern australia fig 7 a indicated the prevalence of low rainfall intensity events in these regions in the sahara northern africa where rainfall is scarce some grid cells showed very high ed values such exceptionally high ed values were corrected using ed values of adjacent grid cells coupled mapping of ed and mean annual rainfall can facilitate identification of erosion prone areas fig 7 b the ed fig 7 a and chelsa mean annual rainfall fig s13 have been classified into 25 categories fig 7 b that represent the five quantiles q1 q5 of each dataset depending on the underlying geology areas characterized by both very high eds 4 mjha 1 h 1 q5 and very high mean annual rainfall 1200 mm q5 are very susceptible to soil erosion and or landslides sizable areas of madagascar central and western africa southeast asia northwestern and southeastern parts of south america and the southeastern united states are apt to be strongly affected by soil erosion and or landslides fig 7 b areas where very high ed 4 mjha 1 h 1 q5 was accompanied by very low mean annual rainfall less than300 mm q1 were also identified as erosion prone such areas include the sahel in africa western chile and eastern argentina in south america and southwestern china northwestern india and western pakistan in asia fig 7 b the lowest susceptibility areas were identified as those characterized by very low ed less than0 5 mj ha 1 h 1 q1 and very low mean annual rainfall less than300 mm q1 also areas with high mean annual rainfall but very low ed due to an even distribution of rainfall are less susceptible to erosion the areas of low susceptibility include a broad stretch of europe the northern part of north america northern and southern africa and southern australia fig 7 b the ed based erosion prone area mapping fig 7 b partly agreed with global scale and regional scale soil erosion and landslide studies for example borrelli et al 2017 have reported that parts of south america western and eastern africa and southeast asia are subject to relatively high rates of soil erosion by water furthermore relatively high rates of landslide mobilization have been reported in central and southeast asian mountain ranges and the western flank of south and north america broeckx et al 2020 our results also agreed well with the data based intra continental patterns of landslides for africa reported by broeckx et al 2018 who have identified landslide prone areas in madagascar as well as central and western africa 3 4 sources of uncertainty this study integrated global rainfall erosivity estimates from best available gauge measurements gloreda and new generation satellite based observations gpm imerg gloreda is the only global dataset based on sub hourly and hourly station data currently available panagos et al 2017 nevertheless the density of gloreda stations used for the residual based merging with gpm imerg based erosivity estimates is relatively low particularly in africa and south america the low density of gloreda stations in these regions could affect the accuracy of the rainfall erosivity estimates based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 2 b as well as the gloreda interpolated map panagos et al 2017 we used gloreda as independent data for cross scale point global continental climate zone and river basin scales comparison with the gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates gpm imerg s climatological adjustment using gpcc data might indirectly employ some of the gloreda stations which may entail bias in our comparison the resulting bias however may not have a marked effect since the comparison was done based on long term mean annual data gpm imerg uses inter calibrated pmw sensors to estimate rainfall geosynchronous ir based rainfall estimates are used to fill gaps in the pmw estimates within 60 n 60 s hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2019 ir data are limited to 60 n 60 s because the viewing angle is too oblique to produce reliably useful information at high latitudes tan et al 2019 gpm imerg v06 provides coverage at high latitudes through morphing using numerical model variables however the benefits of morphing diminish at high latitudes due to the high inter sensor differences over frozen areas tan et al 2019 leading to uncertainties in rainfall erosivity estimates poleward of 60 n and s there is uncertainty associated with the gpm imerg based rainfall estimates as discussed in section 3 2 1 that uncertainty results in marked underestimation overestimation of global rainfall erosivity especially by gpm imerg only furthermore at least 22 years of data are recommended for accurate assessment of long term rainfall erosivity brown and foster 1987 renard et al 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 however most gloreda stations covered the years 2000 2010 panagos et al 2017 whereas the gpm imerg data used in the present study covered the years 2001 2020 we recognize that the difference in temporal coverage between gloreda and gpm imerg may cause a bias because the merging of gmp imerg with gloreda was based on long term mean annual data the bias due to the difference in temporal coverage may not be significant but should be considered when making further applications 4 data availability and outlook the integration of gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with gloreda can be considered as an important step to improve our understanding of large scale patterns of rainfall erosivity improving rainfall erosivity estimates can help to enhance regional to global scale soil erosion modeling to better understand the severity of land degradation by soil erosion this in turn can contribute to addressing the current policy challenges relating to land degradation by soil erosion by relevant stakeholders such as the united nations convention to combat desertification unccd and the food and agriculture organization fao the new global rainfall erosivity dataset is not to challenge local or regional rainfall erosivity maps developed from locally available data with better quality higher resolution or longer time series nonetheless our integrated approach to map global rainfall erosivity can potentially address gaps especially for areas where rainfall erosivity was estimated merely from spares gauging stations and from daily monthly or annual rainfall volume data instead of rainfall intensity it is noteworthy that integrating gpm imerg with gloreda enabled leveraging of the complementary strengths of gloreda and gpm imerg to improve global rainfall erosivity estimates from satellite observations further improvements can be made at global regional scales as more long term gpm imerg and locally available station data become available in addition the computation of rainfall erosivity from gpm imerg can be made operational to produce time series annual global rainfall erosivity maps instead of long term average the gpm imerg final 30 min rain rate data used in this study can be downloaded from the gpm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm the mean annual rainfall data used as a predictor variable for the gwr can be downloaded from the chelsa website https chelsa climate org the data and maps presented here will be available in the european soil data centre esdac a data repository of the european commission joint research centre https esdac jrc ec europa eu 5 conclusions traditionally rainfall data from conventional rain gauges are used to calculate rainfall erosivity however spatial interpolation of point data is not a good option especially in areas where gauge measurements are rarely available satellite based rainfall estimates offer continuous spatial coverage but they are affected by biases we demonstrated a novel approach to improving global rainfall erosivity estimates by integrating satellite and gauge data a gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda was used to leverage the complementary strengths of satellite and gauge based rainfall erosivity measurements the spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity estimates by gpm imerg only closely resembled those of gpm imerg merged with gloreda however gpm imerg only tended to underestimate the rainfall erosivity values over large parts of the globe with the greatest underestimations observed in areas of high rainfall erosivity 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 this suggests that soil erosion modeling driven by satellite only rainfall erosivity estimates would likely result in unreliable estimates of soil loss rates due to uncertainty propagation from rainfall erosivity estimates in turn unreliable estimates of soil loss rates especially in areas experiencing high rainfall erosivity may lead to inaccurate conclusions about prioritization of erosion prone areas and soil conservation planning to reliably estimate rainfall erosivity from satellite based observations one must consider bias correction using gauge measurements merging gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with gloreda markedly reduced the rainfall erosivity bias from the gpm imerg only estimates the accuracy of gwr based merging of rainfall erosivity generally improved with increasing rain gauge density the rainfall erosivity estimates by gpm imerg merged with gloreda can be employed by soil erosion modelers for improving cross scale soil erosion assessment this in turn can contribute to make informed decisions at regional national continental and global scales and support ongoing efforts to reverse soil erosion related land degradation such as those of the united nations goal of achieving land degradation neutrality the satellite based rainfall estimates despite their notable limitations are useful for understanding the spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity particularly when gauge data are scarce or completely do not exist the satellite based rainfall estimates are also good alternatives to model the intra annual dynamics of rainfall erosivity and enable spatio temporal modeling of soil erosion this study will lead to a follow up work for investigating monthly global rainfall erosivity based on gpm imerg

1928,rainfall erosivity is a key factor that influences soil erosion by water rain gauge measurements are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity however long term gauge records with sub hourly resolutions are lacking in large parts of the world satellite observations provide spatially continuous estimates of rainfall but they are subject to biases that affect estimates of rainfall erosivity

haregeweyn et al 2023 recent predictions have shown that soil erosion by water may increase globally because of climate change by 30 66 between 2015 and 2070 borrelli et al 2020 rainfall erosivity is among the important drivers of soil erosion because it influences the detachment breakdown and transport of soil particles soil erosion models such as the universal soil loss equation wischmeier and smith 1978 and its updated version renard et al 1997 use rainfall erosivity as one of the major input factors rainfall erosivity can be estimated using two approaches panagos et al 2015a 2015b i computing rainfall erosivity using high temporal resolution rainfall data and ii establishing relationships that correlate rainfall erosivity with more readily available rainfall data e g daily

calculated from high temporal resolution e g 1 min measurements of raindrop size and velocity using optical disdrometers e g meshesha et al 2019 johannsen et al 2020 however such measuring instruments are seldom available in national meteorological networks because of instrumentation drawbacks rainfall erosivity is commonly computed from sub hourly rainfall measured by pluviographs or tipping buckets which do not provide data on raindrop size and velocity such data are then used to compute rainfall erosivity using empirically developed equations that relate rainfall intensity with rainfall kinetic energy e g wischmeier and smith 1978 brown and foster 1987 renard et al 1997 van dijk et al 2002 in the second approach rainfall erosivity is estimated based on daily monthly or annual rainfall volume data instead of rainfall intensity e g diodato and bellocchi 2007 angulo martínez and beguería 2009 fenta et al 2016 2017 2020a haregeweyn et al 2017 elnashar et al 2021 because extreme rainfall events are typically rare events of short duration the reliability of rainfall erosivity estimations declines as the temporal resolution decreases panagos et al 2016 yue et al 2020 traditionally rain gauges provide a direct and the most reliable measure of rainfall however conventional gauge measurements with sub hourly resolutions are rarely available especially in developing countries panagos et al 2017 meira et al 2022 moreover conventional rain gauges provide point scale measurements and thus can only represent a geographically limited area of observation because rainfall erosivity can have large spatial variability the use of point scale data to represent areal rainfall erosivity can result in the loss of some spatial variability past research that relied on gauge measurements applied spatial interpolation of point data to estimate rainfall erosivity in ungauged areas e g bonilla and vidal 2011 meusburger et al 2012 panagos et al 2015a 2017 ballabio et al 2017 however the interpolated rainfall erosivity values can have a large degree of uncertainty especially in areas where rain gauges are sparsely located angulo martínez et al 2009 besides rainfall measurements from rain gauges have uncertainties resulting from installation defects wind effects as well as other systematic and random errors upton and rahimi 2003 the use of rain gauge measurements for rainfall erosivity assessments is hampered by several shortcomings in terms of spatial coverage temporal resolution period of operation data access and data latency kidd et al 2017 recent developments have offered satellite based rainfall estimates with both high temporal and spatial resolutions e g sun et al 2018 huffman et al 2019 in addition satellite based rainfall estimates have near global coverage relatively long term data and are available free of charge at short latency due to these advantages satellite based rainfall estimates have become promising alternatives especially in areas where analysis of rainfall erosivity is compromised by the limited availability of gauge measurements such as in africa south america and asia in recent years significant efforts have been underway to model rainfall erosivity based on satellite rainfall datasets at national e g kim et al 2020 chen et al 2021 das et al 2022 regional fenta et al 2017 2020a haregeweyn et al 2017

influence the accuracy of rainfall erosivity estimates merging satellite based estimates with gauge data can help leverage their complementary strengths the accuracy of gauge measurements and spatial

gwr based merging scheme to effectively enhance the quality of rainfall data e g hu et al 2015 chao et al 2018 gebremedhin et al 2021 the goal of this study was to advance the modeling of global rainfall erosivity by integrating satellite based erosivity estimates with gauge data to this end we employed a first approach to analyze global rainfall erosivity based on the new generation gpm imerg long term 2001 2020 rainfall data at a temporal resolution of 30 min and spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 we then improved the gpm imerg based global rainfall erosivity estimates by merging with global rainfall erosivity database gloreda station data panagos et al 2017 through a residual based merging scheme using gwr the specific objectives were to i develop a new global rainfall erosivity map based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda ii evaluate the performance of the gwr based merging method based on the gloreda data and iii identify areas prone to soil erosion by water through a coupled mapping of erosivity density ed and mean annual rainfall the findings of this study can enhance our understanding of the global patterns of rainfall erosivity and contribute to improving soil erosion modeling 2 data sources and methods 2 1 gpm imerg recent advances in the accessibility of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite rainfall data have enabled global scale hydrological investigations in particular the global precipitation measurement gpm mission has set the standard for a new generation of satellite based global rainfall estimates gpm is jointly developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa hou et al 2014 building upon the success of trmm launched in november 1997 the gpm placed in orbit in february 2014 mission is designed to unify and advance rainfall estimates from a constellation of satellites the trmm satellite and gpm serve as reference standards for combining all the passive microwave pmw and geosynchronous infrared ir based rainfall estimates in their respective eras three noteworthy advancements of the gpm over trmm have been i an increase of the orbital inclination angle from 35 to

to provide the first map of global rainfall erosivity panagos et al 2017 gloreda is the outcome of a thorough effort to collect high temporal resolution 1 min to 60 min rainfall data from all possible countries across different climatic and geographic regions the number of years of data ranged from 5 to 52 and most of the data covered the years 2000 to 2010 panagos et al 2017 the number of gloreda stations varied greatly among continents europe with 48 of the total dataset made the largest contribution followed by asia and the middle east 34 of the total dataset south america and africa had the lowest number of gloreda stations 5 of the total dataset the gloreda data for north america and the caribbean were collected from 146 stations the majority of which were in the united states there were marked differences in the geographical distribution of gloreda stations across continents stations in europe north america and oceania were relatively well distributed geographically but those in africa and south america were clustered overall the gloreda stations were well distributed over different levels of rainfall erosivity panagos et al 2017 panagos et al 2017 have developed a global map of rainfall erosivity at 0 01 0 01 resolution based on gloreda and gaussian process regression this study used annual rainfall erosivity data from both the gloreda stations as well as the global map of rainfall erosivity we used 3286 gloreda stations that fell within the 0 1 0 1 grid cells of gpm imerg data for the global land areas the gloreda station data and the global rainfall erosivity map

erosivity is the erosive power of rainfall to cause soil erosion which accounts for the combined effects of the rainfall intensity duration and magnitude wischmeier and smith 1978 the mean annual rainfall erosivity for each 0 1 0 1 grid cell of 30 min gpm imerg data mm h 1 was computed as the product of the kinetic energy of a rainfall event and its maximum 30 min intensity i30 brown and foster 1987 1 r 1 n i 1 n j 1 k e i 30 j where r is the mean annual rainfall erosivity mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 n is the number of years of gpm imerg data k is the number of erosive events in year i and ei30 is the rainfall erosivity of event j the event rainfall erosivity index ei30 mj mm ha 1 h 1 is defined as follows 2 ei 30 r 1 m e r v r j i 30 j where er is the specific kinetic energy of rainfall mj ha 1 mm 1 vr is the rainfall volume mm of a rainfall event for the rth period having m parts and i30 is the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity mmh 1 of the rainfall event j the specific kinetic energy of rainfall er was computed based on a rainfall intensity energy equation proposed by brown and foster 1987 because panagos et al 2017 also applied this equation to develop gloreda 3 e r 0 29 1 0 72 e x p 0 05 i r where ir is the rainfall intensity mm hr 1 for the rth period identification of erosive events j is necessary to compute rainfall erosivity for each gpm imerg grid cell renard et al 1997 proposed three criteria for identifying an erosive event i an event has at least 12 7 mm of cumulative rainfall or ii an event has at least one peak that is 12 7 mm or larger for a 30 min period within the event and iii an event with less than 12 7 mm of rainfall in a 6 h period is applied to divide a longer rainfall event into two events the assumption used to determine the threshold value of 12 7 mm was that events with less than 12 7 mm of rainfall would not significantly affect the annual rainfall erosivity this assumption was corroborated by lu and yu 2002 who have shown that using a threshold of 0 mm instead of 12 7 mm resulted in an increase of the rainfall erosivity by only 3 5 the erosive event criteria and the rainfall erosivity equations were formulated based on over 10 000 plot years of data brown and foster 1987 renard et al 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 2 5 merging gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with gloreda the residual based merging approach applied in this study followed a two source i e satellite and gauge rainfall merging scheme hu et al 2015 the background field was the gpm imerg based estimations of mean annual rainfall erosivity the residual field was calculated using residuals while taking the effects of the predictor variables into consideration the residual was computed as the difference between the mean annual rainfall erosivity estimates of the gpm imerg and gloreda stations the merged rainfall erosivity rf was a function of the erosivity estimates from the gpm imerg rs and the gloreda data rg 4 r f r s f r g r s the function f rg rs represents the residual to be corrected in the gpm imerg rainfall erosivity estimates solved through mathematical methods following the work of hu et al 2015 the gwr brunsdon et al 1996 was used to estimate the residual field f rg rs as 5 f r g r s i β i 0 k 1 n β ik x ik ε i where f r g r s i is the residual at grid cell i βi0 is the constant regression coefficient intercept n is the number of predictor variables xik is thekth explanatory variable at grid celli βik is the correspondingkth regression coefficient at grid celli andε i is the random error at grid cell i eq 5 describes the non stationary relationship between the residual field and predictor variables and can be written using matrix multiplication as follows 6 y x β ε where is the symbol for matrix multiplication ε is the error vector and x and β are the two matrices for the predictor variables and local regression coefficients respectively the local regression coefficients at grid celliwere estimated using a weighted least squares approach brunsdon et al 1996 as follows 7 β i x t w i x 1 x t w i y where β i is an n 1 vector of theregression coefficient at grid cell i xt is the transpose of x and wi is the spatial weight matrix computed using weighting functions based on the proximities of grid cellito its m neighboring gauges for observation at grid cell i the β i based estimates were computed as follows 8 y i x i x t w i x 1 x t w i y theneighborhood parameter was set based on the distance band the optimal bandwidth was determined automatically by the akaike information criterion fotheringham et al 2003 gwr applies a geographical weighting to the observations used in each of the local regression equations gwr assumes that observations that are closer to the regression point have more weight in the regression equation than observations farther away the weights were determined using a kernel which used a distance decay function for the spatial weight matrix the adaptive kernel was used because the distribution of gloreda stations varied spatially fig 1 we used agaussianweighting scheme because it avoids local collinearity a well known problem in gwr the weight using the gaussian kernel distance decay function was computed as follows 9 w ij e x p 1 2 d ij b 2 where wij is the weight of observation j for observation i dij is the distance between observation i and j and b is the bandwidth distance the local regression coefficients for each grid cell of the gpm imerg were estimated based on eq 7 substituting these coefficients into eq 5 resulted in the residual field at each grid cell of the gpm imerg finally the residual based merged mean annual rainfall erosivity was produced based on eq 4 we used the mean annual rainfall 1979 2013 from the chelsa database as an independent predictor variable to estimate the residual field the chelsa database has other potential predictor variables e g average minimum and maximum monthly rainfall rainfall during the wettest and driest month rainfall during the wettest and driest quarter but those variables were strongly correlated with the mean annual rainfall elevation was not included as a predictor variable because it was already used in chelsa to correct the orographic effects karger et al 2017 for the gpm imerg and chelsa data a projected coordinate system with a resolution of 10 10 km was used to enhance the computational efficiency of gwr the standardized residual of the gwr model fig s1 showed that the analysis was not much affected by outliers in the gloreda the performance of the residual based merging scheme was evaluated against gloreda station data panagos et al 2017 using k fold cross validation k 10 this approach involved randomly splitting the gloreda data into k 10 mutually exclusive folds of approximately equal size subsequently k 10 iterations of training and validation were performed during each iteration one of the k folds was treated as a validation set while the model was fitted on the remaining k 1 folds the cross validation estimate of accuracy was the average of all the iterations the random sampling was stratified by continent to ensure that each fold had the same proportion of gloreda stations across continents to avoid sampling of multiple gloreda stations per pixel of gpm imerg the distance between the sampling points was set to be 10 km the accuracy of the merging scheme was evaluated based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse the nse showed how well the plot of the gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity versus gloreda station data fit the 1 1 line whereas the pbias and rmse were metrics of the mean residual and spread of the residual respectively moriasi et al 2007 in addition we compared the gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with the gloreda interpolated data panagos et al 2017 at continental koppen geiger climate zone beck et al 2018 and river basin lehner and grill 2013 scales the gloreda interpolated data were projected and aggregated by mean value to 10 10 km to conform to the spatial resolution of the gpm imerg data comparisons at global continental climate zone and river basin scales were made using the projected and aggregated gloreda interpolated data fig 1 illustrates the main steps used to merge rainfall erosivity estimates from gpm imerg with gloreda station data 2 6 calculation of erosivity density the amount of rainfall and its erosivity vary over space and time relatively long term rainfall data are required for an accurate assessment of rainfall erosivity to cope with a lack of long term data foster et al 2008 have proposed the concept of erosivity density ed a function of rainfall erosivity and rainfall depth as a more stable erosivity index the ed strongly depends on rainfall intensity and the number of erosive events foster et al 2008 high ed values indicate the occurrence of intense rainstorms over an area foster et al 2008 kinnell 2010 the prevalence of potentially high runoff shown by regions with very high ed values suggests that these regions are more prone to floods dabney et al 2011 the ed shows the rainfall erosivity per unit of rainfall and is expressed as follows foster et al 2008 kinnell 2010 10 ed r p where ed is the erosivity density mj ha 1 h 1 r is the mean annual rainfall erosivity mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda and p is the mean annual rainfall mm yr 1 from chelsa to identify erosion prone areas we used a coupled mapping of ed and mean annual rainfall panagos et al 2015b datasets of ed and mean annual rainfall were classified into five categories using quantile classification for both ed and mean annual rainfall the five quantiles represented very low q1 low q2 moderate q3 high q4 and very high q5 classes we combined these five categories of ed and mean annual rainfall into 25 new categories the overall susceptibility to soil erosion was then mapped using the 25 categories the most susceptible areas were those with very high ed values and very low mean annual rainfall as well as areas with very high ed values and very high mean annual rainfall panagos et al 2015b areas with very low to low ed could be considered less erosion prone despite having high mean annual rainfall rainfall erosivity and ed statistics presented in section 3 were extracted from maps with a resolution of 10 10 km 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of global rainfall erosivity based on gpm imerg only fig 2 a the global mean annual rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 1173 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with a standard deviation sd of 1736 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 2 b the global mean annual rainfall erosivity was 2020 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 3415 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the fact that the global mean annual rainfall erosivity from gpm imerg merged with gloreda was 1 7 times the gpm imerg only estimate implied that the rainfall erosivity estimated by only satellites was a marked underestimate a ratio map of gpm imerg merged with gloreda to gpm imerg only fig s2 revealed substantial underestimation of the mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only over large parts of the globe except for europe and northern africa compared to gpm imerg merged with gloreda gpm imerg only slightly overestimated the mean annual rainfall erosivity over large swaths of europe fig s2 consistent with our results the gloreda based mean annual rainfall erosivity estimates panagos et al 2017 were 1 65 times for the united states kim et al 2020 and 1 8 times globally bezak et al 2022 the cmorph based erosivity estimates over europe i e without russia cmorph overestimated the mean annual rainfall erosivity compared to gloreda interpolated bezak et al 2022 based on the quantile map of rainfall erosivity derived from gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 2 b the 50th percentile median of the global rainfall erosivity was 1050 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 whereas the 20th percentile 20 of the erosivity values was lower than 200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and the 80th percentile the highest 20 of the erosivity values was higher than 5500 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 overall the spatial distribution of global rainfall erosivity was highly variable very high rainfall erosivity was estimated for south america southeast asia central and western africa central america and the caribbean very low rainfall erosivity was found predominantly in northern africa the middle east central asia and northern europe fig 2 the global rainfall erosivity spatial patterns fig 2 agreed well with previous studies e g panagos et al 2017 bezak et al 2022 that have reported very high rainfall erosivity in south america southeast asia central africa and the caribbean countries visual comparison of the spatial distribution of global rainfall erosivity fig 2 with regional scale erosivity maps reported for africa e g diodato et al 2013 vrieling et al 2010 eastern africa fenta et al 2017 the united states kim et al 2020 and india das et al 2022 revealed a high degree of agreement consistent with our results fig 2 high rainfall erosivity 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 has been reported over central and western africa and the ethiopian highlands diodato et al 2013 vrieling et al 2010 fenta et al 2017 as well as western india das et al 2022 the spatial distribution of very high rainfall erosivity fig 2 corresponds well with the spatial distribution of high intensity rainfall events reported by zipser et al 2006 who have found that extreme rainfall events are more frequent over central south america the caribbean central and western africa and southeast asia 3 2 evaluation of gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates the gpm imerg based global rainfall erosivity estimates of this study were evaluated through i a point to pixel comparison using the mean annual rainfall erosivity values of the gloreda stations panagos et al 2017 and ii a cross scale global continental climate zone and river basin scale comparison with the mean annual rainfall erosivity map produced based on interpolation of the gloreda station data panagos et al 2017 3 2 1 evaluation using gloreda station data merging rainfall erosivity estimates from gpm imerg with gloreda using gwr substantially improved the accuracy of global rainfall erosivity estimates the improvement was evidenced by the higher nse 0 83 lower pbias 2 4 and lower rmse 1122 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 compared with the gpm imerg only rainfall erosivity estimates nse 0 51 pbias 27 8 and rmse 1730 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 we investigated the performance of gwr based merging scheme under different rain gauge density the accuracy of rainfall erosivity estimates from gpm imerg merged with gloreda generally improved in regions with relatively high density of gloreda stations europe north america asia and oceania nse 0 81 pbias 1 9 and rmse 1030 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in regions where the density of gloreda stations was sparse africa and south america the accuracy of gwr based merging scheme decreased nse 0 81 pbias 6 4 and rmse 1769 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 we found that gpm imerg only underestimated mean annual rainfall erosivity the underestimation was more severe in the highland stations elevation 1500 m fig s3 we also observed that the underestimation of rainfall erosivity by the gpm imerg only tended to increase with increasing rainfall erosivity fig s4 the greatest underestimations were apparent at stations where annual rainfall erosivity values exceeded 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the gpm imerg only estimates overestimated mean annual rainfall erosivity at stations with erosivity values less than 1000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig s4 it is worth noting that the gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda considerably reduced the rainfall erosivity bias from the gpm imerg only estimates fig s4 comparison of mean annual rainfall from gloreda stations with gpm imerg showed that gpm imerg underestimated rainfall fig s5 a the underestimation was greater at the highland stations fig s5 b several studies have evaluated the performance of the gpm imerg rainfall estimates at local regional e g manz et al 2017 navarro et al 2019 palomino ángel et al 2019 shawky et al 2019 yang et al 2020 and global derin et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 wang and yong 2020 scales on the one hand gpm imerg overestimated low rainfall intensity events derin et al 2019 palomino ángel et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 shawky et al 2019 wang and yong 2020 pmw algorithms have limitations to properly differentiate between raining clouds and surfaces that produce a microwave signature like that of rainfall wang et al 2009 sand and snow surfaces could therefore be confused with rainfall signatures which are specific to pmw algorithms e g wang et al 2009 this could result in overestimation of rainfall by gpm imerg the other possibility is that the rainfall detected aloft by the satellite may evaporate before reaching the ground especially in dry areas dinku et al 2011 pradhan et al 2022 yang et al 2020 leading to overestimation of rainfall overestimation of rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only in areas of relatively low erosivity values less than1000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig s4 is likely caused by overestimation of low rainfall intensity events on the other hand gpm imerg based rainfall estimates underestimated high rainfall intensity events derin et al 2019 navarro et al 2019 palomino ángel et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 shawky et al 2019 the underestimation of high rainfall events was worse for highland regions than for lowlands pradhan et al 2022 the underestimation of high rainfall events by the gpm imerg was likely attributable to i underestimation of high intensity rainfall because rainfall is averaged over a pixel area and such rainfall eventsare commonly observed over spatial domains smaller than the pixel size of the gpm imerg manz et al 2017 ii gpm imerg may not accurately estimate rainfall from warm rain processes especially in mountainous areas because the tendency of the cloud top temperature to be warmer than the rainfall detection thresholds leads to underestimation of rainfall derin et al 2019 navarro et al 2019 pradhan et al 2022 and iii rainfall underestimation may be caused by the low sampling frequency of the satellite which causes gpm imerg based rainfall estimates to miss short duration high intensity rainfall events pradhan et al 2022 the marked underestimation of rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only especially in regions of relatively high erosivity values 2000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig s4 is likely the result of underestimation of high rainfall intensity events 3 2 2 comparison with gloreda interpolated data comparison at global scale fig 3 shows comparison at the global scale taking ratio of rainfall erosivity estimates of gpm imerg merged with gloreda to gloreda interpolated panagos et al 2017 relatively better agreement between the two rainfall erosivity estimates was observed mainly in high rainfall erosivity areas including southeastern north america central africa central south america southern asia and sizable parts of australia figs 3 s6 regions of better agreement between rainfall erosivity estimates of gpm imerg merged with gloreda and gloreda interpolated covered ca 25 of the global land area figs 3 s6 in these regions the mean rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 2935 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 3250 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 by both gpm imerg merged with gloreda and gloreda interpolated rainfall erosivity estimated by gpm imerg merged with gloreda was higher than gloreda interpolated for ca 42 of the global land area figs 3 s6 these areas include large parts of north america northern and southern parts of south america the sahel in africa central asia eastern russia southeastern asia and southern australia figs 3 s6 in areas where erosivity estimates by gpm imerg merged with gloreda were higher figs 3 s6 the mean rainfall erosivity estimated by gpm imerg merged with gloreda was 2530 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 4160 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 whereas the one estimated by gloreda interpolated was 1370 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 2270 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 regions where gloreda interpolated rainfall erosivity estimates were higher than gpm imerg merged with gloreda were found mainly in low rainfall erosivity areas of northern and southern africa middle east northern europe northwestern china and large parts of mongolia figs 3 s6 these regions cover ca 33 of the global land area figs 4 s6 the mean rainfall erosivity estimated for these regions was 1190 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 2280 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 by gloreda interpolated and 670 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 1560 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 by gpm imerg merged with gloreda comparison at continental scale at the continental scale gpm imerg only substantially underestimated the mean annual rainfall erosivity fig 4 whereas rainfall erosivity estimated based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda agreed better with the erosivity estimates of panagos et al 2017 this better agreement demonstrated the improvement in rainfall erosivity estimates that resulted from the gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda the largest differences were observed for africa gpm imerg only and south america gpm imerg only and gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 4 relatively better agreement between the gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated map was found for europe and to some extent for north america and asia fig 4 where the networks of stations were relatively dense the difference between the gpm imerg only and gloreda was partly attributable to the density of stations used by gloreda panagos et al 2017 and partly to the rainfall underestimation by gpm imerg as discussed in section 3 2 1 in line with our results fig 4 bezak et al 2022 and kim et al 2020 have reported large differences between satellite based rainfall erosivity estimates and gloreda estimates based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 4 south america experienced the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity of 6521 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and high spatial variability sd 4569 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 this high erosivity was followed by africa 3214 sd 3993 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 asia 2272 sd 4137 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 oceania 1941 sd 2720 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and north america 1794 sd 2019 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the mean annual rainfall erosivity for europe was the lowest among the continents 325 sd 492 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the 80th percentiles highest 20 of the mean annual rainfall erosivities were 9200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the northern part of south america 7800 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in central and western africa 5300 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in southeast asia and 3200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the northern part of oceania and southwestern north america fig s7 comparison by climate zones comparison at the climate zone level fig 5 revealed relatively large underestimation of mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only in tropical and temperate climates where erosivity is high over large areas fig s8 in climate zones with low rainfall erosivity arid cold and polar the differences between gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated panagos et al 2017 mean annual rainfall erosivity were found to be smaller fig 5 the gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda substantially reduced the differences between gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated rainfall erosivity estimates fig 5 climate zone level estimates of mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 5 showed that regions with tropical climate experience the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity of 8625 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an sd of 4709 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by regions with temperate climates 4248 sd 3079 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 this pattern is likely attributable to the occurrence of frequent intense rainfall events especially in tropical regions zipser et al 2006 previous global regional scale studies e g bezak et al 2022 kim et al 2020 panagos et al 2017 das et al 2022 have also reported high rainfall erosivity for regions with tropical and temperate climates the lowest rainfall erosivity as expected was estimated for arid climate 726 sd 998 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by cold climate 796 sd 987 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and polar climate 1189 sd 1609 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 zones quantile maps fig s8 showed that the 80th percentile highest 20 of the mean annual rainfall erosivity values exceeded 11 800 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in equatorial tropical regions 6300 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in temperate climates 1400 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in arid climates and 1000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in cold climates comparison at river basin scale figure s9 a compares mean annual rainfall erosivity estimates for 244 river basins extracted from the hydrosheds third level global catchment boundaries fig s9 b lehner and grill 2013 a comparison between gpm imerg only and gloreda fig s9 a revealed that gpm imerg only markedly underestimated rainfall erosivity pbias 39 the gwr based blending of gpm imerg with gloreda improved the accuracy of rainfall erosivity estimates nse 0 8 pbias 21 and rmse 2077 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 compared with the gpm imerg only fig s9 a for rainfall erosivity values above 11 000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the fact that gpm imerg merged with gloreda estimates exceeded gloreda interpolated estimates panagos et al 2017 fig s9 a was likely attributable to the effect of interpolation which tends to smooth the extreme values hofstra et al 2010 figure s9 a indicates that the uncertainty increases for river basins with high rainfall erosivity values further comparison of the rainfall erosivity estimates was made for 10 major river basins figs 6 s10 selected on the basis of their susceptibility to soil erosion yang et al 2003 fig 6 shows a large underestimation of mean annual rainfall erosivity by gpm imerg only in river basins where rainfall erosivity is relatively high e g amazon congo mekong the mean annual rainfall erosivity difference between the gpm imerg only and gloreda interpolated estimates was smaller in river basins characterized by relatively low rainfall erosivity e g amur huang he fig 6 the considerable improvement of rainfall erosivity estimates for all the major river basins by integration of the gpm imerg with gloreda was evidenced by the reduced discrepancy between the gpm imerg merged with gloreda and gloreda interpolated estimates fig 6 based on the gpm imerg merged with the gloreda fig 6 the amazon experienced the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity 9736 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and sd of 4155 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by the congo 8192 sd 1878 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and mekong 6416 sd 4219 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the lowest mean annual rainfall erosivity was estimated for huang he 707 sd 564 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 followed by the amur 765 sd 310 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 the quantile maps fig s11 showed that the 80th percentiles highest 20 of the mean annual rainfall erosivity were 12 900 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the northwestern amazon 9900 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the central congo and southwestern mekong 5200 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in southern and western nile and central and western ganges and 4500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in southwestern mississippi and yangtze fig s12 shows that although the amazon congo and mekong basins are subject to high rainfall erosivity they are experiencing relatively low rates of soil loss likely due to better vegetation forest cover in high erosivity areas borrelli et al 2017 moderately high rainfall erosivity fig s12 resulted in relatively high rates of soil loss in the ganges indus nile and yangtze basins likely because of the presence of mountainous areas and intensively cultivated croplands in the high population regions of these basins yang et al 2003 borrelli et al 2017 fenta et al 2020b 2021 elnashar et al 2021 it is worth noting that rainfall erosivity indicates spatial differences in the erosive power of rainfall but does not necessarily indicate where soil erosion occurs soil erosion modeling thus integrates rainfall erosivity with other soil erosion factors such as soil topography land cover and management practices wischmeier and smith 1978 renard et al 1997 3 3 erosivity density the global mean of the ed was 1 9 mj ha 1 h 1 with an sd of 2 mj ha 1 h 1 an ed that exceeded 1 mj ha 1 h 1 indicated that the rainfall in the area was characterized by intense rainstorms of short duration whereas an ed of less than 1 mj ha 1 h 1 indicated the prevalence of low rainfall intensity events in the area fig 7 a foster et al 2008 have demonstrated that ed values are directly related to the 30 min maximum rainfall intensity dabney et al 2011 have predicted higher runoff and flood risk for areas with ed values that exceed 3 mj ha 1 h 1 large parts of south america central and western africa madagascar northern australia southeastern asia the southwestern us and the caribbean are characterized by high ed erosivity values in those areas are more than three times the mean annual rainfall fig 7 a in contrast the relatively low ed over large parts of europe northern parts of north america northern and southern parts of africa the middle east and southern australia fig 7 a indicated the prevalence of low rainfall intensity events in these regions in the sahara northern africa where rainfall is scarce some grid cells showed very high ed values such exceptionally high ed values were corrected using ed values of adjacent grid cells coupled mapping of ed and mean annual rainfall can facilitate identification of erosion prone areas fig 7 b the ed fig 7 a and chelsa mean annual rainfall fig s13 have been classified into 25 categories fig 7 b that represent the five quantiles q1 q5 of each dataset depending on the underlying geology areas characterized by both very high eds 4 mjha 1 h 1 q5 and very high mean annual rainfall 1200 mm q5 are very susceptible to soil erosion and or landslides sizable areas of madagascar central and western africa southeast asia northwestern and southeastern parts of south america and the southeastern united states are apt to be strongly affected by soil erosion and or landslides fig 7 b areas where very high ed 4 mjha 1 h 1 q5 was accompanied by very low mean annual rainfall less than300 mm q1 were also identified as erosion prone such areas include the sahel in africa western chile and eastern argentina in south america and southwestern china northwestern india and western pakistan in asia fig 7 b the lowest susceptibility areas were identified as those characterized by very low ed less than0 5 mj ha 1 h 1 q1 and very low mean annual rainfall less than300 mm q1 also areas with high mean annual rainfall but very low ed due to an even distribution of rainfall are less susceptible to erosion the areas of low susceptibility include a broad stretch of europe the northern part of north america northern and southern africa and southern australia fig 7 b the ed based erosion prone area mapping fig 7 b partly agreed with global scale and regional scale soil erosion and landslide studies for example borrelli et al 2017 have reported that parts of south america western and eastern africa and southeast asia are subject to relatively high rates of soil erosion by water furthermore relatively high rates of landslide mobilization have been reported in central and southeast asian mountain ranges and the western flank of south and north america broeckx et al 2020 our results also agreed well with the data based intra continental patterns of landslides for africa reported by broeckx et al 2018 who have identified landslide prone areas in madagascar as well as central and western africa 3 4 sources of uncertainty this study integrated global rainfall erosivity estimates from best available gauge measurements gloreda and new generation satellite based observations gpm imerg gloreda is the only global dataset based on sub hourly and hourly station data currently available panagos et al 2017 nevertheless the density of gloreda stations used for the residual based merging with gpm imerg based erosivity estimates is relatively low particularly in africa and south america the low density of gloreda stations in these regions could affect the accuracy of the rainfall erosivity estimates based on gpm imerg merged with gloreda fig 2 b as well as the gloreda interpolated map panagos et al 2017 we used gloreda as independent data for cross scale point global continental climate zone and river basin scales comparison with the gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates gpm imerg s climatological adjustment using gpcc data might indirectly employ some of the gloreda stations which may entail bias in our comparison the resulting bias however may not have a marked effect since the comparison was done based on long term mean annual data gpm imerg uses inter calibrated pmw sensors to estimate rainfall geosynchronous ir based rainfall estimates are used to fill gaps in the pmw estimates within 60 n 60 s hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2019 ir data are limited to 60 n 60 s because the viewing angle is too oblique to produce reliably useful information at high latitudes tan et al 2019 gpm imerg v06 provides coverage at high latitudes through morphing using numerical model variables however the benefits of morphing diminish at high latitudes due to the high inter sensor differences over frozen areas tan et al 2019 leading to uncertainties in rainfall erosivity estimates poleward of 60 n and s there is uncertainty associated with the gpm imerg based rainfall estimates as discussed in section 3 2 1 that uncertainty results in marked underestimation overestimation of global rainfall erosivity especially by gpm imerg only furthermore at least 22 years of data are recommended for accurate assessment of long term rainfall erosivity brown and foster 1987 renard et al 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 however most gloreda stations covered the years 2000 2010 panagos et al 2017 whereas the gpm imerg data used in the present study covered the years 2001 2020 we recognize that the difference in temporal coverage between gloreda and gpm imerg may cause a bias because the merging of gmp imerg with gloreda was based on long term mean annual data the bias due to the difference in temporal coverage may not be significant but should be considered when making further applications 4 data availability and outlook the integration of gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with gloreda can be considered as an important step to improve our understanding of large scale patterns of rainfall erosivity improving rainfall erosivity estimates can help to enhance regional to global scale soil erosion modeling to better understand the severity of land degradation by soil erosion this in turn can contribute to addressing the current policy challenges relating to land degradation by soil erosion by relevant stakeholders such as the united nations convention to combat desertification unccd and the food and agriculture organization fao the new global rainfall erosivity dataset is not to challenge local or regional rainfall erosivity maps developed from locally available data with better quality higher resolution or longer time series nonetheless our integrated approach to map global rainfall erosivity can potentially address gaps especially for areas where rainfall erosivity was estimated merely from spares gauging stations and from daily monthly or annual rainfall volume data instead of rainfall intensity it is noteworthy that integrating gpm imerg with gloreda enabled leveraging of the complementary strengths of gloreda and gpm imerg to improve global rainfall erosivity estimates from satellite observations further improvements can be made at global regional scales as more long term gpm imerg and locally available station data become available in addition the computation of rainfall erosivity from gpm imerg can be made operational to produce time series annual global rainfall erosivity maps instead of long term average the gpm imerg final 30 min rain rate data used in this study can be downloaded from the gpm website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm the mean annual rainfall data used as a predictor variable for the gwr can be downloaded from the chelsa website https chelsa climate org the data and maps presented here will be available in the european soil data centre esdac a data repository of the european commission joint research centre https esdac jrc ec europa eu 5 conclusions traditionally rainfall data from conventional rain gauges are used to calculate rainfall erosivity however spatial interpolation of point data is not a good option especially in areas where gauge measurements are rarely available satellite based rainfall estimates offer continuous spatial coverage but they are affected by biases we demonstrated a novel approach to improving global rainfall erosivity estimates by integrating satellite and gauge data a gwr based merging of gpm imerg with gloreda was used to leverage the complementary strengths of satellite and gauge based rainfall erosivity measurements the spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity estimates by gpm imerg only closely resembled those of gpm imerg merged with gloreda however gpm imerg only tended to underestimate the rainfall erosivity values over large parts of the globe with the greatest underestimations observed in areas of high rainfall erosivity 5000 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 this suggests that soil erosion modeling driven by satellite only rainfall erosivity estimates would likely result in unreliable estimates of soil loss rates due to uncertainty propagation from rainfall erosivity estimates in turn unreliable estimates of soil loss rates especially in areas experiencing high rainfall erosivity may lead to inaccurate conclusions about prioritization of erosion prone areas and soil conservation planning to reliably estimate rainfall erosivity from satellite based observations one must consider bias correction using gauge measurements merging gpm imerg based rainfall erosivity estimates with gloreda markedly reduced the rainfall erosivity bias from the gpm imerg only estimates the accuracy of gwr based merging of rainfall erosivity generally improved with increasing rain gauge density the rainfall erosivity estimates by gpm imerg merged with gloreda can be employed by soil erosion modelers for improving cross scale soil erosion assessment this in turn can contribute to make informed decisions at regional national continental and global scales and support ongoing efforts to reverse soil erosion related land degradation such as those of the united nations goal of achieving land degradation neutrality the satellite based rainfall estimates despite their notable limitations are useful for understanding the spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity particularly when gauge data are scarce or completely do not exist the satellite based rainfall estimates are also good alternatives to model the intra annual dynamics of rainfall erosivity and enable spatio temporal modeling of soil erosion this study will lead to a follow up work for investigating monthly global rainfall erosivity based on gpm imerg

1929,climate change and anthropogenic factors have resulted in intense and frequent droughts and floods in the hengduan mountain region hmr exploring the source supply of evaporation and transportation processes for the precipitation in the hmr can help us understand regional precipitation characteristics and provide valuable insights regarding effective water resource management disaster prevention and mitigation based on the era5 reanalysis data we identified the annual and seasonal precipitationsheds of the hmr using the water accounting model 2layer to investigate the potential mechanisms that drive the changes in the precipitation in the hmr in terms of external moisture contribution and local recycling the identified precipitationshed in the hmr varied in response to different types of precipitation during the different seasons the decrease in the annual precipitation was mainly attributed to the reduced moisture supply from the extended southwest sw and northwest nw regions portraying a decreasing trend of 2 08 mm yr yr and 0 92 mm yr yr respectively the detected difference in the moisture sources and transport pathways in terms of the response of wet and dry precipitation years can improve our understanding of the moisture patterns of wet and dry years we could conclude that the increase in moisture from the sw regions due to el niño may have triggered the heavy precipitation in the hmr in 1998 additionally the reduction in moisture from the sw regions due to la niña may have triggered an extreme drought in the hmr in 2011 notably woodland and water surface expansion tend to weaken local recycling 0 07 yr after 2000 in the future the decreasing trend of local recycling will likely be intensified owing to large scale artificial reservoir construction and the surface changes caused by underlying impoundment keywords hengduan mountain region moisture source climate change wam 2layers anthropogenic factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change and anthropogenic activities are contributing to more intense and frequent extreme droughts and floods on global and regional scales chiang et al 2021 donat et al 2016 tang 2020 thackeray et al 2022 the intensifying global water cycle and more frequent water extremes are results of the synergistic impact of natural and human induced changes in many regions xiong et al 2022 for example in the chao phraya river basin in thailand the hydroclimatic extremes are primarily triggered by the variations in precipitation and further amplified by the subsequent water storage and abstraction abhishek et al 2021 unsustainable groundwater extraction in india has also contributed to water scarcity and drought conditions in many regions abhishek and kinouchi 2021 looking ahead projections suggest that climate change will further exacerbate this trend with more frequent and intense water extremes in many regions around the world pokhrel et al 2021 notably identifying the source supply of evapotranspiration and transportation processes for a specific region s precipitation can provide a better understanding of the region s precipitation characteristics atmospheric circulations transport evaporated moisture from local and external locations and precipitate it in the target region thus playing an essential role in the global and regional hydrological cycles li et al 2021 van der ent et al 2010 yang et al 2022a moisture tracking is an efficient method to understand regional precipitation before the 21st century several scholars used simple bulk methods or conceptualizations of hydrological cycle models to estimate the moisture recycled within a target region benton et al 1950 brubaker et al 1993 lettau et al 1979 trenberth 1999 however the results obtained in these studies are only a rough estimation and are subject to several assumptions over a large region at the beginning of the 21st century several studies focused on recycling along a streamline but have not yet provided a reliable estimation in real world cases lintner et al 2013 schaefli et al 2012 stable isotopes of water δ 2 h and δ 18 o are good indicators for identifying the evaporation source of precipitation risi et al 2013 salati et al 1979 tian et al 2007 however spatiotemporally consistent isotope records are expensive and not available easily which limits their application with the abundance of multi source data such as remote sensing and reanalysis numerically tracking atmospheric moisture has become feasible bosilovich and schubert 2002 dominguez et al 2006 keys et al 2012 a typical example is the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers developed by van der ent 2014 the offline wam 2layers model consisting of only two well chosen layers can yield nearly identical results to a highly advanced online tracking model with a much lower computational cost van der ent et al 2013 the hengduan mountain region hmr full list of abbreviations see appendix a is located in the transitional zone between the high altitude qinghai tibet plateau and the low lying middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and is one of the global hotspots of climate change and anthropogenic influence fan et al 2009 yin et al 2020 the hmr has a complex terrain and dense population along with rich resources thus secondary disasters such as fires landslides and debris flows caused by drought and floods can significantly impact the social economy of hmr li et al 2022a yang et al 2022b therefore it is essential to clarify the reasons for the fluctuations and changes in precipitation several studies have analyzed the moisture sources for the precipitation in the hmr huang and cui 2015a 2015b analyzed the primary moisture sources affecting the precipitation in sichuan province and the extreme precipitation events caused by abnormal moisture sources chen and xu 2016 analyzed the spatiotemporal structure of the moisture sources feeding the heavy precipitation events in the sichuan basin based on the wam 2layers model zhang et al 2017 and zhang 2020 not only tracked the moisture changes in the atmosphere resulting in the drying trend in southwest china but also analyzed the variations in the moisture sources in the wet and dry years nevertheless these studies mainly focused on the variations in the moisture source regions and the moisture quantity at annual or seasonal scales in general the sources and transport of moisture are regulated by climate and land atmosphere interactions however none of these studies were linked to external sources and local moisture recycling resulting from global climate change and anthropogenic influences several studies conclude that regional precipitation is influenced by the el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and north atlantic oscillation nao abram et al 2022 2008 du et al 2020 xiao and cui 2021 zhang et al 2022 for example xiao and cui 2021 identified the seasonal moisture resources using wam 2layers they investigated the influence of climate indices on different types of seasonal precipitation in the pearl river delta china in addition the changes in land surface characteristics can alter the contribution of local evaporation to precipitation li et al 2021 pranindita et al 2022 for example li et al 2021 used the wam 2layers model and concluded that constructing the three gorges reservoir may affect local recycling and thus alter the precipitation patterns over the past 40 years the hmr region has undergone significant changes in land use and cover lucc primarily driven by the implementation of various national projects such as the returning farmland to forest policy 3 north shelter forest program and construction of reservoirs zheng et al 2016 notably the region is now home to six of china s top 10 mega reservoirs all built after 2000 lehner et al 2011 these anthropogenic factors can have profound impacts on the subsurface affecting terrestrial water storage tws components such as groundwater surface water and soil moisture which in turn influences the regional water vapor cycle therefore it is important to understand how the anthropogenic factors affect precipitation and moisture availability in the hmr based on long term numerical moisture tracking this study aims to investigate the potential mechanisms that drive the changes in the precipitation in the hmr in terms of external moisture contribution and local recycling from the following aspects 1 identify the annual and seasonal precipitationshed of the hmr 2 detect the difference in the moisture sources and transport pathways during extreme wet and dry years 3 quantify the influences of climate indices enso iod and nao on the variations in the annual and seasonal moisture contributions and 4 investigate the potential impacts of anthropogenic factors on local moisture recycling 2 materials 2 1 study area the hmr bounded by 24 7 34 1 n and 96 6 104 7 e is located in the transitional zone between the high altitude qinghai tibet plateau and the low lying middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the chinese mainland the landform of the hmr is significant and its terrain is complex and diverse it is composed of mountains hills plains basins and plateaus with a total area of 436 300 km2 the elevation decreases from northwest to southeast with an altitude range of 351 7417 m fig 1 the hmr is home to several major rivers including the jinsha lancang and nu rivers these rivers run parallel to each other from east to west while flowing from north to south advantaged natural and geographical conditions such as abundant water resources and natural water level drops have led to the intensive construction of artificial reservoirs and dams in this region especially after 2000 notably six of china s top 10 large reservoirs are located in the hmr the hmr has a typical monsoon climate influenced not only by the east asian monsoon from the western pacific but also the south asian monsoon from the bay of bengal and the indian ocean along with the tibetan plateau monsoon and westerlies thus the hmr presents an apparent seasonal and vertical climate zone influenced by various monsoons and complex terrains 2 2 observational data the forcing data of the wam 2layers model were derived from the newest era5 reanalysis products hersbach et al 2020 including precipitation evaporation surface pressure total column moisture vertically integrated moisture fluxes at a single level and specific humidity u velocity and v velocity at 17 pressure levels 10 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 825 850 875 900 925 950 975 and 1000 hpa to ensure the accuracy of water vapor tracking and reduce the amount of data almost all the variables were downloaded at 6 h intervals precipitation and evaporation were downloaded at 1 h intervals the era5 data from 1980 to 2020 having a spatial resolution of 1 were used in this study li et al 2021 2022b conducted an extensive evaluation of different reanalysis datasets i e era interim modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 for tracking moisture using the wam 2layers model their study revealed that different input data led to consistent spatial coverage of precipitationsheds apart from these findings era5 has been found to be more suitable for moisture tracking studies in china and has been widely utilized compared to other reanalysis products li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 zhang 2020 to further verify the accuracy of the simulated precipitation from the era5 reanalysis we used the ground based 0 5 gridded daily precipitation dataset from the china meteorological administration cma hereinafter referred to as cmagrid zhu et al 2018 zhao and zhu 2015 in addition the bi monthly multivariate enso index mei v2 a

lucc data from the center 1980 2000 and 2020 these data can be used to study the long term change state of land use with a high accuracy rate of local categories and a qualitative accuracy rate of more than 95 liu et al 2014 the land types were divided into six categories cropland woodland grassland water build up land and unused land see appendix b fig b1 furthermore the tws anomalies twsa were obtained from the grace satellite which detects changes in the earth s gravitational field by measuring the distance between twin satellites tapley et al 2004 three processing centers the geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz the center for space research at the university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl provided monthly grace solutions with each center using different parameters and solution strategies swenson and wahr 2006 this study utilized five twsa products from 2002 to 2020 1 three spherical harmonic coefficients from csr gfz and jpl 2 jpl mascon solutions and 3 csr mascon solutions 3 methodology 3 1 water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers an offline eulerian numerical atmospheric moisture tracking model the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers van der ent 2014 van der ent et al 2010 was applied to track tagged moisture in the hmr backward tracking was used to track the volume of evaporation that entered a column of air the output for backward tracking the spatial distribution of atmospheric moisture or evaporation which precipitates in a predefined region hmr in this study is defined as precipitationshed keys 2016 keys et al 2012 refer to fig b2 for a schematic diagram illustrating the precipitationshed and moisture exchange within a single column of atmosphere for the wam 2layers the grids with higher values that sum up to 90 of the tracked moisture were included in the precipitationshed in this study the model assumed that the precipitation in a sink region hmr equaled the sum of the tracked evaporation in the precipitationshed therefore the governing equation was the atmospheric water balance following the global scale test illustrated in van der ent et al 2013 a layer around 813 hpa pressure level was set to divide the vertical column air into two well chosen layers top and bottom the separation pressure was applicable in this region li et al 2021 the formula used is as follows 1 m b t m b u x m b v y e b p b ε b f v b where mb represents the tagged atmospheric moisture in the bottom layer t indicates time and u and v denote the wind components in the zonal x and meridional y directions respectively eb and pb indicate the evaporation entering the bottom layer and the precipitation removed from the bottom layer respectively ε b is the residual and f v b indicates the vertical moisture transport between the bottom and top layers the total evaporation of each grid in the precipitationshed was denoted as etotal the evaporation transport from the atmosphere to the end as precipitation in the hmr was defined as tracked moisture etracked the moisture contribution mm was defined as the total volume of tracked moisture in a particular region to the hmr etracked region the moisture contribution ratio was defined as the ratio of the total volume of tracked moisture in a particular region to the total precipitation in the hmr phmr i e cratio etracked region phmr unit local recycling was defined as the ratio of contributed evaporation in the hmr etracked hmr relative to precipitation in the hmr phmr i e rratio etracked hmr phmr unit the wam 2layers were valuable for moisture tracking over long time series to reduce the downside of numerical errors during the eulerian method in this study all variables were resampled into a minor time step 10 min in addition a 30 day back tracking time was set to ensure that the vast majority of tagged moisture 90 fell back to the ground surface as a result the model produced daily gridded moisture contributions for the entire tracking domain although only monthly contributions were analyzed in this study 3 2 analyzing influences of climate indices on moisture contribution the climate indices enso iod and nao are time series of the leading combined empirical orthogonal function eof of several different variables such as the sea level pressure sea surface temperature and zonal and meridional components of the surface wind to investigate the influence of the climate indices on the moisture contribution in different source regions the eof was used to extract the temporal patterns of the tracked moisture from different moisture source regions on an annual and seasonal scale the calculations were performed using the matlab package climate data toolbox using the following equation 2 e t r a c k r e g i o n t s c 1 n eof c s pc c t the eof can decompose the continuous space time tracked moisture e t r a c k r e g i o n t s into several patterns c with spatial eof s and temporal pc t patterns hannachi et al 2007 xiao and cui 2021 3 3 evaluating precipitation data the standardized precipitation index spi is widely used to characterize meteorological droughts for a range of timescales guttman 1999 hayes et al 2011 trenberth et al 2014 different precipitation data vary significantly in time and space therefore comparing them on different spatial and temporal scales using precipitation directly is difficult the spi can be used to assess whether a data product reflects the trends and extremes in the observed precipitation for example li et al 2021 estimated the era interim using spi to analyze precipitation trends before forcing the moisture tracking model dimensionless spi values are typically used to describe drought intensity therefore in this study the comparison between era5 and cmagrid precipitation was based on the spi index the cmagrid precipitation data was resampled using a bilinear approach to match the 1 spatial resolution of the era5 data the precipitation followed an asymmetric frequency distribution the spi algorithms adopted the gamma distribution probability to transform the precipitation data into gaussian equivalents the spi value was calculated by normalizing the transformed precipitation using the following equation 3 spi p i p i 1 n p i p 2 n 1 where p i represents the transformed daily or monthly precipitation p represents the transformed average precipitation the main focus of this study is to analyze changes in moisture transport across different seasons and years with the month as the fundamental unit for calculating these variations as such we have used a monthly evaluation scale for precipitation in this analysis calculations were performed using the matlab package climate data toolbox 4 results 4 1 evaluation and variation of precipitation data the seasonal and annual precipitation time series estimated from the era5 and cmagrid data are shown in fig 2 a 2e the fluctuations and variations in the era5 spi were consistent p 0 05 with the observed data at both the seasonal and annual scales along with the r correlation coefficient values higher than 0 67 although there are slight differences in the trends of total annual precipitation in spring and summer between the two sets of precipitation data the era5 precipitation data generally depict the characteristics of hmr precipitation including the drought index over a long time scale the differences observed may be attributed to the limited station interpolation in the cmagrids data or the resampling process despite this the era5 precipitation data are suitable for studying moisture changes in the study region the precipitation over the hmr portrayed a decreasing trend in the seasonal scales especially in autumn and winter with a decreasing rate linear trends of era5 p 0 05 of 1 08 mm yr yr and 0 61 mm yr yr respectively fig 2c and 2d summer precipitation was the main contributor to annual precipitation notably the average precipitation in summer 725 mm was more than twice that in other seasons 307 331 and 99 mm for spring autumn and winter respectively summer precipitation was within the 95 confidence interval for almost all years with extreme precipitation in 1998 927 mm and extreme drought in 2006 593 mm and 2011 589 mm the decreasing trend over this region is further illustrated by the time series and spatial distribution of the linear trends in annual precipitation in fig 2e 2f the era5 precipitation over the hrm portrayed a decreasing trend annually with a decrease rate of 3 02 mm yr yr fig 2e during 1980 2020 the hmr was dominated by a significant decrease in the annual precipitation p 0 05 during 1980 2020 especially in the southern low altitude regions fig 2f in addition there was a significant difference in precipitation between 1980 and 2000 and 2000 2020 fig 2e with the average precipitation of era5 over the hmr in 1980 2000 being 96 mm higher than that in 2001 2020 based on moisture tracking we investigated the potential mechanisms that drove the decreasing trend of the precipitation in the hmr from the following three aspects the moisture source of annual and seasonal precipitation in the hmr section 4 1 contribution of moisture sources during the wet and dry years section 4 2 and potential mechanisms that drive the change in internal and external moisture section 5 4 2 moisture source of annual and seasonal precipitation in hmr based on the era5 reanalysis data the annual and seasonal precipitationsheds in the hrm were identified using the wam 2layers fig 3 the moisture evaporated from the shaded regions contributed to the accumulated annual and seasonal precipitation in the hmr fig 3a portrays that the grids with high contributions are in and around the target hmr with an annual moisture contribution of more than 200 mm yr with the target hmr as the center the hot spot diffusion was irregular with respect to the moisture transport distance the sum of the tracked internal and external moisture contributions to the annual precipitation in the target hmr reached 92 66 in addition to moisture loss and residual of the calculation process in the wam 2layers the precipitationsheds varied in terms of the responses of different types of precipitation during different seasons fig 3b 3e the extent of the area with a moisture contribution greater than 2 mm season was smaller in spring autumn and winter than in summer because of the larger precipitation in summer than in other seasons fig 3a portrays that the precipitation in the hmr is influenced by the westerlies and south asian and east asian monsoons the contribution of moisture to the hmr could be divided into three major external source regions the southwest region sw sourced from the indian ocean eastern region e sourced from the western north pacific ocean and northwest region nw sourced from the qinghai tibet plateau central asia and southern europe as shown in fig 3a and table 1 the evaporated moisture of the sw transport from the east coast of australia across the indian ocean and along the east coast of africa eventually contributed to the hmr via the arabian sea india and the bay of bengal the tracked moisture in the sw dominated the annual precipitation of the hmr accounting for approximately 45 75 of the total the evaporated moisture of the nw was continuously transported by stationary flows from the qinghai tibet plateau central asia and southern europe accounting for approximately 22 70 of the total moisture the evaporated moisture of e was transported by the high frequency transient eddies from the western north pacific ocean accounting for approximately 7 45 of the total local recycling in the hmr was integral and contributed to a high moisture density fig 3a accounting for approximately 16 76 of the annual target precipitation the regional moisture contribution varied in different seasons as shown in fig 4 the moisture contribution during the summer was dominant in all regions except for the local moisture contribution of the hmr being higher than that of the nw in summer the order of moisture contribution in other seasons was sw nw hmr e therefore the precipitation in the target hmr was mainly sourced from the westerlies and the south asian monsoon local recycling in the hmr contributed to considerable moisture in the summer in addition the transient eddies over e were more prominent in summer and autumn than in spring and winter as shown in fig 3b 3e with contribution ratios of 8 20 and 10 65 and 3 30 and 4 13 respectively the statistical analysis of the moisture contribution trends in spring summer autumn and winter and annually over different source regions from 1980 to 2020 is shown in table 1 the moisture contributions in the nw and sw portrayed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at the annual scale with gradient rates of 0 92 mm yr yr and 2 08 mm yr yr from 1980 to 2020 respectively although the gradient rates of the hmr and e were positive they could not compensate for the overall decreasing trend this result was consistent with fig 2e in section 4 1 in which the annual precipitation portrayed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at a rate of 3 02 mm yr yr in addition the decreasing trend in autumn and winter was more prominent than that in spring and summer except for e the moisture contribution in the hmr nw and sw portrayed a prominent decreasing trend p 0 05 the decreasing trend was also consistent with fig 2c 2d in section 4 1 in which the autumn and winter precipitation portrayed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 with a rate of 1 08 mm yr yr and 0 61 mm yr yr respectively generally the two primary moisture source regions nw and sw portrayed decreasing trends on annual and seasonal scales the local moisture contribution of the hmr portrayed an increasing trend except in winter additionally the moisture contribution to e portrayed an increasing trend in all seasons except spring 4 3 contribution of moisture source during wet years and dry years the wet 1998 and dry 2006 and 2011 years were selected as described in section 4 1 the difference in the moisture contribution in summer obtained from the wet 1998 and dry 2006 and 2011 years subtracted with the average value for 1980 2000 is shown in fig 5 in the wet year 1998 the moisture contributions of hmr sw and nw were higher than the multi year average whereas that of e was lower than the multi year average as shown in fig 5a the distributions of moisture contribution anomalies over the hmr 3 mm sw 136 mm and nw 26 mm were dominated by positive values while that of e 14 mm was dominated by negative values in the wet year westerly moisture transport over the qinghai tibet plateau was enhanced accompanied by more moisture from the nw the southwest monsoon moisture transport improved during the study period thus driving the arabian sea india bay of bengal and even the indo china peninsula of the sw contributing to more moisture an anticyclone in the sw transported moisture from southeast asia located southwest to the target hmr notably the moisture contribution at the eastern edge of the anticyclone was less than the multi year average as described in section 4 2 the moisture contribution to e was impacted by the transient eddy moisture from the western north pacific ocean the moisture transport decreased in wet years in addition the moisture evaporated from the local region and adjacent southwest increased during the wet years generally the precipitation increase in 1998 was mainly due to the strengthened moisture contribution from the nw sw and hmr especially in the sw region fig 5a and 5e in the dry years 2006 and 2011 the summer precipitation in 2006 and 2011 was lower than the lower limit of the 95 confidence interval fig 2b from the distribution of differences in fig 5b the negatively changing grids were mainly located in the sw 110 mm and nw 24 mm in 2006 the positively changing grids were located in the e hmr and eastern edge of the anticyclone of sw the distribution was opposite to that of the wet year 1998 in the dry year of 2011 almost all grids changed negatively except for several broken patches fig 5c however the weakened moisture contribution in sw 66 mm in 2011 was less than that in 2006 fig 5f 5 g the summer precipitation in 2006 was less than that in 2011 fig 2b generally the moisture changes during the wet and the two dry years portrayed different patterns the wet 1998 and dry 2006 year presented opposite weakened and strengthened trends in different contribution regions the two dry years also portrayed opposite characteristics in the eastern marginal area of the precipitationshed additionally we selected three normal years 1980 2000 and 2020 as reference years for comparison see appendix b fig b3 and it is apparent that the difference in moisture contribution anomaly during normal years is considerably smaller than that during years with extreme precipitation events 5 discussion 5 1 influences of climate indices on external moisture contribution of hmr huang and cui 2015a found that the main sources of moisture for precipitation in the hrm are the surrounding areas of the qinghai tibet plateau the bay of bengal and the southeast monsoon region with a surge of moisture from the bay of bengal during heavy precipitation events and a decline in moisture input from the peripheral zones of the qinghai tibet plateau our investigation also revealed the significant contribution of the southeast monsoon zone to precipitation in the southwest which is consistent with zhang and wu 2021 additionally this study found that the main source of moisture for extreme precipitation in 2008 was the southwest monsoon region section 4 3 shows that the moisture changes during the wet 2008 and two dry years 2006 and 2011 exhibited different patterns with opposite characteristics in the eastern marginal area of the precipitationshed li et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 reported that in 2006 and 2011 a strong western pacific subtropical high moved abnormally northward and westward causing descending motion over southwest china and suppressing moisture transport from the bay of bengal and south china sea however the behavior of the western pacific subtropical high differed in 2006 and 2011 with a westward stretch in 2006 but an eastward withdrawal in 2011 zhang 2020 which is consistent with the moisture distribution observed in our study however none of the studies comprehensively analyzed the effect of various climate indices on the moisture contribution to different seasons and extreme precipitation events the influences of enso iod and nao on the first principal component time series hereinafter referred to as fpc explaining the primary variance of precipitationshed of different types of annual and seasonal external moisture contributions were investigated for the annual and seasonal moisture contributions in each precipitationshed region table 2 portrayed that the fpc in some regions was significantly correlated with the climate indices for the annual moisture contribution the fpc of e s moisture contribution was significantly positively correlated with the enso whereas that of the nw s moisture contribution was significantly negatively correlated with the nao according to the moisture contribution to precipitation shown in fig 3a we could infer that the annual evaporation contribution in the western north pacific ocean enhanced during the positive enso phase conversely the annual evaporation contribution from the qinghai tibet plateau central asia and southern europe decreased during the negative nao phase which in turn partially decreased the moisture contribution combined with other climate indices in nw with a total gradient of 0 92 mm yr yr table 1 although the indian ocean was the central moisture contribution region that targets the hmr the iod had no significant influence on the annual moisture contribution for seasonal moisture contribution the fpc of the moisture contribution of the hmr was significantly positively correlated with the enso in summer and winter table 2 thus local recycling improved in summer and winter during the positive enso phase which increased the summer and winter precipitation in the target region the fpc of the nw s moisture contribution was significantly negatively correlated with the enso and iod in spring and autumn the moisture contribution of the nw also reduced during the negative nao phase in the spring thus the external moisture from the nw reduced in spring and autumn during the negative enso iod and nao phases which in turn decreases the spring and autumn precipitation in the target region this result was consistent with the decreasing trend of moisture contribution in the nw as shown in table 1 notably sw was the primary moisture source region of the hmr and its influence on the climate indices was more complicated owing to its wide range and rich moisture sources the fpc of the sw s moisture contribution was significantly positively correlated with the enso in spring and winter positively correlated with the iod in spring and negatively correlated with the iod in summer as shown in fig 3 the moisture contribution was more prominent in summer and autumn the fpc of e s moisture contribution was negatively correlated with the iod in summer and significantly negatively correlated with the enso and iod in autumn the annual time series of these climate indices from 1980 to 2020 is shown in fig 6 a the performances of the enso nao and iod in extreme wet 1998 and drought 2006 and 2011 years were investigated fig 6b 6d from the enso time series shown in fig 6b we could observe that a severe el niño event occurred in 1997 1998 and a severe la niña event occurred in 2011 notably china experienced massive flooding along the yangtze river in the south central regions during the summer of 1998 various studies have shown that in china massive flooding occurred in 1998 because of a prolonged and strong el niño effect lau and weng 2001 tong et al 2006 as shown in fig 6b the intense el niño event ended in may which was consistent with the positive correlation between the sw moisture contribution and enso index in the winter and spring seasons as shown in table 2 the central and eastern pacific heat up and updrafts appear the cooling of the western pacific weakened the updraft and led to the emergence of downdrafts resulting in increased precipitation in the western pacific during el niño the anomalous anticyclone over the philippines transferred moisture from the tropical pacific ocean to the hmr through the south china sea zhang et al 2022 in addition the negative phases of the nao and iod in 1998 reduced the source of moisture fig 6c 6d but did not play a leading role in the precipitation of the entire hmr therefore we could conclude that the strengthening of the primary source of moisture in sw likely triggered the heavy precipitation in the hmr in 1998 additionally a strong la niña event occurred in 2011 significantly reducing the pacific ocean s moisture contribution and leading to a severe drought in the hmr fig 5g in addition the nao portrayed a negative phase in 2011 fig 6c which may have enhanced the joint effects of la niña and aggravated the degree of the drought the positive phase of iod in 2011 portrayed little enhancement in moisture contribution with the maximum value being 1 fig 6d unlike the drought in 2011 no significant el niño or la niña events occurred in 2006 as shown in fig 6b 6c the negative phases of enso and nao before august 2006 combined to intensify the drought degree of the hmr in spring and summer however a new el niño event occurred in august 2006 in addition a positive phase iod event occurred in 2006 and the cold sst anomaly in the eastern tropical indian ocean triggered an anomalous anticyclone southeast of the indian continent transporting moisture in the tropical indian ocean through the bay of bengal to the south of mainland china zhang et al 2022 the enhanced joint effects of the enso and iod increased the precipitation in the autumn and winter of the hmr in 2006 fig 2 and fig 6 in addition to the influence of el niño and la niña events the precipitation of the hmr may portrayed a synergistic strengthening or neutralizing effect for all the climatic indexes 5 2 potential impacts of lucc on moisture derived from local recycling local moisture recycling occupies a non negligible part accounting for about 16 76 of the total annual precipitation table 1 the temporal change in moisture from the hmr local recycling unit and its contribution local contribution unit mm to annual precipitation in the hmr before and after 2000 is shown in fig 7 the positively changing grids are located in the e region hmr and the eastern edge of the anticyclone of the sw generally the average local contribution and recycling ratio after 2000 were higher than those during 1980 2000 the local recycling ratio and local contribution volume from 1980 to 2000 portrayed an apparent upward trend with a growth rate of 0 15 yr and 1 22 mm yr respectively on the contrary the local recycling ratio and local contribution volume from 2001 to 2020 portrayed a downward trend with a reduced rate of 0 07 yr and 0 96 mm yr respectively studies have shown that there are critical links between lucc and local moisture recycling li et al 2021 pranindita et al 2022 the underlying surface conditions affect the surface temperature surface albedo and other climatic factors which in turn affect the evaporation intensity air water saturation and sinking water vapor jiang et al 2021 for example in tropical and desert areas the recycling ratio is high whereas water vapor sinks and saturates in areas that have more water cover van der ent 2014 the main types of land use and land cover changes in the hmr during 1980 2000 and 2001 2020 are listed in table 3 spatial distribution map of lucc refer to fig b1 in the past 40 years policies projects and significant events affected the lucc land cover changes in southwest china cropland coverage increased by 2 62 from 1980 to 2000 because of population growth and the increased demand for food in contrast woodland areas were reduced 0 71 because of the need for productivity and deforestation table 3 since the mid 1980 s china has enacted a series of grassland and forest laws and launched the 3 north shelter forest program project however these laws and plans are still in the early stages since the beginning of the 21st century the forest area increased dramatically 0 83 due to the policies aiming at converting farmlands back to forests the establishment of the sanjiangyuan nature reserve and the implementation of closing mountains for forest cultivation in addition many water conservancy projects such as the xiaowan and jinping reservoirs were built in the study area between 2001 and 2020 increasing the water surface area of the study area by 39 22 according to the global reservoir and dam database grand approximately 36 large artificial reservoirs 0 1 km3 are located mainly in the southeast region fig 1 of the study area lehner et al 2011 some studies have revealed that the expansion of the woodland and water surface tended to decrease the surface temperature increase regional humidity enhance the descending motion of air and alter the regional atmospheric circulation under some special synoptic conditions jiang et al 2021 li et al 2021 miller et al 2005 wang et al 2020 therefore the weakened local recycling after 2000 may be linked to the enhancements in the sinking air and moisture divergence in the lower atmosphere resulting from surface cooling the spatial distribution of local recycling conforms to this hypothesis the moisture contribution in the southeastern reservoir distribution area fig 1 was lower than that in the northwest fig 7a 7c after 2000 woodland and water surface expansion tended to weaken local recycling in the future the decreasing trend of local recycling will likely intensify owing to large scale artificial reservoir construction and surface changes caused by impoundment in addition the alterations in subsurface characteristics along with the impacts of climate change can induce changes in groundwater and soil water content in the study area leading to alterations in the tws within hmr the western region of the study area portrays a substantial declining trend in twsa from 2002 to 2020 with a maximum reduction rate of 10 cm yr as shown in fig b4 a this trend is attributed to rising temperatures and decreased precipitation particularly in the indian monsoon dominated himalayas as documented by yao et al 2012 furthermore leakage from the northwest region of india has been identified as a significant contributor to the grace signals as the groundwater depletion persists in this area as suggested by chen et al 2014 lapworth et al 2015 overall the twsa within the study area demonstrates a notable declining trend with a rate of 1 15 cm yr fig b4 b which is similar to the trend observed in the local recycling fig 7 c the results reveal a positive correlation between the monthly variations in twsa and the monthly local recycling rate with a correlation coefficient of 0 3 though the correlation was not significance in 2021 four super large reservoirs in the study area were completed and put into operation namely baihetan xiluodu wudongde and xiangjiaba at present six of the 10 largest reservoirs in china are located in the study area the impoundment of these reservoirs will significantly improve the water surface coverage of the study area and thus enhance the water vapor subsidence in the region however the precipitation in the study area in the future in addition to the local recycling changes caused by the underlying surface climate indexes will also affect the internal and external moisture sources thus the process is complex and changeable and requires further discussion and consideration 5 3 uncertainties of moisture tracking the wam 2layer dynamically reconstructs moisture transport and tracks tagged moisture in the eulerian grid uncertainties in moisture source analyses mainly stem from input reanalysis products but studies li et al 2021 2022b show that precipitation biases do not significantly impact identification or quantification of contributions additionally many studies have verified the excellent performance of era5 for water vapor tracking and climate analysis in china or globally liu et al 2021 xiao and cui 2021 zhang and wu 2021 in this study era5 reanalysis data was used as input and cmagrid data verified its consistency with measurements a difference in precipitation trend between the datasets in spring and summer may be due to various factors fig 1 including limited site interpolation of cmagrid in complex southwest mountainous areas however the two datasets showed significant correlations across seasons and interannual variability and high consistency in extreme precipitation characteristics factors affecting extreme precipitation analysis were not significant but may affect moisture contribution in different seasons more accurate data in the future would be ideal for analysis 6 conclusions due to global climate change extreme climate events in the hmr have increased significantly based on precipitation evaporation and various atmospheric vertical layer data in the era5 reanalysis we investigated the long term 1980 2020 moisture sources that contributed to the annual and seasonal precipitation change in the hmr we identified the annual and seasonal precipitationsheds in the hmr based on the backtracking of the precipitation in the region to its source the contribution of moisture to the hmr precipitation in representative wet and dry years was further evaluated in addition we explored the potential impacts of climate indices and lucc on the hmr based on the external moisture contribution and internal local moisture recycling the main conclusions of this study are as follows the identified precipitationsheds in the hmr varied in response to different types of precipitation during different seasons the extent of the areas having moisture contributions greater than 2 mm season was smaller in spring autumn and winter than in summer because of the larger precipitation in summer the decrease in the annual precipitation could be mainly attributed to the reduced moisture supply from the extended sw and nw portraying a decreasing trend of 2 08 mm yr yr and 0 92 mm yr yr respectively the precipitation in the target hmr mainly originated from the westerlies and south asian monsoon the two primary moisture source regions nw and sw portrayed significant decreasing trends at the annual and seasonal scales the local moisture contribution of the hmr presented an increasing trend in all seasons except winter the moisture contribution to e portrayed an increasing trend in all seasons except spring we compared the summer moisture source differences between the extremely dry wet and multi year averages the precipitation increase in the wet year was mainly due to the strengthened moisture contribution of nw 26 mm sw 136 mm and hmr 3 mm particularly in sw the moisture contribution changed during the wet year and the two drought years indicated different patterns the wet year 1998 and the dry year 2006 presented opposite weakened and strengthened trends in different regions the two drought years also portrayed opposite characteristics in the eastern marginal area of the precipitationshed the influences of the enso iod and nao on the leading first patterns explaining the primary variance in the precipitationshed of different types of annual and seasonal external moisture contributions were investigated notably the strengthening of the primary moisture source in the sw due to the el niño may have triggered the heavy precipitation of the hmr in 1998 the reduction in the primary moisture source in the sw due to la niña may have triggered an extreme drought event in the hmr in 2011 we could conclude that the extreme drought event in 2006 may have been caused by the synergistic effects of the enso iod and nao in conclusion this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that drive changes in precipitation in the hmr and highlights the importance of effective water resource management disaster prevention and mitigation the findings of this study can guide future research on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies in the region however the study also warns that the trend of decreasing local moisture recycling in the hmr may intensify due to large scale artificial reservoir construction and underlying impoundment surface changes caused by lucc therefore more attention needs to be paid to the potential impacts of these factors on the water cycle and hydrological processes in the hmr data availability statement all the data used in this study are publicly available

1929,climate change and anthropogenic factors have resulted in intense and frequent droughts and floods in the hengduan mountain region hmr exploring the source supply of evaporation and transportation processes for the precipitation in the hmr can help us understand regional precipitation characteristics and provide valuable insights regarding effective water resource management disaster prevention and mitigation based on the era5 reanalysis data we identified the annual and seasonal precipitationsheds of the hmr using the water accounting model 2layer to investigate the potential mechanisms that drive the changes in the precipitation in the hmr in terms of external moisture contribution and local recycling the identified precipitationshed in the hmr varied in response to different types of precipitation during the different seasons the decrease in the annual precipitation was mainly attributed to the reduced moisture supply from the extended southwest sw and northwest nw regions portraying a decreasing trend of 2 08 mm yr yr and 0 92 mm yr yr respectively the detected difference in the moisture sources and transport pathways in terms of the response of wet and dry precipitation years can improve our understanding of the moisture patterns of wet and dry years we could conclude that the increase in moisture from the sw regions due to el niño may have triggered the heavy precipitation in the hmr in 1998 additionally the reduction in moisture from the sw regions due to la niña may have triggered an extreme drought in the hmr in 2011 notably woodland and water surface expansion tend to weaken local recycling 0 07 yr after 2000 in the future the decreasing trend of local recycling will likely be intensified owing to large scale artificial reservoir construction and the surface changes caused by underlying impoundment keywords hengduan mountain region moisture source climate change wam 2layers anthropogenic factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change and anthropogenic activities are contributing to more intense and frequent extreme droughts and floods on global and regional scales chiang et al 2021 donat et al 2016 tang 2020 thackeray et al 2022 the intensifying global water cycle and more frequent water extremes are results of the synergistic impact of natural and human induced changes in many regions xiong et al 2022 for example in the chao phraya river basin in thailand the hydroclimatic extremes are primarily triggered by the variations in precipitation and further amplified by the subsequent water storage and abstraction abhishek et al 2021 unsustainable groundwater extraction in india has also contributed to water scarcity and drought conditions in many regions abhishek and kinouchi 2021 looking ahead projections suggest that climate change will further exacerbate this trend with more frequent and intense water extremes in many regions around the world pokhrel et al 2021 notably identifying the source supply of evapotranspiration and transportation processes for a specific region s precipitation can provide a better understanding of the region s precipitation characteristics atmospheric circulations transport evaporated moisture from local and external locations and precipitate it in the target region thus playing an essential role in the global and regional hydrological cycles li et al 2021 van der ent et al 2010 yang et al 2022a moisture tracking is an efficient method to understand regional precipitation before the 21st century several scholars used simple bulk methods or conceptualizations of hydrological cycle models to estimate the moisture recycled within a target region benton et al 1950 brubaker et al 1993 lettau et al 1979 trenberth 1999 however the results obtained in these studies are only a rough estimation and are subject to several assumptions over a large region at the beginning of the 21st century several studies focused on recycling along a streamline but have not yet provided a reliable estimation in real world cases lintner et al 2013 schaefli et al 2012 stable isotopes of water δ 2 h and δ 18 o are good indicators for identifying the evaporation source of precipitation risi et al 2013 salati et al 1979 tian et al 2007 however spatiotemporally consistent isotope records are expensive and not available easily which limits their application with the abundance of multi source data such as remote sensing and reanalysis numerically tracking atmospheric moisture has become feasible bosilovich and schubert 2002 dominguez et al 2006 keys et al 2012 a typical example is the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers developed by van der ent 2014 the offline wam 2layers model consisting of only two well chosen layers can yield nearly identical results to a highly advanced online tracking model with a much lower computational cost van der ent et al 2013 the hengduan mountain region hmr full list of abbreviations see appendix a is located in the transitional zone between the high altitude qinghai tibet plateau and the low lying middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and is one of the global hotspots of climate change and anthropogenic influence fan et al 2009 yin et al 2020 the hmr has a complex terrain and dense population along with rich resources thus secondary disasters such as fires landslides and debris flows caused by drought and floods can significantly impact the social economy of hmr li et al 2022a yang et al 2022b therefore it is essential to clarify the reasons for the fluctuations and changes in precipitation several studies have analyzed the moisture sources for the precipitation in the hmr huang and cui 2015a 2015b analyzed the primary moisture sources affecting the precipitation in sichuan province and the extreme precipitation events caused by abnormal moisture sources chen and xu 2016 analyzed the spatiotemporal structure of the moisture sources feeding the heavy precipitation events in the sichuan basin based on the wam 2layers model zhang et al 2017 and zhang 2020 not only tracked the moisture changes in the atmosphere resulting in the drying trend in southwest china but also analyzed the variations in the moisture sources in the wet and dry years nevertheless these studies mainly focused on the variations in the moisture source regions and the moisture quantity at annual or seasonal scales in general the sources and transport of moisture are regulated by climate and land atmosphere interactions however none of these studies were linked to external sources and local moisture recycling resulting from global climate change and anthropogenic influences several studies conclude that regional precipitation is influenced by the el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and north atlantic oscillation nao abram et al 2022 2008 du et al 2020 xiao and cui 2021 zhang et al 2022 for example xiao and cui 2021 identified the seasonal moisture resources using wam 2layers they investigated the influence of climate indices on different types of seasonal precipitation in the pearl river delta china in addition the changes in land surface characteristics can alter the contribution of local evaporation to precipitation li et al 2021 pranindita et al 2022 for example li et al 2021 used the wam 2layers model and concluded that constructing the three gorges reservoir may affect local recycling and thus alter the precipitation patterns over the past 40 years the hmr region has undergone significant changes in land use and cover lucc primarily driven by the implementation of various national projects such as the returning farmland to forest policy 3 north shelter forest program and construction of reservoirs zheng et al 2016 notably the region is now home to six of china s top 10 mega reservoirs all built after 2000 lehner et al 2011 these anthropogenic factors can have profound impacts on the subsurface affecting terrestrial water storage tws components such as groundwater surface water and soil moisture which in turn influences the regional water vapor cycle therefore it is important to understand how the anthropogenic factors affect precipitation and moisture availability in the hmr based on long term numerical moisture tracking this study aims to investigate the potential mechanisms that drive the changes in the precipitation in the hmr in terms of external moisture contribution and local recycling from the following aspects 1 identify the annual and seasonal precipitationshed of the hmr 2 detect the difference in the moisture sources and transport pathways during extreme wet and dry years 3 quantify the influences of climate indices enso iod and nao on the variations in the annual and seasonal moisture contributions and 4 investigate the potential impacts of anthropogenic factors on local moisture recycling 2 materials 2 1 study area the hmr bounded by 24 7 34 1 n and 96 6 104 7 e is located in the transitional zone between the high altitude qinghai tibet plateau and the low lying middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the chinese mainland the landform of the hmr is significant and its terrain is complex and diverse it is composed of mountains hills plains basins and plateaus with a total area of 436 300 km2 the elevation decreases from northwest to southeast with an altitude range of 351 7417 m fig 1 the hmr is home to several major rivers including the jinsha lancang and nu rivers these rivers run parallel to each other from east to west while flowing from north to south advantaged natural and geographical conditions such as abundant water resources and natural water level drops have led to the intensive construction of artificial reservoirs and dams in this region especially after 2000 notably six of china s top 10 large reservoirs are located in the hmr the hmr has a typical monsoon climate influenced not only by the east asian monsoon from the western pacific but also the south asian monsoon from the bay of bengal and the indian ocean along with the tibetan plateau monsoon and westerlies thus the hmr presents an apparent seasonal and vertical climate zone influenced by various monsoons and complex terrains 2 2 observational data the forcing data of the wam 2layers model were derived from the newest era5 reanalysis products hersbach et al 2020 including precipitation evaporation surface pressure total column moisture vertically integrated moisture fluxes at a single level and specific humidity u velocity and v velocity at 17 pressure levels 10 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 825 850 875 900 925 950 975 and 1000 hpa to ensure the accuracy of water vapor tracking and reduce the amount of data almost all the variables were downloaded at 6 h intervals precipitation and evaporation were downloaded at 1 h intervals the era5 data from 1980 to 2020 having a spatial resolution of 1 were used in this study li et al 2021 2022b conducted an extensive evaluation of different reanalysis datasets i e era interim modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 for tracking moisture using the wam 2layers model their study revealed that different input data led to consistent spatial coverage of precipitationsheds apart from these findings era5 has been found to be more suitable for moisture tracking studies in china and has been widely utilized compared to other reanalysis products li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 zhang 2020 to further verify the accuracy of the simulated precipitation from the era5 reanalysis we used the ground based 0 5 gridded daily precipitation dataset from the china meteorological administration cma hereinafter referred to as cmagrid zhu et al 2018 zhao and zhu 2015 in addition the bi monthly multivariate enso index mei v2 a

lucc data from the center 1980 2000 and 2020 these data can be used to study the long term change state of land use with a high accuracy rate of local categories and a qualitative accuracy rate of more than 95 liu et al 2014 the land types were divided into six categories cropland woodland grassland water build up land and unused land see appendix b fig b1 furthermore the tws anomalies twsa were obtained from the grace satellite which detects changes in the earth s gravitational field by measuring the distance between twin satellites tapley et al 2004 three processing centers the geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz the center for space research at the university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl provided monthly grace solutions with each center using different parameters and solution strategies swenson and wahr 2006 this study utilized five twsa products from 2002 to 2020 1 three spherical harmonic coefficients from csr gfz and jpl 2 jpl mascon solutions and 3 csr mascon solutions 3 methodology 3 1 water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers an offline eulerian numerical atmospheric moisture tracking model the water accounting model 2layers wam 2layers van der ent 2014 van der ent et al 2010 was applied to track tagged moisture in the hmr backward tracking was used to track the volume of evaporation that entered a column of air the output for backward tracking the spatial distribution of atmospheric moisture or evaporation which precipitates in a predefined region hmr in this study is defined as precipitationshed keys 2016 keys et al 2012 refer to fig b2 for a schematic diagram illustrating the precipitationshed and moisture exchange within a single column of atmosphere for the wam 2layers the grids with higher values that sum up to 90 of the tracked moisture were included in the precipitationshed in this study the model assumed that the precipitation in a sink region hmr equaled the sum of the tracked evaporation in the precipitationshed therefore the governing equation was the atmospheric water balance following the global scale test illustrated in van der ent et al 2013 a layer around 813 hpa pressure level was set to divide the vertical column air into two well chosen layers top and bottom the separation pressure was applicable in this region li et al 2021 the formula used is as follows 1 m b t m b u x m b v y e b p b ε b f v b where mb represents the tagged atmospheric moisture in the bottom layer t indicates time and u and v denote the wind components in the zonal x and meridional y directions respectively eb and pb indicate the evaporation entering the bottom layer and the precipitation removed from the bottom layer respectively ε b is the residual and f v b indicates the vertical moisture transport between the bottom and top layers the total evaporation of each grid in the precipitationshed was denoted as etotal the evaporation transport from the atmosphere to the end as precipitation in the hmr was defined as tracked moisture etracked the moisture contribution mm was defined as the total volume of tracked moisture in a particular region to the hmr etracked region the moisture contribution ratio was defined as the ratio of the total volume of tracked moisture in a particular region to the total precipitation in the hmr phmr i e cratio etracked region phmr unit local recycling was defined as the ratio of contributed evaporation in the hmr etracked hmr relative to precipitation in the hmr phmr i e rratio etracked hmr phmr unit the wam 2layers were valuable for moisture tracking over long time series to reduce the downside of numerical errors during the eulerian method in this study all variables were resampled into a minor time step 10 min in addition a 30 day back tracking time was set to ensure that the vast majority of tagged moisture 90 fell back to the ground surface as a result the model produced daily gridded moisture contributions for the entire tracking domain although only monthly contributions were analyzed in this study 3 2 analyzing influences of climate indices on moisture contribution the climate indices enso iod and nao are time series of the leading combined empirical orthogonal function eof of several different variables such as the sea level pressure sea surface temperature and zonal and meridional components of the surface wind to investigate the influence of the climate indices on the moisture contribution in different source regions the eof was used to extract the temporal patterns of the tracked moisture from different moisture source regions on an annual and seasonal scale the calculations were performed using the matlab package climate data toolbox using the following equation 2 e t r a c k r e g i o n t

2007 xiao and cui 2021 3 3 evaluating precipitation data the standardized precipitation index spi is widely used to characterize meteorological droughts for a range of timescales guttman 1999 hayes et al 2011 trenberth et al 2014 different precipitation data vary significantly in time and space therefore comparing them on different spatial and temporal scales using precipitation directly is difficult the spi can be used to assess whether a data product reflects the trends and extremes in the observed precipitation for example li et al 2021 estimated the era interim using spi to analyze precipitation trends before forcing the moisture tracking model dimensionless spi values are typically used to describe drought intensity therefore in this study the comparison between era5 and cmagrid precipitation was based on the spi index the cmagrid precipitation data was resampled using a bilinear approach to match the 1 spatial resolution of the era5 data the precipitation followed an asymmetric frequency distribution the spi algorithms adopted the gamma distribution probability to transform the precipitation data into gaussian equivalents the spi value was calculated by normalizing the transformed precipitation using the following equation 3 spi p i p i 1 n p i p 2 n 1 where p i represents the transformed daily or monthly precipitation p represents the transformed average precipitation the main focus of this study is to analyze changes in moisture transport across different seasons and years with the month as the fundamental unit for calculating these variations as such we have used a monthly evaluation scale for precipitation in this analysis calculations were performed using the matlab package climate data toolbox 4 results 4 1 evaluation and variation of precipitation data the seasonal and annual precipitation time series estimated from the era5 and cmagrid data are shown in fig 2 a 2e the fluctuations and variations in the era5 spi were consistent p 0 05 with the observed data at both the seasonal and annual scales along with the r correlation coefficient values higher than 0 67 although there are slight differences in the trends of total annual precipitation in spring and summer between the two sets of precipitation data the era5 precipitation data generally depict the characteristics of hmr precipitation including the drought index over a long time scale the differences observed may be attributed to the limited station interpolation in the cmagrids data or the resampling process despite this the era5 precipitation data are suitable for studying moisture changes in the study region the precipitation over the hmr portrayed a decreasing trend in the seasonal scales especially in autumn and winter with a decreasing rate linear trends of era5 p 0 05 of 1 08 mm yr yr and 0 61 mm yr yr respectively fig 2c and 2d summer precipitation was the main contributor to annual precipitation notably the average precipitation in summer 725 mm was more than twice that in other seasons 307 331 and 99 mm for spring autumn and winter respectively summer precipitation was within the 95 confidence interval for almost all years with extreme precipitation in 1998 927 mm and extreme drought in 2006 593 mm and 2011 589 mm the decreasing trend over this region is further illustrated by the time series and spatial distribution of the linear trends in annual precipitation in fig 2e 2f the era5 precipitation over the hrm portrayed a decreasing trend annually with a decrease rate of 3 02 mm yr yr fig 2e during 1980 2020 the hmr was dominated by a significant decrease in the annual precipitation p 0 05 during 1980 2020 especially in the southern low altitude regions fig 2f in addition there was a significant difference in precipitation between 1980 and 2000 and 2000 2020 fig 2e with the average precipitation of era5 over the hmr in 1980 2000 being 96 mm higher than that in 2001 2020 based on moisture tracking we investigated the potential mechanisms that drove the decreasing trend of the precipitation in the hmr from the following three aspects the moisture source of annual and seasonal precipitation in the hmr section 4 1 contribution of moisture sources during the wet and dry years section 4 2 and potential mechanisms that drive the change in internal and external moisture section 5 4 2 moisture source of annual and seasonal precipitation in hmr based on the era5 reanalysis data the annual and seasonal precipitationsheds in the hrm were identified using the wam 2layers fig 3 the moisture evaporated from the shaded regions contributed to the accumulated annual and seasonal precipitation in the hmr fig 3a portrays that the grids with high contributions are in and around the target hmr with an annual moisture contribution of more than 200 mm yr with the target hmr as the center the hot spot diffusion was irregular with respect to the moisture transport distance the sum of the tracked internal and external moisture contributions to the annual precipitation in the target hmr reached 92 66 in addition to moisture loss and residual of the calculation process in the wam 2layers the precipitationsheds varied in terms of the responses of different types of precipitation during different seasons fig 3b 3e the extent of the area with a moisture contribution greater than 2 mm season was smaller in spring autumn and winter than in summer because of the larger precipitation in summer than in other seasons fig 3a portrays that the precipitation in the hmr is influenced by the westerlies and south asian and east asian monsoons the contribution of moisture to the hmr could be divided into three major external source regions the southwest region sw sourced from the indian ocean eastern region e sourced from the western north pacific ocean and northwest region nw sourced from the qinghai tibet plateau central asia and southern europe as shown in fig 3a and table 1 the evaporated moisture of the sw transport from the east coast of australia across the indian ocean and along the east coast of africa eventually contributed to the hmr via the arabian sea india and the bay of bengal the tracked moisture in the sw dominated the annual precipitation of the hmr accounting for approximately 45 75 of the total the evaporated moisture of the nw was continuously transported by stationary flows from the qinghai tibet plateau central asia and southern europe accounting for approximately 22 70 of the total moisture the evaporated moisture of e was transported by the high frequency transient eddies from the western north pacific ocean accounting for approximately 7 45 of the total local recycling in the hmr was integral and contributed to a high moisture density fig 3a accounting for approximately 16 76 of the annual target precipitation the regional moisture contribution varied in different seasons as shown in fig 4 the moisture contribution during the summer was dominant in all regions except for the local moisture contribution of the hmr being higher than that of the nw in summer the order of moisture contribution in other seasons was sw nw hmr e therefore the precipitation in the target hmr was mainly sourced from the westerlies and the south asian monsoon local recycling in the hmr contributed to considerable moisture in the summer in addition the transient eddies over e were more prominent in summer and autumn than in spring and winter as shown in fig 3b 3e with contribution ratios of 8 20 and 10 65 and 3 30 and 4 13 respectively the statistical analysis of the moisture contribution trends in spring summer autumn and winter and annually over different source regions from 1980 to 2020 is shown in table 1 the moisture contributions in the nw and sw portrayed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at the annual scale with gradient rates of 0 92 mm yr yr and 2 08 mm yr yr from 1980 to 2020 respectively although the gradient rates of the hmr and e were positive they could not compensate for the overall decreasing trend this result was consistent with fig 2e in section 4 1 in which the annual precipitation portrayed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 at a rate of 3 02 mm yr yr in addition the decreasing trend in autumn and winter was more prominent than that in spring and summer except for e the moisture contribution in the hmr nw and sw portrayed a prominent decreasing trend p 0 05 the decreasing trend was also consistent with fig 2c 2d in section 4 1 in which the autumn and winter precipitation portrayed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 with a rate of 1 08 mm yr yr and 0 61 mm yr yr respectively generally the two primary moisture source regions nw and sw portrayed decreasing trends on annual and seasonal scales the local moisture contribution of the hmr portrayed an increasing trend except in winter additionally the moisture contribution to e portrayed an increasing trend in all seasons except spring 4 3 contribution of moisture source during wet years and dry years the wet 1998 and dry 2006 and 2011 years were selected as described in section 4 1 the difference in the moisture contribution in summer obtained from the wet 1998 and dry 2006 and 2011 years subtracted with the average value for 1980 2000 is shown in fig 5 in the wet year 1998 the moisture contributions of hmr sw and nw were higher than the multi year average whereas that of e was lower than the multi year average as shown in fig 5a the distributions of moisture contribution anomalies over the hmr 3 mm sw 136 mm and nw 26 mm were dominated by positive values while that of e 14 mm was dominated by negative values in the wet year westerly moisture transport over the qinghai tibet plateau was enhanced accompanied by more moisture from the nw the southwest monsoon moisture transport improved during the study period thus driving the arabian sea india bay of bengal and even the indo china peninsula of the sw contributing to more moisture an anticyclone in the sw transported moisture from southeast asia located southwest to the target hmr notably the moisture contribution at the eastern edge of the anticyclone was less than the multi year average as described in section 4 2 the moisture contribution to e was impacted by the transient eddy moisture from the western north pacific ocean the moisture transport decreased in wet years in addition the moisture evaporated from the local region and adjacent southwest increased during the wet years generally the precipitation increase in 1998 was mainly due to the strengthened moisture contribution from the nw sw and hmr especially in the sw region fig 5a and 5e in the dry years 2006 and 2011 the summer precipitation in 2006 and 2011 was lower than the lower limit of the 95 confidence interval fig 2b from the distribution of differences in fig 5b the negatively changing grids were mainly located in the sw 110 mm and nw 24 mm in 2006 the positively changing grids were located in the e hmr and eastern edge of the anticyclone of sw the distribution was opposite to that of the wet year 1998 in the dry year of 2011 almost all grids changed negatively except for several broken patches fig 5c however the weakened moisture contribution in sw 66 mm in 2011 was less than that in 2006 fig 5f 5 g the summer precipitation in 2006 was less than that in 2011 fig 2b generally the moisture changes during the wet and the two dry years portrayed different patterns the wet 1998 and dry 2006 year presented opposite weakened and strengthened trends in different contribution regions the two dry years also portrayed opposite characteristics in the eastern marginal area of the precipitationshed additionally we selected three normal years 1980 2000 and 2020 as reference years for comparison see appendix b fig b3 and it is apparent that the difference in moisture contribution anomaly during normal years is considerably smaller than that during years with extreme precipitation events 5 discussion 5 1 influences of climate indices on external moisture contribution of hmr huang and cui 2015a found that the main sources of moisture for precipitation in the hrm are the surrounding areas of the qinghai tibet plateau the bay of bengal and the southeast monsoon region with a surge of moisture from the bay of bengal during heavy precipitation events and a decline in moisture input from the peripheral zones of the qinghai tibet plateau our investigation also revealed the significant contribution of the southeast monsoon zone to precipitation in the southwest which is consistent with zhang and wu 2021 additionally this study found that the main source of moisture for extreme precipitation in 2008 was the southwest monsoon region section 4 3 shows that the moisture changes during the wet 2008 and two dry years 2006 and 2011 exhibited different patterns with opposite characteristics in the eastern marginal area of the precipitationshed li et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 reported that in 2006 and 2011 a strong western pacific subtropical high moved abnormally northward and westward causing descending motion over southwest china and suppressing moisture transport from the bay of bengal and south china sea however the behavior of the western pacific subtropical high differed in 2006 and 2011 with a westward stretch in 2006 but an eastward withdrawal in 2011 zhang 2020 which is consistent with the moisture distribution observed in our study however none of the studies comprehensively analyzed the effect of various climate indices on the moisture contribution to different seasons and extreme precipitation events the influences of enso iod and nao on the first principal component time series hereinafter referred to as fpc explaining the primary variance of precipitationshed of different types of annual and seasonal external moisture contributions were investigated for the annual and seasonal moisture contributions in each precipitationshed region table 2 portrayed that the fpc in some regions was significantly correlated with the climate indices for the annual moisture contribution the fpc of e s moisture contribution was significantly positively correlated with the enso whereas that of the nw s moisture contribution was significantly negatively correlated with the nao according to the moisture contribution to precipitation shown in fig 3a we could infer that the annual evaporation contribution in the western north pacific ocean enhanced during the positive enso phase conversely the annual evaporation contribution from the qinghai tibet plateau central asia and southern europe decreased during the negative nao phase which in turn partially decreased the moisture contribution combined with other climate indices in nw with a total gradient of 0 92 mm yr yr table 1 although the indian ocean was the central moisture contribution region that targets the hmr the iod had no significant influence on the annual moisture contribution for seasonal moisture contribution the fpc of the moisture contribution of the hmr was significantly positively correlated with the enso in summer and winter table 2 thus local recycling improved in summer and winter during the positive enso phase which increased the summer and winter precipitation in the target region the fpc of the nw s moisture contribution was significantly negatively correlated with the enso and iod in spring and autumn the moisture contribution of the nw also reduced during the negative nao phase in the spring thus the external moisture from the nw reduced in spring and autumn during the negative enso iod and nao phases which in turn decreases the spring and autumn precipitation in the target region this result was consistent with the decreasing trend of moisture contribution in the nw as shown in table 1 notably sw was the primary moisture source region of the hmr and its influence on the climate indices was more complicated owing to its wide range and rich moisture sources the fpc of the sw s moisture contribution was significantly positively correlated with the enso in spring and winter positively correlated with the iod in spring and negatively correlated with the iod in summer as shown in fig 3 the moisture contribution was more prominent in summer and autumn the fpc of e s moisture contribution was negatively correlated with the iod in summer and significantly negatively correlated with the enso and iod in autumn the annual time series of these climate indices from 1980 to 2020 is shown in fig 6 a the performances of the enso nao and iod in extreme wet 1998 and drought 2006 and 2011 years were investigated fig 6b 6d from the enso time series shown in fig 6b we could observe that a severe el niño event occurred in 1997 1998 and a severe la niña event occurred in 2011 notably china experienced massive flooding along the yangtze river in the south central regions during the summer of 1998 various studies have shown that in china massive flooding occurred in 1998 because of a prolonged and strong el niño effect lau and weng 2001 tong et al 2006 as shown in fig 6b the intense el niño event ended in may which was consistent with the positive correlation between the sw moisture contribution and enso index in the winter and spring seasons as shown in table 2 the central and eastern pacific heat up and updrafts appear the cooling of the western pacific weakened the updraft and led to the emergence of downdrafts resulting in increased precipitation in the western pacific during el niño the anomalous anticyclone over the philippines transferred moisture from the tropical pacific ocean to the hmr through the south china sea zhang et al 2022 in addition the negative phases of the nao and iod in 1998 reduced the source of moisture fig 6c 6d but did not play a leading role in the precipitation of the entire hmr therefore we could conclude that the strengthening of the primary source of moisture in sw likely triggered the heavy precipitation in the hmr in 1998 additionally a strong la niña event occurred in 2011 significantly reducing the pacific ocean s moisture contribution and leading to a severe drought in the hmr fig 5g in addition the nao portrayed a negative phase in 2011 fig 6c which may have enhanced the joint effects of la niña and aggravated the degree of the drought the positive phase of iod in 2011 portrayed little enhancement in moisture contribution with the maximum value being 1 fig 6d unlike the drought in 2011 no significant el niño or la niña events occurred in 2006 as shown in fig 6b 6c the negative phases of enso and nao before august 2006 combined to intensify the drought degree of the hmr in spring and summer however a new el niño event occurred in august 2006 in addition a positive phase iod event occurred in 2006 and the cold sst anomaly in the eastern tropical indian ocean triggered an anomalous anticyclone southeast of the indian continent transporting moisture in the tropical indian ocean through the bay of bengal to the south of mainland china zhang et al 2022 the enhanced joint effects of the enso and iod increased the precipitation in the autumn and winter of the hmr in 2006 fig 2 and fig 6 in addition to the influence of el niño and la niña events the precipitation of the hmr may portrayed a synergistic strengthening or neutralizing effect for all the climatic indexes 5 2 potential impacts of lucc on moisture derived from local recycling local moisture recycling occupies a non negligible part accounting for about 16 76 of the total annual precipitation table 1 the temporal change in moisture from the hmr local recycling unit and its contribution local contribution unit mm to annual precipitation in the hmr before and after 2000 is shown in fig 7 the positively changing grids are located in the e region hmr and the eastern edge of the anticyclone of the sw generally the average local contribution and recycling ratio after 2000 were higher than those during 1980 2000 the local recycling ratio and local contribution volume from 1980 to 2000 portrayed an apparent upward trend with a growth rate of 0 15 yr and 1 22 mm yr respectively on the contrary the local recycling ratio and local contribution volume from 2001 to 2020 portrayed a downward trend with a reduced rate of 0 07 yr and 0 96 mm yr respectively studies have shown that there are critical links between lucc and local moisture recycling li et al 2021 pranindita et al 2022 the underlying surface conditions affect the surface temperature surface albedo and other climatic factors which in turn affect the evaporation intensity air water saturation and sinking water vapor jiang et al 2021 for example in tropical and desert areas the recycling ratio is high whereas water vapor sinks and saturates in areas that have more water cover van der ent 2014 the main types of land use and land cover changes in the hmr during 1980 2000 and 2001 2020 are listed in table 3 spatial distribution map of lucc refer to fig b1 in the past 40 years policies projects and significant events affected the lucc land cover changes in southwest china cropland coverage increased by 2 62 from 1980 to 2000 because of population growth and the increased demand for food in contrast woodland areas were reduced 0 71 because of the need for productivity and deforestation table 3 since the mid 1980 s china has enacted a series of grassland and forest laws and launched the 3 north shelter forest program project however these laws and plans are still in the early stages since the beginning of the 21st century the forest area increased dramatically 0 83 due to the policies aiming at converting farmlands back to forests the establishment of the sanjiangyuan nature reserve and the implementation of closing mountains for forest cultivation in addition many water conservancy projects such as the xiaowan and jinping reservoirs were built in the study area between 2001 and 2020 increasing the water surface area of the study area by 39 22 according to the global reservoir and dam database grand approximately 36 large artificial reservoirs 0 1 km3 are located mainly in the southeast region fig 1 of the study area lehner et al 2011 some studies have revealed that the expansion of the woodland and water surface tended to decrease the surface temperature increase regional humidity enhance the descending motion of air and alter the regional atmospheric circulation under some special synoptic conditions jiang et al 2021 li et al 2021 miller et al 2005 wang et al 2020 therefore the weakened local recycling after 2000 may be linked to the enhancements in the sinking air and moisture divergence in the lower atmosphere resulting from surface cooling the spatial distribution of local recycling conforms to this hypothesis the moisture contribution in the southeastern reservoir distribution area fig 1 was lower than that in the northwest fig 7a 7c after 2000 woodland and water surface expansion tended to weaken local recycling in the future the decreasing trend of local recycling will likely intensify owing to large scale artificial reservoir construction and surface changes caused by impoundment in addition the alterations in subsurface characteristics along with the impacts of climate change can induce changes in groundwater and soil water content in the study area leading to alterations in the tws within hmr the western region of the study area portrays a substantial declining trend in twsa from 2002 to 2020 with a maximum reduction rate of 10 cm yr as shown in fig b4 a this trend is attributed to rising temperatures and decreased precipitation particularly in the indian monsoon dominated himalayas as documented by yao et al 2012 furthermore leakage from the northwest region of india has been identified as a significant contributor to the grace signals as the groundwater depletion persists in this area as suggested by chen et al 2014 lapworth et al 2015 overall the twsa within the study area demonstrates a notable declining trend with a rate of 1 15 cm yr fig b4 b which is similar to the trend observed in the local recycling fig 7 c the results reveal a positive correlation between the monthly variations in twsa and the monthly local recycling rate with a correlation coefficient of 0 3 though the correlation was not significance in 2021 four super large reservoirs in the study area were completed and put into operation namely baihetan xiluodu wudongde and xiangjiaba at present six of the 10 largest reservoirs in china are located in the study area the impoundment of these reservoirs will significantly improve the water surface coverage of the study area and thus enhance the water vapor subsidence in the region however the precipitation in the study area in the future in addition to the local recycling changes caused by the underlying surface climate indexes will also affect the internal and external moisture sources thus the process is complex and changeable and requires further discussion and consideration 5 3 uncertainties of moisture tracking the wam 2layer dynamically reconstructs moisture transport and tracks tagged moisture in the eulerian grid uncertainties in moisture source analyses mainly stem from input reanalysis products but studies li et al 2021 2022b show that precipitation biases do not significantly impact identification or quantification of contributions additionally many studies have verified the excellent performance of era5 for water vapor tracking and climate analysis in china or globally liu et al 2021 xiao and cui 2021 zhang and wu 2021 in this study era5 reanalysis data was used as input and cmagrid data verified its consistency with measurements a difference in precipitation trend between the datasets in spring and summer may be due to various factors fig 1 including limited site interpolation of cmagrid in complex southwest mountainous areas however the two datasets showed significant correlations across seasons and interannual variability and high consistency in extreme precipitation characteristics factors affecting extreme precipitation analysis were not significant but may affect moisture contribution in different seasons more accurate data in the future would be ideal for analysis 6 conclusions due to global climate change extreme climate events in the hmr have increased significantly based on precipitation evaporation and various atmospheric vertical layer data in the era5 reanalysis we investigated the long term 1980 2020 moisture sources that contributed to the annual and seasonal precipitation change in the hmr we identified the annual and seasonal precipitationsheds in the hmr based on the backtracking of the precipitation in the region to its source the contribution of moisture to the hmr precipitation in representative wet and dry years was further evaluated in addition we explored the potential impacts of climate indices and lucc on the hmr based on the external moisture contribution and internal local moisture recycling the main conclusions of this study are as follows the identified precipitationsheds in the hmr varied in response to different types of precipitation during different seasons the extent of the areas having moisture contributions greater than 2 mm season was smaller in spring autumn and winter than in summer because of the larger precipitation in summer the decrease in the annual precipitation could be mainly attributed to the reduced moisture supply from the extended sw and nw portraying a decreasing trend of 2 08 mm yr yr and 0 92 mm yr yr respectively the precipitation in the target hmr mainly originated from the westerlies and south asian monsoon the two primary moisture source regions nw and sw portrayed significant decreasing trends at the annual and seasonal scales the local moisture contribution of the hmr presented an increasing trend in all seasons except winter the moisture contribution to e portrayed an increasing trend in all seasons except spring we compared the summer moisture source differences between the extremely dry wet and multi year averages the precipitation increase in the wet year was mainly due to the strengthened moisture contribution of nw 26 mm sw 136 mm and hmr 3 mm particularly in sw the moisture contribution changed during the wet year and the two drought years indicated different patterns the wet year 1998 and the dry year 2006 presented opposite weakened and strengthened trends in different regions the two drought years also portrayed opposite characteristics in the eastern marginal area of the precipitationshed the influences of the enso iod and nao on the leading first patterns explaining the primary variance in the precipitationshed of different types of annual and seasonal external moisture contributions were investigated notably the strengthening of the primary moisture source in the sw due to the el niño may have triggered the heavy precipitation of the hmr in 1998 the reduction in the primary moisture source in the sw due to la niña may have triggered an extreme drought event in the hmr in 2011 we could conclude that the extreme drought event in 2006 may have been caused by the synergistic effects of the enso iod and nao in conclusion this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that drive changes in precipitation in the hmr and highlights the importance of effective water resource management disaster prevention and mitigation the findings of this study can guide future research on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies in the region however the study also warns that the trend of decreasing local moisture recycling in the hmr may intensify due to large scale artificial reservoir construction and underlying impoundment surface changes caused by lucc therefore more attention needs to be paid to the potential impacts of these factors on the water cycle and hydrological processes in the hmr data availability statement all the data used in this study are publicly available
