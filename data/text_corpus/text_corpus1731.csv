8655,almost 800 million people lack access to basic water supply and almost 2000 million lack access to sanitation therefore achieving universal access remains a crucial goal of the global development agenda in order to shed light on whether international aid might help accomplish that goal this study evaluates its impact in a sample of 121 developing countries during 1990 2015 a new approach is adopted in which aid affects access not only through provision of infrastructure supply but also through health education demand additionally the long held concern about the persistence of impacts over time is addressed by estimating panel vector autoregressive models pvar the results show that both supply and demand side interventions financed by aid can contribute to promoting access to water but consistent long term investments are needed keywords water supply sanitation developing regions aid effectiveness jel classification q25 o18 f35 i12 1 introduction while the basic elements of modern water and sanitation ws services were almost fully developed in europe and north america by the middle of the 20th century many developing countries face a severe lack of access to improved ws still today 1 1 improved drinking water sources are those that have the potential to deliver safe water by nature of their design and construction and include water piped into private premises a household water connection located inside the user s dwelling plot or yard public taps or standpipes tube wells or boreholes protected dug wells protected springs and rainwater collection improved sanitation facilities include flush or pour flush systems piped to a sewer system septic tank or pit latrine ventilated pit latrines pit latrines with foundational slab and composting toilets this poses significant challenges for global development in different domains first the lack of access to improved ws is directly linked to poor health outcomes the evidence suggests that the lack of sanitation is associated with higher risk of diarrhea active trachoma some soil transmitted helminth sth infections and schistosomiasis 1 with infants and children being the most affected the lack of access to ws has detrimental effects on child nutrition 2 and on health indicators such as height and weight z scores 3 4 it is also associated with diarrheal morbidity among children 5 7 and infant mortality 8 the lack of access to ws also poses a significant public health risk related to the spread of epidemic diseases notably its association with cholera transmission is well attested 9 10 and recent research states that ensuring access to ws services is important for preventing covid 19 11 the ws health nexus intersects with gender and other development challenges 12 the lack of access to improved ws is associated with a lack of safe menstrual hygiene management 13 greater gender inequality and women s exposure to partner violence 14 16 women also carry a disproportionate psychosocial burden as a consequence of inequities in access to water and sanitation 17 finally the lack of access to these services may have far reaching implications for the general economy as ws related diseases undermine human capital formation and reduce the productivity of those who fall sick or must care for the sick 18 the importance of ws for global development has not gone unnoticed by the international community the millennium development goals mdgs included as target 10 the commitment to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to improved ws with the baseline year being 1990 over this period annual disbursements of official development assistance oda targeted for ws multiplied by 15 8 in real terms from us 386 million to us 6 088 billion 2015 dollars fortunately the proportion of people without access to water more than halved from 23 9 to 9 as for sanitation however the corresponding ratio only dropped from 47 1 to 32 5 19 with the approval of the new sustainable development goals sdgs in 2015 the objective on ws became to ensure access to safe water and sanitation for all oda is expected to substantially contribute to this endeavor but if the appropriate use of oda is to be ensured it is essential to evaluate its effectiveness during the mdg reference period in the first place that is the objective of this article the impact of oda on the proportion of population with access to improved ws is assessed while adding to the literature on this topic in a number of ways firstly this study employs a comprehensive panel of 121 aid recipient countries as registered by the oecd s creditor reporting system crs thus allowing conclusions to be drawn that can be considered of general validity and not limited to the specific sample of countries chosen it is also showed that the estimates for the average impact of aid at the global level are also valid for the regions most in need secondly this article emphasizes the role of micro level theoretical foundations in drawing causal pathways that can guide the specification of the empirical model for the evaluation of aid effectiveness at the aggregate level unlike previous research on this topic it is not assumed here that the mere provision of ws services automatically translates into use instead the use of improved ws is assumed to be the result of an individual decision making process in which improved ws are considered among other goods and services this approach allows to clearly identify factors related to demand and not only supply as potential determinants of use of improved ws services as a result the evaluation offered here considers not only the potential impact of oda for ws infrastructure henceforth ws oda but also the impact that oda for health education may have on the use of improved ws services 2 2 health education includes information education and training of the population for improving health knowledge and practices public health and awareness campaigns and promotion of improved personal hygiene practices including use of sanitation facilities and handwashing with soap it does not include other components of health oda such as medical services health care or infectious disease control malaria tuberculosis hiv aids etc finally the long held statistical concern about co causality between aid and outcomes has been better dealt with by introducing the use of panel vector autoregressive models pvar with simultaneous equations which assume that both aid and use of improved ws are endogenous variables additionally these models permit to assess the persistence of the effect of aid over time this being an aspect absent from previous literature the empirical strategy adopted and the results obtained by this study add to a growing literature on development policy evaluation suggesting that while the impact of overall aid on macroeconomic aggregates remains elusive a positive impact of some components of aid on sector specific outcomes is more likely to be found however a warning is made that the impacts of isolated aid flows can fade off as time passes if consistent long term investments are not put into place the remainder of the article is organized as follows section 2 reviews the body of literature that investigates the impact of aid on ws section 3 delineates the theoretical framework on which this study is based section 4 describes the data section 5 discusses the empirical strategy section 6 provides the results finally section 7 concludes with a summary and a discussion of policy implications 2 review of the literature the empirical evaluation of aid effectiveness has received significant attention in the scholarly literature since the 1980s however it has tended to focus on the relationship between overall aid and economic growth yielding conflicting results 20 23 as argued by bourguignon and sundberg 52 the ambiguous findings of this literature are in fact to be expected given the heterogeneity of aid motives the limitations of the tools of analysis and the complex causality chain linking aid to final outcomes similarly clemens et al 24 point out that one would not expect all the diverse types of aid to have similar effects and that this diversity might partly account for the wide ranging results reported in the literature for this reason some researchers have preferred to look for the impact of aid on non growth outcomes of direct interest such as education and health because these studies may benefit from clearer causal chains they are indeed more likely to find a significant impact even though they are not free from unclear results 25 within this literature on the effectiveness of aid at the sectoral level little attention has been paid to the ws sector this line of research emerged in the mid 2000s and is still at a nascent stage even so two waves of literature can be distinguished within this short period the first wave studies ranging from 2006 to 2014 used cross sectional regressions as their empirical strategy anand 26 and wolf 27 made the first such attempts neither found any impact of ws oda on access to ws at the national level botting et al 28 did find an impact on access to water but not on access to sanitation thus this group of studies conjured a rather pessimistic image concluding that ws oda had no impact on access to ws the second wave of studies has taken advantage of the availability of longer series of data allowing them to employ panel data models in the estimates and to better deal with unobserved heterogeneity among countries however a downside of this new wave of literature is that sanitation has been less studied than before bain et al 29 and wayland 30 focused on water only leaving sanitation aside their results are contradictory even though they employ similar statistical methods and sample size bain et al who used aid disbursements to ws found no evidence of a positive impact of aid on access to water however wayland who used commitments did find an impact gopalan and rajan 31 added methodological improvements such as the estimation of dynamic models by gmm in addition to static models already used by bain et al and wayland they found aid disbursements to produce a strong positive and significant effect on access to improved ws similar findings are provided by wayland 32 and ahmed 33 in this last case regarding the impact on access to water only whose studies are based on dynamic models however the results of these three articles are qualified by francois kakeu and kouame 34 who also employ dynamic models but do not find an impact of aid on sanitation in sub saharan africa the still scarce literature on the impact of ws oda on access to ws is therefore largely inconclusive four studies found no impact of aid on access to water or sanitation 26 27 29 34 only two studies found a positive impact on both water and sanitation 31 32 finally three studies that focused on water found different results while bain et al 29 did not observe any impact wayland 30 did and ahmed 33 only found impact when employing dynamic models 3 theoretical framework traditionally the literature on aid effectiveness adopts a supply side perspective ultimately inspired by economic growth theory while this may be justified when considering the relation between aid and recipient countries gdp the link is not so clear when it is transplanted to other areas of analysis the relation between aid and ws among them the use of many kinds of services is not a mere mechanical result of investment in the infrastructure required to provide them building a school does not guarantee that children will enroll creating an infrastructure for water or sanitation does not guarantee that people will use it 35 36 factors from the demand side related to people s preferences culture values and customs as well as to perceived benefits and costs are equally crucial in order to overcome this gap a new perspective rooted in individual decision making and expected utility maximization is adopted in this study in accordance with this approach the variable of interest is not the supply or provision of ws to a population i e available infrastructure but the use of such services by the population this is the full meaning of the indicator called access by the joint monitoring program jmp the official indicator for monitoring progress towards target 10 of the mdgs 3 3 this is so because the coverage rates are based on information from service users on actual household use and not merely on availability while the estimates are based on use the jmp reports use as access because access is the term used in the mdg target for drinking water and sanitation 37 consequently both terms are used indistinctly throughout this article the mdg target on ws is to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation this goal can be disaggregated into a number of separate targets regarding individual use of improved ws if r k a k n k is the ratio of total number of people using improved ws a k to total population n k in country k then a k is the sum of the individual values of b i for each inhabitant i of country k 1 a k i 1 n b i i 1 n where b i equals 1 if individual i uses improved ws and 0 otherwise now we turn to the question of how the value of b i for each individual i is determined it is assumed that individual i demonstrates well behaved preferences i e monotonic and convex preferences and makes decisions with the aim of maximizing their expected utility u i that depends positively on the quantity of goods and services consumed individual i faces an optimization problem with a budgetary constraint 2 max u i x subject to j 1 n p j x j i r i where x x 1 i x n i is a vector of quantities of n goods and services with x j i being the quantity of the good or service j for j 1 n and where p j is the price of x j and r i is the individual s budget now let x n i be the quantity of improved ws services used by individual i with x 1 i x n 1 i being the rest of goods and services including unimproved ws education etc the optimization problem faced by an important share of the world population reaches a corner solution where x n i 0 and consequently b i 0 in order for development assistance to succeed in its goal it is necessary to increase the number of individuals whose optimization problem leads to a solution where x n i 0 and therefore b i 1 the more individuals that make this transition from b i 0 to b i 1 the more the aggregate a k increases and so does the official mdg target variable r k a k n k 4 4 this goal can be referred to as an extensive rather than an intensive one meaning that the goal as officially formulated is not to increase the amount of improved ws used by each individual regardless their initial level that is to increase x n i t so that x n i t 1 x n i t but to increase the amount used only by those who are initially at x n i t 0 so that x n i t 1 0 the increase in the individual use of improved ws can be achieved in two ways either by relaxing the individual s budgetary constraint or by affecting the specific form of the individual s utility function in turn a possible way of modifying the budgetary constraint is by reducing the fixed costs associated to the use of improved ws such as those needed for the installation of on site facilities but also opportunity costs such as for instance the time spent travelling the distance to the nearest water source and the time spent waiting in line once there 38 39 5 5 the budgetary constraint can also be modified by increasing household income which can be a general outcome of the aggregate oda but not likely as a consequence of the sectoral oda on ws the constraint could also be modified by pushing p n down although this price is established by local providers of improved ws and it is not usually the aim of development assistance to alter this these fixed costs can be formalized as a capitation tax t applied only when x n i 0 thus t reflects the income that the individual either devotes to installing a new facility or else stops earning in the labor market when they decide to spend time carrying water home then in the presence of these fixed costs the constrained optimization problem actually faced by the individual is 3 max u i x subject to j 1 n p j x j i r i if x n i 0 j 1 n p j x j i t r i if x n i 0 in this context ws oda may help reduce t for example via the increase of the number of available water points by doing so the budgetary constraint is modified and there is the possibility that a new equilibrium can be reached where x n i 0 although that would depend on both the magnitude of such reduction and the actual shape of the utility function an alternative way of promoting the use of improved ws that is of pushing x n i up is to modify the specific form of the individual s utility function u i namely by achieving an increment in u i x n i a possible manner of doing this is suggested by evidence that the more people understand the health benefits of using improved ws the more likely they are willing to pay for these services 40 thus if x n 1 i is the consumption of health education from now on h e by the individual i it can be assumed that an increase in the quantity consumed of h e leads to an increase in the marginal utility of x n h e i u i x n i 0 that is health education and improved ws services are q complements following the terminology established by hicks 41 this means that once the recipients of health education financed by oda are provided with better information about the health benefits of improved ws their preferences are expected to change in favor of these services giving rise to the possibility of a new equilibrium with a consumption decision where x n i 0 6 6 other factors such as convenience and status are also important determinants of demand for ws an illustrative case is provided by reis and mollinga 42 the demand for safe sanitation appliances offered within a microcredit program was concentrated on a relatively expensive beautiful latrine because latrines were being valued as a status symbol for relatively better off households 4 data in the empirical work r k is represented by two objective variables the share of population with access to improved water and the share of population with access to improved sanitation the concept of access to improved ws see note 1 for a brief account of facilities included served as the official instrument for monitoring progress towards target 10 of the mdgs and is a precondition for access to safely managed ws this being the target indicator established by the current sdgs 43 thus the concept of improved ws is still relevant in global policy practice and allows to evaluate the effectiveness of aid in the ws sector while long time series on access to safely managed ws become available data were sourced from the world bank s world development indicators wdi database which in turn takes its information from the jmp administered by unicef and who 7 7 once the mdgs were replaced by the sdgs the definition of the objective variables changed the last version of the wdi that included the mdg oriented variables is that of april 2018 for that reason all the variables that have been sourced from the wdi come from this version of the database regarding the variables that may affect r k a guide can be found in the theoretical framework developed above 4 1 supply side factors as stated before the opportunity costs represented by t may be reduced by an increase of supply of the service this supply can be financed internally as by local government expenditure or externally as by development assistance the latter is one of the two explanatory variables of interest for this study a single variable including gross disbursements of oda for both water and sanitation infrastructure ws oda is used in the empirical work separate information about each type of oda is not available and additionally using separate variables would be not appropriate because of the existence of narrow links between both sectors data were sourced from the oecd s crs code 140 a total of 155 aid recipient countries during the period 1990 2015 are considered see appendix a but due to missing data the maximum number of recipients included in the regression analysis is 121 almost half of ws oda is allocated to the construction of large systems of ws and about a fifth is intended for basic infrastructure for a detailed breakdown see appendix c all amounts are expressed in 2015 us dollars per capita 8 8 data on both ws oda and health education oda were sourced from the project level files 18 january 2019 version and aggregated at the national level any type of oda budget support project type interventions technical assistance etc is included all channels public sector ngos public private partnerships etc are taken into account but only official flows are considered private development finance is out of the scope of this study because reliable data on these flows began to be available only recently in order to compute disbursements per inhabitant population data were sourced from the wdi apart from external financing the supply of ws can also be financed internally because there is no single database with comprehensive panel data on local government expenditures on ws gdp per capita has been included in the model as a broad indicator on the local capacity to provide the population with ws 9 9 gopalan and rajan 31 managed to compile some sparse estimates on local government expenditures on ws from secondary reports but only for a small number of countries and years it is expected to show a positive relation with access to ws data were sourced from the wdi and amounts are expressed in constant 2011 international dollars ppp per capita the share of urban population was also included as a variable that may affect the costs of using ws since populations in urban contexts are more densely distributed the same expenditure on ws can provide coverage to more people in urban settings than in rural areas therefore a positive relation with access is expected data were sourced from the wdi supply of ws can also be affected by institutional factors particularly democracies have been found to provide safe water and public sanitation far above dictatorships 44 this is the reason why the democracy score developed by the center of systemic peace has been included in the model as a control variable the indicator ranges from strongly autocratic 10 to strongly democratic 10 so a positive impact on access is expected similarly corruption may lead to increased prices or reduced supply of ws for a given level of expenditure for this reason the model also includes an average measure of corruption provided by the varieties of democracy project its directionality runs from less corrupt 0 to more corrupt 1 so a negative relation with access is expected 4 2 demand side factors the most evident factor of demand for any good or service including ws is income which has already been discussed as a supply side factor the expected positive impact of gdp per capita on access to ws also applies to its condition as a demand side factor since households with higher incomes can afford a more intensive use of ws services 10 10 arguably the effect of gdp per capita may be modulated by inequality however reliable data on income inequality are remarkably scarce in developing countries for this reason income inequality or more accurately the component of income inequality that is not correlated with other control variables is included in the error term of our models this is not expected to affect the estimated impact of aid on access to ws since short term variations in inequality and aid are not significantly correlated aid fluctuates considerably in short periods of time while statistically significant variations in inequality can only be observed in relatively long periods following the suggested theoretical framework the use of improved ws is also influenced by the marginal utility of these services which in turn depends on the individual s knowledge about their health benefits thus higher levels of at least basic education are expected to increase the use of improved ws the logarithm of mean years of education has been employed as a measure of basic education data were sourced from the undp s human development data bank in the same line the demand for ws can be influenced by oda oriented to health education insofar as it can improve citizens levels of information around the effects of the use of improved ws on health and may improve their knowledge on how to use them properly as a consequence oda for health education was included in the models as a second explanatory variable of interest data were sourced from crs code 12261 for the components of health education oda see note 2 lastly since a large fraction of oda is channeled through national governments the number and quality of health education programs actually carried out with external funding can be negatively affected by corruption thus the supply side negative effect of this variable is reinforced by its demand side effect summary statistics of both objective and explanatory variables are presented in table 1 5 empirical strategy in a cross country setting r k may be affected by measurable factors that change over time such as those presented in section 4 but also by factors that do not change over time or that change at a rather slow pace and are difficult to measure these latter types of factors constitute what has been called unobserved heterogeneity and include among others geographical factors such as climate aridity etc as well as institutional or cultural factors in order to account for these factors the following equation is estimated as a baseline fixed effects model 4 r k t β x k t δ k γ t u k t where r k t is the rate of access to improved w s in country k at time t δ k is the country fixed effect γ t is a time fixed effect that accounts for factors that vary over time but equally affect all countries x k t is a matrix including the variables presented in section 4 which may affect access in country k at time t and u k t is the error term β is a vector of parameters to be estimated correlations for explanatory variables can be found in table 2 oda has been included in the model using logarithms instead of the original series as in gopalan and rajan 31 this specification shows a higher explanatory capacity meaning that the effect of oda on access to ws seems to be non linear it is also common in the literature to measure oda as the average of a number of past time periods in order to soften a portion of the volatility that oda is supposed to exert given its irregular nature but also due to possible errors of measurement in this study two different models have been estimated one of them containing yearly data and another with the variable expressed as the average of the past five years in this last case the regressions have been run taking into account only years 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 by taking the average the impact of long infrastructure projects can be better captured while yearly data would be more likely to show the effect of shorter projects in basic infrastructures as well as health education both models are estimated by making use of ordinary least squares ols apart from volatility another source of concern when evaluating the impact of aid is the possible existence of endogeneity or co causality this is because just as ws aid is expected to have an impact on access it is also expected to respond to this indicator by flowing in a greater magnitude to those countries that need it most i e that present lower rates of access in order to avoid this issue one possible estimation alternative is the use of instrumental variables thus the model has also been estimated by making use of two stages least squares 2sls where the aid variables have been instrumented with their first lags the instrumental variables are strongly correlated with current aid ρ 0 75 for ws oda and ρ 0 69 for health education oda various test statistics for the instrumental variable estimation are reported in appendix b as shown in section 6 the estimations based on static models from equation 4 prove to be of little use in explaining the impact of ws oda this may be due to the static nature of the model objective and explanatory variables are assumed to be linked in levels meaning that as increases in oda are expected to lead to increases in r k t reductions in oda would lead to reductions in r k t this assumption may not be appropriate when assessing the effectiveness of ws oda which is mostly allocated to financing projects of infrastructure in this case the output built infrastructure can hardly be expected to decrease as oda does therefore a reduction in oda could most probably lead to a stagnation or a smaller increase rather than to a decline in the level of access to test this possibility an alternative model has been estimated including the dependent variable as an interannual variation 5 r k t r k t 1 β x k t δ k γ t u k t explanatory variables other than oda have also been included in the models as variations as they are expected to be related to the objective variable in levels by examining the impact of oda on the interannual variation in access some evidence is found that the relation between oda and access may in fact be dynamic instead of static for that reason a third specification has been employed where the dynamic nature of the model is made explicit by including the lagged dependent variable in the right side of the equation as an explanatory factor 6 r k t α r k t 1 β x k t δ k γ t u k t where the lagged dependent variable r k t 1 captures the effects of aid in t 1 which are not expected to completely dissapear in t even if new aid falls to zero thus r k t 1 causes accumulation of aid effects over time note that both equation 4 and equation 5 are special cases of equation 6 with α 0 and α 1 respectively because the estimated values of α in equation 6 are close to 1 see table 4 and table 6 the β coefficients associated with aid in equation 6 can be interpreted as those in equation 5 that is the impact of aid on the interannual variation in access finally to account for the possibility of endogeneity an equation system has been employed even if the issue of endogeneity can be addressed to some extent with the use of single equation dynamic models such as those employed by gopalan and rajan 31 ahmed 33 francois et al 34 and wayland 32 they cannot provide estimates for the cumulative impact of aid over time considering the intermediate impacts among all endogenous variables consequently a long run view of the lagged structure of aid impacts is missing from previous studies on the topic with the aim of providing such a view dynamic autoregressive simultaneous equation models are adopted in this study thus in addition to equation 6 two more equations relate the explanatory variables of interest ws oda and health education oda to r k t 1 and the rest of the independent variables because applying fixed effects estimates to dynamic panels could potentially lead to significantly biased ols coefficients a panel data vector autoregressive pvar model has been estimated through the gmm method 11 11 all statistical analysis was performed using stata 15 to estimate pvar models the program pvar developed by abrigo and love 45 has been used the pvar model assumes that access ws oda and health education oda are all endogenous variables although each of them has a different degree of endogeneity the identification strategy used here follows a cholesky decomposition which depends on the ordering of variables according to their relative endogeneity the ordering adopted assumes that the rate of access influences oda disbursements before these can have an effect on access since donors decisions are usually based on recipients needs while ws oda is more likely to influence contemporaneous health education oda than the other way around because the promotion of demand is usually pursued when efforts in the supply side are already in place using this causal ordering the implied impulse response functions irf and forecast error variance decompositions fevd are calculated the irf confidence intervals are computed using 200 monte carlo draws based on the estimated model 6 results 6 1 the impact of oda on access to water table 3 shows the results from the static models for the impact of oda on access to improved water where the dependent variable is measured in levels columns 1 3 and in variations columns 4 6 as already observed by ndikumana and pickbourn 18 if the relation between oda and access is assumed to be in levels 1 3 the coefficients for ws oda show a counterintuitive negative sign although they are commonly not different from zero at the usual confidence levels the impact of health education oda is positive in all the model specifications the negative expected value of the coefficient associated with ws oda could be partly explained by the fact that we are considering a static relation between ws oda and access when the relation is in fact dynamic some evidence in favor of this possibility is found in the results shown in columns 4 6 obtained when using first differences in the dependent variable here the signs of the coefficients turn positive and significantly different from zero in all cases considering models 4 6 a one percent increase in ws oda per capita is associated with an interannual variation in the rate of access to water of between 0 0014 and 0 0066 percentage points higher with a confidence of 95 12 12 the coefficient associated to ws oda shows its highest expected value in model 6 a one percent increase in the average amount of yearly ws oda received over the past five years is associated with a five year variation in the rate of access of between 0 0082 and 0 0323 percentage points higher with a confidence of 95 nevertheless if this contribution to five year variation is assumed to be evenly distributed over time the expected yearly contribution would be between 0 0082 5 0 0016 and 0 0323 5 0 0065 percentage points which almost perfectly matches the range of 0 0014 0 0066 suggested by models 4 5 this effect may seem rather small however if ws oda is related to the variation in access instead of the level of access it would mean that once a given disbursement is made its effect persists for some time and consequently the impacts of subsequent aid disbursements can accumulate to give rise to a significant effect in the long term to better test the dynamic nature of the relation between oda and access a pvar model has been estimated the results contained in table 4 point to a positive impact of both ws oda and health education oda on access to water the expected impacts of both types of oda on access one year later are fairly similar per increase of one percent with that of ws oda 0 0020 being only 17 6 higher than that of health education oda 0 0017 regarding the coefficients of the control variables none is significantly different from zero probably because their effects are already captured by the lagged dependent variable 13 13 it has already been noted by previous authors on aid effectiveness that regressions with lagged dependent variables in particular when using general method of moments gmm tend to find a low number of significant regressors 25 as for oda as a dependent variable the level of access is found to increase the amount of both types of oda received one year later with a higher effect on health education oda in a pvar model however what is truly interesting is the cumulative impact over time of exogenous changes in one variable on the rest taking into account the intermediate impacts among all endogenous variables in terms of levels the irf shows that while a positive shock on any type of oda leads to an increased rate of access as soon as one year later this impact does not reach its maximum until three or four years after the disbursement graph 1 this finding which was expected for infrastructure projects with long lead times also holds to a lesser extent for health education which implies that certain changes in behavior can also take some time to show up a one percent increase in health education oda raises the rate of access by more than 0 002 percentage points in the long run while the effect of a shock of the same magnitude in ws oda is expected to be about 0 003 percentage points from four years after the shock onward nonetheless the effect of ws oda while expected to be somewhat higher is also more uncertain in the long run the estimated contribution of health education oda to the rate of access to water may range from about 0 0001 to 0 0003 percentage points with a confidence of 95 while the contribution of ws oda may range from 0 0006 percentage points to the neighborhood of zero in fact this finding that points to a positive but uncertain effect of ws oda on access to water in the long run is consistent with field experience that has already warned about the sustainability of ws infrastructures 46 47 factors such as the capacity and willingness of local governments to provide and finance post construction support the willingness and ability of water users to pay tariffs and the availability of reliable maintenance resources might explain why the impact of ws oda becomes more difficult to measure accurately as time passes thus these issues should be urgently addressed in order to make sure that the impact of foreign aid persists over long time periods this is important because even if the aforementioned estimates may portray the image of negligible effects it is necessary to keep in mind that these are effects from one shot infusions of aid which are expected to accumulate if consistent and long run investments are put into place moreover since the aggregated rates of access to ws change rather slowly what seems negligible in absolute numbers may not be so in relative terms based on the fevd estimates as much as 9 7 of variation in the rate of access to water can be explained by ws oda in a forecast horizon of ten years and 4 2 can be explained by health education oda see appendix d this means that on average at least 13 9 of observed long term variation in national rates of access to water can be explained by oda therefore even if it is other determinants that account for most of the progress these results show that the contribution of development assistance has been generally positive and significant 6 2 the impact of oda on access to sanitation as for access to sanitation the static models do not identify any relation between ws oda and access while they do find a positive impact of health education oda see table 5 if we measure the impact on interannual variations ws oda again turns to a positive sign in two of the specifications the estimated values of the coefficients are however lower than in the case of water and this relation disappears when using five year averages the explanatory capacity of the models as measured by the r squared is also significantly lower the pvar model finds the impact of health education to again be positive and persistent over time see table 6 and graph 2 a one percent increase in health education oda is expected to increase the rate of access to sanitation by 0 0020 percentage points one year later and that effect persists for at least ten years nonetheless based on the fevd estimates only as much as 1 1 of variation in access can be explained by health education oda at a forecast horizon of ten years see appendix e so the effect is persistent but of small relative importance with the same forecast horizon as much as 3 6 of variation in health education can be explained by the rate of access thus there is evidence of reverse causality but its magnitude is also small regarding ws oda the model fails to find a consistent relation with access to sanitation in the same way that static models in differences show worse results than in the case of access to water a likely explanation to this finding is the well known emphasis that development assistance placed on water over sanitation in the mdg era 48 crs data does not allow a full accounting for this bias but those items that can be differentiated into water and sanitation oriented show a clear bias in favor of water thus large systems of sanitation received us 2 29 billion of 2015 dollars between 1990 and 2015 which makes little more than 50 of the us 4 32 billion allocated to large systems of water supply the same applies to basic sanitation which received only us 855 98 million or about 40 of the us 2 01 billion received by basic water supply see appendix c although lack of investment does not necessarily translate into lack of effectiveness it may ultimately reflect a lack of interest which could lead to relatively poor performance in interventions and thus to lower impacts the role played by local governments might also be of great importance most basic sanitation technologies are not expensive to implement but those facing the problems of inadequate sanitation may not be aware of either the origin of their ills or the true costs of poor sanitation and hygiene and as a result they are hard to convince of the need to invest scarce resources in sanitation 49 it should come as no surprise then that the impact of ws oda is highly uncertain this in turn might explain the positive and persistent impact of health education which could be helping to change that state of mind if this interpretation is correct it could be concluded that investment in education builds human capital just as investment in infrastructure builds physical capital the former being more difficult to destroy than the latter 6 3 a regional look less effective where most needed the results presented above come from the analysis of a large sample of countries from all regions of the developing world which allow to draw relevant global conclusions on the average effect of oda on access to improved ws however the problems and challenges regarding ws vary widely among different world regions in particular ws related deaths remain especially high in parts of south asia and much of sub saharan africa and expert forecasts have warned that health losses will likely remain high in these two regions over the medium term 50 it is therefore sensible to ask whether foreign aid has been less effective in these areas or whether on the contrary it can be of particular help to those that need it most in order to answer this question the pvar models discussed above have been reestimated including interactions terms between oda variables and regional dummy variables for sub saharan africa and south asia the results presented in table 7 show that none of the interaction terms included in the models are significantly different from zero thus suggesting that the estimates for the average impact of oda at the global level are also valid for the regions that are most in need accordingly foreign aid would not have been less effective in these areas nor would it have a higher transformative power compared to its impact in other parts of the developing world the aforementioned notwithstanding a brief remark should be made although the confidence intervals of the regional effects are relatively large their estimated coefficients tend to show a negative sign in the case of ws oda while they all show a positive sign for health education oda this pattern might be suggesting that there are regional differences in the relative impact of supply side and demand side interventions in the ws sector even if they cannot be measured accurately in the context of this study hopefully future research will be able to shed light on whether complementing infrastructure with health education would be especially effective in those regions where progress seems to be harder to achieve 7 conclusions global rates of access to improved water and sanitation increased over the period 1990 2015 but progress was uneven and the role played by development assistance in these trends has not been fully disentangled this study has tried to shed light on this matter in a number of ways firstly it provides a theoretical framework that opens a new way of addressing the interpretation of causal pathways in the evaluation of the impact of development assistance for the water and sanitation sector secondly it applies new empirical methods that are considered more suitable to the theoretical perspective that has been adopted two main conclusions have been reached as a result first the relation between oda for water and sanitation infrastructure and the rates of access to water seems to be dynamic in nature meaning that the impacts of individual disbursements may accumulate over time to yield remarkable results if consistent long term investments are put into place otherwise even if isolated infusions of aid can be credited for up to a tenth of observed progress in access to water ten years after the disbursement they can also fade off as time passes as for the impact of oda for infrastructure on access to sanitation no general rule has been found it is commonly known that this sector has been under considered in comparison to water supply which might account for that result more careful consideration of sanitation is needed especially given that progress in this sector has been observed as more uneven than in access to water second oda for health education seems to have a persistent positive impact on the use of both water and sanitation services although this effect is relatively small in comparison to that of oda for infrastructure the persistent effect of health education might be due to the positive reinforcement between this type of oda and the levels of access due to the existence of co causality which is weaker in the case of ws oda therefore these results may suggest that health education seems to take the baton from ws oda when certain levels of access have already been reached and it continues to improve on these levels by promoting the use of ws when the infrastructure is already available both sides of the coin supply and demand deserve careful consideration the conclusions reached by this study add to a growing line of research that discredits the most pessimistic visions on aid by providing a picture in which development assistance is generally found effective at the sectoral level by focusing on the impact of specific components of aid causal pathways are easier to detect and a positive effect is more likely to be found while the impact of overall aid on macroeconomic aggregates remains elusive thus the findings of this literature support the use of foreign aid and encourage donors to keep investing in cooperation while warning about the specific areas in which the outcomes are too uncertain the reforms needed in these cases however should be further informed by micro level analysis and case studies that can carefully assess the costs and benefits of aid efforts in specific locations in this line of research and regarding water and sanitation an interesting step forward would be to disaggregate the impact of aid in urban and rural areas since both supply and demand factors vary widely between cities and the countryside in particular health education programs may be expected to play a more important role in rural areas and in the sanitation sector where the knowledge of the health benefits of improved services is scarcer the study of these issues however will require better data than those currently available on aid disaggregated by both urban rural areas and water sanitation sectors credit author statement javier abellán conceptualization methodology formal analysis

8655,almost 800 million people lack access to basic water supply and almost 2000 million lack access to sanitation therefore achieving universal access remains a crucial goal of the global development agenda in order to shed light on whether international aid might help accomplish that goal this study evaluates its impact in a sample of 121 developing countries during 1990 2015 a new approach is adopted in which aid affects access not only through provision of infrastructure supply but also through health education demand additionally the long held concern about the persistence of impacts over time is addressed by estimating panel vector autoregressive models pvar the results show that both supply and demand side interventions financed by aid can contribute to promoting access to water but consistent long term investments are needed keywords water supply sanitation developing regions aid effectiveness jel classification q25 o18 f35 i12 1 introduction while the basic elements of modern water and sanitation ws services were almost fully developed in europe and north america by the middle of the 20th century many developing countries face a severe lack of access to improved ws still today 1 1 improved drinking water sources are those that have the potential to deliver safe water by nature of their design and construction and include water piped into private premises a household water connection located inside the user s dwelling plot or yard public taps or standpipes tube wells or boreholes protected dug wells protected springs and rainwater collection improved sanitation facilities include flush or pour flush systems piped to a sewer system septic tank or pit latrine ventilated pit latrines pit latrines with foundational slab and composting toilets this poses significant challenges for global development in different domains first the lack of access to improved ws is directly linked to poor health outcomes the evidence suggests that the lack of sanitation is associated with higher risk of diarrhea active trachoma some soil transmitted helminth sth infections and schistosomiasis 1 with infants and children being the most affected the lack of access to ws has detrimental effects on child nutrition 2 and on health indicators such as height and weight z scores 3 4 it is also associated with diarrheal morbidity among children 5 7 and infant mortality 8 the lack of access to ws also poses a significant public health risk related to the spread of epidemic diseases notably its association with cholera transmission is well attested 9 10 and recent research states that ensuring access to ws services is important for preventing covid 19 11 the ws health nexus intersects with gender and other development challenges 12 the lack of access to improved ws is associated with a lack of safe menstrual hygiene management 13 greater gender inequality and women s exposure to partner violence 14 16 women also carry a disproportionate psychosocial burden as a consequence of inequities in access to water and sanitation 17 finally the lack of access to these services may have far reaching implications for the general economy as ws related diseases undermine human capital formation and reduce the productivity of those who fall sick or must care for the sick 18 the importance of ws for global development has not gone unnoticed by the international community the millennium development goals mdgs included as target 10 the commitment to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to improved ws with the baseline year being 1990 over this period annual disbursements of official development assistance oda targeted for ws multiplied by 15 8 in real terms from us 386 million to us 6 088 billion 2015 dollars fortunately the proportion of people without access to water more than halved from 23 9 to 9 as for sanitation however the corresponding ratio only dropped from 47 1 to 32 5 19 with the approval of the new sustainable development goals sdgs in 2015 the objective on ws became to ensure access to safe water and sanitation for all oda is expected to substantially contribute to this endeavor but if the appropriate use of oda is to be ensured it is essential to evaluate its effectiveness during the mdg reference period in the first place that is the objective of this article the impact of oda on the proportion of population with access to improved ws is assessed while adding to the literature on this topic in a number of ways firstly this study employs a comprehensive panel of 121 aid recipient countries as registered by the oecd s creditor reporting system crs thus allowing conclusions to be drawn that can be considered of general validity and not limited to the specific sample of countries chosen it is also showed that the estimates for the average impact of aid at the global level are also valid for the regions most in need secondly this article emphasizes the role of micro level theoretical foundations in drawing causal pathways that can guide the specification of the empirical model for the evaluation of aid effectiveness at the aggregate level unlike previous research on this topic it is not assumed here that the mere provision of ws services automatically translates into use instead the use of improved ws is assumed to be the result of an individual decision making process in which improved ws are considered among other goods and services this approach allows to clearly identify factors related to demand and not only supply as potential determinants of use of improved ws services as a result the evaluation offered here considers not only the potential impact of oda for ws infrastructure henceforth ws oda but also the impact that oda for health education may have on the use of improved ws services 2 2 health education includes information education and training of the population for improving health knowledge and practices public health and awareness campaigns and promotion of improved personal hygiene practices including use of sanitation facilities and handwashing with soap it does not include other components of health oda such as medical services health care or infectious disease control malaria tuberculosis hiv aids etc finally the long held statistical concern about co causality between aid and outcomes has been better dealt with by introducing the use of panel vector autoregressive models pvar with simultaneous equations which assume that both aid and use of improved ws are endogenous variables additionally these models permit to assess the persistence of the effect of aid over time this being an aspect absent from previous literature the empirical strategy adopted and the results obtained by this study add to a growing literature on development policy evaluation suggesting that while the impact of overall aid on macroeconomic aggregates remains elusive a positive impact of some components of aid on sector specific outcomes is more likely to be found however a warning is made that the impacts of isolated aid flows can fade off as time passes if consistent long term investments are not put into place the remainder of the article is organized as follows section 2 reviews the body of literature that investigates the impact of aid on ws section 3 delineates the theoretical framework on which this study is based section 4 describes the data section 5 discusses the empirical strategy section 6 provides the results finally section 7 concludes with a summary and a discussion of policy implications 2 review of the literature the empirical evaluation of aid effectiveness has received significant attention in the scholarly literature since the 1980s however it has tended to focus on the relationship between overall aid and economic growth yielding conflicting results 20 23 as argued by bourguignon and sundberg 52 the ambiguous findings of this literature are in fact to be expected given the heterogeneity of aid motives the limitations of the tools of analysis and the complex causality chain linking aid to final outcomes similarly clemens et al 24 point out that one would not expect all the diverse types of aid to have similar effects and that this diversity might partly account for the wide ranging results reported in the literature for this reason some researchers have preferred to look for the impact of aid on non growth outcomes of direct interest such as education and health because these studies may benefit from clearer causal chains they are indeed more likely to find a significant impact even though they are not free from unclear results 25 within this literature on the effectiveness of aid at the sectoral level little attention has been paid to the ws sector this line of research emerged in the mid 2000s and is still at a nascent stage even so two waves of literature can be distinguished within this short period the first wave studies ranging from 2006 to 2014 used cross sectional regressions as their empirical strategy anand 26 and wolf 27 made the first such attempts neither found any impact of ws oda on access to ws at the national level botting et al 28 did find an impact on access to water but not on access to sanitation thus this group of studies conjured a rather pessimistic image concluding that ws oda had no impact on access to ws the second wave of studies has taken advantage of the availability of longer series of data allowing them to employ panel data models in the estimates and to better deal with unobserved heterogeneity among countries however a downside of this new wave of literature is that sanitation has been less studied than before bain et al 29 and wayland 30 focused on water only leaving sanitation aside their results are contradictory even though they employ similar statistical methods and sample size bain et al who used aid disbursements to ws found no evidence of a positive impact of aid on access to water however wayland who used commitments did find an impact gopalan and rajan 31 added methodological improvements such as the estimation of dynamic models by gmm in addition to static models already used by bain et al and wayland they found aid disbursements to produce a strong positive and significant effect on access to improved ws similar findings are provided by wayland 32 and ahmed 33 in this last case regarding the impact on access to water only whose studies are based on dynamic models however the results of these three articles are qualified by francois kakeu and kouame 34 who also employ dynamic models but do not find an impact of aid on sanitation in sub saharan africa the still scarce literature on the impact of ws oda on access to ws is therefore largely inconclusive four studies found no impact of aid on access to water or sanitation 26 27 29 34 only two studies found a positive impact on both water and sanitation 31 32 finally three studies that focused on water found different results while bain et al 29 did not observe any impact wayland 30 did and ahmed 33 only found impact when employing dynamic models 3 theoretical framework traditionally the literature on aid effectiveness adopts a supply side perspective ultimately inspired by economic growth theory while this may be justified when considering the relation between aid and recipient countries gdp the link is not so clear when it is transplanted to other areas of analysis the relation between aid and ws among them the use of many kinds of services is not a mere mechanical result of investment in the infrastructure required to provide them building a school does not guarantee that children will enroll creating an infrastructure for water or sanitation does not guarantee that people will use it 35 36 factors from the demand side related to people s preferences culture values and customs as well as to perceived benefits and costs are equally crucial in order to overcome this gap a new perspective rooted in individual decision making and expected utility maximization is adopted in this study in accordance with this approach the variable of interest is not the supply or provision of ws to a population i e available infrastructure but the use of such services by the population this is the full meaning of the indicator called access by the joint monitoring program jmp the official indicator for monitoring progress towards target 10 of the mdgs 3 3 this is so because the coverage rates are based on information from service users on actual household use and not merely on availability while the estimates are based on use the jmp reports use as access because access is the term used in the mdg target for drinking water and sanitation 37 consequently both terms are used indistinctly throughout this article the mdg target on ws is to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation this goal can be disaggregated into a number of separate targets regarding individual use of improved ws if r k a k n k is the ratio of total number of people using improved ws a k to total population n k in country k then a k is the sum of the individual values of b i for each inhabitant i of country k 1 a k i 1 n b i i 1 n where b i equals 1 if individual i uses improved ws and 0 otherwise now we turn to the question of how the value of b i for each individual i is determined it is assumed that individual i demonstrates well behaved preferences i e monotonic and convex preferences and makes decisions with the aim of maximizing their expected utility u i that depends positively on the quantity of goods and services consumed individual i faces an optimization problem with a budgetary constraint 2 max u i x subject to j 1 n p j x j i r i where x x 1 i x n i is a vector of quantities of n goods and services with x j i being the quantity of the good or service j for j 1 n and where p j is the price of x j and r i is the individual s budget now let x n i be the quantity of improved ws services used by individual i with x 1 i x n 1 i being the rest of goods and services including unimproved ws education etc the optimization problem faced by an important share of the world population reaches a corner solution where x n i 0 and consequently b i 0 in order for development assistance to succeed in its goal it is necessary to increase the number of individuals whose optimization problem leads to a solution where x n i 0 and therefore b i 1 the more individuals that make this transition from b i 0 to b i 1 the more the aggregate a k increases and so does the official mdg target variable r k a k n k 4 4 this goal can be referred to as an extensive rather than an intensive one meaning that the goal as officially formulated is not to increase the amount of improved ws used by each individual regardless their initial level that is to increase x n i t so that x n i t 1 x n i t but to increase the amount used only by those who are initially at x n i t 0 so that x n i t 1 0 the increase in the individual use of improved ws can be achieved in two ways either by relaxing the individual s budgetary constraint or by affecting the specific form of the individual s utility function in turn a possible way of modifying the budgetary constraint is by reducing the fixed costs associated to the use of improved ws such as those needed for the installation of on site facilities but also opportunity costs such as for instance the time spent travelling the distance to the nearest water source and the time spent waiting in line once there 38 39 5 5 the budgetary constraint can also be modified by increasing household income which can be a general outcome of the aggregate oda but not likely as a consequence of the sectoral oda on ws the constraint could also be modified by pushing p n down although this price is established by local providers of improved ws and it is not usually the aim of development assistance to alter this these fixed costs can be formalized as a capitation tax t applied only when x n i 0 thus t reflects the income that the individual either devotes to installing a new facility or else stops earning in the labor market when they decide to spend time carrying water home then in the presence of these fixed costs the constrained optimization problem actually faced by the individual is 3 max u i x subject to j 1 n p j x j i r i if x n i 0 j 1 n p j x j i t r i if x n i 0 in this context ws oda may help reduce t for example via the increase of the number of available water points by doing so the budgetary constraint is modified and there is the possibility that a new equilibrium can be reached where x n i 0 although that would depend on both the magnitude of such reduction and the actual shape of the utility function an alternative way of promoting the use of improved ws that is of pushing x n i up is to modify the specific form of the individual s utility function u i namely by achieving an increment in u i x n i a possible manner of doing this is suggested by evidence that the more people understand the health benefits of using improved ws the more likely they are willing to pay for these services 40 thus if x n 1 i is the consumption of health education from now on h e by the individual i it can be assumed that an increase in the quantity consumed of h e leads to an increase in the marginal utility of x n h e i u i x n i 0 that is health education and improved ws services are q complements following the terminology established by hicks 41 this means that once the recipients of health education financed by oda are provided with better information about the health benefits of improved ws their preferences are expected to change in favor of these services giving rise to the possibility of a new equilibrium with a consumption decision where x n i 0 6 6 other factors such as convenience and status are also important determinants of demand for ws an illustrative case is provided by reis and mollinga 42 the demand for safe sanitation appliances offered within a microcredit program was concentrated on a relatively expensive beautiful latrine because latrines were being valued as a status symbol for relatively better off households 4 data in the empirical work r k is represented by two objective variables the share of population with access to improved water and the share of population with access to improved sanitation the concept of access to improved ws see note 1 for a brief account of facilities included served as the official instrument for monitoring progress towards target 10 of the mdgs and is a precondition for access to safely managed ws this being the target indicator established by the current sdgs 43 thus the concept of improved ws is still relevant in global policy practice and allows to evaluate the effectiveness of aid in the ws sector while long time series on access to safely managed ws become available data were sourced from the world bank s world development indicators wdi database which in turn takes its information from the jmp administered by unicef and who 7 7 once the mdgs were replaced by the sdgs the definition of the objective variables changed the last version of the wdi that included the mdg oriented variables is that of april 2018 for that reason all the variables that have been sourced from the wdi come from this version of the database regarding the variables that may affect r k a guide can be found in the theoretical framework developed above 4 1 supply side factors as stated before the opportunity costs represented by t may be reduced by an increase of supply of the service this supply can be financed internally as by local government expenditure or externally as by development assistance the latter is one of the two explanatory variables of interest for this study a single variable including gross disbursements of oda for both water and sanitation infrastructure ws oda is used in the empirical work separate information about each type of oda is not available and additionally using separate variables would be not appropriate because of the existence of narrow links between both sectors data were sourced from the oecd s crs code 140 a total of 155 aid recipient countries during the period 1990 2015 are considered see appendix a but due to missing data the maximum number of recipients included in the regression analysis is 121 almost half of ws oda is allocated to the construction of large systems of ws and about a fifth is intended for basic infrastructure for a detailed breakdown see appendix c all amounts are expressed in 2015 us dollars per capita 8 8 data on both ws oda and health education oda were sourced from the project level files 18 january 2019 version and aggregated at the national level any type of oda budget support project type interventions technical assistance etc is included all channels public sector ngos public private partnerships etc are taken into account but only official flows are considered private development finance is out of the scope of this study because reliable data on these flows began to be available only recently in order to compute disbursements per inhabitant population data were sourced from the wdi apart from external financing the supply of ws can also be financed internally because there is no single database with comprehensive panel data on local government expenditures on ws gdp per capita has been included in the model as a broad indicator on the local capacity to provide the population with ws 9 9 gopalan and rajan 31 managed to compile some sparse estimates on local government expenditures on ws from secondary reports but only for a small number of countries and years it is expected to show a positive relation with access to ws data were sourced from the wdi and amounts are expressed in constant 2011 international dollars ppp per capita the share of urban population was also included as a variable that may affect the costs of using ws since populations in urban contexts are more densely distributed the same expenditure on ws can provide coverage to more people in urban settings than in rural areas therefore a positive relation with access is expected data were sourced from the wdi supply of ws can also be affected by institutional factors particularly democracies have been found to provide safe water and public sanitation far above dictatorships 44 this is the reason why the democracy score developed by the center of systemic peace has been included in the model as a control variable the indicator ranges from strongly autocratic 10 to strongly democratic 10 so a positive impact on access is expected similarly corruption may lead to increased prices or reduced supply of ws for a given level of expenditure for this reason the model also includes an average measure of corruption provided by the varieties of democracy project its directionality runs from less corrupt 0 to more corrupt 1 so a negative relation with access is expected 4 2 demand side factors the most evident factor of demand for any good or service including ws is income which has already been discussed as a supply side factor the expected positive impact of gdp per capita on access to ws also applies to its condition as a demand side factor since households with higher incomes can afford a more intensive use of ws services 10 10 arguably the effect of gdp per capita may be modulated by inequality however reliable data on income inequality are remarkably scarce in developing countries for this reason income inequality or more accurately the component of income inequality that is not correlated with other control variables is included in the error term of our models this is not expected to affect the estimated impact of aid on access to ws since short term variations in inequality and aid are not significantly correlated aid fluctuates considerably in short periods of time while statistically significant variations in inequality can only be observed in relatively long periods following the suggested theoretical framework the use of improved ws is also influenced by the marginal utility of these services which in turn depends on the individual s knowledge about their health benefits thus higher levels of at least basic education are expected to increase the use of improved ws the logarithm of mean years of education has been employed as a measure of basic education data were sourced from the undp s human development data bank in the same line the demand for ws can be influenced by oda oriented to health education insofar as it can improve citizens levels of information around the effects of the use of improved ws on health and may improve their knowledge on how to use them properly as a consequence oda for health education was included in the models as a second explanatory variable of interest data were sourced from crs code 12261 for the components of health education oda see note 2 lastly since a large fraction of oda is channeled through national governments the number and quality of health education programs actually carried out with external funding can be negatively affected by corruption thus the supply side negative effect of this variable is reinforced by its demand side effect summary statistics of both objective and explanatory variables are presented in table 1 5 empirical strategy in a cross country setting r k may be affected by measurable factors that change over time such as those presented in section 4 but also by factors that do not change over time or that change at a rather slow pace and are difficult to measure these latter types of factors constitute what has been called unobserved heterogeneity and include among others geographical factors such as climate aridity etc as well as institutional or cultural factors in order to account for these factors the following equation is estimated as a baseline fixed effects model 4 r k t β x k t δ k γ t u k t where r k t is the rate of access to improved w s in country k at time t δ k is the country fixed effect γ t is a time fixed effect that accounts for factors that vary over time but equally affect all countries x k t is a matrix including the variables presented in section 4 which may affect access in country k at time t and u k t is the error term β is a vector of parameters to be estimated correlations for explanatory variables can be found in table 2 oda has been included in the model using logarithms instead of the original series as in gopalan and rajan 31 this specification shows a higher explanatory capacity meaning that the effect of oda on access to ws seems to be non linear it is also common in the literature to measure oda as the average of a number of past time periods in order to soften a portion of the volatility that oda is supposed to exert given its irregular nature but also due to possible errors of measurement in this study two different models have been estimated one of them containing yearly data and another with the variable expressed as the average of the past five years in this last case the regressions have been run taking into account only years 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 by taking the average the impact of long infrastructure projects can be better captured while yearly data would be more likely to show the effect of shorter projects in basic infrastructures as well as health education both models are estimated by making use of ordinary least squares ols apart from volatility another source of concern when evaluating the impact of aid is the possible existence of endogeneity or co causality this is because just as ws aid is expected to have an impact on access it is also expected to respond to this indicator by flowing in a greater magnitude to those countries that need it most i e that present lower rates of access in order to avoid this issue one possible estimation alternative is the use of instrumental variables thus the model has also been estimated by making use of two stages least squares 2sls where the aid variables have been instrumented with their first lags the instrumental variables are strongly correlated with current aid ρ 0 75 for ws oda and ρ 0 69 for health education oda various test statistics for the instrumental variable estimation are reported in appendix b as shown in section 6 the estimations based on static models from equation 4 prove to be of little use in explaining the impact of ws oda this may be due to the static nature of the model objective and explanatory variables are assumed to be linked in levels meaning that as increases in oda are expected to lead to increases in r k t reductions in oda would lead to reductions in r k t this assumption may not be appropriate when assessing the effectiveness of ws oda which is mostly allocated to financing projects of infrastructure in this case the output built infrastructure can hardly be expected to decrease as oda does therefore a reduction in oda could most probably lead to a stagnation or a smaller increase rather than to a decline in the level of access to test this possibility an alternative model has been estimated including the dependent variable as an interannual variation 5 r k t r k t 1 β x k t δ k γ t u k t explanatory variables other than oda have also been included in the models as variations as they are expected to be related to the objective variable in levels by examining the impact of oda on the interannual variation in access some evidence is found that the relation between oda and access may in fact be dynamic instead of static for that reason a third specification has been employed where the dynamic nature of the model is made explicit by including the lagged dependent variable in the right side of the equation as an explanatory factor 6 r k t α r k t 1 β x k t δ k γ t u k t where the lagged dependent variable r k t 1 captures the effects of aid in t 1 which are not expected to completely dissapear in t even if new aid falls to zero thus r k t 1 causes accumulation of aid effects over time note that both equation 4 and equation 5 are special cases of equation 6 with α 0 and α 1 respectively because the estimated values of α in equation 6 are close to 1 see table 4 and table 6 the β coefficients associated with aid in equation 6 can be interpreted as those in equation 5 that is the impact of aid on the interannual variation in access finally to account for the possibility of endogeneity an equation system has been employed even if the issue of endogeneity can be addressed to some extent with the use of single equation dynamic models such as those employed by gopalan and rajan 31 ahmed 33 francois et al 34 and wayland 32 they cannot provide estimates for the cumulative impact of aid over time considering the intermediate impacts among all endogenous variables consequently a long run view of the lagged structure of aid impacts is missing from previous studies on the topic with the aim of providing such a view dynamic autoregressive simultaneous equation models are adopted in this study thus in addition to equation 6 two more equations relate the explanatory variables of interest ws oda and health education oda to r k t 1 and the rest of the independent variables because applying fixed effects estimates to dynamic panels could potentially lead to significantly biased ols coefficients a panel data vector autoregressive pvar model has been estimated through the gmm method 11 11 all statistical analysis was performed using stata 15 to estimate pvar models the program pvar developed by abrigo and love 45 has been used the pvar model assumes that access ws oda and health education oda are all endogenous variables although each of them has a different degree of endogeneity the identification strategy used here follows a cholesky decomposition which depends on the ordering of variables according to their relative endogeneity the ordering adopted assumes that the rate of access influences oda disbursements before these can have an effect on access since donors decisions are usually based on recipients needs while ws oda is more likely to influence contemporaneous health education oda than the other way around because the promotion of demand is usually pursued when efforts in the supply side are already in place using this causal ordering the implied impulse response functions irf and forecast error variance decompositions fevd are calculated the irf confidence intervals are computed using 200 monte carlo draws based on the estimated model 6 results 6 1 the impact of oda on access to water table 3 shows the results from the static models for the impact of oda on access to improved water where the dependent variable is measured in levels columns 1 3 and in variations columns 4 6 as already observed by ndikumana and pickbourn 18 if the relation between oda and access is assumed to be in levels 1 3 the coefficients for ws oda show a counterintuitive negative sign although they are commonly not different from zero at the usual confidence levels the impact of health education oda is positive in all the model specifications the negative expected value of the coefficient associated with ws oda could be partly explained by the fact that we are considering a static relation between ws oda and access when the relation is in fact dynamic some evidence in favor of this possibility is found in the results shown in columns 4 6 obtained when using first differences in the dependent variable here the signs of the coefficients turn positive and significantly different from zero in all cases considering models 4 6 a one percent increase in ws oda per capita is associated with an interannual variation in the rate of access to water of between 0 0014 and 0 0066 percentage points higher with a confidence of 95 12 12 the coefficient associated to ws oda shows its highest expected value in model 6 a one percent increase in the average amount of yearly ws oda received over the past five years is associated with a five year variation in the rate of access of between 0 0082 and 0 0323 percentage points higher with a confidence of 95 nevertheless if this contribution to five year variation is assumed to be evenly distributed over time the expected yearly contribution would be between 0 0082 5 0 0016 and 0 0323 5 0 0065 percentage points which almost perfectly matches the range of 0 0014 0 0066 suggested by models 4 5 this effect may seem rather small however if ws oda is related to the variation in access instead of the level of access it would mean that once a given disbursement is made its effect persists for some time and consequently the impacts of subsequent aid disbursements can accumulate to give rise to a significant effect in the long term to better test the dynamic nature of the relation between oda and access a pvar model has been estimated the results contained in table 4 point to a positive impact of both ws oda and health education oda on access to water the expected impacts of both types of oda on access one year later are fairly similar per increase of one percent with that of ws oda 0 0020 being only 17 6 higher than that of health education oda 0 0017 regarding the coefficients of the control variables none is significantly different from zero probably because their effects are already captured by the lagged dependent variable 13 13 it has already been noted by previous authors on aid effectiveness that regressions with lagged dependent variables in particular when using general method of moments gmm tend to find a low number of significant regressors 25 as for oda as a dependent variable the level of access is found to increase the amount of both types of oda received one year later with a higher effect on health education oda in a pvar model however what is truly interesting is the cumulative impact over time of exogenous changes in one variable on the rest taking into account the intermediate impacts among all endogenous variables in terms of levels the irf shows that while a positive shock on any type of oda leads to an increased rate of access as soon as one year later this impact does not reach its maximum until three or four years after the disbursement graph 1 this finding which was expected for infrastructure projects with long lead times also holds to a lesser extent for health education which implies that certain changes in behavior can also take some time to show up a one percent increase in health education oda raises the rate of access by more than 0 002 percentage points in the long run while the effect of a shock of the same magnitude in ws oda is expected to be about 0 003 percentage points from four years after the shock onward nonetheless the effect of ws oda while expected to be somewhat higher is also more uncertain in the long run the estimated contribution of health education oda to the rate of access to water may range from about 0 0001 to 0 0003 percentage points with a confidence of 95 while the contribution of ws oda may range from 0 0006 percentage points to the neighborhood of zero in fact this finding that points to a positive but uncertain effect of ws oda on access to water in the long run is consistent with field experience that has already warned about the sustainability of ws infrastructures 46 47 factors such as the capacity and willingness of local governments to provide and finance post construction support the willingness and ability of water users to pay tariffs and the availability of reliable maintenance resources might explain why the impact of ws oda becomes more difficult to measure accurately as time passes thus these issues should be urgently addressed in order to make sure that the impact of foreign aid persists over long time periods this is important because even if the aforementioned estimates may portray the image of negligible effects it is necessary to keep in mind that these are effects from one shot infusions of aid which are expected to accumulate if consistent and long run investments are put into place moreover since the aggregated rates of access to ws change rather slowly what seems negligible in absolute numbers may not be so in relative terms based on the fevd estimates as much as 9 7 of variation in the rate of access to water can be explained by ws oda in a forecast horizon of ten years and 4 2 can be explained by health education oda see appendix d this means that on average at least 13 9 of observed long term variation in national rates of access to water can be explained by oda therefore even if it is other determinants that account for most of the progress these results show that the contribution of development assistance has been generally positive and significant 6 2 the impact of oda on access to sanitation as for access to sanitation the static models do not identify any relation between ws oda and access while they do find a positive impact of health education oda see table 5 if we measure the impact on interannual variations ws oda again turns to a positive sign in two of the specifications the estimated values of the coefficients are however lower than in the case of water and this relation disappears when using five year averages the explanatory capacity of the models as measured by the r squared is also significantly lower the pvar model finds the impact of health education to again be positive and persistent over time see table 6 and graph 2 a one percent increase in health education oda is expected to increase the rate of access to sanitation by 0 0020 percentage points one year later and that effect persists for at least ten years nonetheless based on the fevd estimates only as much as 1 1 of variation in access can be explained by health education oda at a forecast horizon of ten years see appendix e so the effect is persistent but of small relative importance with the same forecast horizon as much as 3 6 of variation in health education can be explained by the rate of access thus there is evidence of reverse causality but its magnitude is also small regarding ws oda the model fails to find a consistent relation with access to sanitation in the same way that static models in differences show worse results than in the case of access to water a likely explanation to this finding is the well known emphasis that development assistance placed on water over sanitation in the mdg era 48 crs data does not allow a full accounting for this bias but those items that can be differentiated into water and sanitation oriented show a clear bias in favor of water thus large systems of sanitation received us 2 29 billion of 2015 dollars between 1990 and 2015 which makes little more than 50 of the us 4 32 billion allocated to large systems of water supply the same applies to basic sanitation which received only us 855 98 million or about 40 of the us 2 01 billion received by basic water supply see appendix c although lack of investment does not necessarily translate into lack of effectiveness it may ultimately reflect a lack of interest which could lead to relatively poor performance in interventions and thus to lower impacts the role played by local governments might also be of great importance most basic sanitation technologies are not expensive to implement but those facing the problems of inadequate sanitation may not be aware of either the origin of their ills or the true costs of poor sanitation and hygiene and as a result they are hard to convince of the need to invest scarce resources in sanitation 49 it should come as no surprise then that the impact of ws oda is highly uncertain this in turn might explain the positive and persistent impact of health education which could be helping to change that state of mind if this interpretation is correct it could be concluded that investment in education builds human capital just as investment in infrastructure builds physical capital the former being more difficult to destroy than the latter 6 3 a regional look less effective where most needed the results presented above come from the analysis of a large sample of countries from all regions of the developing world which allow to draw relevant global conclusions on the average effect of oda on access to improved ws however the problems and challenges regarding ws vary widely among different world regions in particular ws related deaths remain especially high in parts of south asia and much of sub saharan africa and expert forecasts have warned that health losses will likely remain high in these two regions over the medium term 50 it is therefore sensible to ask whether foreign aid has been less effective in these areas or whether on the contrary it can be of particular help to those that need it most in order to answer this question the pvar models discussed above have been reestimated including interactions terms between oda variables and regional dummy variables for sub saharan africa and south asia the results presented in table 7 show that none of the interaction terms included in the models are significantly different from zero thus suggesting that the estimates for the average impact of oda at the global level are also valid for the regions that are most in need accordingly foreign aid would not have been less effective in these areas nor would it have a higher transformative power compared to its impact in other parts of the developing world the aforementioned notwithstanding a brief remark should be made although the confidence intervals of the regional effects are relatively large their estimated coefficients tend to show a negative sign in the case of ws oda while they all show a positive sign for health education oda this pattern might be suggesting that there are regional differences in the relative impact of supply side and demand side interventions in the ws sector even if they cannot be measured accurately in the context of this study hopefully future research will be able to shed light on whether complementing infrastructure with health education would be especially effective in those regions where progress seems to be harder to achieve 7 conclusions global rates of access to improved water and sanitation increased over the period 1990 2015 but progress was uneven and the role played by development assistance in these trends has not been fully disentangled this study has tried to shed light on this matter in a number of ways firstly it provides a theoretical framework that opens a new way of addressing the interpretation of causal pathways in the evaluation of the impact of development assistance for the water and sanitation sector secondly it applies new empirical methods that are considered more suitable to the theoretical perspective that has been adopted two main conclusions have been reached as a result first the relation between oda for water and sanitation infrastructure and the rates of access to water seems to be dynamic in nature meaning that the impacts of individual disbursements may accumulate over time to yield remarkable results if consistent long term investments are put into place otherwise even if isolated infusions of aid can be credited for up to a tenth of observed progress in access to water ten years after the disbursement they can also fade off as time passes as for the impact of oda for infrastructure on access to sanitation no general rule has been found it is commonly known that this sector has been under considered in comparison to water supply which might account for that result more careful consideration of sanitation is needed especially given that progress in this sector has been observed as more uneven than in access to water second oda for health education seems to have a persistent positive impact on the use of both water and sanitation services although this effect is relatively small in comparison to that of oda for infrastructure the persistent effect of health education might be due to the positive reinforcement between this type of oda and the levels of access due to the existence of co causality which is weaker in the case of ws oda therefore these results may suggest that health education seems to take the baton from ws oda when certain levels of access have already been reached and it continues to improve on these levels by promoting the use of ws when the infrastructure is already available both sides of the coin supply and demand deserve careful consideration the conclusions reached by this study add to a growing line of research that discredits the most pessimistic visions on aid by providing a picture in which development assistance is generally found effective at the sectoral level by focusing on the impact of specific components of aid causal pathways are easier to detect and a positive effect is more likely to be found while the impact of overall aid on macroeconomic aggregates remains elusive thus the findings of this literature support the use of foreign aid and encourage donors to keep investing in cooperation while warning about the specific areas in which the outcomes are too uncertain the reforms needed in these cases however should be further informed by micro level analysis and case studies that can carefully assess the costs and benefits of aid efforts in specific locations in this line of research and regarding water and sanitation an interesting step forward would be to disaggregate the impact of aid in urban and rural areas since both supply and demand factors vary widely between cities and the countryside in particular health education programs may be expected to play a more important role in rural areas and in the sanitation sector where the knowledge of the health benefits of improved services is scarcer the study of these issues however will require better data than those currently available on aid disaggregated by both urban rural areas and water sanitation sectors credit author statement javier abellán conceptualization methodology formal analysis

8656,drip irrigation is claimed to save water and fertilizers and improve land productivity considerable recent evidence supports the water saving effect of drip irrigation techniques but little attention has been given to the effect on fertilizer savings and land productivity improvement this study examines the effects of collective and individual drip irrigation cdi and idi respectively on fertilizer use intensity and land productivity using a multinomial endogenous switching treatment regression and a survey dataset collected in awati county xinjiang we found that 1 on average cdi reduces fertilizer use intensity by 10 31 but idi increases it by 5 57 and 2 compared to idi cdi improves land productivity by more than 13 65 moreover based on quantitative analyses we found that 3 a high frequency of mutual adjustment of fertigation an information coordination mechanism gives cdi these advantages the policy implications are to continue the top down promotion of cdi technology and strengthen the information coordination on fertigation during the operation of cdi systems keywords drip irrigation fertilizer use land productivity information coordination treatment effects rural china 1 introduction drip irrigation is frequently touted by inventors and policymakers as a plot or basin level solution to water shortage issues therefore drip irrigation is widely promoted especially in regions that experience high water stress china is home to the largest land area with drip irrigation system coverage in the world 1 in 2017 the area with drip micro irrigation systems totaled 6 283 5 kha 2 xinjiang accounts for 56 of the chinese drip irrigation area 2 in xinjiang there are two types of drip irrigation systems specifically collective and individual i e idi and cdi respectively an idi system simply imitates the components of cdi but involves only one smallholder and his or her plot smallholders individually use and maintain idi systems a cdi project is built on multiple segments of farmland owned by small households and thus involves multiple farmers the multiple farmers involved in the same project are self organized as a cdi group and collectively take charge of the daily use management and maintenance of their cdi system in southern xinjiang an organization like information coordination mechanism is applied by cdi groups to coordinate information on collective irrigation and fertigation this information includes members demand for water and nutrients topographic and environmental information for all the plots involved in the cdi project and knowledge on the fertigation process and the operation of cdi facilities however much evidence challenges the status of drip irrigation as a plot or basin level solution to water shortage issues in rajasthan india the saiss plain and the souss and tensift basins in morocco and the rio grande valley in the united states 3 4 according to evidence from morocco and burkina faso one reason for the failure to save water at the plot level is that farmers are not interested in saving water 3 5 in china strict water quantity standards define the authorized water use capacity water quota based on the irrigation area and are strictly enforced at every level in southern xinjiang a semiarid region at the household level water fees are charged based on irrigation areas and plot level irrigation water gauges are lacking 1 1 this lack of water gauges also results in a lack of irrigation water quantity data this is a practical reason for why we do not focus on irrigation water productivity or use efficiency therefore households tend to use equal water quantities and all the water available for an irrigation area unit in addition the local surface irrigation water is mainly sourced from glacier melt due to the local climate in southern xinjiang the irrigation water supply in spring is insufficient but flooding is common in summer and autumn therefore considering the fixed water quantity allotment and fluctuating local water supply drip irrigation technology can be applied to stabilize the water supply and to save water to increase land productivity at the plot level in addition to saving water and stabilizing the water supply and thus increasing agricultural productivity drip irrigation can save fertilizer through the use of fertigation techniques at the farm scale and outperform the traditional fertilization used in furrow irrigation setups 5 6 fertilizer savings are highly important in arid and semiarid regions where the natural environment is fragile this is because some environmental problems such as atmospheric warming climate change and nutrient overloading in water bodies are direct or indirect consequences of the residual effects of chemical fertilizer use and fertilizer runoff 7 however among small chinese farmers there is a general belief that increasing fertilizer use increases agricultural production and that reducing fertilizer use reduces agricultural production 8 that is potential overfertigation can occur with negative effects on land productivity these results imply that such beliefs may weaken the fertilizer saving and land productivity improving benefits of drip irrigation if no incentives or interventions are used that is although drip irrigation technology may have the potential to reduce fertilizer use it is not clear whether the fertilizer saving and land productivity improving benefits of drip irrigation exist in the context of such beliefs previous empirical evidence from morocco and burkina faso revealed that drip irrigation did not result in input e g water and labor savings at the plot level as inventors and policymakers claimed that it would 3 5 few studies provide empirical evidence of the claimed fertilizer saving effect of drip irrigation therefore the objective of this paper is to estimate whether compared with flooding irrigation cdi and idi actually reduce fertilizer use intensity fui and increase land productivity lp at the plot level in the chinese context considering equal and fixed water quotas and smallholders fertilization beliefs the empirical analysis is based on a dataset with information on 599 cotton households 1 132 cotton plots and 18 cdi projects collected in awati county xinjiang in 2017 we found that cdi has an obvious advantage in terms of reducing fui and increasing lp we also account for this advantage of cdi as much as possible by examining the effects of the information coordination mechanism on this advantage in southern xinjiang farmers suffer deep poverty due to the inactive off farm labor market and land rental market farmers deeply rely on fixed farmland and associated agricultural income considering the local fragile natural environment insight into the actual fertilizer saving and lp improving effects of cdi and idi is important for drip irrigation promotion and the recent policy reforms aimed at poverty reduction and environmental protection in southern xinjiang and other similar regions of china such insight is also helpful for understanding the actual fertigation practices in drip irrigation systems in other countries where this technology is widely promoted such as spain morocco mexico brazil iran and india this paper contributes to the literature in two ways first we provide empirical evidence of the effect of drip irrigation systems on fertilizer use and lp by focusing on the difference between the two types of drip irrigation systems we also provide an explanation of the advantage of cdi in terms of reducing fertilizer and improving lp based on quantitative analyses second in contrast to previous studies we use the average treatment effect on the treated att to quantify the actual fertigation and lp of cdi and idi by applying the multinomial endogenous switching treatment regression mestr technique to address the issues related to endogeneity between multiple technology choices and actual fertigation and lp for example innate managerial and technical abilities related to agriculture may affect both technology choices and agricultural performance the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the background information on the research site section 3 describes a conceptual and econometric model of the relationships in question a brief introduction of the dataset is provided in section 4 the estimation results are interpreted in section 5 and section 6 presents our conclusions 2 research site and data collection 2 1 research site our research site fig 1 is situated in awati county aksu prefecture in southwestern xinjiang which neighbors the northern edge of the taklimakan desert awati county is known as the land of long staple cotton a designation given by the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china prc in 2001 in 2015 the total sown area of cotton was 1 345 806 mu 2 2 15 mu 1 ha ninety five percent of this total sown area 1 285 000 mu was not intercropped and the remainder was a pure stand that was intercropped with fruit e g jujube and walnut trees 9 a total of 41 6 of the total cotton sown area 559 763 mu was fertigated by cdi systems agriculture bureau of awati county 2015a a total of 17 3 of the cdi area 96 839 mu was cultivated by small farmers the remaining area was cultivated by agricultural companies 36 however there are no official data on the area fertigated by idi in awati county idi systems consist of a private well a pump powered by a tracker a fertilizer dissolver and a private surface pipe system cdi systems are made up of a shared water storing facility a pump system a fertilizer dissolver an underground tube system and a private surface pipe system located on pieces of farmland fig 2 cdi groups hire one or several local farmers as full time irrigators to operate check and maintain cdi systems to uniformly irrigate and fertigate all plots located in the project based on the irrigation and fertigation schedule and rules these schedules and rules are made by the cdi groups based on the xinjiang government s technical guidelines users water and nutrient needs and the geographical characteristics of the project one obvious difference between idi and cdi is the information coordination mechanism based on ref 30 we identified three coordination channels for water and fertilizer application in the cdi group idi systems are not equipped with such channels first process standardization standardizes the cdi system s general content and fertigation procedures the local government provides a technical guide 3 3 the xinjiang uygur autonomous region agricultural high efficiency water saving irrigation technical guide is published by the water resources department of xinjiang uygur autonomous region and the irrigation and drainage development center a division of the ministry of water resources of china to standardize the fertigation process and asks cdi projects to comply with this guide and keep relevant records second skills and knowledge standardization standardizes irrigators skills and knowledge regarding the daily operation such as water pressure control assessment and maintenance of fertigation systems this standardization is enforced by training irrigators in local areas such training is not compulsory or regular third mutual adjustment is used to coordinate the information on users nutrient demand the geographical characteristics of plots the cost of fertilizers and the knowledge of cdi among cdi groups and irrigators to achieve mutual adjustment cdi groups organize cdi users and irrigators to attend meetings before the irrigation season starts after mutual adjustment the cdi group makes a group decision on the fertigation order of the plots and what and how much fertilizer should be purchased and used 2 2 data collection the dataset used for the empirical analysis was obtained from a rural household survey conducted in awati county in february 2017 a multiple stratified sampling strategy was used to select 774 households detailed information can be found in 35 thirty five of the interviewed households indicated that they were not involved in farmland cultivation and were therefore excluded from the analysis because households usually cultivate many plots it is a very time consuming task to collect information on all plots we therefore collected information on a maximum of four plots per interviewed household specifically the two largest contracted plots and the two largest wasteland plots 4 4 a contracted plot is assigned following the implementation of the household responsibility system wasteland refers to land converted from desert land that can be developed by farm households or local government cited from ref 10 in awati county wasteland developed by the local government is usually leased to farm households this procedure resulted in 1 763 plots we collected information on households and cdi projects separately cdi projects were randomly selected in each village out of the 17 selected villages 2 villages did not have any installed well cdi projects to sample and were therefore excluded from the cdi project selection notably the number of cdi projects chosen was based on the total number of cdi projects and the heterogeneity in terms of the cdi project and group size land tenure crop type and the operation situation finally 39 cdi projects were included which accounted for 83 of the total installed well cdi projects in the 15 villages we used the names of the irrigation managers and or the number of village groups reported on the cdi project questionnaire and household questionnaire to match the data which led to data loss because the cdi projects in which the included plots were located may not have been selected the final survey dataset had information on 599 cotton households 1 132 cotton plots and 18 cdi projects in our 2016 sample there were 154 cdi plot sections cdi subsample 198 idi plot sections idi subsample and 780 flooding irrigation plot sections fi subsample fui refers to the quantity of fertilizers used per unit area of a plot on average the greatest fui is used by the idi subsample 98 83 kg mu the second greatest is used by the cdi subsample 96 14 kg mu and the third greatest is used by the fi subsample 83 68 kg mu the fui is significantly greater in both the cdi and idi subsamples than in the fi subsample at the 1 significance level lp is measured as the production quantity of all crops planted in a unit area of a plot on average the greatest lp is in the cdi subsample 346 27 kg mu the second greatest is in the idi subsample 308 51 kg mu and the third greatest is in the fi subsample 280 39 kg mu the fui and lp distributions by fertilization method are presented in fig 3 the distributions show indications of negative skewness with a smaller variance in the cdi subsample than in the fi subsample 3 econometric analysis framework at the household level farmland is fixed or quasi fixed input in awati county for three reasons first the contracting relationship for farmland between farmers and village committees remains stable and permanent based on the law of the prc on the contracting of rural land second wasteland is leased from village committees for a certain period usually 5 years and the tenant has priority to continue leasing therefore contracted land and wasteland have a stable land tenure third the local farmland rental market is inactive little contracted land and wasteland are rented between farmers measuring land input s partial factor productivity 5 5 the productivity change of the variable inputs should be properly measured by the total factor productivity decomposition approach 11 i e lp provides helpful insight into the utilization of agricultural technology and variable inputs as fertilizers 11 therefore following a partial productivity approach this paper measures the productivity and fertilizer input of a unit of farmland as our focus outcome variables i e lp and fui this study is interested in lp and fui changes when cotton farmers choose to use cdi or idi instead of flooding irrigation however there may be potential selection bias and endogeneity problems that provide inconsistent estimates of the actual change specifically farmers may endogenously self select into these three subsamples additionally fertilization decisions are likely to be influenced by unobserved or unobservable 6 6 we use unobserved to refer to factors that are measurable but for which we have no data e g soil temperature and unobservable to refer to factors that are challenging to measure e g a farmer s motivation or managerial skills note that the two are used interchangeably factors that may be correlated with fui and lp e g unobservable innate managerial and technical abilities related to agriculture unlike propensity score matching and the endogenous switching model the mestr model not only handles multivalued choices but also resolves unobserved and unobservable selection bias and endogeneity 34 this model introduces a multinomial logit selection mls model in the first stage to handle multivalued choices and calculates an inverse mills ratio by using the theory of truncated normal distribution and a latent factor structure to correct the selection bias from unobserved variables the second stage models the effect of cdi on fui by using ordinary least squares ols with selection correction terms i e an inverse mills ratio 3 1 the first stage of the mestr model in the first step assuming that households choose the fertilization method that maximizes their utility first their fertilization method decision can be expressed as a latent choice model 1 u i j i k α 1 j x j i k α 2 j x j i ε j i k where u i j i k is the ith household utility for fertilization method j used on plot k with the methods including cdi idi and flooding irrigation x j i k is a set of observable exogenous variables such as household plot level and regional characteristics and ε j i k is the random error term we use plot level information to address the problem of households unobserved characteristics that result in inconsistent estimations recent literature has applied plot level data as panel data to control farm specific effects 12 we follow the 13 mundlak s approach where the means x j i of the plot varying independent variables including the fertility soil type salinization and plot location i e distance to a village level canal are used to control for the unobserved heterogeneity that may be correlated with x j i k this approach assumes that the unobserved effect is a linear function of the means of the plot varying independent variables the utility from the fertilization method choice is not observable but households could make decisions by ranking the utility the decision relies on 2 u i j i k max m j u i m i k o r τ j i k 0 j 1 2 3 where j 1 j 2 and j 3 represent flooding irrigation as a reference category cdi and idi respectively τ j i k max m j u i m i k u i j i k 0 equation 2 uses fertilization method j rather than m because j brings greater utility to household i than m therefore the probability of household i choosing fertilization method j to fertigate plot k can be specified by an mls model 3 p j i k p r τ j i k 0 x j i k exp α 1 j x j i k α 2 j x j i m 1 j exp α 1 m x m i k α 2 m x j i 3 2 the second stage of the mestr model the second step of mestr estimates the effect of fertilization method j on the outcome variables i e fui and lp for household i s plot k this effect can be modeled basically as 4 y j i k β j z i j k ϑ j z i j μ j i k where y j i k is the fui used or lp obtained on plot k of household i when the household uses fertilization method j z i j k is the set of factors that influence fui or lp when idi or flooding irrigation is chosen z i j k includes household and plot characteristics and regional factors see table 3 when cdi is chosen z i j k includes irrigators and cdi project and group characteristics in addition to household and plot information and regional factors z i j is a set of mean values of the same plot level characteristics based on the same assumption regarding the unobserved heterogeneity made in the first stage a wald test of the null hypothesis that the vectors ϑ j are jointly equal to zero is conducted to determine the relevance of plot specific heterogeneity 14 μ j i k is the error term when μ j i k is correlated with ε j i k a consistent estimation of β j requires the inclusion of the selection correction terms of the alternative choices in equation 4 the second step of mestr is finally shown as 5 y j i k β j z i j k σ j λ ˆ i j k ϑ j z i j μ j i k where μ j i k is the error term with an expected value of zero σ j is the covariance between μ j i k and ε j i k and λ ˆ i j k is the inverse mills ratio which is calculated as follows λ ˆ j i k m j j ρ j p ˆ m j ln p ˆ m j 1 p ˆ m j ln p ˆ m j where ρ j is the correlation coefficient between μ j i k and ε j i k to obtain a consistent estimation x j i k in the mls needs to include at least one selection instrument that influences the fertilization method choice but not the outcome variables as the instrumental variable iv we choose the accumulated percentage of the cdi project area to the total farmland area of a village in 2016 in villages with larger percentages there are more cdi plots and users to be used to obtain information on how drip irrigation technology improves agricultural yields through information exchange it is easier to help one another when households have some problems when they use cdi systems therefore in such villages households are more likely to use cdi or idi however this village level area percentage cannot affect the personal fertilizer input decision and lp other than through the irrigation technology choice which is already controlled by the first stage of the mestr model we perform a simple falsification test on the test admissibility of these instruments as 15 perform the results confirm the validity of the iv as they significantly jointly affect the fertilization method choice but not fui or lp see table 2 3 3 estimation of the att our aim in this paper is to obtain the effect of cdi and idi on fui and lp and to compare it to the effect of flooding irrigation to this end we need the average expected fui and lp values under cdi and idi in actual and counterfactual scenarios the actual scenario refers to the expected fui and lp in the ith household s plot k in the cdi or idi scenarios the counterfactual scenario of cdi or idi refers to the expected fui and lp in this plot if this household did not adopt cdi or idi respectively i e it adopted flooding irrigation the actual and counterfactual expected fui and lp values are computed by mestr with equation 5 as follows the actual outcomes under cdi or idi are 6 e y j i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ ˆ i j k z i j β j z i j k σ j λ ˆ i j k ϑ j z i j the counterfactual outcomes for cdi or idi are 7 e y 1 i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ ˆ i j k z i j β 1 z i j k σ 1 λ ˆ i j k ϑ 1 z i j following 16 the impact of drip irrigation is denoted as the att which is calculated by equations 6 and 7 as 8 att e y j i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ ˆ i j k z i 2 e y 1 i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ

outcomes if drip irrigation users have similar characteristics and resources as flooding irrigation users and z i j ϑ j ϑ 1 and λ i j k σ j σ 1 correct the selection bias and endogeneity respectively mentioned above the mestr approach enables a consistent and efficient estimation of β j and a reasonable correction of bias in the outcome equations even when the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia assumption is not met 14 another advantage of using this approach is the ability to evaluate the impact of both idi and cdi furthermore it relaxes the restrictive assumptions of the 17 selectivity model and provides a complete description of the selectivity impacts on all options considered by farmers 14 3 4 variable specification table 1 shows the definition of variables that we use in the empirical model and their descriptive statistics resoults in the first stage of the mestr model the factors that are likely to affect the fertilization method choice include household plot village and regional characteristics the gender age and education of the household head and labor availability household wealth and risk preference are generally identified as household level factors that affect modern agricultural technology adoption 18 gender differences are observed in new technology adoption 19 20 and are therefore controlled in the first stages of the mestr model age has a mixed effect on the probability of cdi and flooding irrigation because older farmers are expected to have more experience and skills related to agricultural production and are thus more likely to adopt new technology but they are more likely to be risk averse and thus less likely to adopt new technology similar effects on the adoption and impact of new technology may be seen for young farmers because they may be more flexible in adopting innovations and they have advantages in learning new technology 19 the education level of household heads is expected to have a positive effect on this probability because education helps households understand the benefits of new technologies 19 drip irrigation technology could save labor input such that households with lower labor availability are more likely to choose cdi or flooding irrigation household wealth is reported to have a positive effect on new technology adoption because it facilitates investment in and maintenance of the technology 19 drip irrigation technology carries risks for future outcomes and causes lasting fertigation improvement therefore household heads who are risk averse are less likely to choose flooding irrigation or cdi in addition uyghur ethnicity is used to reflect the potential differences in the fertilization method choice tractors are important to provide the power of pumping and or delivering water and to transport fertilizers and pipes for idi systems owning a tractor is therefore beneficial to adopting idi therefore we add a variable about whether a household owns tractors plot information is also controlled the type of main crop planted reflects potential differences in terms of fertigation applicability however cropping decisions are affected by household characteristics which may influence the fertilization method choice and fui and lp which contributes to potential endogeneity we use a method similar to that employed by refs 21 22 the crop type variable is defined as the average probability that the main crop is long staple cotton on the other survey plots including those within the same village farm size is an important factor when households decide to adopt new technologies for their farm 18 because this research was conducted at the plot level we used the plot area not the farm size additionally considering the potential differences in the evaporation rate water demand of the soil and water supply we control the soil type whether sandy salinization whether heavily salinized and plot location distance to a village level canal in addition village level water availability is controlled we apply two indicators to reflect this availability specifically the number of villager owned wells and the village s location along the county level canal more wells usually indicate a more serious surface water shortage which may encourage the application of drip irrigation technology in plots generally downstream villages are more likely to suffer water shortages because their water supply is obtained in a less timely manner therefore a village s location may have a positive effect on the choice of cdi or idi in the second stage of the mestr model for fui and lp we control household plot cdi project village and region characteristics for all subsamples regarding the household characteristics gender age education ethnic group training experience in farm management of the household heads household wealth and labor availability are added in this stage gender differences may be observed in fui because gender differences in knowledge of fertilizer use have been observed 20 gender differences are also observed in agricultural productivity because of gender differences in the access to inputs and time allocated to agricultural production and child care 23 age is expected to have a mixed effect on fui and lp compared with younger farmers older farmers tend to have more experience in farming and thus apply lower fui and obtain higher lp but they are more risk averse and have less physical power which leads to higher fui and lower lp education is expected to make practice more efficient 19 and thus reduce fui and increase lp uyghur ethnicity is used to reflect the potential differences in agricultural production training in farm management is expected to be helpful for farm and fertilizer management and is accordingly expected to negatively affect fui but positively affect lp household wealth has been reported to have a negative effect on fertilizer use 24 household wealth may facilitate the financing of high fui and other input demands thereby increasing fui and lp therefore we add a household wealth variable in this stage regarding plot information we control in the second stage of the mestr model for fui and lp whether intercropping and suffering natural disasters e g hailstone and drought occur the measurement of the intercropping variables is conducted through the abovementioned relevant approach we also add agricultural production input variables and a plot tenure type variable in the second stage of the mestr model for lp to control the differences in inputs and tenure land tenure being a contracted land may positively affect lp by promoting long term land improvement investments e g farmyard manure 25 regarding village characteristics when the water supply is not sufficient and timely the positive effects of fertilizers on crop growth may be weakened thus a higher fui may be applied to stabilize crop growth therefore we control water availability the indicators of water availability are the number of wells and the village s location along the county level canal water source more wells indicate lower surface water availability a larger distance from the village to the water source indicates a higher probability that the water supply is not timely in addition to the abovementioned household plot and village characteristics we add some cdi project level characteristics to the module on the cdi plots fui and lp we add the cdi project area because of the potential economy of scale the human resource indicators of irrigators age and education are included because irrigators take charge of fertigation which influences fui and lp we also control for the effect of mutual adjustment on irrigation on lp for the same reason we control for the effect of mutual adjustment on fertigation finally seven township dummy variables are included in the mestr model to control for the major unobserved differences between towns in terms of the factors such as geographic features that might affect the fertilization method choice fui and lp 4 empirical results and discussion 4 1 the determinants of the drip irrigation system choice the results of the determinants of the fertilization method choice are reported in table 2 the reference method is flooding irrigation the mnl model fits the data well according to the wald test χ 2 17 3243 41 p χ 2 0 000 which rejects the null hypothesis that all the regression coefficients are jointly equal to zero and the results of the goodness of fit test mcfadden s r2 0 411 the instrument employed to identify the mestr is also significant a falsification test on the excluded instruments also shows that the instruments influenced the fertilization method choice at all levels but not fui or lp the mundlak fixed effects used to indicate the relevance of plot specific heterogeneity are also significant regarding the household characteristics we find that male household heads are more likely to use cdi but less likely to use idi or flooding irrigation uyghur household heads are more likely to choose flooding irrigation while han heads are more likely to choose idi richer households are more likely to use cdi or idi but less likely to use flooding irrigation as we expected owning a tractor significantly increases the use of idi but not flooding irrigation as we expected regarding the plot level information we find that long staple cotton reduces the probability of idi use but increases the probability of flooding irrigation heavy salinization decreases the probability of cdi larger plots are more likely to use idi but not flooding irrigation when plots are farther away from the source of village level canals the probability of using flooding irrigation is lower turning to the village level characteristics the significant coefficient of distance to the water source shows that low timeliness in the surface irrigation water supply decreases the probability of using cdi but increase the probability of using idi when there are less surface water that is indicated by the number of village owned wells the probability of using cdi is higher but the probability of using flooding irrigation is lower as we expected the result of the iv shows that in a village with a larger area percentage of cdi projects on the village level total farmland area the probability of using cdi is higher but the probability of using idi or flooding irrigation is lower as we expected 4 2 the determinants of fui and lp the second stage regression eq 4 estimates of fui and lp are reported in tables 3 and 4 for the cdi plots fui is mainly influenced positively by irrigators human resource characteristics i e age education and training a possible reason for the effect of age is that old irrigators are more risk averse and thus use more fertilizer per mu than young irrigators even though old irrigators have more farming management experience which helps them reduce fui the estimation results of education and training are not consistent with our expectations this may be because having a higher level of education or attending training on cdi helps irrigators acknowledge that more fertilizers bring more production or a low probability of uneven nutrition distribution this possible explanation needs more empirical research to examine it finally the wald test for the mundlak fixed effects shows that in the cdi subsample there is plot specific heterogeneity for the idi plots intercropping and the number of village owned wells positively affect fui as we expected the inverse mills ratios significantly affect fui which indicates that there are unobserved or unobservable endogeneity problems for the flooding irrigation plots the household head age has a negative effect on fui uyghur household heads use lower fui than han household heads richer households tend to use higher fui but household heads who attend more farming training tend to use lower fui as we expected additionally the wald test results of the mundlak fixed effects and the significant effects of the inverse mills ratios indicate that unobserved or unobservable endogeneity problems cannot be ignored in the fi subsample turing to the determinants of lp for the cdi subsample richer households or household heads who attended more farming training increase lp as we expected wasteland has lower lp than contracted land irrigators who attended cdi training decreased lp which is not consistent with our expectation a possible reason is that the knowledge and skills obtained from cdi trainings are a shock for irrigators they need more practice and time to master the knowledge and skills that are beneficial to lp this finding should be considered cautiously the significant effects of the inverse mills ratios show that there is selection bias in the cdi subsample for the idi subsample seed and mulch inputs significantly and positively affected lp there is plot specific heterogeneity which is indicated by the wald test for the fi subsample the plot characteristics specifically contracted land seed and pesticide inputs have a positive effect on lp 4 3 the average treatment effects of the drip irrigation system recall that the att requires actual and counterfactual outcomes that are predicted in the second stage of mestr table 5 presents the actual outcomes for cdi and idi column 2 i e the expected fui and lp used when plots are fertigated via cdi or flooding irrigation respectively this table also shows their counterfactual outcome column 3 i e the expected fui and lp if cdi or idi users did not use cdi or flooding irrigation on average cdi reduces fui by 10 889 kg mu or 10 31 while idi increases it by 5 062 kg mu or 5 57 after accounting for the selection bias that originates from observed and unobserved factors on average cdi increases lp by 55 639 kg mu or 21 17 while idi increases lp by 20 106 kg mu or 7 52 after accounting for the selection bias that originates from observed and unobserved factors these findings indicate that cdi is a better method for achieving the central government s plan to both control fertilizers and improve agricultural yield on average we use a kernel density distribution to further illustrate the heterogeneous treatment effects of drip irrigation technology fig 3 there were 109 plots in which fui was reduced by cdi which accounted for 70 78 of the total number of cdi plots there were 71 plots in which fui was reduced by idi which accounted for 35 86 of the total number of idi plots regarding lp 81 82 of the cdi plots improved lp 128 plots while 64 65 of the idi plots improved lp 128 plots this suggests that at the individual plot level cdi has a better performance than idi in terms of fui and lp 4 4 the advantages of cdi in reducing fui and increasing lp as mentioned above in section 2 the obvious difference between cdi and idi is the information coordination mechanism this may give us a way to account for the advantage of cdi based on quantitative analyses table 6 presents the average marginal effects of the information coordination variables on the probability that cdi reduces fui or increases lp compared with the effects of flooding irrigation at the plot level table 6 reveals that the frequency of mutual adjustment on fertigation 7 7 the frequency of mutual adjustment on fertigation is defined as the average frequency of the other survey respondents attending fertigation meetings in 2015 including those within the same cdi project based on 21 22 after taking into account potential endogeneity the frequency of a respondent attending fertigation meetings may be affected by the household characteristics e g households motivation to earn more money that may influence fui or lp which contributes to potential endogeneity significantly increases the probability that compared with flooding irrigation cdi reduces fui and increases lp as expected this is because mutual adjustment being higher in a cdi group facilitates the reduction of information asymmetry 8 8 this information asymmetry may increase the probability and or area of the uneven nutrient distribution because such information may lead to poor water pressure uneven nutrient distribution leads to the use of supplementary fertilizers to fertigate plots with insufficient fertilizer and to lower lp in plots with too much fertilizer about the knowledge regarding fertigation and the topographical and physical characteristics of all plots within a cdi group and its irrigators and the actual cdi performance however the frequency of mutual adjustment on irrigation reduces the probability that cdi improves lp which is not consistent with our expectations we must be cautious of this finding and more research is needed to test this mechanism however table 6 shows that training on skills and knowledge standardization 9 9 this skills and knowledge standardization is treated as an irrigator s cdi training variable and is drawn from the question did the irrigator participate in trainings about cdi yes 1 no 0 has a significant negative effect on the probability that cdi reduces fui and has a significant positive effect on the probability that cdi increases lp compared with the effects of flooding irrigation at the plot level this does not mean that training on skills and knowledge standardization should not be provided because this dummy is weak in capturing the overall effects of this training on the improvement of irrigators knowledge and skills regarding cdi however due to the data limitations we cannot further measure such overall effects and more research on this issue is required 5 conclusion this study used a survey dataset of 599 cotton households 1 132 cotton plots and 18 cdi projects collected in awati county xinjiang to investigate the fertilizer reducing and lp improving effects of two types of drip irrigation systems i e cdi and idi using the mestr technique we find that on average cdi reduces fui by 10 31 but idi increases it by 5 57 and cdi improves lp more than idi 21 17 vs 7 52 this implies that cdi has a better potential to support the achievement of the chinese central government s plan related to achieving zero growth in fertilizer use and increased agricultural yield in awati county the organization like information coordination mechanism related to collective fertigation is a noteworthy characteristic of cdi compared with idi therefore we further examine whether two information coordination variables help cdi to save fertilizer and increase lp at the plot level we find that the frequency of mutual adjustment on fertigation has a significantly positive effect not only on the probability that cdi reduces fui compared with the effect of flooding irrigation but also on the probability that cdi improves lp compared with the effect of flooding irrigation however training on skills and knowledge standardization has a negative effect on the probability that cdi reduces fui but has no significant effect on the probability that cdi improves lp this study provides evidence of the actual fui reducing and lp improving effects of cdi and contributes to our understanding of the necessity of continuous cdi promotion in china china faces egregious fertilizer overuse which leads to agricultural pollution and environmental problems 26 in 2015 the chinese central government planned to achieve zero growth in chemical fertilizers by 2020 and to further improve agricultural production yields china has continued to positively promote drip irrigation systems in the 14th five year plan 2021 2025 therefore china s new trend in the agricultural sector with the development of drip irrigation will not only affect agricultural production and improve rural livelihoods but also have a profound effect on environmental pollution control future work could investigate the empirical impacts of cdi on farmers agricultural income and environmental protection lessons from this study also have policy implications regarding how to improve the fertilizer reducing and lp increasing effects of cdi in many countries and regions such as china chile mexico morocco the mediterranean zambia and peru through national pilot programs the promotion of drip irrigation technology follows a top down approach however this approach has hidden trouble because farmers or water use associations have no related experience and skills regarding the use of this technique before such pilot programs 27 28 which weakens the positive effects of this technique on lp and input savings 29 therefore based on our findings it is recommended that the abovementioned regions should give more attention and make more efforts to improve drip irrigation users participation in collective mutual adjustment on collective fertigation to balance the divergent or conflicting interests of the different members of cdi groups however due to data limitations we do not examine the entire influencing mechanism chain that links users awareness information asymmetry the information coordination mechanism and the actual performance of cdi therefore future research could investigate this influencing mechanism as a whole which would provide not only profound insights into the differences between the actual performance and claimed effects of drip irrigation but also more practical polices to manage an increasing number of cdi projects in addition our findings are obtained from a small region and based on cross sectional data therefore more empirical studies on this topic should be conducted in different regions where rental markets of land and irrigation water are well developed and households easily change land and water inputs and more studies should apply a total factor productivity decomposition approach and panel data to expand the findings funding this work was supported by the national natural

8656,drip irrigation is claimed to save water and fertilizers and improve land productivity considerable recent evidence supports the water saving effect of drip irrigation techniques but little attention has been given to the effect on fertilizer savings and land productivity improvement this study examines the effects of collective and individual drip irrigation cdi and idi respectively on fertilizer use intensity and land productivity using a multinomial endogenous switching treatment regression and a survey dataset collected in awati county xinjiang we found that 1 on average cdi reduces fertilizer use intensity by 10 31 but idi increases it by 5 57 and 2 compared to idi cdi improves land productivity by more than 13 65 moreover based on quantitative analyses we found that 3 a high frequency of mutual adjustment of fertigation an information coordination mechanism gives cdi these advantages the policy implications are to continue the top down promotion of cdi technology and strengthen the information coordination on fertigation during the operation of cdi systems keywords drip irrigation fertilizer use land productivity information coordination treatment effects rural china 1 introduction drip irrigation is frequently touted by inventors and policymakers as a plot or basin level solution to water shortage issues therefore drip irrigation is widely promoted especially in regions that experience high water stress china is home to the largest land area with drip irrigation system coverage in the world 1 in 2017 the area with drip micro irrigation systems totaled 6 283 5 kha 2 xinjiang accounts for 56 of the chinese drip irrigation area 2 in xinjiang there are two types of drip irrigation systems specifically collective and individual i e idi and cdi respectively an idi system simply imitates the components of cdi but involves only one smallholder and his or her plot smallholders individually use and maintain idi systems a cdi project is built on multiple segments of farmland owned by small households and thus involves multiple farmers the multiple farmers involved in the same project are self organized as a cdi group and collectively take charge of the daily use management and maintenance of their cdi system in southern xinjiang an organization like information coordination mechanism is applied by cdi groups to coordinate information on collective irrigation and fertigation this information includes members demand for water and nutrients topographic and environmental information for all the plots involved in the cdi project and knowledge on the fertigation process and the operation of cdi facilities however much evidence challenges the status of drip irrigation as a plot or basin level solution to water shortage issues in rajasthan india the saiss plain and the souss and tensift basins in morocco and the rio grande valley in the united states 3 4 according to evidence from morocco and burkina faso one reason for the failure to save water at the plot level is that farmers are not interested in saving water 3 5 in china strict water quantity standards define the authorized water use capacity water quota based on the irrigation area and are strictly enforced at every level in southern xinjiang a semiarid region at the household level water fees are charged based on irrigation areas and plot level irrigation water gauges are lacking 1 1 this lack of water gauges also results in a lack of irrigation water quantity data this is a practical reason for why we do not focus on irrigation water productivity or use efficiency therefore households tend to use equal water quantities and all the water available for an irrigation area unit in addition the local surface irrigation water is mainly sourced from glacier melt due to the local climate in southern xinjiang the irrigation water supply in spring is insufficient but flooding is common in summer and autumn therefore considering the fixed water quantity allotment and fluctuating local water supply drip irrigation technology can be applied to stabilize the water supply and to save water to increase land productivity at the plot level in addition to saving water and stabilizing the water supply and thus increasing agricultural productivity drip irrigation can save fertilizer through the use of fertigation techniques at the farm scale and outperform the traditional fertilization used in furrow irrigation setups 5 6 fertilizer savings are highly important in arid and semiarid regions where the natural environment is fragile this is because some environmental problems such as atmospheric warming climate change and nutrient overloading in water bodies are direct or indirect consequences of the residual effects of chemical fertilizer use and fertilizer runoff 7 however among small chinese farmers there is a general belief that increasing fertilizer use increases agricultural production and that reducing fertilizer use reduces agricultural production 8 that is potential overfertigation can occur with negative effects on land productivity these results imply that such beliefs may weaken the fertilizer saving and land productivity improving benefits of drip irrigation if no incentives or interventions are used that is although drip irrigation technology may have the potential to reduce fertilizer use it is not clear whether the fertilizer saving and land productivity improving benefits of drip irrigation exist in the context of such beliefs previous empirical evidence from morocco and burkina faso revealed that drip irrigation did not result in input e g water and labor savings at the plot level as inventors and policymakers claimed that it would 3 5 few studies provide empirical evidence of the claimed fertilizer saving effect of drip irrigation therefore the objective of this paper is to estimate whether compared with flooding irrigation cdi and idi actually reduce fertilizer use intensity fui and increase land productivity lp at the plot level in the chinese context considering equal and fixed water quotas and smallholders fertilization beliefs the empirical analysis is based on a dataset with information on 599 cotton households 1 132 cotton plots and 18 cdi projects collected in awati county xinjiang in 2017 we found that cdi has an obvious advantage in terms of reducing fui and increasing lp we also account for this advantage of cdi as much as possible by examining the effects of the information coordination mechanism on this advantage in southern xinjiang farmers suffer deep poverty due to the inactive off farm labor market and land rental market farmers deeply rely on fixed farmland and associated agricultural income considering the local fragile natural environment insight into the actual fertilizer saving and lp improving effects of cdi and idi is important for drip irrigation promotion and the recent policy reforms aimed at poverty reduction and environmental protection in southern xinjiang and other similar regions of china such insight is also helpful for understanding the actual fertigation practices in drip irrigation systems in other countries where this technology is widely promoted such as spain morocco mexico brazil iran and india this paper contributes to the literature in two ways first we provide empirical evidence of the effect of drip irrigation systems on fertilizer use and lp by focusing on the difference between the two types of drip irrigation systems we also provide an explanation of the advantage of cdi in terms of reducing fertilizer and improving lp based on quantitative analyses second in contrast to previous studies we use the average treatment effect on the treated att to quantify the actual fertigation and lp of cdi and idi by applying the multinomial endogenous switching treatment regression mestr technique to address the issues related to endogeneity between multiple technology choices and actual fertigation and lp for example innate managerial and technical abilities related to agriculture may affect both technology choices and agricultural performance the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the background information on the research site section 3 describes a conceptual and econometric model of the relationships in question a brief introduction of the dataset is provided in section 4 the estimation results are interpreted in section 5 and section 6 presents our conclusions 2 research site and data collection 2 1 research site our research site fig 1 is situated in awati county aksu prefecture in southwestern xinjiang which neighbors the northern edge of the taklimakan desert awati county is known as the land of long staple cotton a designation given by the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china prc in 2001 in 2015 the total sown area of cotton was 1 345 806 mu 2 2 15 mu 1 ha ninety five percent of this total sown area 1 285 000 mu was not intercropped and the remainder was a pure stand that was intercropped with fruit e g jujube and walnut trees 9 a total of 41 6 of the total cotton sown area 559 763 mu was fertigated by cdi systems agriculture bureau of awati county 2015a a total of 17 3 of the cdi area 96 839 mu was cultivated by small farmers the remaining area was cultivated by agricultural companies 36 however there are no official data on the area fertigated by idi in awati county idi systems consist of a private well a pump powered by a tracker a fertilizer dissolver and a private surface pipe system cdi systems are made up of a shared water storing facility a pump system a fertilizer dissolver an underground tube system and a private surface pipe system located on pieces of farmland fig 2 cdi groups hire one or several local farmers as full time irrigators to operate check and maintain cdi systems to uniformly irrigate and fertigate all plots located in the project based on the irrigation and fertigation schedule and rules these schedules and rules are made by the cdi groups based on the xinjiang government s technical guidelines users water and nutrient needs and the geographical characteristics of the project one obvious difference between idi and cdi is the information coordination mechanism based on ref 30 we identified three coordination channels for water and fertilizer application in the cdi group idi systems are not equipped with such channels first process standardization standardizes the cdi system s general content and fertigation procedures the local government provides a technical guide 3 3 the xinjiang uygur autonomous region agricultural high efficiency water saving irrigation technical guide is published by the water resources department of xinjiang uygur autonomous region and the irrigation and drainage development center a division of the ministry of water resources of china to standardize the fertigation process and asks cdi projects to comply with this guide and keep relevant records second skills and knowledge standardization standardizes irrigators skills and knowledge regarding the daily operation such as water pressure control assessment and maintenance of fertigation systems this standardization is enforced by training irrigators in local areas such training is not compulsory or regular third mutual adjustment is used to coordinate the information on users nutrient demand the geographical characteristics of plots the cost of fertilizers and the knowledge of cdi among cdi groups and irrigators to achieve mutual adjustment cdi groups organize cdi users and irrigators to attend meetings before the irrigation season starts after mutual adjustment the cdi group makes a group decision on the fertigation order of the plots and what and how much fertilizer should be purchased and used 2 2 data collection the dataset used for the empirical analysis was obtained from a rural household survey conducted in awati county in february 2017 a multiple stratified sampling strategy was used to select 774 households detailed information can be found in 35 thirty five of the interviewed households indicated that they were not involved in farmland cultivation and were therefore excluded from the analysis because households usually cultivate many plots it is a very time consuming task to collect information on all plots we therefore collected information on a maximum of four plots per interviewed household specifically the two largest contracted plots and the two largest wasteland plots 4 4 a contracted plot is assigned following the implementation of the household responsibility system wasteland refers to land converted from desert land that can be developed by farm households or local government cited from ref 10 in awati county wasteland developed by the local government is usually leased to farm households this procedure resulted in 1 763 plots we collected information on households and cdi projects separately cdi projects were randomly selected in each village out of the 17 selected villages 2 villages did not have any installed well cdi projects to sample and were therefore excluded from the cdi project selection notably the number of cdi projects chosen was based on the total number of cdi projects and the heterogeneity in terms of the cdi project and group size land tenure crop type and the operation situation finally 39 cdi projects were included which accounted for 83 of the total installed well cdi projects in the 15 villages we used the names of the irrigation managers and or the number of village groups reported on the cdi project questionnaire and household questionnaire to match the data which led to data loss because the cdi projects in which the included plots were located may not have been selected the final survey dataset had information on 599 cotton households 1 132 cotton plots and 18 cdi projects in our 2016 sample there were 154 cdi plot sections cdi subsample 198 idi plot sections idi subsample and 780 flooding irrigation plot sections fi subsample fui refers to the quantity of fertilizers used per unit area of a plot on average the greatest fui is used by the idi subsample 98 83 kg mu the second greatest is used by the cdi subsample 96 14 kg mu and the third greatest is used by the fi subsample 83 68 kg mu the fui is significantly greater in both the cdi and idi subsamples than in the fi subsample at the 1 significance level lp is measured as the production quantity of all crops planted in a unit area of a plot on average the greatest lp is in the cdi subsample 346 27 kg mu the second greatest is in the idi subsample 308 51 kg mu and the third greatest is in the fi subsample 280 39 kg mu the fui and lp distributions by fertilization method are presented in fig 3 the distributions show indications of negative skewness with a smaller variance in the cdi subsample than in the fi subsample 3 econometric analysis framework at the household level farmland is fixed or quasi fixed input in awati county for three reasons first the contracting relationship for farmland between farmers and village committees remains stable and permanent based on the law of the prc on the contracting of rural land second wasteland is leased from village committees for a certain period usually 5 years and the tenant has priority to continue leasing therefore contracted land and wasteland have a stable land tenure third the local farmland rental market is inactive little contracted land and wasteland are rented between farmers measuring land input s partial factor productivity 5 5 the productivity change of the variable inputs should be properly measured by the total factor productivity decomposition approach 11 i e lp provides helpful insight into the utilization of agricultural technology and variable inputs as fertilizers 11 therefore following a partial productivity approach this paper measures the productivity and fertilizer input of a unit of farmland as our focus outcome variables i e lp and fui this study is interested in lp and fui changes when cotton farmers choose to use cdi or idi instead of flooding irrigation however there may be potential selection bias and endogeneity problems that provide inconsistent estimates of the actual change specifically farmers may endogenously self select into these three subsamples additionally fertilization decisions are likely to be influenced by unobserved or unobservable 6 6 we use unobserved to refer to factors that are measurable but for which we have no data e g soil temperature and unobservable to refer to factors that are challenging to measure e g a farmer s motivation or managerial skills note that the two are used interchangeably factors that may be correlated with fui and lp e g unobservable innate managerial and technical abilities related to agriculture unlike propensity score matching and the endogenous switching model the mestr model not only handles multivalued choices but also resolves unobserved and unobservable selection bias and endogeneity 34 this model introduces a multinomial logit selection mls model in the first stage to handle multivalued choices and calculates an inverse mills ratio by using the theory of truncated normal distribution and a latent factor structure to correct the selection bias from unobserved variables the second stage models the effect of cdi on fui by using ordinary least squares ols with selection correction terms i e an inverse mills ratio 3 1 the first stage of the mestr model in the first step assuming that households choose the fertilization method that maximizes their utility first their fertilization method decision can be expressed as a latent choice model 1 u i j i k α 1 j x j i k α 2 j x j i ε j i k where u i j i k is the ith household utility for fertilization method j used on plot k with the methods including cdi idi and flooding irrigation x j i k is a set of observable exogenous variables such as household plot level and regional characteristics and ε j i k is the random error term we use plot level information to address the problem of households unobserved characteristics that result in inconsistent estimations recent literature has applied plot level data as panel data to control farm specific effects 12 we follow the 13 mundlak s approach where the means x j i of the plot varying independent variables including the fertility soil type salinization and plot location i e distance to a village level canal are used to control for the unobserved heterogeneity that may be correlated with x j i k this approach assumes that the unobserved effect is a linear function of the means of the plot varying independent variables the utility from the fertilization method choice is not observable but households could make decisions by ranking the utility the decision relies on 2 u i j i k max m j u i m i k o r τ j i k 0 j 1 2 3 where j 1 j 2 and j 3 represent flooding irrigation as a reference category cdi and idi respectively τ j i k max m j u i m i k u i j i k 0 equation 2 uses fertilization method j rather than m because j brings greater utility to household i than m therefore the probability of household i choosing fertilization method j to fertigate plot k can be specified by an mls model 3 p j i k p r τ j i k 0 x j i k exp α 1 j x j i k α 2 j x j i m 1 j exp α 1 m x m i k α 2 m x j i 3 2 the second stage of the mestr model the second step of mestr estimates the effect of fertilization method j on the outcome variables i e fui and lp for household i s plot k this effect can be modeled basically as 4 y j i k β j z i j k ϑ j z i j μ j i k where y j i k is the fui used or lp obtained on plot k of household i when the household uses fertilization method j z i j k is the set of factors that influence fui or lp when idi or flooding irrigation is chosen z i j k includes household and plot characteristics and regional factors see table 3 when cdi is chosen z i j k includes irrigators and cdi project and group characteristics in addition to household and plot information and regional factors z i j is a set of mean values of the same plot level characteristics based on the same assumption regarding the unobserved heterogeneity made in the first stage a wald test of the null hypothesis that the vectors ϑ j are jointly equal to zero is conducted to determine the relevance of plot specific heterogeneity 14 μ j i k is the error term when μ j i k is correlated with ε j i k a consistent estimation of β j requires the inclusion of the selection correction terms of the alternative choices in equation 4 the second step of mestr is finally shown as 5 y j i k β j z i j k σ j λ ˆ i j k ϑ j z i j μ j i k where μ j i k is the error term with an expected value of zero σ j is the covariance between μ j i k and ε j i k and λ ˆ i j k is the inverse mills ratio which is calculated as follows λ ˆ j i k m j j ρ j p ˆ m j ln p ˆ m j 1 p ˆ m j ln p ˆ m j where ρ j is the correlation coefficient between μ j i k and ε j i k to obtain a consistent estimation x j i k in the mls needs to include at least one selection instrument that influences the fertilization method choice but not the outcome variables as the instrumental variable iv we choose the accumulated percentage of the cdi project area to the total farmland area of a village in 2016 in villages with larger percentages there are more cdi plots and users to be used to obtain information on how drip irrigation technology improves agricultural yields through information exchange it is easier to help one another when households have some problems when they use cdi systems therefore in such villages households are more likely to use cdi or idi however this village level area percentage cannot affect the personal fertilizer input decision and lp other than through the irrigation technology choice which is already controlled by the first stage of the mestr model we perform a simple falsification test on the test admissibility of these instruments as 15 perform the results confirm the validity of the iv as they significantly jointly affect the fertilization method choice but not fui or lp see table 2 3 3 estimation of the att our aim in this paper is to obtain the effect of cdi and idi on fui and lp and to compare it to the effect of flooding irrigation to this end we need the average expected fui and lp values under cdi and idi in actual and counterfactual scenarios the actual scenario refers to the expected fui and lp in the ith household s plot k in the cdi or idi scenarios the counterfactual scenario of cdi or idi refers to the expected fui and lp in this plot if this household did not adopt cdi or idi respectively i e it adopted flooding irrigation the actual and counterfactual expected fui and lp values are computed by mestr with equation 5 as follows the actual outcomes under cdi or idi are 6 e y j i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ ˆ i j k z i j β j z i j k σ j λ ˆ i j k ϑ j z i j the counterfactual outcomes for cdi or idi are 7 e y 1 i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ ˆ i j k z i j β 1 z i j k σ 1 λ ˆ i j k ϑ 1 z i j following 16 the impact of drip irrigation is denoted as the att which is calculated by equations 6 and 7 as 8 att e y j i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ ˆ i j k z i 2 e y 1 i k j 2 o r j 3 z i j k λ ˆ i j k z i j β j z i j k σ j λ ˆ i j k ϑ j z i j β 1 z i j k σ 1 λ ˆ i j k ϑ 1 z i j z i j k β j β 1 z i j ϑ j ϑ 1 λ ˆ i j k σ j σ 1 where z i j k β j β 1 refers to the expected change in the mean outcomes if drip irrigation users have similar characteristics and resources as flooding irrigation users and z i j ϑ j ϑ 1 and λ i j k σ j σ 1 correct the selection bias and endogeneity respectively mentioned above the mestr approach enables a consistent and efficient estimation of β j and a reasonable correction of bias in the outcome equations even when the independence of irrelevant alternatives iia assumption is not met 14 another advantage of using this approach is the ability to evaluate the impact of both idi and cdi furthermore it relaxes the restrictive assumptions of the 17 selectivity model and provides a complete description of the selectivity impacts on all options considered by farmers 14 3 4 variable specification table 1 shows the definition of variables that we use in the empirical model and their descriptive statistics resoults in the first stage of the mestr model the factors that are likely to affect the fertilization method choice include household plot village and regional characteristics the gender age and education of the household head and labor availability household wealth and risk preference are generally identified as household level factors that affect modern agricultural technology adoption 18 gender differences are observed in new technology adoption 19 20 and are therefore controlled in the first stages of the mestr model age has a mixed effect on the probability of cdi and flooding irrigation because older farmers are expected to have more experience and skills related to agricultural production and are thus more likely to adopt new technology but they are more likely to be risk averse and thus less likely to adopt new technology similar effects on the adoption and impact of new technology may be seen for young farmers because they may be more flexible in adopting innovations and they have advantages in learning new technology 19 the education level of household heads is expected to have a positive effect on this probability because education helps households understand the benefits of new technologies 19 drip irrigation technology could save labor input such that households with lower labor availability are more likely to choose cdi or flooding irrigation household wealth is reported to have a positive effect on new technology adoption because it facilitates investment in and maintenance of the technology 19 drip irrigation technology carries risks for future outcomes and causes lasting fertigation improvement therefore household heads who are risk averse are less likely to choose flooding irrigation or cdi in addition uyghur ethnicity is used to reflect the potential differences in the fertilization method choice tractors are important to provide the power of pumping and or delivering water and to transport fertilizers and pipes for idi systems owning a tractor is therefore beneficial to adopting idi therefore we add a variable about whether a household owns tractors plot information is also controlled the type of main crop planted reflects potential differences in terms of fertigation applicability however cropping decisions are affected by household characteristics which may influence the fertilization method choice and fui and lp which contributes to potential endogeneity we use a method similar to that employed by refs 21 22 the crop type variable is defined as the average probability that the main crop is long staple cotton on the other survey plots including those within the same village farm size is an important factor when households decide to adopt new technologies for their farm 18 because this research was conducted at the plot level we used the plot area not the farm size additionally considering the potential differences in the evaporation rate water demand of the soil and water supply we control the soil type whether sandy salinization whether heavily salinized and plot location distance to a village level canal in addition village level water availability is controlled we apply two indicators to reflect this availability specifically the number of villager owned wells and the village s location along the county level canal more wells usually indicate a more serious surface water shortage which may encourage the application of drip irrigation technology in plots generally downstream villages are more likely to suffer water shortages because their water supply is obtained in a less timely manner therefore a village s location may have a positive effect on the choice of cdi or idi in the second stage of the mestr model for fui and lp we control household plot cdi project village and region characteristics for all subsamples regarding the household characteristics gender age education ethnic group training experience in farm management of the household heads household wealth and labor availability are added in this stage gender differences may be observed in fui because gender differences in knowledge of fertilizer use have been observed 20 gender differences are also observed in agricultural productivity because of gender differences in the access to inputs and time allocated to agricultural production and child care 23 age is expected to have a mixed effect on fui and lp compared with younger farmers older farmers tend to have more experience in farming and thus apply lower fui and obtain higher lp but they are more risk averse and have less physical power which leads to higher fui and lower lp education is expected to make practice more efficient 19 and thus reduce fui and increase lp uyghur ethnicity is used to reflect the potential differences in agricultural production training in farm management is expected to be helpful for farm and fertilizer management and is accordingly expected to negatively affect fui but positively affect lp household wealth has been reported to have a negative effect on fertilizer use 24 household wealth may facilitate the financing of high fui and other input demands thereby increasing fui and lp therefore we add a household wealth variable in this stage regarding plot information we control in the second stage of the mestr model for fui and lp whether intercropping and suffering natural disasters e g hailstone and drought occur the measurement of the intercropping variables is conducted through the abovementioned relevant approach we also add agricultural production input variables and a plot tenure type variable in the second stage of the mestr model for lp to control the differences in inputs and tenure land tenure being a contracted land may positively affect lp by promoting long term land improvement investments e g farmyard manure 25 regarding village characteristics when the water supply is not sufficient and timely the positive effects of fertilizers on crop growth may be weakened thus a higher fui may be applied to stabilize crop growth therefore we control water availability the indicators of water availability are the number of wells and the village s location along the county level canal water source more wells indicate lower surface water availability a larger distance from the village to the water source indicates a higher probability that the water supply is not timely in addition to the abovementioned household plot and village characteristics we add some cdi project level characteristics to the module on the cdi plots fui and lp we add the cdi project area because of the potential economy of scale the human resource indicators of irrigators age and education are included because irrigators take charge of fertigation which influences fui and lp we also control for the effect of mutual adjustment on irrigation on lp for the same reason we control for the effect of mutual adjustment on fertigation finally seven township dummy variables are included in the mestr model to control for the major unobserved differences between towns in terms of the factors such as geographic features that might affect the fertilization method choice fui and lp 4 empirical results and discussion 4 1 the determinants of the drip irrigation system choice the results of the determinants of the fertilization method choice are reported in table 2 the reference method is flooding irrigation the mnl model fits the data well according to the wald test χ 2 17 3243 41 p χ 2 0 000 which rejects the null hypothesis that all the regression coefficients are jointly equal to zero and the results of the goodness of fit test mcfadden s r2 0 411 the instrument employed to identify the mestr is also significant a falsification test on the excluded instruments also shows that the instruments influenced the fertilization method choice at all levels but not fui or lp the mundlak fixed effects used to indicate the relevance of plot specific heterogeneity are also significant regarding the household characteristics we find that male household heads are more likely to use cdi but less likely to use idi or flooding irrigation uyghur household heads are more likely to choose flooding irrigation while han heads are more likely to choose idi richer households are more likely to use cdi or idi but less likely to use flooding irrigation as we expected owning a tractor significantly increases the use of idi but not flooding irrigation as we expected regarding the plot level information we find that long staple cotton reduces the probability of idi use but increases the probability of flooding irrigation heavy salinization decreases the probability of cdi larger plots are more likely to use idi but not flooding irrigation when plots are farther away from the source of village level canals the probability of using flooding irrigation is lower turning to the village level characteristics the significant coefficient of distance to the water source shows that low timeliness in the surface irrigation water supply decreases the probability of using cdi but increase the probability of using idi when there are less surface water that is indicated by the number of village owned wells the probability of using cdi is higher but the probability of using flooding irrigation is lower as we expected the result of the iv shows that in a village with a larger area percentage of cdi projects on the village level total farmland area the probability of using cdi is higher but the probability of using idi or flooding irrigation is lower as we expected 4 2 the determinants of fui and lp the second stage regression eq 4 estimates of fui and lp are reported in tables 3 and 4 for the cdi plots fui is mainly influenced positively by irrigators human resource characteristics i e age education and training a possible reason for the effect of age is that old irrigators are more risk averse and thus use more fertilizer per mu than young irrigators even though old irrigators have more farming management experience which helps them reduce fui the estimation results of education and training are not consistent with our expectations this may be because having a higher level of education or attending training on cdi helps irrigators acknowledge that more fertilizers bring more production or a low probability of uneven nutrition distribution this possible explanation needs more empirical research to examine it finally the wald test for the mundlak fixed effects shows that in the cdi subsample there is plot specific heterogeneity for the idi plots intercropping and the number of village owned wells positively affect fui as we expected the inverse mills ratios significantly affect fui which indicates that there are unobserved or unobservable endogeneity problems for the flooding irrigation plots the household head age has a negative effect on fui uyghur household heads use lower fui than han household heads richer households tend to use higher fui but household heads who attend more farming training tend to use lower fui as we expected additionally the wald test results of the mundlak fixed effects and the significant effects of the inverse mills ratios indicate that unobserved or unobservable endogeneity problems cannot be ignored in the fi subsample turing to the determinants of lp for the cdi subsample richer households or household heads who attended more farming training increase lp as we expected wasteland has lower lp than contracted land irrigators who attended cdi training decreased lp which is not consistent with our expectation a possible reason is that the knowledge and skills obtained from cdi trainings are a shock for irrigators they need more practice and time to master the knowledge and skills that are beneficial to lp this finding should be considered cautiously the significant effects of the inverse mills ratios show that there is selection bias in the cdi subsample for the idi subsample seed and mulch inputs significantly and positively affected lp there is plot specific heterogeneity which is indicated by the wald test for the fi subsample the plot characteristics specifically contracted land seed and pesticide inputs have a positive effect on lp 4 3 the average treatment effects of the drip irrigation system recall that the att requires actual and counterfactual outcomes that are predicted in the second stage of mestr table 5 presents the actual outcomes for cdi and idi column 2 i e the expected fui and lp used when plots are fertigated via cdi or flooding irrigation respectively this table also shows their counterfactual outcome column 3 i e the expected fui and lp if cdi or idi users did not use cdi or flooding irrigation on average cdi reduces fui by 10 889 kg mu or 10 31 while idi increases it by 5 062 kg mu or 5 57 after accounting for the selection bias that originates from observed and unobserved factors on average cdi increases lp by 55 639 kg mu or 21 17 while idi increases lp by 20 106 kg mu or 7 52 after accounting for the selection bias that originates from observed and unobserved factors these findings indicate that cdi is a better method for achieving the central government s plan to both control fertilizers and improve agricultural yield on average we use a kernel density distribution to further illustrate the heterogeneous treatment effects of drip irrigation technology fig 3 there were 109 plots in which fui was reduced by cdi which accounted for 70 78 of the total number of cdi plots there were 71 plots in which fui was reduced by idi which accounted for 35 86 of the total number of idi plots regarding lp 81 82 of the cdi plots improved lp 128 plots while 64 65 of the idi plots improved lp 128 plots this suggests that at the individual plot level cdi has a better performance than idi in terms of fui and lp 4 4 the advantages of cdi in reducing fui and increasing lp as mentioned above in section 2 the obvious difference between cdi and idi is the information coordination mechanism this may give us a way to account for the advantage of cdi based on quantitative analyses table 6 presents the average marginal effects of the information coordination variables on the probability that cdi reduces fui or increases lp compared with the effects of flooding irrigation at the plot level table 6 reveals that the frequency of mutual adjustment on fertigation 7 7 the frequency of mutual adjustment on fertigation is defined as the average frequency of the other survey respondents attending fertigation meetings in 2015 including those within the same cdi project based on 21 22 after taking into account potential endogeneity the frequency of a respondent attending fertigation meetings may be affected by the household characteristics e g households motivation to earn more money that may influence fui or lp which contributes to potential endogeneity significantly increases the probability that compared with flooding irrigation cdi reduces fui and increases lp as expected this is because mutual adjustment being higher in a cdi group facilitates the reduction of information asymmetry 8 8 this information asymmetry may increase the probability and or area of the uneven nutrient distribution because such information may lead to poor water pressure uneven nutrient distribution leads to the use of supplementary fertilizers to fertigate plots with insufficient fertilizer and to lower lp in plots with too much fertilizer about the knowledge regarding fertigation and the topographical and physical characteristics of all plots within a cdi group and its irrigators and the actual cdi performance however the frequency of mutual adjustment on irrigation reduces the probability that cdi improves lp which is not consistent with our expectations we must be cautious of this finding and more research is needed to test this mechanism however table 6 shows that training on skills and knowledge standardization 9 9 this skills and knowledge standardization is treated as an irrigator s cdi training variable and is drawn from the question did the irrigator participate in trainings about cdi yes 1 no 0 has a significant negative effect on the probability that cdi reduces fui and has a significant positive effect on the probability that cdi increases lp compared with the effects of flooding irrigation at the plot level this does not mean that training on skills and knowledge standardization should not be provided because this dummy is weak in capturing the overall effects of this training on the improvement of irrigators knowledge and skills regarding cdi however due to the data limitations we cannot further measure such overall effects and more research on this issue is required 5 conclusion this study used a survey dataset of 599 cotton households 1 132 cotton plots and 18 cdi projects collected in awati county xinjiang to investigate the fertilizer reducing and lp improving effects of two types of drip irrigation systems i e cdi and idi using the mestr technique we find that on average cdi reduces fui by 10 31 but idi increases it by 5 57 and cdi improves lp more than idi 21 17 vs 7 52 this implies that cdi has a better potential to support the achievement of the chinese central government s plan related to achieving zero growth in fertilizer use and increased agricultural yield in awati county the organization like information coordination mechanism related to collective fertigation is a noteworthy characteristic of cdi compared with idi therefore we further examine whether two information coordination variables help cdi to save fertilizer and increase lp at the plot level we find that the frequency of mutual adjustment on fertigation has a significantly positive effect not only on the probability that cdi reduces fui compared with the effect of flooding irrigation but also on the probability that cdi improves lp compared with the effect of flooding irrigation however training on skills and knowledge standardization has a negative effect on the probability that cdi reduces fui but has no significant effect on the probability that cdi improves lp this study provides evidence of the actual fui reducing and lp improving effects of cdi and contributes to our understanding of the necessity of continuous cdi promotion in china china faces egregious fertilizer overuse which leads to agricultural pollution and environmental problems 26 in 2015 the chinese central government planned to achieve zero growth in chemical fertilizers by 2020 and to further improve agricultural production yields china has continued to positively promote drip irrigation systems in the 14th five year plan 2021 2025 therefore china s new trend in the agricultural sector with the development of drip irrigation will not only affect agricultural production and improve rural livelihoods but also have a profound effect on environmental pollution control future work could investigate the empirical impacts of cdi on farmers agricultural income and environmental protection lessons from this study also have policy implications regarding how to improve the fertilizer reducing and lp increasing effects of cdi in many countries and regions such as china chile mexico morocco the mediterranean zambia and peru through national pilot programs the promotion of drip irrigation technology follows a top down approach however this approach has hidden trouble because farmers or water use associations have no related experience and skills regarding the use of this technique before such pilot programs 27 28 which weakens the positive effects of this technique on lp and input savings 29 therefore based on our findings it is recommended that the abovementioned regions should give more attention and make more efforts to improve drip irrigation users participation in collective mutual adjustment on collective fertigation to balance the divergent or conflicting interests of the different members of cdi groups however due to data limitations we do not examine the entire influencing mechanism chain that links users awareness information asymmetry the information coordination mechanism and the actual performance of cdi therefore future research could investigate this influencing mechanism as a whole which would provide not only profound insights into the differences between the actual performance and claimed effects of drip irrigation but also more practical polices to manage an increasing number of cdi projects in addition our findings are obtained from a small region and based on cross sectional data therefore more empirical studies on this topic should be conducted in different regions where rental markets of land and irrigation water are well developed and households easily change land and water inputs and more studies should apply a total factor productivity decomposition approach and panel data to expand the findings funding this work was supported by the national natural

8657,in this paper we explore the economic value of groundwater in irrigation both in terms of the way in which it stabilizes water supply for those facing uncertain surface water flows as well as in the way it augments water supply to farming enterprises beyond what would be available from precipitation or surface water flows alone these respective components of groundwater s economic value its stabilization and augmentation value have been discussed in the literature before but we point out some important ways in which they could be diminished if sub optimal groundwater abstraction is allowed to persist groundwater mining tends to diminish the augmentation value of groundwater while leaving the stabilization value unaffected as long as the resource extraction only manifests itself in terms of increased pumping costs we illustrate however a situation in which even the stabilization value can be attenuated which arises when constraints to the user s ability to abstract groundwater become binding and prevent her from realizing the stabilizing value that is embodied in the immediate exploitation of the resource we demonstrate these losses in groundwater s economic value in irrigation through simulating increasingly sub optimal non cooperative and strategic groundwater pumping behavior in a way that has not been done explicitly in the literature and use a well studied example from california to give an empirical illustration of our points keywords groundwater resource use externalities dynamic games common pool resources summary in this paper we discuss the implications of sub optimal extraction behavior and pumping constraints on the economic value of groundwater in irrigation within a dynamic context taking the empirical context of the western united states we examine the ways in which the two important components of groundwater s intrinsic economic value namely its stabilization and augmentation value are impacted by sub optimal groundwater exploitation and the increasing possibility of encountering constraints on groundwater use as the aquifer becomes overdrafted we compare the case of centralized management intervention to those situations in which a non cooperative resource extraction regime dominates and where the resource extraction decisions become increasingly atomistic and decentralized among an increasing number of agents our results show the overall gains to management that can be realized with centralized and behaviourally optimal control of groundwater pumping are mostly in line with the literature on groundwater management and do not represent a novelty in that respect however we take the extra step of showing how augmentation and stabilization value change as you progress gradually from optimal extraction behavior to increasing myopia and erode the overall economic value of the resource in our results we show that in the absence of any physical constraints to groundwater extraction the increasing degree of myopia in behavior arising from increasingly atomistic and non cooperative pumping decisions reduces the augmentation value of groundwater while leaving its intrinsic stabilization value unchanged this loss of augmentation value is caused by a diminution of the perceived marginal user cost of the resource by the individual agents that drives their aggregate behaviour towards increasingly myopic extraction patterns if however continuing overdraft of the aquifer causes limits to be placed on what users can pump then the stabilization value will also begin to diminish these results point to the role that stock externalities can play in diminishing the economic value that can be realized by the users of a common pool resource such as groundwater and which act differently from the cost extermalities that arise when un interrupted access to the resource is maintained but is made more costly by a falling water table this helps to clarify the way in which the economic value of groundwater in irrigation or other direct use can be affected by user behavior according to the external effects that are imposed by sub optimal extraction behavior 1 introduction groundwater resources represent one of the most abundant and important sources of freshwater on the planet but the nature of hydrology complicates our efforts to study and monitor it and presents an even greater challenge when trying to manage it sustainably in the context of many users these management challenges aside the key role that groundwater plays in supporting irrigated agriculture worldwide is widely known and has been acknowledged in enabling the high value agricultural sector of california to continue operating through the severe droughts that the state has experienced in the past 1 and in enabling the uptake and wide spread use of yield enhancing green revolution technologies in south asia 2 in such regions where rainfall patterns can be un reliable or even insufficient at critical points in the crop growing cycle and surface water flows may be limited due to competing demands groundwater represents a crucial fallback resource for irrigation and plays a clear stabilizing role it is this stabilizing effect of groundwater as a buffer stock that motivated the seminal work of tsur and colleagues in describing the role of groundwater plays in the decisions of an economic agent using water for agricultural irrigation and facing uncertainty over the availability of variable surface water the papers of tsur 3 and tsur and graham tomasi 4 discussed the economic value of groundwater as a buffer stock within the context of irrigated agriculture in the arid regions of israel while the later papers of tsur 5 and gemma and tsur 6 discussed groundwater s stabilization value within the context of california s central valley and the semi arid tropics of india respectively in these papers tsur and his co authors described the economic use value of groundwater in irrigation in terms of both its ability to provide stability to an otherwise uncertain supply of rainfall or surface water flows as well as its ability to augment the overall supply of water to the irrigator above and beyond what it would have been if only surface water was available these two respective components stabilization and augmentation comprise the key elements of the economic value of groundwater to the irrigator in their framework in this paper we take the example of kern county california to illustrate the total economic use value of groundwater in irrigation in terms of both its stabilization and augmentation value and show how this might be affected by sub optimal non cooperative groundwater extraction as well as by constraints to pumping that irrigators might face by examining the behavioral and physical dimensions that could lead to a loss of both augmentation and stabilization value in groundwater we expand the discussion that has occurred within the literature on this topic and illustrate how these economic values can be evaluated within the context of non cooperative dynamic game problems in our study we do not address the economic value that groundwater embodies beyond its use in irrigated agricultural production as other studies have done when trying to capture the ways in which ecosystem functions are impaired by groundwater over exploitation 7 or by those studies which try to elicit the value of groundwater as natural capital 8 or through other means of eliciting user specific valuation 9 we limit ourselves to the more narrow definition of economic use value in irrigation in order to simplify and reduce the pathways through which groundwater over abstraction can affect economic net benefits of resource users and to place these results squarely within the context of irrigation focused case studies of groundwater extraction that were seminal in clarifying the types of externalities that arise from sub optimal resource use behavior as a result of imposing alternative regimes of management and property rights 10 14 a number of these cited studies go into depth in exploring the nature of the externalities that are generated by groundwater over exploitation and some discuss the alternative policy instruments that can be applied to address sub optimal resource extraction on the part of water users in order to enhance economic use efficiency and resource sustainability over time we do not spend time addressing these issues given the extent to which it has already been discussed by other papers looking at groundwater management issues in the western us and elsewhere instead we focus on how the separate components of stabilization and augmentation value are affected by user behavior in order to bring greater insight to this relatively under studied aspect of groundwater resource economics the rest of this paper is designed as follows in the following section we give an overview of the key conceptual components that comprise the economic use value of groundwater in irrigation as discussed in the literature the section which follows uses an empirical application of groundwater exploitation that is based on a well known case in kern county california which we adapt to account for both optimal and sub optimal behavior we then illustrate the impacts of changing user behavior and pumping constraints on the economic use value of groundwater and discuss its implications before concluding the paper 2 background in this section we give the background and supporting literature on groundwater s stabilization value that provides the reader with the necessary context for understanding the concepts of groundwater s economic use value in irrigation that we will use in the paper the literature on the stabilization value of groundwater begins with the seminal work of yakov tsur who began with an examination of how groundwater stocks provide stability to water supply used for irrigation in the israeli desert the chapter of tsur and issar 15 laid out the conceptual basis for thinking about groundwater s stabilizing role in the face of uncertainty over surface water supplies the paper of tsur 3 applied this concept to an empirical case of an israeli kibbutz in the negev desert and found that 70 of the per hectare economic value of groundwater to irrigated agriculture lay in its ability to stabilize water supply we draw from the discussion of groundwater s economic value to irrigation within these papers to describe how the irrigation value is divided between the stabilization and augmentation components that are described further in what follows 2 1 defining augmentation and stabilization value our conceptualization of augmentation and stabilization value is derived from the underlying economics that drives the behavior of an agent or multiple agents who want s to gain the maximum net benefit from the use of water whether from surface or groundwater sources in a productive activity such as agriculture we present the details of such a water user s production problem in technical annex a for the interested reader and proceed here to describe how it relates to the valuation of surface and groundwater resources if we were to summarize the net benefits arising from the water user s problem by a concave net benefit function n b w then we can write out the gains to stabilizing the value of a stochastic water allocation w at its mean value w as 1 s v n b w e n b w as was shown by gemma tsur 6 if were to take an approximation of the expected value of net benefits under the stochastic outcome using a 2nd order taylor s series expansion around the mean value w we would obtain 2 e n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 where σ 2 is the variance of the stochastic distribution of water around its mean value i e σ 2 e w w 2 and n b w is the 2nd derivative of the net benefit function if we substitute this expression into equation we get an approximation to the stabilization value of water as 3 s v n b w e n b w n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 1 2 n b w σ 2 which clearly increases with the variability of water supply and with the curvature of the net benefit function since we know that a quasi concave net benefit function must satisfy the condition n b w 0 and that variance is positive we therefore know that the stabilization value is positive or non negative in the case of quasi concavity this positive quantity is representative of the risk neutral decision maker s willingness to pay in order to receive the mean quantity w with assurance rather than have to face the uncertainty in the realization of w as a stochastic outcome we can also consider the additional benefit that can arise if another more stable source of water is found say from groundwater if we think of groundwater as providing the stability in water supply embodied in n b w as well as providing additional supply over and above what the decision maker would obtain with surface water alone then the benefit of augmenting the agent s water supply with groundwater i e the augmentation value av would be given as 4 a v n b w g n b w where g is the amount of groundwater pumped if we add the stabilization and augmentation values of groundwaer in equations 1 and 4 respectively we can obtain an expression for the total economic use value tev of groundwater as 5 t e v s v a v n b w e n b w n b w g n b w n b w g e n b w which captures the gains to moving from a situation where one relies solely upon a stochastic supply of water for productive use such as from rainfall or surface runoff to one in which the source of water is effectively stabilized and augmented with groundwater resources in reality the presence of groundwater would not alter the period to period realizations of surface water inflow but would allow the agent the opportunity to make period to period decisions on groundwater pumping that would enable any shortfall to be compensated for with increased withdrawals from the aquifer conversely when there is an above average realization of surface water inflow then the agent is able to pump less in order to receive the same total amount of water what would change period to period under a stochastic series of surface water realizations is the amount of groundwater that would be pumped and its share in the overall mix of water sources as tsur issar 15 note this effectively moves the uncertainty over water from the production side i e how much output can be realized with a given quantity of water realization to the cost side where the same output can be achieved but at a cost which varies with the needed amount of supplemental groundwater pumping this assumes that cost is the only consideration that could potentially ration groundwater use which is a critical assumption as rad et al 16 have pointed out we return to the significance of this assumption later in the paper 2 2 discussion of groundwater stabilization value from the literature while the early papers of tsur issar 15 and tsur 3 addressed the economic value of groundwater in irrigation within a static framework the 1991 paper of tsur and graham tomasi grounded their analysis within the framework of dynamic optimization and laid out a conceptual basis for thinking about how the evaluation of groundwater s buffer 1 1 although the terms buffer value and stabilization value have been used interchangeably by some authors we have opted to use the latter term in this paper given that we re not explicitly trying to derive an economic value for the aquifer as a finite resource stock as one would a stockpile of grain in a silo we feel that the term stabilization is more descriptive of the role we see groundwater playing in providing a flow of benefits over time value should be carried out when the uncertainty governing the future realization of surface supplies is resolved or not before the groundwater pumping decision is made in this paper they took up the example of groundwater irrigation in the negev desert and varied some key parameters to give a range of economic values for groundwater over which the share of buffer value in the overall total varied from 5 under low pumping costs low sw variability and a larger sized aquifer to 84 when the aquifer size is smaller the pumping cost is higer and the variability of sw is at a maximum the chapter of tsur 5 evaluated the stabilization value of groundwater within the context of the groundwater recharge scheme used in the arvin edison water district of southern california and found it to be 47 of the total economic value of groundwater in the paper of gemma and tsur 6 the authors evaluated the stabilization value of groundwater in a case study of tamil nadu india to be 25 of the overall total economic value of groundwater and another study of tamil nadu by palanisami and co authors 17 found it to be 15 of the total in all of these papers there is no discussion of how the behavior of water users might affect these calculations of groundwater s economic value the paper of foster et al 18 which looked at the case of tomato production in the central valley of california pointed out that declining well yields as a consequence of groundwater overdraft could degrade the ability of the aquifer to deliver its full stabilization value in their example they showed how the well yields could be negatively impacted over time but did not quantify the implications on the total economic value of groundwater or on how the share belonging to stabilization value might be affected the analysis of rad et al 16 used explicit production modeling to quantify the yield losses that occur when groundwater availability is limited and its full buffer value cannot be exploited they did not show how the economic values they calculated as losses relate to the overall value of groundwater and its constituent parts i e augmentation stabilization which is a distinction we try and maintain throughout this paper in this paper we examine both of the components of groundwater s overall economic use value the stabilization and augmentation value and see how they are affected by changes in the user s behavioral incentives as well as by other constraints to water use that the user might face we see the value of our paper as providing a level of conceptual clarity that is lacking in the literature over which component of groundwater s economic value is affected by sub optimal resource extraction behavior or by difficulties encountered in accessing the resource itself we feel that this has not been addressed well in the literature and that it constitutes the primary contribution of this paper 3 methods an empirical application to california the empirical setting that we choose for our investigation of groundwater s value in irrigation is that of kern county california which has been examined by several authors 19 24 although not in the context of evaluating the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater under varying assumptions on behavior and resource access we return to this well documented example for our empirical illustration of the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater so that the contribution we are able to make to the understanding of these economic components of resource value can be immediately placed in the context of what we already know about this basin this should provide a ready point of departure for any interested reader who wishes to apply these concepts elsewhere 3 1 model specification 3 1 1 a simplified hydrology in this paper we follow the simplified hydrology of the aquifer in kern county used by feinerman and knapp 19 in which the bathtub representation critiqued by authors such as brozovic et al 25 is adopted for simplicity of exposition 2 2 we will make note of the limitations that this formulation poses to our interpretation of model results later in the paper in this representation there is net recharge r that goes into the aquifer along with the return flows from irrigation with surface and groundwater the total water used for irrigation is a combination of water pumped from the aquifer q along with surface water flows s which we treat as exogenous to the key decision on groundwater pumping and which is stochastic in nature the combination of surface and groundwater gives us to the total water applied to agriculture i e w q s fig 1 below shows how recharge surface water flows groundwater pumping and return flows from both water sources form the overall hydrological balance that we capture within this simplified framework in order to model the way in which the distance between the water table and the ground surface i e the lift l were to evolve over time we use the following equation of motion for lift 6 l t 1 l t 1 θ q r t θ s t a s y w h e r e r t 1 ε i t r in which l t 1 is the lift to the groundwater table in the next period and represents the carry over level of the groundwater stock that remains in future the volumetric quantities of groundwater pumping return flow and aquifer recharge are translated into units of lift by dividing through by the irrigated surface area a and the specific yield of the aquifer s y in these expressions θ represents the deep percolation into the aquifer while a represents the areal extent of the aquifer and s y is its specific yield recharge r t is given in terms of a base annual level of recharge r plus the share of total sw inflow into the basin i that goes to groundwater once the share that goes into surface irrigation ξ is accounted for it is that portion that goes to surface irrigation ξ i s that we are referring to as the surface water flow that makes up part of the total applied water to agriculture w q s and which enters into the decision maker s economic problem some of the key parameter values used to characterize the aquifer are shown in table 1 and follows the empirical values employed by feinerman knapp 19 and knapp olson 22 the stochastic nature of surface water availability for this example is characterized by the probability distribution of surface water inflows to kern county that was noted in table ii of knapp and olson 22 and which is shown in part b of the technical annex where we explain how it was used to generate a series of flows s t used in our quantitative analysis 3 1 2 the economic model to motivate the economic framework in which we will be examining the behavioral dimensions of water users we start with defining the welfare criteria that we used to evaluate the benefits received from the use of water surface or ground for irrigation starting from the formulation of net benefits and its implicit maximization by water users we expand on the definition of net benefits to irrigated production from water use used by feinerman knapp 19 and subsequent studies shown below 7 max q 0 b w e l q w q s 0 w h e r e b w a w 1 2 b w 2 where the benefit function b w whose parameter values are given in table 1 satisfies the conditions of concavity that were applied to the net benefit function n b w described in section 2 to motivate the concept of stabilization and augmentation value note here that the benefit side accounts for the total applied water to irrigated agriculture which includes pumped groundwater whereas the cost side of the objective function only accounts for the pumping cost of groundwater for which e represents the energy cost of lifting a unit volume of water over a unit length of lift this problem represents the decision making process of an economic agent who only maximizes the immediate benefits from water use without considering the implicit economic carry over value of the groundwater stock that is left in the aquifer such a myopically extracting agent would only consider the marginal benefits of pumping in the current period and would not internalize any of the user cost that conveys the benefits of having more groundwater stock left over in the next period in order to achieve optimality with respect to maximizing the net benefits that could be derived from using the groundwater resource over a multi period time horizon we adopt the dynamic programming framework has been applied to groundwater extraction problems like this since the early 1960s starting with the seminal work of oscar burt 26 27 and followed by others 28 29 13 in this framework the maximized value of the groundwater exploitation problem adds the immediate net benefits from groundwater use to the discounted value of carrying over stock to the following period and applies a similar optimality criterion to that quantity which is left over this is captured in the equation below which is the classical bellman equation that lies at the heart of many dynamic programming problems 30 8 v l t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 l t 1 l t q t θ w t r a s y w t q t s t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 θ q t θ s t r a s y in this problem v l is a value function that gives the maximized value of the optimization problem for any value of the state variable l the expectations operator is used to capture the fact that surface water realizations are stochastic although the uncertainty over any given realization is resolved before the agent needs to make the pumping decision in any period 3 3 this resolution of uncertainty prior to the choice of the optimal pumping level is equivalent to the ex post regime described by tsur and graham tomasi 4 and in their estimation is appropriate to the western us where surface water contracts are often known in advance and where irrigation waters are typically diverted from streamflows generated by snow melt whose potential volume in high altitude snow pack is closely monitored and noted for planning purposes by surface water managers therefore we adopt this information regime in our paper the details for solving this kind of dynamic programming problem are given in technical annexes c and d 3 2 evaluating the economic use value of groundwater in order to calculate the total economic use value of groundwater in irrigation along with its constituent components as laid out in equation 5 we have to define the economic problem of water usage for irrigation in terms the case with and without uncertainty as well as the case with and without groundwater the analogue to the dynamic programming problem embodied in equation 8 which deals with the case of certainty in surface water inflow is that shown below 9 v l t max q b q t s e l t q t β v l t q t θ q t s r a s y where the mean value of the stochastic surface water inflow s is realized in each period in the case where there is no groundwater available the decision maker s problem is simply to maximize the net benefits that are achievable with the available surface water on hand in the case of a stochastic regime of surface water inflow the decision maker s problem is the simple static optimization problem shown below 10 max w 0 e b w w s max w 0 e a w 1 2 b w 2 w s whereas in the case where the mean value of surface water inflow is available in each period the decision maker s problem becomes 11 max w 0 b w w s max w 0 a w 1 2 b w 2 w s in both cases the decision maker s problem is static given that there is no groundwater stock to manage and carry forward into subsequent periods leaving the current period s realization of surface water as the sole resource available using the results from the optimization problems given in equations 8 11 we can now evaluate the augmentation value the stabilization value and therefore the total economic use value of groundwater using the relationships shown in 5 which we now re state in terms of the notation used in our empirical example of california in the expressions below for the stabilization value of groundwater we can use the solutions from the optimization problems in 10 and 11 to calculate 12 s v 1 t τ 1 t τ t max 0 w s b w max 0 w s t b w 1 t τ 1 t τ t b s b s t where the benefit function b w is assumed to be maximized at the maximum allowable surface water allocation in each period and where the problem is simulated over t time periods the calculation of maximized benefits is carried out over the portion of the simulation horizon that starts from period t τ where τ can be arbitrarily chosen 4 4 given the nature of the static problem being solved the choice of τ is not of great consequence for the subsequent calculations with the dynamic model however it is best to choose a value of τ that is closer to that part of the simulation horizon where the model achieves a steady state or something close to it this is in line with the assumptions applied in the analysis by gemma tsur 6 and tsur graham tomasi 4 in the case of calculating the augmentation value of groundwater we use the dynamic optimization problem in 9 and the static problem given in 11 to make the following calculation 13 a v 1 t τ 1 t τ t b q ˆ t s e l t q ˆ t max 0 w s b w t τ t b q ˆ t s e l t q ˆ t b s t τ 1 where q ˆ t is the solution to the dynamic problem 9 in each period i e q ˆ t argmax q 0 b q t s e l t q t β v l t q t θ q t s r a s y for t τ t and where the value of groundwater lift l t in each period is recursively updated using the equation of motion and the optimal value of groundwater pumping in the previous period it should be noted that the calculation for stabilization value in equation 12 only involves the surface water component s and s and does not include the quantity of pumped groundwater q ˆ as does the expression for augmentation value equation 13 implicit in this definition of stabilization value is the fact that the stable mean quantity s can always be obtained as a result of groundwater pumping and that it is preferable to an unstable and stochastically varying quantity s that fluctuates around this mean for this reason we would expect the stabilization value under these conditions to be invariant over any range of behaviors that might affect the pumping behavior q ˆ that is incorporated into the augmentation value calculation we will see this intuition confirmed in the following section and observe that only augmentation value responds directly to behavioral changes when groundwater is not quantity constrained we will also see however a change in stabilization value occur when the quantity of groundwater available becomes so limiting as to make the stable equivalent of surface water at its mean value unattainable this is a possibility that was not directly addressed in the discussion of stabilization value by tsur and his co authors and is a case sensitivity that we will explore and discuss more fully in what follows 4 results by following the scheme of calculating the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater that was explained in the previous section we obtain the results shown in table 2 below in this table we see that the stabilization value of groundwater constitutes 17 of the total overall economic value of groundwater which stands at 35 5 million per year for the study area we can put these results in context by looking at other assessments of stabilization value that have come from the literature in the chapter of tsur 5 based on a specific water district within kern county the author evaluated the share of stabilization value in the total economic use value of groundwater to be 47 in this analysis however the author did not account for changes in the cost of groundwater pumping as we have and kept a fixed value over time the paper of gemma tsur 6 did an evaluation of stabilization value for a case study in india and found that it accounted for over 25 of the tev this was a lower bound estimate given that they assumed there to be unlimited groundwater availability thereby making their calculated augmentation value an upper bound estimate they made this assumption due to the lack of data that would have enabled them to model of groundwater pumping behavior directly as we have as we will discuss in a later section this assumption about the availability and accessibility of groundwater turns out to be a critical one especially when evaluating the economic value of groundwater s potential to stabilize water supply in irrigation 4 1 impact of behavior on augmentation value in this section we extend our analysis of the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater to see how they might be affected by deviations in behavior from the socially optimal regime of a single central authority who exerts full control over the resource and maintains dynamic efficiency in how it is extracted over time this deviation from social optimality is oftentimes the norm in real life behavior as it relates to groundwater use and most other types of human activity but does not only arise from myopia on the part of the resource user even dynamically optimizing agents can create sub optimal outcomes in how a resource is exploited if they choose to act non cooperatively some examples of earlier literature that looked at this within the context of common pool resource extraction are the works of khalatbari 31 eswaran and lewis 32 and reinganum and stokey 33 the paper of provencher and burt 14 was among the first to discuss the common pool problems of groundwater management in this way so we will now extend the groundwater pumping problem modeled in the bellman equations of 8 and 9 to address a more generalized case where more than one player is engaged in groundwater extraction and where these agents are forward looking and dynamically optimizing with respect to the internalized user cost that the derivative of the carry over value function embodies these agents however do not coordinate their pumping or cooperate explicitly to yield the socially optimal outcome that the sole decision maker with control over the entire aquifer can achieve thereby achieving a sub optimal outcome with respect to the central planner case these agents are essentially engaged in a dynamic game in which their pumping behavior is strategic and results in outcome which represents a markov sub game perfect nash equilibrium this is exactly the type of strategic behavior captured by negri 12 34 and others 33 35 39 the dynamic game which characterizes this interaction can be written as follows 14 v i l t max w e b i w t i e l t q t i β v i l t 1 θ q t i n 1 q t θ s t r a s y s t w t i q t i s t n where each of the n players chooses her own pumping level q t i while taking the pumping actions of the other n 1 agents as exogenous and given q t the amount of available surface water is also assumed to be shared across agents equally for simplicity we impose symmetry on this problem and assume that each player expects all n 1 other agents to behave exactly as they would as such we have maintained all the same physical and behavioral parameters that define the groundwater pumping problem as identical for each agent in order to make the aggregate welfare add up over all players to the same level as that for the single agent case we have multiplied the original slope parameter of the demand function for water by n such that b i b n for each of the n players in the dynamic game we do this so that we capture the erosion of incentives for resource conservation that are occurring in aggregate without changing the aggregate scale of irrigation based activities in the case study area 5 5 this approach illustrates what would happen if the 800 or so irrigators in the original survey of kern county used by ref 19 study were to move from aligning their pumping preferences in perfect unison towards increasingly individual considerations as smaller and smaller blocks of irrigators take control of their pumping decisions we simulate myopia by setting n 1000 which is essentially each irrigator acting on their own the details for how this dynamic n player game is solved is given in technical annex d the strategic and non cooperative behavior of the agents can be observed to change the pattern of aggregate groundwater pumping over time as the decision making for irrigating the aggregate acreage of this kern county case area is spread out over an increasing number of players as seen in fig 2 below the optimal pumping rule of each player converges towards that of a purely myopic agent as the number of decision makers in the aggregate pumping game increases and the rents of holding an extra unit of stock into the next period are gradually dissipated this phenomenon was shown clearly by negri 34 in his analytical derivation of a differential game of groundwater extraction and is driven by the diminution of the marginal user cost that each player internalizes when considering the first order conditions of his own optimal pumping strategy solution in the technical annex to the paper we show that for n 1 the carry over value function for the individual agent is equivalent to that of the idealized central planner who would coordinate and harmonize all pumping within the groundwater basin to maximize the overall social net benefits over time we also show that the derivative of the value function converges to zero as the number of decision making agents gets larger i e v l t 1 l 0 a s n which means that the user cost i e β 1 θ a s y v l t 1 also goes to zero 6 6 we point out that we are using the dynamic game framework in this paper to change groundwater conservation incentives and therefore groundwater pumping behavior this is to illustrate the effect of changing behavior on the calculated augmentation and stabilization values and not to make any particular point regarding groundwater policy the aggregate effect of the change in groundwater pumping behavior as the number of decision makers increases from 1 is seen in the way that groundwater lift evolves over time in fig 3 below at the end of 50 periods the difference in groundwater lift between the central planner and complete myopia is over 100 ft as was seen in fig 2 the convergence to myopia is relatively rapid once we begin adding agents to the dynamic game beyond 2 players in order to establish a benchmark of economic efficiency in a case with multiple agents we take the dynamic programming problem facing the central planner who jointly maximizes the net benefits of all players over the planning horizon the problem facing the central planner can be written as follows 15 v c p l t max w i i 1 n e i 1 n b i w t i e l t q t i β v c p l t 1 θ i q t i θ s t r a s y s t i w t i i q t i s t in which the carry over value of the groundwater stock in the next period i e v c p l t 1 takes into account the future benefit accruing to all players of each type and therefore embodies the true social user cost of groundwater extraction if we were to calculate the aggregate and cumulative present value of net benefits that are realized when all of the groundwater extraction for irrigation in the case study area is centralized and dynamically optimal control and compare it to the aggregate cumulative present value of net benefits that are realized under dynamically optimizing but individually non cooperative extraction decisions we obtain the results shown in table 3 below these values reflect the gains in cumulative present value of net benefits realized under various configurations of the dynamic game over the myopic case and show these gains to be steadily decreasing with the number of players these results conform to those of dixon 21 who also showed that the strategic non cooperative behavior involving a small number of agents is able to capture a sizeable portion of the management gains realized under centralized and optimal control given that the agents still internalize a large fraction of the social user cost of extraction as the number players increases the non cooperative solution diverges more from the central planner s optimal path towards that of myopic behavior and increasing gains to centralized management are realized as is consistent with other literature evaluating the use value of groundwater for irrigation ignoring other co benefits these gains are relatively small and are not of central interest in this paper to explain nonetheless we give discussion and details of how these gains to management are calculated and interpreted in the technical annex e in parallel with the changes that we ve shown above as the number of players engaged in the dynamic game increase we can also show what happens to the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater starting from the results we discussed in table 2 where the entire groundwater basin was under the control of a unitary decision maker who exercised dynamic efficiency in terms of pumping behavior and achieving the maximal net benefits across time we see a loss of that maximal value as the numbers of decision makers increases in parallel to what we have shown in table 3 above as can be seen in fig 4 below as we increase the number of players from the case of the unitary decision maker i e the planner where n 1 we get a steady diminution of the augmentation value of groundwater but a constant value for stabilization value across these cases the fact that stabilization value remains constant is not surprising given its definition which is based upon the stabilizing effect it has on that part of water supply that can be attributed to the mean value of surface water inflow as was shown in equations 1 and 12 since this is not directly affected by the addition of other agents into the dynamic game its calculated value also does not change in the technical annex f we show analytically how augmentation value changes with the addition of agents to the dynamic non cooperative game given the decline of the augmentation value as the number of players increases and the parallel decline in the total economic use value of groundwater as stabilization value remains constant we observe an increasing value of the ratio s v t e v as is shown in fig 5 below in the following sub section we examine a situation in which both components of groundwater s total economic use value in irrigation could be impacted under increasingly myopic behavior 4 2 impact of extraction constraints on stabilization value in the previous case we observed a constancy in the stabilization value of groundwater as the number of players increased due to the fact that the fundamental calculation of stabilization value sv rests upon the implied guarantee that surface water is available at its mean level for any actual realization of s t given the presence of groundwater and the ability to control its use to compensate for surface water fluctuations in the cases that we have observed so far the total water that irrigators have available for beneficial use have exceeded the mean surface water inflow levels as is shown in the figure below fig 6 as we see that combination of groundwater and available surface water satisfies the inequality 16 i 1 n q t i s t s in all periods of the simulation thereby demonstrating the role that groundwater extraction has in assuring the total availability of water for irrigation at a level no less than the mean value of surface water inflow this illustration conforms to the original concept of stabilization value motivated by tsur and other co authors if for some reason however there were to arise a constraint on groundwater pumping in conditions where the performance of wells drawing from the aquifer has been limited or compromised by increasing overdraft within the groundwater basin then this assurance of sufficient groundwater availability to satisfy the inequality 16 may not hold we can simulate such a situation by imposing the following condition on the groundwater user s optimization problem such that 17 q t i l max l 0 which suggests that in order for groundwater pumping to be non zero the level of groundwater lift has to remain below a critical level l max otherwise extraction is no longer possible we acknowledge that this type of constraint is rather crude in form and does not address the subtle aspects of the arguments that authors like foster et al 2015 or rad et al 2020 were trying to draw out in their discussion of declining well yields and its effect on groundwater benefits for irrigation we use an annual time step for modeling groundwater pumping whereas their studies looked at well yield in a more appropriate time scale of quantities pumped per day and tied it into the sub annual irrigation requirements for various crops what we are trying to accomplish here by modeling a constraint on the total amount that one can pump from an aquifer on an annual basis is to provide a contrast to the purely economic effects that changing user incentives and behavior have on the aggregate amount of benefits that irrigators receive from groundwater in this case we define a physical threshold that when crossed forces pumping to cease even when it might still be economically feasible or desirable to continue pumping in situations where groundwater extraction is sub optimal and approaching myopia the possibility of reaching and exceeding this threshold becomes more likely as we see in the results below fig 7 which were generated for the case where l max 500 ft 7 7 the choice of 500 ft for the value of l max is rather arbitrary and we explore the sensitivity of these results across a range of cut off values l max in technical appendix g in this case we see that simulating the aggregate levels of pumping and surface water availability over same range of behavioral regimes as before results in cases for n 6 where the condition embodied in the inequality 16 is not satisfied for those cases the assurance of stabilization at the mean value of surface water inflow is no longer present and they face situations where the availability of water for beneficial use is below s for such cases we would have to therefore revise downward the value of available water that can be obtained with certainty such that the inequality 16 can again be satisfied albeit with a new right hand side value w n s t a b l e such that 18 i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e s where the value of w n s t a b l e could vary with changes in the number of players n we find this value by inspection of the simulated results for a given number of players n and value of l max such that we get the highest value of w n s t a b l e that allows the constraint in equation 16 to be binding for the latter part of the simulation horizon i e i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e a s t a revision of this type would necessitate a re calculation of the stabilization value of groundwater where we would use the new value of available water that the presence of groundwater albeit under constraint would effectively provide a stable floor to the user in place of s in equation 12 in other words we would now calculate the stabilization value of groundwater using this expression 19 s v n 1 t τ 1 t τ t b w n s t a b l e b s t where under constraints to pumping we could have w n s t a b l e declining with n thereby making b w n s t a b l e decline with increasing numbers and thereby making s v n a declining function of n as well we see this kind of trend unfold in the figure below where there is a decline in stabilization value beyond the n 2 case along with the decline of augmentation value making the loss in the total economic value of groundwater more pronounced although the changes in stabilization value might appear slight from how the variation appears in fig 8 above we see that the percentage differences show over a third or up to nearly half in one case of the stabilization value of groundwater can be lost when behavioral change causes the increase in pumping and groundwater lift to run up against the limits imposed by such a constraint this can be seen from the results in table 4 below we can better appreciate the difference the pumping constraint makes by directly comparing the changes in stabilization value between the case where there is a limit on groundwater pumping versus that in which there is none as is shown in the figure below fig 9 we can make a similar comparison between these cases in terms of the total economic use value in irrigation as is shown in fig 10 below in this figure we see the contrast between these two is significant and amounts to a loss in nearly 10 million per year of aggregate benefit to irrigation due to the presence of pumping limits the connection between the behavioral effects of increasing the number of players in the dynamic game and the loss of augmentation value is made through the impact that decreasing the groundwater conservation incentives embodied in the marginal user cost of the irrigator s dynamic programming problem has on the steady state value of groundwater lift fig 11 below shows that as the level of lift that the users face at steady state increases the augmentation value diminishes from this figure we see that this diminution is more pronounced as we increase the number of players from n 1 and start to move from the case of the central planner to the non cooperative dynamic game between two players the rate at which this diminution occurs then decreases and converges to a steady state value of lift that is consistent with that under myopic pumping behavior this pattern reflects what we saw in figs 2 and 3 where we observe the pumping decision rule and the resulting levels of lift to rapidly converge on the myopic case once the number of players exceeds 2 the changes in augmentation value in response to adding players to the dynamic game is further discussed in part e of the technical annex 5 discussion from our analysis we have tried to compare two key factors that affect the total economic use value of groundwater that can be realized and enjoyed by all of its users namely 1 incentive driven behavior and 2 physical constraints to groundwater abstraction the first aspect that we explored was that of non cooperative behavior among groundwater users in which we have forward looking and dynamically optimizing agents becoming increasingly myopic in their behavior as we add more decision makers to the extraction game we showed that the effect that this increasing myopia has on eroding the overall economic use value of groundwater acts through the erosion of augmentation value but does not affect the stabilization value of groundwater as long as the agents are able to withdraw whatever amount of groundwater they want even if at increasing cost we showed that when this ability to withdraw groundwater at any cost is impaired then we also begin to lose the implicit stabilization value that groundwater embodies for those users who face variability in alternative surface water supplies in the sensitivity analysis that we do in technical annex g we see that the decline in stabilization value is more pronounced when we lower the cutoff threshold for gw pumping l max from 500 ft to 400 ft and that it remains stable as it was in fig 5 when we raise it to 600 ft this seems intuitive since making the cut off for pumping more stringent would allow the groundwater users even less room to make use of the available groundwater for offsetting shortfalls in surface water flows by the users being constrained in being able to stabilize their overall water supply in this way the groundwater begins to lose its stabilization potential the loss in augmentation value also increases in general when decreasing l max from 600 ft to 400 ft for a given number of players in the groundwater extraction game we recognize that the way we have formulated the problem imposes the groundwater constraint on all users identically and does not allow for the case where some users with deeper wells might be able to continue pumping beyond the level of groundwater lift that is unreachable for others our assumption of symmetry on the part of all players in the dynamic game is one of the key factors behind this as well as the fact that we re maintaining the bathtub aquifer formulation of the original kern county studies of feinerman knapp and others in such a formulation the bottom of the aquifer is perpendicular to the sides and all users spread out along the surface area overlying the aquifer are at an equal distance to the bottom of the aquifer this is in contrast to the formulation used in the study of merrill and guilfoos 40 where the cone shaped aquifer introduces a spatial dimension to the stock externality imposed by one player upon another such that the users on the outer edge of the cone will experience depletion and loss of access to the resource before those on the inner concentric rings of the conical aquifer do while this imposition of homogeneity across users and the strategic and stock externalities that they impose upon each other does not invalidate the qualitative nature of the results that we show it does point to an aspect of the socio economic dimensions of groundwater based agricultural economies that is of relevance in cases where there are some users with extraction technologies that allow them to exploit the resource more effectively and at greater levels of groundwater lift than others they have a different perception of the stabilization value of groundwater and are able to enjoy the stabilizing effects of the resource beyond the level of depletion that would ration the pumping of others to zero and leave them solely reliant upon the surface water flows that are available the juxtaposition of hand dug and relatively shallow wells in the northern and central irrigated areas of india next to deeper tubewells that are able to tap the aquifer up to greater depths and thereby draw down the water table below the limits of the shallower well has created an inequality of resource access that has been noted by researchers 41 the additional dimension of well deepening as a user decision aside from that of pumping quantity was introduced into the analysis of groundwater depletion in india by sayre and taraz 42 as a way of illustrating how the race to the bottom can be further accelerated if the ability to overcome the threshold introduced by l max in our analysis can be achieved by deepening the reach of the tubewell even further we hope to explore these dimensions of user heterogeneity spatial asymmetry and resource access inequality in further extensions to this study although a few studies in the literature have addressed the potential of not being able to benefit from the full stabilization potential of groundwater when there are constraints on the rate of pumping imposed by a decrease in well yields or other reasons no study has illustrated its direct impact upon the implicit stabilization benefits that groundwater provides to water users facing variable surface water supplies in the way that we have tsur and his co authors motivated their original interest in looking at stabilization value in terms of un covering the economic benefits of maintaining expanding or newly exploiting groundwater resource potential in a way that traditional cost benefit approaches might miss as tsur issar 15 and gemma tsur 6 stated ignoring the stabilization value of groundwater might cause one to underestimate the benefits that can come from investing in groundwater resource development for irrigation and bias the cost benefit analysis of irrigation investment our results provide an important caution to those trying to pursue the analysis laid out by tsur and his colleagues namely that one might end up over estimating the potential stabilization value that groundwater could offer if the underlying assumptions of the analysis ignore the physical dimensions that are critical to groundwater exploitation and which could impose limits on the pumping ability of users in the basin if such limits lie well beyond the level of groundwater overdraft that an economically rational user would pump then one could safely ignore this in an analysis of the potential economic value of groundwater but if as is the case in our illustration this threshold is crossed well within the range of groundwater lift that a user would still be willing to pump from then it becomes a relevant issue given the fact that such threshold effects are specific to the characteristics of an aquifer and may be reached sooner later or perhaps not at all in practical terms we cannot propose a general rule or criterion that can be applied universally to an economic analysis of groundwater potential we do recommend however that a more detailed analysis of a groundwater basin s ability to deliver water consistently to users should be undertaken as a follow up to a broader and more general analysis of groundwater resource potential and economic value the analysis of macewan et al 43 in which they couple a behavioral model of irrigated agricultural production to a more realistic representation of hydrological response derived from a detailed groundwater simulation model for california could be one approach that could achieve this any correction that such a follow up analysis of pumping constraints could provide would give useful information to the decision makers evaluating the costs and benefits of investing in groundwater potential and would also be important for key stakeholders in the groundwater basin to understand 6 conclusion in this paper we have demonstrated the importance of accounting for agent behavior and pumping constraints in the evaluation of the economic use value of groundwater in irrigation we have taken a well known example of kern county california from the literature to show how the total economic use value of groundwater for irrigation is shared between the intrinsic value of augmentation and stabilization that groundwater provides these results were derived from a dynamic programming framework have could be easily generalized from the case of a single unitary decision maker to that of multiple agents acting dynamically but non cooperatively this was done in order to demonstrate how the economic value of groundwater specifically the augmentation value can be dissipated with an increasing number of competing decision makers for the purposes of illustration we introduced a limit on groundwater pumping into the problem that is triggered when a threshold level of groundwater lift has been exceeded as way of modeling how groundwater users can be confronted with increasing constraints on pumping as the resource becomes over exploited by doing so were able to illustrate how the stabilization value of groundwater can also be dissipated as the aggregate pumping behavior becomes more myopic and the groundwater resource is more heavily mined the loss of stabilization value specifically was a result of the pumping limits no longer allowing the mean value of surface water inflow to be achieved in all time periods thereby causing us to lower the stable floor of available water that the groundwater user can be assured of always being able to have access to this resulted in a downward revision of the stabilization value which resulted in a further decrease in the overall economic use value of groundwater for irrigation than before our analysis expands the literature on the stabilization value of groundwater and points to some key behavioral and physical factors that can affect it along with the other components of total economic use value in irrigation this points to one of the pervasive challenges of managing common pool resources like groundwater where controlling the number of people who have access to it along with the modification of user behavior is the key to achieving sustainable resource usage for the long term while our analysis does not propose any specific policy instruments that would be effective in achieving this we provide a clearer picture as to which component of groundwater s economic use value to irrigation is lost when over exploitation occurs and in what sequence that progressive loss might occur declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper technical annex a the economic value of groundwater in production to define the total economic value of groundwater in production we start from the economic problem facing a water user who uses the resource to produce a good valued at price p while incurring some cost c w where w is the quantity of water used the profit maximization problem of this water user can be written as 20 max w 0 p f w c w where the water can be derived from either ground or surface water at the total cost specified by the function if the amount of water available was constrained in some way i e w w max then the shadow value of that constraint would represent the marginal value of water which could be traced out parametrically as the quantity of water available w was varied by doing so we would obtain the curve below fig a1 demand for water fig a1 where d w is the demand curve for water i e d w p f w 8 8 note that the function f w satisfies f w 0 f w 0 augmentation and stabilization value if we summarize the net benefits arising from the water user s problem by a net benefit function n b w p f w c w then we can write out the gains to stabilizing the value of a stochastic water allocation w at its mean value w as 21 s v n b w e n b w as was shown by gemma tsur 6 if were to take an approximation of the expected value of net benefits under the stochastic outcome using a 2nd order taylor s series expansion around the mean value w we would obtain 22 e n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 where σ 2 is the variance of the stochastic distribution of water around its mean value i e σ 2 e w w 2 and n b w is the 2nd derivative of the net benefit function if we substitute this expression into equation we get an approximation to the stabilization value of water as 23 s v n b w e n b w n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 1 2 n b w σ 2 which clearly increases with the variability of water supply and with the curvature of the net benefit function given that the cost term in the net benefit expression is convex we know that n b w p f w c w 0 that variance is positive and therefore that the stabilization value is positive this positive quantity is representative of the risk neutral decision maker s willingness to pay in order to receive the mean quantity w with assurance rather than have to face the uncertainty in the realization of w as a stochastic outcome proceeding further with the economic problem laid out in equation 20 we can consider the additional benefit that can arise if another more stable source of water is found say from groundwater if we think of groundwater as providing the stability in water supply embodied in n b w as well as providing additional supply over and above what the decision maker would obtain with surface water alone then the benefit of augmenting the agent s water supply with groundwater i e the augmentation value av would be given as 24 a v n b w g n b w where g is the amount of groundwater pumped if we add the stabilization and augmentation values of groundwaer in equations 1 and 4 respectively we can obtain an expression for the total economic value tev of groundwater as 25 t e v s v a v n b w e n b w n b w g n b w n b w g e n b w b characterizing the stochastic surface water inflow for the kern county example as was shown in equation 6 of the main text the surface water inflows i t are divided between a portion that is used for irrigation ε i t and that which contributes to the recharge of that aquifer i t 1 ε to capture the stochastic nature of inflow we used the probability distribution of surface water inflow that was described by knapp and olson 22 in table ii of their paper which we have reproduced below table b1 probability distribution of surface water inflows for the kern county example table b1 sw inflow volume millions of acre feet per year probability 0

distribution of 12 inflow levels i p that are each associated with a probability p such that the expected value i 1 12 p i i p i is equal to the 1 97 million acre feet of average surface water inflow shown in table 1 of the main text in order to take draws from this distribution we designed a sampling program that populated 12 bins of width that is in proportion to the probability weights with inflow values from the table above we then took draws from the uniform distribution 1 100 using the random number generator in gams which is the program we used to implement and solve the dynamic programming problem given that the likelihood of landing on an inflow value is directly tied to the number of values between 1 and 100 that are assigned to it within each bin we were able to simulate a series of draws that replicated the empirical distribution given in knapp and olson s paper below we show in fig b1 how the relative sampling proportions of the inflow levels taken from our simulated draws compare to the probability distribution given in the knapp olson paper fig b1 comparison of observed and simulated sw inflow probability distribution for the kern county example source author calculations fig b1 c numerical solution of the dynamic game of groundwater extraction typically in a dynamic programming problem one has to perform a series of recursive calculations to recover the exact form of the value function v l so as that one can solve the bellman equation as a static optimization problem in cases where the benefit function is more complex numerical techniques have to be employed to obtain an approximation to the function in order to proceed with a numerical solution in our case we are able to obtain the exact form of the value function by using recursive techniques detailed in part d of the technical annex to this paper in the end we find that the infinite horizon carry over value function for this problem takes on the following form 26 v l a b a e l c a e l 2 d l where the parameters a b c and d are complex functions of the basic parameters of the groundwater extraction problem including the surface water inflow level s by using the parameters shown in table 1 we can solve the bellman equation as a static optimization problem using the values of a b c and d that define the infinite horizon carry over value function of the problem as shown in the maximization problem below 27 max q t 0 e b q t s t e l t q t β a b a e l t 1 c a e l t 1 2 d l t 1 w h e r e l t 1 l t 1 θ q t θ s t r a s y b q t s t a q t s t 1 2 b q t s t 2 doing so over a sequence of time periods t 9 9 while sequentially updating the value of lift l t in each period using the value of l t 1 from the last in recursive fashion would give us a series of pumping decisions that vary with the groundwater lift in a very systematic way as the problem moves forward that relationship between groundwater pumping and the groundwater lift is shown in figure c2 below and constitutes a linear pumping rule that captures the optimal trade off between current net benefit from pumping and future discounted benefits deriving from groundwater left over for optimal use in subsequent periods fig c2 decision rule on optimal pumping derived from kern county example fig c2 we would obtain the same pumping rule analytically by taking the first order necessary conditions of the maximization problem shown in equation 8 and re arranging the terms to give an expression for q t in terms of the other model parameters and the key state variable l t by doing so we would obtain the expression below 28 q t o p t i m a l a b s t β b 1 θ a s y v l t 1 e b l t from this expression we can see that the intercept of the function is a combination of terms involving the model parameters the sw inflow and the derivative of the carry over value function v l t 1 whereas the slope is largely driven by the energy costs and the slope of the underlying demand function for water the term v l t 1 captures the marginal value of keeping an extra unit of groundwater in the aquifer i e the shadow value which is commonly referred to as the co state variable in the jargon of dynamic optimization given that adding an extra unit of lift to the pumping problem represents an increased cost to the groundwater user this shadow value is negative for this problem the combined term β 1 θ a s y v l t 1 is referred to as the marginal user cost of the groundwater resource and embodies the difference between a strictly myopic solution to the groundwater extraction problem resulting from the solution of the optimization problem in 7 and the dynamically optimal solution we obtain from the dynamic programming problem in eqn 27 we will show later how a sub optimal behavioral regime can reduce the marginal user cost and cause the solution embodied in figure c2 to shift towards one that follows a myopic extraction rule in part d of the technical appendix we derive the optimal pumping rule in terms of its infinite horizon parameter values which are comprised of the basic parameters of the problem in table 1 and the more complex parameters a b c and d shown in equation eqn 26 this gives us 29 q t o p t i m a l φ 1 φ 2 a e l t w h e r e φ 1 γ β d e b b s n 2 e 2 γ β c θ s r b 2 e γ 2 β n c φ 2 1 2 e γ β c b 2 e γ 2 β n c we will employ this form of the pumping rule within an analytical illustration that will be given in a later section of the paper d derivation of the infinite horizon value function for the dynamic game starting with the example of kern county based on the paper of feinerman and knapp 19 and the other ones that followed it we set out to derive the closed form solution of the infinite horizon carry over value function for groundwater lift in the next period so that we can apply it to the solution of the following problem stated in equation 8 of section 3 1 of the paper 30 v l t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 l t 1 l t q t θ w t r a s y w t q t s t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 θ q t θ s t r a s y given that we would want to address both the problem of the central planner as well as the decentralized problem that each individual groundwater using agent solves in a non cooperative manner we develop our solution with the dynamic game setting in mind so as to achieve the most general case in the case where we only want to consider the central planner s problem we would set n 1 and the solution would converge to that case otherwise we would get a result that would be applicable to any number of players groundwater pumping game now consider a simple dynamic and symmetric game of strategic pumping from a common aquifer which will illustrate the competitive equilibrium that we would expect between players pumping from the same aquifer the lift to the groundwater table i e the distance over which water has to be pumped to the surface at time t l t evolves according to the equation of motion below 10 10 note that the parameter ξ does not appear anywhere in our derivations since it is used to translate the value of total surface water inflow into the basin i into the quantity that contributes towards the recharge of the aquifer r 1 ξ i r and that which is available for irrigation s ξ i therefore it is embedded in those quantities s r used in our derivations 31 l t 1 l t 1 θ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s t r t a s y l t γ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s t r t w h e r e γ 1 θ a s y θ θ a s y r t r t a s y here we have kept the same overall form of the equation as in the main text equation 6 but have now simplified it by dividing certain terms through by the quantity a s y that had appeared in the denominator of the 2nd rhs term of the equation this gives us a more compact equation whose terms we can carry through more easily in the derivations that will follow in contrast to equation 6 where we just have a single agent we have a representation of all of the other n 1 identical agents who are also pumping from the aquifer and whose aggregate pumping behavior is an exogenous quantity n 1 q ˆ to the single agent s maximization problem the net benefit function for water use is quadratic for each player i and includes the water that is pumped from the aquifer q t i as well as the surface water that is available and divided evenly over all n agents s t n this net benefit function incorporates the cost effect of having decreasing groundwater levels and increasing levels of lift such that 32 n b i w i a w i b 2 w i 2 e l t q t i a 1 2 b w i w i e l t q t i s t w t i q t i s t n a 1 2 b q t i s t n q t i s t n e l t q t i here the marginal costs of groundwater withdrawal which incorporate the unit energy cost e increase linearly with the depth to groundwater i e lift l t and is faced by all n agents the parameters a and b describe the marginal benefits and costs of groundwater withdrawals respectively and are shared by all players with the slope term being scaled according to the number of players i e b b n so that the aggregate benefit adds up to that given by the original feinerman knapp 19 model b as shown in table 1 of the main text therefore when describing the dynamic game problem of player i we can write out the infinite horizon dynamic problem facing player i as follows 33 v i l t max q t i a 1 2 b q t i s t n q t i s t n e l t q t i β v i l t 1 θ q t i n 1 q ˆ t θ s t r t a s y which we can simplify further by dropping the time subscripts 11 11 we have also simplified here further by dropping the expectations operator given that we are dealing with the case where the decision maker makes the pumping decision ex post of knowing the realization of surface water we can treat surface water as a known quantity to the decision maker s problem we do this because of the closed loop autonomous nature of the infinite horizon dynamic programming problem presented here in which only the current state of the state and control variables are relevant to the maximization problem of the decision maker in any given period therefore we can state the bellman equation in eqn 33 for player i as 34 v i l max q i a 1 2 b q i s n q i s n e l q i β v i l t γ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s t r t where we also use the more compact form of the equation of motion from equation eqn 31 the functions v i l represent the maximized value of the dynamic problem starting with the current level of the groundwater lift l for a given time period forward assuming that the actions taken in subsequent periods will be done optimally with the level of groundwater lift realized in later periods this recursive relationship linking the implied optimality of behavior from period to period captures the essence of bellman s principle of optimality 30 and holds within the context of a strategic game played dynamically by two or more players in order to describe the nature of the solution to the dynamic game problem for player i we begin from the stage zero problem in which the carry over value of the groundwater level is zero v 0 i l 0 making the player s problem myopic as is shown below 35 v 1 i l max q i a 1 2 b q i s n q i s n e l q i such that we obtain the first order conditions 36 a b q i o p t s n e l 0 from which we can immediately derive the optimal value of the decision variable as 37 q i o p t a e l b s n b a e l b s n with which we impose symmetry across all players such that q i o p t q ˆ q by substituting this back into the expression for the maximized value at stage one we obtain 12 12 note that w q i o p t s n a e l b s n s n a e l b v 1 i l a 1 2 b q s n q s n e l q a 1 2 b a e l b a e

player i which can be written as 39 v 2 i l max q i a 1 2 b q i s n q i s n e l q i β v 2 i l s t l l γ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s r max q i a 1 2 b q i s n q i s n e l q i β a e l γ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s r 2 2 b β e

defines the bellman equation and the underlying optimization problem for the infinite horizon dynamic game 65 v i l max w a q i s n 1 2 b q i s n 2 e l q i β a b a e l c a e l 2 d l s t l l 1 θ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s r a s y from the relationships in we have show the parameters a b c and d to be complex functions of the basic parameters of the groundwater extraction problem including the surface water inflow level s in fact the presence of s and the way it augments the available water that enters into the net benefit calculation is responsible for the last term d l of the value function we have derived here in the classic formulation of feinerman and knapp 19 where only pumped groundwater gives direct economic benefits and the surface water inflow only contributes to the recharge of the aquifer within the equation of motion the functional form of the infinite horizon value function would be strictly quadratic in a e l with only the terms associated with a b and c being present the interested and intrepid reader is invited to replicate the backward recursion process we have used for this case with only q i in the net benefits of the objective and verify this result from the steady state convergence of the relationships in eqn 60 we also get the parameters that define the reduced form decision rule that captures and replicates the solution of the dynamic programming problem in each step of the dynamic game namely 66 q i φ 1 a e l φ 2 and which represents the stationary markov equilibrium strategy for the players in this dynamic game for a given level of groundwater lift the equilibrium concept used in this paper is based on the definition of a markov strategy also known as a closed loop or feedback strategy given by dockner et al 44 in which the actions of each player depend on the past history of the game only through the current value of the state variable 45 the decision rule in equation eqn 66 embodies the type of policy function used in simulating such a closed loop feedback strategy and boils down to having a reaction function for each player that is defined by the basic parameters of the groundwater extraction problem namely q i q i l a b e β s r n θ a s y for each player we can write this more compactly as q i q i l ξ where ξ is a vector that embodies all the key parameters of the problem a b e β s r n θ a s y since the dynamic programming problem and hence the resulting solution of each player is independent of time the optimal value functions and equilibrium policy functions will also be time independent autonomous which will make our equilibrium stationary markov and sub game perfect such an equilibrium is defined for the strategy space of each player ω i q i q i q i l ξ such that v i l q i q j i v i l q i q j i q i ω i and holds for any level of lift to the groundwater table l and hence for any stage within the play of the dynamic game the solution method that we use to obtain the stationary markov equilibrium for this problem differs from the continuous time approach commonly employed by authors in the literature who solve infinite horizon differential game problems using the continuous time optimal control approach 44 46 in this case we adopt a discrete time dynamic programming approach similar to that of levhari and mirman 47 and eswaran and lewis 32 and adapted by negri 12 to the groundwater pumping problem in order to obtain a recursive relationship that describes the evolution of the parameters of each player s carry over value function for groundwater stock towards its infinite horizon value this will allow us to numerically obtain the solution to the problem such that the derived infinite horizon value function is consistent with the implied policy function that we obtain from the euler first order conditions of the dynamic problem e how augmentation value changes with the nature of the dynamic game in terms of the augmentation value of groundwater its calculation directly depends upon the behavioral outcomes of combined groundwater and surface water use as captured in equations eqn 4 and 13 if we express these in terms of the basic parameters of the kern county empirical case ignoring the averaging process for simplicity we obtain the following expression 67 a v b q ˆ t s e l t q ˆ t b s a q ˆ t s n 1 2 b q ˆ t s n 2 e l t q ˆ t a s n 1 2 b s n 2 which simplifies to the following case as n and s n 0 68 a v a q ˆ t 1 2 b q ˆ t 2 e l t q ˆ t a e l q ˆ t 1 2 b q ˆ t 2 and the optimal value of pumping itself converges to the following case as n given the form of the optimal pumping rule that we derived analytically as shown in equation eqn 29 based on these expressions we can see that 69 φ 1 γ β d e b b s n 2 e 2 γ β c θ s r b 2 e γ 2 β n c b s n b 0 φ 2 1 2 e γ β c b 2 e γ 2 β n c 1 b which gives us the result 70 q t o p t i m a l n q t a e l t b which allows us to simplify the expression for augmentation value av in eqn 68 as 71 a v a e l q ˆ t 1 2 b q ˆ t 2 a e l a e l b 1 2 b a e l b 2 1 2 a e l 2 b which is equivalent to the maximized value of the stage 1 optimization problem that was shown in the technical appendix part d at the beginning of the backward recursive derivation of the carry over value function see eqn 38 in this stage 1 problem we treated the carry over value us zero making it essentially a myopic extraction problem therefore the fact that the augmentation value converges to the maximized value of this case is not surprising f evaluating the gains to management of groundwater under dynamic game by considering the solutions to both the central planning problem and the dynamic game problem we can now proceed to evaluate the gains that might be realized under coordinated centralized control of groundwater pumping i e management several authors have noted that in many situations the gains to groundwater management are small when compared to the transactions costs that would be incurred in setting up the institutions necessary for implementing a coordinated management policy 23 48 49 brozovic et al 25 found that the gains to management increased greatly by considering the true hydrological nature of the reservoir and the more localized nature of pumping externalities and addressed a symmetric case in which the effects of pumping drawdown were uniformly felt by other users at any given radial distance by calculating the difference between the cumulative present values of net benefits that accrue to all players over the entire path of extraction under both social planning and purely myopic extraction we then have a measure of the gains that would be realized under central groundwater management the outcomes of the non cooperative extraction regime can also be compared to pure myopia to evaluate any differences or gains in cumulative net benefits over time and this can be compared to the gains realized under centralized control recall that the myopic outcome was captured in the model shown in equation 7 therefore using the outcomes of pumping and groundwater lift from the myopic extraction dynamic game and central planning solutions we can calculate the gains to centralized management over myopic extraction as shown follows 72 g a i n c p t 1 t t β t 1 i 1 n b i w i t c p e l t c p q i t c p t 1 t t β t 1 i 1 n b i w i t m y o p i c e l

b i w i t m y o p i c 2 e l t m y o p i c q i t m y o p i c using this scheme we re able to derive the values shown in table 3 of the main text in keeping with the sensitivity analysis that we do in the later sections of this technical annex we can also investigate how these increases in the sum of present value net benefits over the myopic case might change as we impose the constraint on groundwater pumping given in equation 17 we do this while also changing the value of l max which serves as the threshold for groundwater lift beyond which pumping is forced to zero the results are given below in figure f1 and show that the gain in the sum of present value net benefits to irrigation increases as the constraint on groundwater pumping becomes more stringent in the threshold for maximum groundwater lift this makes intuitive sense given that increasing the curtailment on pumping based on the level of groundwater lift causes the myopic case or those cases which converge towards it to run up against the pumping constraint much sooner than would otherwise be the case forcing it to lose the net benefits that it would have gained under pumping in those later periods this makes it perform comparatively much worse than under the case with a more conservative pumping schedule as is the case under the control of a central planner fig f1 sensitivity of the gains in the present value of net benefits in irrigation over the myopic case when imposing constraints on groundwater pumping under alternative thresholds for maximum gw lift across various extraction regimes source author calculations fig f1 as the numbers of players increase in the dynamic game those differences over the myopic case go towards zero as was seen before in table 3 and for the same reasons that applied in the case without a constraint on groundwater pumping g sensitivity analysis of stabilization and augmentation value to pumping limits below we demonstrate how the choice of threshold for groundwater lift beyond which pumping is not possible i e l max affects the model simulations such that we have to revise the value of w n s t a b l e to reflect the stable level of available water such that the following inequality holds over the model simulation horizon i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e this new value of w n s t a b l e is determined by inspection of the model simulation results under various values of l max and the way it changes across different numbers of players in the simulated dynamic game is shown in fig g1 below fig g1 sensitivity of stable water equivalent to maximum gw lift across various extraction regimes source author calculations fig g1 here we see that as the threshold for the groundwater pumping limit is lowered i e made more stringent the implied value of stable available water w n s t a b l e declines across all cases although at different points for the case of the centralized planner the decrease of w n s t a b l e below the original mean value of surface water inflow s as given in equation 16 doesn t happen until the threshold is lowered below 400 ft for the case of the dynamic game with 40 players by contrast the decrease happens continuously from the level of 600 ft downwards for this latter case the situation is very close to that of myopic extraction from the groundwater aquifer and the resultant mining of the aquifer brings the groundwater levels down much faster than in the fully optimal case of the centralized planner or n 1 in the dynamic game in such a case the threshold is reached much sooner and begins to impact the lhs of the inequality i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e such that the rhs has to be revised downward in order for it to be satisfied at all points along the time horizon of the simulations this resultant impact on the value of stable available water w n s t a b l e has an effect on the stabilization value calculation and causes it to decrease relative to the case where there is no constraint on pumping at any point during the dynamic extraction game this comparative effect is captured in fig g2 below fig g2 stabilization values across various numbers of players and values of maximum gw lift source author calculations fig g2 the case where l max 600 ft is the most generous and does not become binding even under the nearly myopic extraction case for lower values of l max however there starts to be an effect as soon as the number of players in the dynamic game begins to increase this deviation though less striking is also seen in the calculation of augmentation value shown in fig g3 below fig g3 augmentation values across various numbers of players and values of maximum gw lift source author calculations fig g3 as was the case under no groundwater pumping constraint the augmentation value begins to decrease even under the most generous threshold for maximum groundwater lift l max due to the decrease in the marginal user cost that is implicit in the dynamic programming problem of the non cooperative extraction game once we start to deviate from the benchmark of efficiency set by the central planner this deviation is accelerated by the lowering of the threshold for groundwater lift in a way that is consistent with the effect on stabilization value observed previously it should be re iterated here that the effect we observe on stabilization and augmentation values from changing the threshold for groundwater lift on the pumping constraint as we increase the number of players comes through two different pathways as is stated above the impact on augmentation value comes directly from the effect of increasing the number of players in the dynamic game and the resulting effect that it has upon behavior in this case the incentives to conserve groundwater are gradually diminished thereby causing the accelerated pattern of groundwater pumping to increase the groundwater lift up to the point where it makes the constraint on pumping binding in the case of stabilization value the variation we see in fig g2 comes more indirectly through a change in behavior and the way in which it causes groundwater pumping to be curtailed at varying rates across the simulation horizon effectively limiting access to it and its stabilizing properties if we just consider the variation of stabilization value across varying levels of stable inflow holding the stochastic pattern of inflow that is used in the calculation s t constant and apply the formula for calculating stabilization value given in equation 19 we obtain the smooth variation shown in fig g4 below fig g4 stabilization values across various levels of stable surface water inflow source author calculations fig g4 so the variation in stabilization value that we see in fig g2 is a reflection of how the stable value of surface water inflow that we can impute from the various model simulation results is being changed as the different values of maximum groundwater lift that is used in the pumping constraint are being applied to the model the pattern of how this imputed stable equivalent value changes with the constraint threshold was shown in fig g1 and maps onto the corresponding stabilization value of groundwater according to the smooth relationship shown in fig g4 above 
8657,in this paper we explore the economic value of groundwater in irrigation both in terms of the way in which it stabilizes water supply for those facing uncertain surface water flows as well as in the way it augments water supply to farming enterprises beyond what would be available from precipitation or surface water flows alone these respective components of groundwater s economic value its stabilization and augmentation value have been discussed in the literature before but we point out some important ways in which they could be diminished if sub optimal groundwater abstraction is allowed to persist groundwater mining tends to diminish the augmentation value of groundwater while leaving the stabilization value unaffected as long as the resource extraction only manifests itself in terms of increased pumping costs we illustrate however a situation in which even the stabilization value can be attenuated which arises when constraints to the user s ability to abstract groundwater become binding and prevent her from realizing the stabilizing value that is embodied in the immediate exploitation of the resource we demonstrate these losses in groundwater s economic value in irrigation through simulating increasingly sub optimal non cooperative and strategic groundwater pumping behavior in a way that has not been done explicitly in the literature and use a well studied example from california to give an empirical illustration of our points keywords groundwater resource use externalities dynamic games common pool resources summary in this paper we discuss the implications of sub optimal extraction behavior and pumping constraints on the economic value of groundwater in irrigation within a dynamic context taking the empirical context of the western united states we examine the ways in which the two important components of groundwater s intrinsic economic value namely its stabilization and augmentation value are impacted by sub optimal groundwater exploitation and the increasing possibility of encountering constraints on groundwater use as the aquifer becomes overdrafted we compare the case of centralized management intervention to those situations in which a non cooperative resource extraction regime dominates and where the resource extraction decisions become increasingly atomistic and decentralized among an increasing number of agents our results show the overall gains to management that can be realized with centralized and behaviourally optimal control of groundwater pumping are mostly in line with the literature on groundwater management and do not represent a novelty in that respect however we take the extra step of showing how augmentation and stabilization value change as you progress gradually from optimal extraction behavior to increasing myopia and erode the overall economic value of the resource in our results we show that in the absence of any physical constraints to groundwater extraction the increasing degree of myopia in behavior arising from increasingly atomistic and non cooperative pumping decisions reduces the augmentation value of groundwater while leaving its intrinsic stabilization value unchanged this loss of augmentation value is caused by a diminution of the perceived marginal user cost of the resource by the individual agents that drives their aggregate behaviour towards increasingly myopic extraction patterns if however continuing overdraft of the aquifer causes limits to be placed on what users can pump then the stabilization value will also begin to diminish these results point to the role that stock externalities can play in diminishing the economic value that can be realized by the users of a common pool resource such as groundwater and which act differently from the cost extermalities that arise when un interrupted access to the resource is maintained but is made more costly by a falling water table this helps to clarify the way in which the economic value of groundwater in irrigation or other direct use can be affected by user behavior according to the external effects that are imposed by sub optimal extraction behavior 1 introduction groundwater resources represent one of the most abundant and important sources of freshwater on the planet but the nature of hydrology complicates our efforts to study and monitor it and presents an even greater challenge when trying to manage it sustainably in the context of many users these management challenges aside the key role that groundwater plays in supporting irrigated agriculture worldwide is widely known and has been acknowledged in enabling the high value agricultural sector of california to continue operating through the severe droughts that the state has experienced in the past 1 and in enabling the uptake and wide spread use of yield enhancing green revolution technologies in south asia 2 in such regions where rainfall patterns can be un reliable or even insufficient at critical points in the crop growing cycle and surface water flows may be limited due to competing demands groundwater represents a crucial fallback resource for irrigation and plays a clear stabilizing role it is this stabilizing effect of groundwater as a buffer stock that motivated the seminal work of tsur and colleagues in describing the role of groundwater plays in the decisions of an economic agent using water for agricultural irrigation and facing uncertainty over the availability of variable surface water the papers of tsur 3 and tsur and graham tomasi 4 discussed the economic value of groundwater as a buffer stock within the context of irrigated agriculture in the arid regions of israel while the later papers of tsur 5 and gemma and tsur 6 discussed groundwater s stabilization value within the context of california s central valley and the semi arid tropics of india respectively in these papers tsur and his co authors described the economic use value of groundwater in irrigation in terms of both its ability to provide stability to an otherwise uncertain supply of rainfall or surface water flows as well as its ability to augment the overall supply of water to the irrigator above and beyond what it would have been if only surface water was available these two respective components stabilization and augmentation comprise the key elements of the economic value of groundwater to the irrigator in their framework in this paper we take the example of kern county california to illustrate the total economic use value of groundwater in irrigation in terms of both its stabilization and augmentation value and show how this might be affected by sub optimal non cooperative groundwater extraction as well as by constraints to pumping that irrigators might face by examining the behavioral and physical dimensions that could lead to a loss of both augmentation and stabilization value in groundwater we expand the discussion that has occurred within the literature on this topic and illustrate how these economic values can be evaluated within the context of non cooperative dynamic game problems in our study we do not address the economic value that groundwater embodies beyond its use in irrigated agricultural production as other studies have done when trying to capture the ways in which ecosystem functions are impaired by groundwater over exploitation 7 or by those studies which try to elicit the value of groundwater as natural capital 8 or through other means of eliciting user specific valuation 9 we limit ourselves to the more narrow definition of economic use value in irrigation in order to simplify and reduce the pathways through which groundwater over abstraction can affect economic net benefits of resource users and to place these results squarely within the context of irrigation focused case studies of groundwater extraction that were seminal in clarifying the types of externalities that arise from sub optimal resource use behavior as a result of imposing alternative regimes of management and property rights 10 14 a number of these cited studies go into depth in exploring the nature of the externalities that are generated by groundwater over exploitation and some discuss the alternative policy instruments that can be applied to address sub optimal resource extraction on the part of water users in order to enhance economic use efficiency and resource sustainability over time we do not spend time addressing these issues given the extent to which it has already been discussed by other papers looking at groundwater management issues in the western us and elsewhere instead we focus on how the separate components of stabilization and augmentation value are affected by user behavior in order to bring greater insight to this relatively under studied aspect of groundwater resource economics the rest of this paper is designed as follows in the following section we give an overview of the key conceptual components that comprise the economic use value of groundwater in irrigation as discussed in the literature the section which follows uses an empirical application of groundwater exploitation that is based on a well known case in kern county california which we adapt to account for both optimal and sub optimal behavior we then illustrate the impacts of changing user behavior and pumping constraints on the economic use value of groundwater and discuss its implications before concluding the paper 2 background in this section we give the background and supporting literature on groundwater s stabilization value that provides the reader with the necessary context for understanding the concepts of groundwater s economic use value in irrigation that we will use in the paper the literature on the stabilization value of groundwater begins with the seminal work of yakov tsur who began with an examination of how groundwater stocks provide stability to water supply used for irrigation in the israeli desert the chapter of tsur and issar 15 laid out the conceptual basis for thinking about groundwater s stabilizing role in the face of uncertainty over surface water supplies the paper of tsur 3 applied this concept to an empirical case of an israeli kibbutz in the negev desert and found that 70 of the per hectare economic value of groundwater to irrigated agriculture lay in its ability to stabilize water supply we draw from the discussion of groundwater s economic value to irrigation within these papers to describe how the irrigation value is divided between the stabilization and augmentation components that are described further in what follows 2 1 defining augmentation and stabilization value our conceptualization of augmentation and stabilization value is derived from the underlying economics that drives the behavior of an agent or multiple agents who want s to gain the maximum net benefit from the use of water whether from surface or groundwater sources in a productive activity such as agriculture we present the details of such a water user s production problem in technical annex a for the interested reader and proceed here to describe how it relates to the valuation of surface and groundwater resources if we were to summarize the net benefits arising from the water user s problem by a concave net benefit function n b w then we can write out the gains to stabilizing the value of a stochastic water allocation w at its mean value w as 1 s v n b w e n b w as was shown by gemma tsur 6 if were to take an approximation of the expected value of net benefits under the stochastic outcome using a 2nd order taylor s series expansion around the mean value w we would obtain 2 e n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 where σ 2 is the variance of the stochastic distribution of water around its mean value i e σ 2 e w w 2 and n b w is the 2nd derivative of the net benefit function if we substitute this expression into equation we get an approximation to the stabilization value of water as 3 s v n b w e n b w n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 1 2 n b w σ 2 which clearly increases with the variability of water supply and with the curvature of the net benefit function since we know that a quasi concave net benefit function must satisfy the condition n b w 0 and that variance is positive we therefore know that the stabilization value is positive or non negative in the case of quasi concavity this positive quantity is representative of the risk neutral decision maker s willingness to pay in order to receive the mean quantity w with assurance rather than have to face the uncertainty in the realization of w as a stochastic outcome we can also consider the additional benefit that can arise if another more stable source of water is found say from groundwater if we think of groundwater as providing the stability in water supply embodied in n b w as well as providing additional supply over and above what the decision maker would obtain with surface water alone then the benefit of augmenting the agent s water supply with groundwater i e the augmentation value av would be given as 4 a v n b w g n b w where g is the amount of groundwater pumped if we add the stabilization and augmentation values of groundwaer in equations 1 and 4 respectively we can obtain an expression for the total economic use value tev of groundwater as 5 t e v s v a v n b w e n b w n b w g n b w n b w g e n b w which captures the gains to moving from a situation where one relies solely upon a stochastic supply of water for productive use such as from rainfall or surface runoff to one in which the source of water is effectively stabilized and augmented with groundwater resources in reality the presence of groundwater would not alter the period to period realizations of surface water inflow but would allow the agent the opportunity to make period to period decisions on groundwater pumping that would enable any shortfall to be compensated for with increased withdrawals from the aquifer conversely when there is an above average realization of surface water inflow then the agent is able to pump less in order to receive the same total amount of water what would change period to period under a stochastic series of surface water realizations is the amount of groundwater that would be pumped and its share in the overall mix of water sources as tsur issar 15 note this effectively moves the uncertainty over water from the production side i e how much output can be realized with a given quantity of water realization to the cost side where the same output can be achieved but at a cost which varies with the needed amount of supplemental groundwater pumping this assumes that cost is the only consideration that could potentially ration groundwater use which is a critical assumption as rad et al 16 have pointed out we return to the significance of this assumption later in the paper 2 2 discussion of groundwater stabilization value from the literature while the early papers of tsur issar 15 and tsur 3 addressed the economic value of groundwater in irrigation within a static framework the 1991 paper of tsur and graham tomasi grounded their analysis within the framework of dynamic optimization and laid out a conceptual basis for thinking about how the evaluation of groundwater s buffer 1 1 although the terms buffer value and stabilization value have been used interchangeably by some authors we have opted to use the latter term in this paper given that we re not explicitly trying to derive an economic value for the aquifer as a finite resource stock as one would a stockpile of grain in a silo we feel that the term stabilization is more descriptive of the role we see groundwater playing in providing a flow of benefits over time value should be carried out when the uncertainty governing the future realization of surface supplies is resolved or not before the groundwater pumping decision is made in this paper they took up the example of groundwater irrigation in the negev desert and varied some key parameters to give a range of economic values for groundwater over which the share of buffer value in the overall total varied from 5 under low pumping costs low sw variability and a larger sized aquifer to 84 when the aquifer size is smaller the pumping cost is higer and the variability of sw is at a maximum the chapter of tsur 5 evaluated the stabilization value of groundwater within the context of the groundwater recharge scheme used in the arvin edison water district of southern california and found it to be 47 of the total economic value of groundwater in the paper of gemma and tsur 6 the authors evaluated the stabilization value of groundwater in a case study of tamil nadu india to be 25 of the overall total economic value of groundwater and another study of tamil nadu by palanisami and co authors 17 found it to be 15 of the total in all of these papers there is no discussion of how the behavior of water users might affect these calculations of groundwater s economic value the paper of foster et al 18 which looked at the case of tomato production in the central valley of california pointed out that declining well yields as a consequence of groundwater overdraft could degrade the ability of the aquifer to deliver its full stabilization value in their example they showed how the well yields could be negatively impacted over time but did not quantify the implications on the total economic value of groundwater or on how the share belonging to stabilization value might be affected the analysis of rad et al 16 used explicit production modeling to quantify the yield losses that occur when groundwater availability is limited and its full buffer value cannot be exploited they did not show how the economic values they calculated as losses relate to the overall value of groundwater and its constituent parts i e augmentation stabilization which is a distinction we try and maintain throughout this paper in this paper we examine both of the components of groundwater s overall economic use value the stabilization and augmentation value and see how they are affected by changes in the user s behavioral incentives as well as by other constraints to water use that the user might face we see the value of our paper as providing a level of conceptual clarity that is lacking in the literature over which component of groundwater s economic value is affected by sub optimal resource extraction behavior or by difficulties encountered in accessing the resource itself we feel that this has not been addressed well in the literature and that it constitutes the primary contribution of this paper 3 methods an empirical application to california the empirical setting that we choose for our investigation of groundwater s value in irrigation is that of kern county california which has been examined by several authors 19 24 although not in the context of evaluating the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater under varying assumptions on behavior and resource access we return to this well documented example for our empirical illustration of the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater so that the contribution we are able to make to the understanding of these economic components of resource value can be immediately placed in the context of what we already know about this basin this should provide a ready point of departure for any interested reader who wishes to apply these concepts elsewhere 3 1 model specification 3 1 1 a simplified hydrology in this paper we follow the simplified hydrology of the aquifer in kern county used by feinerman and knapp 19 in which the bathtub representation critiqued by authors such as brozovic et al 25 is adopted for simplicity of exposition 2 2 we will make note of the limitations that this formulation poses to our interpretation of model results later in the paper in this representation there is net recharge r that goes into the aquifer along with the return flows from irrigation with surface and groundwater the total water used for irrigation is a combination of water pumped from the aquifer q along with surface water flows s which we treat as exogenous to the key decision on groundwater pumping and which is stochastic in nature the combination of surface and groundwater gives us to the total water applied to agriculture i e w q s fig 1 below shows how recharge surface water flows groundwater pumping and return flows from both water sources form the overall hydrological balance that we capture within this simplified framework in order to model the way in which the distance between the water table and the ground surface i e the lift l were to evolve over time we use the following equation of motion for lift 6 l t 1 l t 1 θ q r t θ s t a s y w h e r e r t 1 ε i t r in which l t 1 is the lift to the groundwater table in the next period and represents the carry over level of the groundwater stock that remains in future the volumetric quantities of groundwater pumping return flow and aquifer recharge are translated into units of lift by dividing through by the irrigated surface area a and the specific yield of the aquifer s y in these expressions θ represents the deep percolation into the aquifer while a represents the areal extent of the aquifer and s y is its specific yield recharge r t is given in terms of a base annual level of recharge r plus the share of total sw inflow into the basin i that goes to groundwater once the share that goes into surface irrigation ξ is accounted for it is that portion that goes to surface irrigation ξ i s that we are referring to as the surface water flow that makes up part of the total applied water to agriculture w q s and which enters into the decision maker s economic problem some of the key parameter values used to characterize the aquifer are shown in table 1 and follows the empirical values employed by feinerman knapp 19 and knapp olson 22 the stochastic nature of surface water availability for this example is characterized by the probability distribution of surface water inflows to kern county that was noted in table ii of knapp and olson 22 and which is shown in part b of the technical annex where we explain how it was used to generate a series of flows s t used in our quantitative analysis 3 1 2 the economic model to motivate the economic framework in which we will be examining the behavioral dimensions of water users we start with defining the welfare criteria that we used to evaluate the benefits received from the use of water surface or ground for irrigation starting from the formulation of net benefits and its implicit maximization by water users we expand on the definition of net benefits to irrigated production from water use used by feinerman knapp 19 and subsequent studies shown below 7 max q 0 b w e l q w q s 0 w h e r e b w a w 1 2 b w 2 where the benefit function b w whose parameter values are given in table 1 satisfies the conditions of concavity that were applied to the net benefit function n b w described in section 2 to motivate the concept of stabilization and augmentation value note here that the benefit side accounts for the total applied water to irrigated agriculture which includes pumped groundwater whereas the cost side of the objective function only accounts for the pumping cost of groundwater for which e represents the energy cost of lifting a unit volume of water over a unit length of lift this problem represents the decision making process of an economic agent who only maximizes the immediate benefits from water use without considering the implicit economic carry over value of the groundwater stock that is left in the aquifer such a myopically extracting agent would only consider the marginal benefits of pumping in the current period and would not internalize any of the user cost that conveys the benefits of having more groundwater stock left over in the next period in order to achieve optimality with respect to maximizing the net benefits that could be derived from using the groundwater resource over a multi period time horizon we adopt the dynamic programming framework has been applied to groundwater extraction problems like this since the early 1960s starting with the seminal work of oscar burt 26 27 and followed by others 28 29 13 in this framework the maximized value of the groundwater exploitation problem adds the immediate net benefits from groundwater use to the discounted value of carrying over stock to the following period and applies a similar optimality criterion to that quantity which is left over this is captured in the equation below which is the classical bellman equation that lies at the heart of many dynamic programming problems 30 8 v l t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 l t 1 l t q t θ w t r a s y w t q t s t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 θ q t θ s t r a s y in this problem v l is a value function that gives the maximized value of the optimization problem for any value of the state variable l the expectations operator is used to capture the fact that surface water realizations are stochastic although the uncertainty over any given realization is resolved before the agent needs to make the pumping decision in any period 3 3 this resolution of uncertainty prior to the choice of the optimal pumping level is equivalent to the ex post regime described by tsur and graham tomasi 4 and in their estimation is appropriate to the western us where surface water contracts are often known in advance and where irrigation waters are typically diverted from streamflows generated by snow melt whose potential volume in high altitude snow pack is closely monitored and noted for planning purposes by surface water managers therefore we adopt this information regime in our paper the details for solving this kind of dynamic programming problem are given in technical annexes c and d 3 2 evaluating the economic use value of groundwater in order to calculate the total economic use value of groundwater in irrigation along with its constituent components as laid out in equation 5 we have to define the economic problem of water usage for irrigation in terms the case with and without uncertainty as well as the case with and without groundwater the analogue to the dynamic programming problem embodied in equation 8 which deals with the case of certainty in surface water inflow is that shown below 9 v l t max q b q t s e l t q t β v l t q t θ q t s r a s y where the mean value of the stochastic surface water inflow s is realized in each period in the case where there is no groundwater available the decision maker s problem is simply to maximize the net benefits that are achievable with the available surface water on hand in the case of a stochastic regime of surface water inflow the decision maker s problem is the simple static optimization problem shown below 10 max w 0 e b w w s max w 0 e a w 1 2 b w 2 w s whereas in the case where the mean value of surface water inflow is available in each period the decision maker s problem becomes 11 max w 0 b w w s max w 0 a w 1 2 b w 2 w s in both cases the decision maker s problem is static given that there is no groundwater stock to manage and carry forward into subsequent periods leaving the current period s realization of surface water as the sole resource available using the results from the optimization problems given in equations 8 11 we can now evaluate the augmentation value the stabilization value and therefore the total economic use value of groundwater using the relationships shown in 5 which we now re state in terms of the notation used in our empirical example of california in the expressions below for the stabilization value of groundwater we can use the solutions from the optimization problems in 10 and 11 to calculate 12 s v 1 t τ 1 t τ t max 0 w s b w max 0 w s t b w 1 t τ 1 t τ t b s b s t where the benefit function b w is assumed to be maximized at the maximum allowable surface water allocation in each period and where the problem is simulated over t time periods the calculation of maximized benefits is carried out over the portion of the simulation horizon that starts from period t τ where τ can be arbitrarily chosen 4 4 given the nature of the static problem being solved the choice of τ is not of great consequence for the subsequent calculations with the dynamic model however it is best to choose a value of τ that is closer to that part of the simulation horizon where the model achieves a steady state or something close to it this is in line with the assumptions applied in the analysis by gemma tsur 6 and tsur graham tomasi 4 in the case of calculating the augmentation value of groundwater we use the dynamic optimization problem in 9 and the static problem given in 11 to make the following calculation 13 a v 1 t τ 1 t τ t b q ˆ t s e l t q ˆ t max 0 w s b w t τ t b q ˆ t s e l t q ˆ t b s t τ 1 where q ˆ t is the solution to the dynamic problem 9 in each period i e q ˆ t argmax q 0 b q t s e l t q t β v l t q t θ q t s r a s y for t τ t and where the value of groundwater lift l t in each period is recursively updated using the equation of motion and the optimal value of groundwater pumping in the previous period it should be noted that the calculation for stabilization value in equation 12 only involves the surface water component s and s and does not include the quantity of pumped groundwater q ˆ as does the expression for augmentation value equation 13 implicit in this definition of stabilization value is the fact that the stable mean quantity s can always be obtained as a result of groundwater pumping and that it is preferable to an unstable and stochastically varying quantity s that fluctuates around this mean for this reason we would expect the stabilization value under these conditions to be invariant over any range of behaviors that might affect the pumping behavior q ˆ that is incorporated into the augmentation value calculation we will see this intuition confirmed in the following section and observe that only augmentation value responds directly to behavioral changes when groundwater is not quantity constrained we will also see however a change in stabilization value occur when the quantity of groundwater available becomes so limiting as to make the stable equivalent of surface water at its mean value unattainable this is a possibility that was not directly addressed in the discussion of stabilization value by tsur and his co authors and is a case sensitivity that we will explore and discuss more fully in what follows 4 results by following the scheme of calculating the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater that was explained in the previous section we obtain the results shown in table 2 below in this table we see that the stabilization value of groundwater constitutes 17 of the total overall economic value of groundwater which stands at 35 5 million per year for the study area we can put these results in context by looking at other assessments of stabilization value that have come from the literature in the chapter of tsur 5 based on a specific water district within kern county the author evaluated the share of stabilization value in the total economic use value of groundwater to be 47 in this analysis however the author did not account for changes in the cost of groundwater pumping as we have and kept a fixed value over time the paper of gemma tsur 6 did an evaluation of stabilization value for a case study in india and found that it accounted for over 25 of the tev this was a lower bound estimate given that they assumed there to be unlimited groundwater availability thereby making their calculated augmentation value an upper bound estimate they made this assumption due to the lack of data that would have enabled them to model of groundwater pumping behavior directly as we have as we will discuss in a later section this assumption about the availability and accessibility of groundwater turns out to be a critical one especially when evaluating the economic value of groundwater s potential to stabilize water supply in irrigation 4 1 impact of behavior on augmentation value in this section we extend our analysis of the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater to see how they might be affected by deviations in behavior from the socially optimal regime of a single central authority who exerts full control over the resource and maintains dynamic efficiency in how it is extracted over time this deviation from social optimality is oftentimes the norm in real life behavior as it relates to groundwater use and most other types of human activity but does not only arise from myopia on the part of the resource user even dynamically optimizing agents can create sub optimal outcomes in how a resource is exploited if they choose to act non cooperatively some examples of earlier literature that looked at this within the context of common pool resource extraction are the works of khalatbari 31 eswaran and lewis 32 and reinganum and stokey 33 the paper of provencher and burt 14 was among the first to discuss the common pool problems of groundwater management in this way so we will now extend the groundwater pumping problem modeled in the bellman equations of 8 and 9 to address a more generalized case where more than one player is engaged in groundwater extraction and where these agents are forward looking and dynamically optimizing with respect to the internalized user cost that the derivative of the carry over value function embodies these agents however do not coordinate their pumping or cooperate explicitly to yield the socially optimal outcome that the sole decision maker with control over the entire aquifer can achieve thereby achieving a sub optimal outcome with respect to the central planner case these agents are essentially engaged in a dynamic game in which their pumping behavior is strategic and results in outcome which represents a markov sub game perfect nash equilibrium this is exactly the type of strategic behavior captured by negri 12 34 and others 33 35 39 the dynamic game which characterizes this interaction can be written as follows 14 v i l t max w e b i w t i e l t q t i β v i l t 1 θ q t i n 1 q t θ s t r a s y s t w t i q t i s t n where each of the n players chooses her own pumping level q t i while taking the pumping actions of the other n 1 agents as exogenous and given q t the amount of available surface water is also assumed to be shared across agents equally for simplicity we impose symmetry on this problem and assume that each player expects all n 1 other agents to behave exactly as they would as such we have maintained all the same physical and behavioral parameters that define the groundwater pumping problem as identical for each agent in order to make the aggregate welfare add up over all players to the same level as that for the single agent case we have multiplied the original slope parameter of the demand function for water by n such that b i b n for each of the n players in the dynamic game we do this so that we capture the erosion of incentives for resource conservation that are occurring in aggregate without changing the aggregate scale of irrigation based activities in the case study area 5 5 this approach illustrates what would happen if the 800 or so irrigators in the original survey of kern county used by ref 19 study were to move from aligning their pumping preferences in perfect unison towards increasingly individual considerations as smaller and smaller blocks of irrigators take control of their pumping decisions we simulate myopia by setting n 1000 which is essentially each irrigator acting on their own the details for how this dynamic n player game is solved is given in technical annex d the strategic and non cooperative behavior of the agents can be observed to change the pattern of aggregate groundwater pumping over time as the decision making for irrigating the aggregate acreage of this kern county case area is spread out over an increasing number of players as seen in fig 2 below the optimal pumping rule of each player converges towards that of a purely myopic agent as the number of decision makers in the aggregate pumping game increases and the rents of holding an extra unit of stock into the next period are gradually dissipated this phenomenon was shown clearly by negri 34 in his analytical derivation of a differential game of groundwater extraction and is driven by the diminution of the marginal user cost that each player internalizes when considering the first order conditions of his own optimal pumping strategy solution in the technical annex to the paper we show that for n 1 the carry over value function for the individual agent is equivalent to that of the idealized central planner who would coordinate and harmonize all pumping within the groundwater basin to maximize the overall social net benefits over time we also show that the derivative of the value function converges to zero as the number of decision making agents gets larger i e v l t 1 l 0 a s n which means that the user cost i e β 1 θ a s y v l t 1 also goes to zero 6 6 we point out that we are using the dynamic game framework in this paper to change groundwater conservation incentives and therefore groundwater pumping behavior this is to illustrate the effect of changing behavior on the calculated augmentation and stabilization values and not to make any particular point regarding groundwater policy the aggregate effect of the change in groundwater pumping behavior as the number of decision makers increases from 1 is seen in the way that groundwater lift evolves over time in fig 3 below at the end of 50 periods the difference in groundwater lift between the central planner and complete myopia is over 100 ft as was seen in fig 2 the convergence to myopia is relatively rapid once we begin adding agents to the dynamic game beyond 2 players in order to establish a benchmark of economic efficiency in a case with multiple agents we take the dynamic programming problem facing the central planner who jointly maximizes the net benefits of all players over the planning horizon the problem facing the central planner can be written as follows 15 v c p l t max w i i 1 n e i 1 n b i w t i e l t q t i β v c p l t 1 θ i q t i θ s t r a s y s t i w t i i q t i s t in which the carry over value of the groundwater stock in the next period i e v c p l t 1 takes into account the future benefit accruing to all players of each type and therefore embodies the true social user cost of groundwater extraction if we were to calculate the aggregate and cumulative present value of net benefits that are realized when all of the groundwater extraction for irrigation in the case study area is centralized and dynamically optimal control and compare it to the aggregate cumulative present value of net benefits that are realized under dynamically optimizing but individually non cooperative extraction decisions we obtain the results shown in table 3 below these values reflect the gains in cumulative present value of net benefits realized under various configurations of the dynamic game over the myopic case and show these gains to be steadily decreasing with the number of players these results conform to those of dixon 21 who also showed that the strategic non cooperative behavior involving a small number of agents is able to capture a sizeable portion of the management gains realized under centralized and optimal control given that the agents still internalize a large fraction of the social user cost of extraction as the number players increases the non cooperative solution diverges more from the central planner s optimal path towards that of myopic behavior and increasing gains to centralized management are realized as is consistent with other literature evaluating the use value of groundwater for irrigation ignoring other co benefits these gains are relatively small and are not of central interest in this paper to explain nonetheless we give discussion and details of how these gains to management are calculated and interpreted in the technical annex e in parallel with the changes that we ve shown above as the number of players engaged in the dynamic game increase we can also show what happens to the stabilization and augmentation value of groundwater starting from the results we discussed in table 2 where the entire groundwater basin was under the control of a unitary decision maker who exercised dynamic efficiency in terms of pumping behavior and achieving the maximal net benefits across time we see a loss of that maximal value as the numbers of decision makers increases in parallel to what we have shown in table 3 above as can be seen in fig 4 below as we increase the number of players from the case of the unitary decision maker i e the planner where n 1 we get a steady diminution of the augmentation value of groundwater but a constant value for stabilization value across these cases the fact that stabilization value remains constant is not surprising given its definition which is based upon the stabilizing effect it has on that part of water supply that can be attributed to the mean value of surface water inflow as was shown in equations 1 and 12 since this is not directly affected by the addition of other agents into the dynamic game its calculated value also does not change in the technical annex f we show analytically how augmentation value changes with the addition of agents to the dynamic non cooperative game given the decline of the augmentation value as the number of players increases and the parallel decline in the total economic use value of groundwater as stabilization value remains constant we observe an increasing value of the ratio s v t e v as is shown in fig 5 below in the following sub section we examine a situation in which both components of groundwater s total economic use value in irrigation could be impacted under increasingly myopic behavior 4 2 impact of extraction constraints on stabilization value in the previous case we observed a constancy in the stabilization value of groundwater as the number of players increased due to the fact that the fundamental calculation of stabilization value sv rests upon the implied guarantee that surface water is available at its mean level for any actual realization of s t given the presence of groundwater and the ability to control its use to compensate for surface water fluctuations in the cases that we have observed so far the total water that irrigators have available for beneficial use have exceeded the mean surface water inflow levels as is shown in the figure below fig 6 as we see that combination of groundwater and available surface water satisfies the inequality 16 i 1 n q t i s t s in all periods of the simulation thereby demonstrating the role that groundwater extraction has in assuring the total availability of water for irrigation at a level no less than the mean value of surface water inflow this illustration conforms to the original concept of stabilization value motivated by tsur and other co authors if for some reason however there were to arise a constraint on groundwater pumping in conditions where the performance of wells drawing from the aquifer has been limited or compromised by increasing overdraft within the groundwater basin then this assurance of sufficient groundwater availability to satisfy the inequality 16 may not hold we can simulate such a situation by imposing the following condition on the groundwater user s optimization problem such that 17 q t i l max l 0 which suggests that in order for groundwater pumping to be non zero the level of groundwater lift has to remain below a critical level l max otherwise extraction is no longer possible we acknowledge that this type of constraint is rather crude in form and does not address the subtle aspects of the arguments that authors like foster et al 2015 or rad et al 2020 were trying to draw out in their discussion of declining well yields and its effect on groundwater benefits for irrigation we use an annual time step for modeling groundwater pumping whereas their studies looked at well yield in a more appropriate time scale of quantities pumped per day and tied it into the sub annual irrigation requirements for various crops what we are trying to accomplish here by modeling a constraint on the total amount that one can pump from an aquifer on an annual basis is to provide a contrast to the purely economic effects that changing user incentives and behavior have on the aggregate amount of benefits that irrigators receive from groundwater in this case we define a physical threshold that when crossed forces pumping to cease even when it might still be economically feasible or desirable to continue pumping in situations where groundwater extraction is sub optimal and approaching myopia the possibility of reaching and exceeding this threshold becomes more likely as we see in the results below fig 7 which were generated for the case where l max 500 ft 7 7 the choice of 500 ft for the value of l max is rather arbitrary and we explore the sensitivity of these results across a range of cut off values l max in technical appendix g in this case we see that simulating the aggregate levels of pumping and surface water availability over same range of behavioral regimes as before results in cases for n 6 where the condition embodied in the inequality 16 is not satisfied for those cases the assurance of stabilization at the mean value of surface water inflow is no longer present and they face situations where the availability of water for beneficial use is below s for such cases we would have to therefore revise downward the value of available water that can be obtained with certainty such that the inequality 16 can again be satisfied albeit with a new right hand side value w n s t a b l e such that 18 i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e s where the value of w n s t a b l e could vary with changes in the number of players n we find this value by inspection of the simulated results for a given number of players n and value of l max such that we get the highest value of w n s t a b l e that allows the constraint in equation 16 to be binding for the latter part of the simulation horizon i e i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e a s t a revision of this type would necessitate a re calculation of the stabilization value of groundwater where we would use the new value of available water that the presence of groundwater albeit under constraint would effectively provide a stable floor to the user in place of s in equation 12 in other words we would now calculate the stabilization value of groundwater using this expression 19 s v n 1 t τ 1 t τ t b w n s t a b l e b s t where under constraints to pumping we could have w n s t a b l e declining with n thereby making b w n s t a b l e decline with increasing numbers and thereby making s v n a declining function of n as well we see this kind of trend unfold in the figure below where there is a decline in stabilization value beyond the n 2 case along with the decline of augmentation value making the loss in the total economic value of groundwater more pronounced although the changes in stabilization value might appear slight from how the variation appears in fig 8 above we see that the percentage differences show over a third or up to nearly half in one case of the stabilization value of groundwater can be lost when behavioral change causes the increase in pumping and groundwater lift to run up against the limits imposed by such a constraint this can be seen from the results in table 4 below we can better appreciate the difference the pumping constraint makes by directly comparing the changes in stabilization value between the case where there is a limit on groundwater pumping versus that in which there is none as is shown in the figure below fig 9 we can make a similar comparison between these cases in terms of the total economic use value in irrigation as is shown in fig 10 below in this figure we see the contrast between these two is significant and amounts to a loss in nearly 10 million per year of aggregate benefit to irrigation due to the presence of pumping limits the connection between the behavioral effects of increasing the number of players in the dynamic game and the loss of augmentation value is made through the impact that decreasing the groundwater conservation incentives embodied in the marginal user cost of the irrigator s dynamic programming problem has on the steady state value of groundwater lift fig 11 below shows that as the level of lift that the users face at steady state increases the augmentation value diminishes from this figure we see that this diminution is more pronounced as we increase the number of players from n 1 and start to move from the case of the central planner to the non cooperative dynamic game between two players the rate at which this diminution occurs then decreases and converges to a steady state value of lift that is consistent with that under myopic pumping behavior this pattern reflects what we saw in figs 2 and 3 where we observe the pumping decision rule and the resulting levels of lift to rapidly converge on the myopic case once the number of players exceeds 2 the changes in augmentation value in response to adding players to the dynamic game is further discussed in part e of the technical annex 5 discussion from our analysis we have tried to compare two key factors that affect the total economic use value of groundwater that can be realized and enjoyed by all of its users namely 1 incentive driven behavior and 2 physical constraints to groundwater abstraction the first aspect that we explored was that of non cooperative behavior among groundwater users in which we have forward looking and dynamically optimizing agents becoming increasingly myopic in their behavior as we add more decision makers to the extraction game we showed that the effect that this increasing myopia has on eroding the overall economic use value of groundwater acts through the erosion of augmentation value but does not affect the stabilization value of groundwater as long as the agents are able to withdraw whatever amount of groundwater they want even if at increasing cost we showed that when this ability to withdraw groundwater at any cost is impaired then we also begin to lose the implicit stabilization value that groundwater embodies for those users who face variability in alternative surface water supplies in the sensitivity analysis that we do in technical annex g we see that the decline in stabilization value is more pronounced when we lower the cutoff threshold for gw pumping l max from 500 ft to 400 ft and that it remains stable as it was in fig 5 when we raise it to 600 ft this seems intuitive since making the cut off for pumping more stringent would allow the groundwater users even less room to make use of the available groundwater for offsetting shortfalls in surface water flows by the users being constrained in being able to stabilize their overall water supply in this way the groundwater begins to lose its stabilization potential the loss in augmentation value also increases in general when decreasing l max from 600 ft to 400 ft for a given number of players in the groundwater extraction game we recognize that the way we have formulated the problem imposes the groundwater constraint on all users identically and does not allow for the case where some users with deeper wells might be able to continue pumping beyond the level of groundwater lift that is unreachable for others our assumption of symmetry on the part of all players in the dynamic game is one of the key factors behind this as well as the fact that we re maintaining the bathtub aquifer formulation of the original kern county studies of feinerman knapp and others in such a formulation the bottom of the aquifer is perpendicular to the sides and all users spread out along the surface area overlying the aquifer are at an equal distance to the bottom of the aquifer this is in contrast to the formulation used in the study of merrill and guilfoos 40 where the cone shaped aquifer introduces a spatial dimension to the stock externality imposed by one player upon another such that the users on the outer edge of the cone will experience depletion and loss of access to the resource before those on the inner concentric rings of the conical aquifer do while this imposition of homogeneity across users and the strategic and stock externalities that they impose upon each other does not invalidate the qualitative nature of the results that we show it does point to an aspect of the socio economic dimensions of groundwater based agricultural economies that is of relevance in cases where there are some users with extraction technologies that allow them to exploit the resource more effectively and at greater levels of groundwater lift than others they have a different perception of the stabilization value of groundwater and are able to enjoy the stabilizing effects of the resource beyond the level of depletion that would ration the pumping of others to zero and leave them solely reliant upon the surface water flows that are available the juxtaposition of hand dug and relatively shallow wells in the northern and central irrigated areas of india next to deeper tubewells that are able to tap the aquifer up to greater depths and thereby draw down the water table below the limits of the shallower well has created an inequality of resource access that has been noted by researchers 41 the additional dimension of well deepening as a user decision aside from that of pumping quantity was introduced into the analysis of groundwater depletion in india by sayre and taraz 42 as a way of illustrating how the race to the bottom can be further accelerated if the ability to overcome the threshold introduced by l max in our analysis can be achieved by deepening the reach of the tubewell even further we hope to explore these dimensions of user heterogeneity spatial asymmetry and resource access inequality in further extensions to this study although a few studies in the literature have addressed the potential of not being able to benefit from the full stabilization potential of groundwater when there are constraints on the rate of pumping imposed by a decrease in well yields or other reasons no study has illustrated its direct impact upon the implicit stabilization benefits that groundwater provides to water users facing variable surface water supplies in the way that we have tsur and his co authors motivated their original interest in looking at stabilization value in terms of un covering the economic benefits of maintaining expanding or newly exploiting groundwater resource potential in a way that traditional cost benefit approaches might miss as tsur issar 15 and gemma tsur 6 stated ignoring the stabilization value of groundwater might cause one to underestimate the benefits that can come from investing in groundwater resource development for irrigation and bias the cost benefit analysis of irrigation investment our results provide an important caution to those trying to pursue the analysis laid out by tsur and his colleagues namely that one might end up over estimating the potential stabilization value that groundwater could offer if the underlying assumptions of the analysis ignore the physical dimensions that are critical to groundwater exploitation and which could impose limits on the pumping ability of users in the basin if such limits lie well beyond the level of groundwater overdraft that an economically rational user would pump then one could safely ignore this in an analysis of the potential economic value of groundwater but if as is the case in our illustration this threshold is crossed well within the range of groundwater lift that a user would still be willing to pump from then it becomes a relevant issue given the fact that such threshold effects are specific to the characteristics of an aquifer and may be reached sooner later or perhaps not at all in practical terms we cannot propose a general rule or criterion that can be applied universally to an economic analysis of groundwater potential we do recommend however that a more detailed analysis of a groundwater basin s ability to deliver water consistently to users should be undertaken as a follow up to a broader and more general analysis of groundwater resource potential and economic value the analysis of macewan et al 43 in which they couple a behavioral model of irrigated agricultural production to a more realistic representation of hydrological response derived from a detailed groundwater simulation model for california could be one approach that could achieve this any correction that such a follow up analysis of pumping constraints could provide would give useful information to the decision makers evaluating the costs and benefits of investing in groundwater potential and would also be important for key stakeholders in the groundwater basin to understand 6 conclusion in this paper we have demonstrated the importance of accounting for agent behavior and pumping constraints in the evaluation of the economic use value of groundwater in irrigation we have taken a well known example of kern county california from the literature to show how the total economic use value of groundwater for irrigation is shared between the intrinsic value of augmentation and stabilization that groundwater provides these results were derived from a dynamic programming framework have could be easily generalized from the case of a single unitary decision maker to that of multiple agents acting dynamically but non cooperatively this was done in order to demonstrate how the economic value of groundwater specifically the augmentation value can be dissipated with an increasing number of competing decision makers for the purposes of illustration we introduced a limit on groundwater pumping into the problem that is triggered when a threshold level of groundwater lift has been exceeded as way of modeling how groundwater users can be confronted with increasing constraints on pumping as the resource becomes over exploited by doing so were able to illustrate how the stabilization value of groundwater can also be dissipated as the aggregate pumping behavior becomes more myopic and the groundwater resource is more heavily mined the loss of stabilization value specifically was a result of the pumping limits no longer allowing the mean value of surface water inflow to be achieved in all time periods thereby causing us to lower the stable floor of available water that the groundwater user can be assured of always being able to have access to this resulted in a downward revision of the stabilization value which resulted in a further decrease in the overall economic use value of groundwater for irrigation than before our analysis expands the literature on the stabilization value of groundwater and points to some key behavioral and physical factors that can affect it along with the other components of total economic use value in irrigation this points to one of the pervasive challenges of managing common pool resources like groundwater where controlling the number of people who have access to it along with the modification of user behavior is the key to achieving sustainable resource usage for the long term while our analysis does not propose any specific policy instruments that would be effective in achieving this we provide a clearer picture as to which component of groundwater s economic use value to irrigation is lost when over exploitation occurs and in what sequence that progressive loss might occur declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper technical annex a the economic value of groundwater in production to define the total economic value of groundwater in production we start from the economic problem facing a water user who uses the resource to produce a good valued at price p while incurring some cost c w where w is the quantity of water used the profit maximization problem of this water user can be written as 20 max w 0 p f w c w where the water can be derived from either ground or surface water at the total cost specified by the function if the amount of water available was constrained in some way i e w w max then the shadow value of that constraint would represent the marginal value of water which could be traced out parametrically as the quantity of water available w was varied by doing so we would obtain the curve below fig a1 demand for water fig a1 where d w is the demand curve for water i e d w p f w 8 8 note that the function f w satisfies f w 0 f w 0 augmentation and stabilization value if we summarize the net benefits arising from the water user s problem by a net benefit function n b w p f w c w then we can write out the gains to stabilizing the value of a stochastic water allocation w at its mean value w as 21 s v n b w e n b w as was shown by gemma tsur 6 if were to take an approximation of the expected value of net benefits under the stochastic outcome using a 2nd order taylor s series expansion around the mean value w we would obtain 22 e n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 where σ 2 is the variance of the stochastic distribution of water around its mean value i e σ 2 e w w 2 and n b w is the 2nd derivative of the net benefit function if we substitute this expression into equation we get an approximation to the stabilization value of water as 23 s v n b w e n b w n b w n b w 1 2 n b w σ 2 1 2 n b w σ 2 which clearly increases with the variability of water supply and with the curvature of the net benefit function given that the cost term in the net benefit expression is convex we know that n b w p f w c w 0 that variance is positive and therefore that the stabilization value is positive this positive quantity is representative of the risk neutral decision maker s willingness to pay in order to receive the mean quantity w with assurance rather than have to face the uncertainty in the realization of w as a stochastic outcome proceeding further with the economic problem laid out in equation 20 we can consider the additional benefit that can arise if another more stable source of water is found say from groundwater if we think of groundwater as providing the stability in water supply embodied in n b w as well as providing additional supply over and above what the decision maker would obtain with surface water alone then the benefit of augmenting the agent s water supply with groundwater i e the augmentation value av would be given as 24 a v n b w g n b w where g is the amount of groundwater pumped if we add the stabilization and augmentation values of groundwaer in equations 1 and 4 respectively we can obtain an expression for the total economic value tev of groundwater as 25 t e v s v a v n b w e n b w n b w g n b w n b w g e n b w b characterizing the stochastic surface water inflow for the kern county example as was shown in equation 6 of the main text the surface water inflows i t are divided between a portion that is used for irrigation ε i t and that which contributes to the recharge of that aquifer i t 1 ε to capture the stochastic nature of inflow we used the probability distribution of surface water inflow that was described by knapp and olson 22 in table ii of their paper which we have reproduced below table b1 probability distribution of surface water inflows for the kern county example table b1 sw inflow volume millions of acre feet per year probability 0

distribution of 12 inflow levels i p that are each associated with a probability p such that the expected value i 1 12 p i i p i is equal to the 1 97 million acre feet of average surface water inflow shown in table 1 of the main text in order to take draws from this distribution we designed a sampling program that populated 12 bins of width that is in proportion to the probability weights with inflow values from the table above we then took draws from the uniform distribution 1 100 using the random number generator in gams which is the program we used to implement and solve the dynamic programming problem given that the likelihood of landing on an inflow value is directly tied to the number of values between 1 and 100 that are assigned to it within each bin we were able to simulate a series of draws that replicated the empirical distribution given in knapp and olson s paper below we show in fig b1 how the relative sampling proportions of the inflow levels taken from our simulated draws compare to the probability distribution given in the knapp olson paper fig b1 comparison of observed and simulated sw inflow probability distribution for the kern county example source author calculations fig b1 c numerical solution of the dynamic game of groundwater extraction typically in a dynamic programming problem one has to perform a series of recursive calculations to recover the exact form of the value function v l so as that one can solve the bellman equation as a static optimization problem in cases where the benefit function is more complex numerical techniques have to be employed to obtain an approximation to the function in order to proceed with a numerical solution in our case we are able to obtain the exact form of the value function by using recursive techniques detailed in part d of the technical annex to this paper in the end we find that the infinite horizon carry over value function for this problem takes on the following form 26 v l a b a e l c a e l 2 d l where the parameters a b c and d are complex functions of the basic parameters of the groundwater extraction problem including the surface water inflow level s by using the parameters shown in table 1 we can solve the bellman equation as a static optimization problem using the values of a b c and d that define the infinite horizon carry over value function of the problem as shown in the maximization problem below 27 max q t 0 e b q t s t e l t q t β a b a e l t 1 c a e l t 1 2 d l t 1 w h e r e l t 1 l t 1 θ q t θ s t r a s y b q t s t a q t s t 1 2 b q t s t 2 doing so over a sequence of time periods t 9 9 while sequentially updating the value of lift l t in each period using the value of l t 1 from the last in recursive fashion would give us a series of pumping decisions that vary with the groundwater lift in a very systematic way as the problem moves forward that relationship between groundwater pumping and the groundwater lift is shown in figure c2 below and constitutes a linear pumping rule that captures the optimal trade off between current net benefit from pumping and future discounted benefits deriving from groundwater left over for optimal use in subsequent periods fig c2 decision rule on optimal pumping derived from kern county example fig c2 we would obtain the same pumping rule analytically by taking the first order necessary conditions of the maximization problem shown in equation 8 and re arranging the terms to give an expression for q t in terms of the other model parameters and the key state variable l t by doing so we would obtain the expression below 28 q t o p t i m a l a b s t β b 1 θ a s y v l t 1 e b l t from this expression we can see that the intercept of the function is a combination of terms involving the model parameters the sw inflow and the derivative of the carry over value function v l t 1 whereas the slope is largely driven by the energy costs and the slope of the underlying demand function for water the term v l t 1 captures the marginal value of keeping an extra unit of groundwater in the aquifer i e the shadow value which is commonly referred to as the co state variable in the jargon of dynamic optimization given that adding an extra unit of lift to the pumping problem represents an increased cost to the groundwater user this shadow value is negative for this problem the combined term β 1 θ a s y v l t 1 is referred to as the marginal user cost of the groundwater resource and embodies the difference between a strictly myopic solution to the groundwater extraction problem resulting from the solution of the optimization problem in 7 and the dynamically optimal solution we obtain from the dynamic programming problem in eqn 27 we will show later how a sub optimal behavioral regime can reduce the marginal user cost and cause the solution embodied in figure c2 to shift towards one that follows a myopic extraction rule in part d of the technical appendix we derive the optimal pumping rule in terms of its infinite horizon parameter values which are comprised of the basic parameters of the problem in table 1 and the more complex parameters a b c and d shown in equation eqn 26 this gives us 29 q t o p t i m a l φ 1 φ 2 a e l t w h e r e φ 1 γ β d e b b s n 2 e 2 γ β c θ s r b 2 e γ 2 β n c φ 2 1 2 e γ β c b 2 e γ 2 β n c we will employ this form of the pumping rule within an analytical illustration that will be given in a later section of the paper d derivation of the infinite horizon value function for the dynamic game starting with the example of kern county based on the paper of feinerman and knapp 19 and the other ones that followed it we set out to derive the closed form solution of the infinite horizon carry over value function for groundwater lift in the next period so that we can apply it to the solution of the following problem stated in equation 8 of section 3 1 of the paper 30 v l t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 l t 1 l t q t θ w t r a s y w t q t s t max q e b q t s t e l t q t β v l t 1 θ q t θ s t r a s y given that we would want to address both the problem of the central planner as well as the decentralized problem that each individual groundwater using agent solves in a non cooperative manner we develop our solution with the dynamic game setting in mind so as to achieve the most general case in the case where we only want to consider the central planner s problem we would set n 1 and the solution would converge to that case otherwise we would get a result that would be applicable to any number of players groundwater pumping game now consider a simple dynamic and symmetric game of strategic pumping from a common aquifer which will illustrate the competitive equilibrium that we would expect between players pumping from the same aquifer the lift to the groundwater table i e the distance over which water has to be pumped to the surface at time t l t evolves according to the equation of motion below 10 10 note that the parameter ξ does not appear anywhere in our derivations since it is used to translate the value of total surface water inflow into the basin i into the quantity that contributes towards the recharge of the aquifer r 1 ξ i r and that which is available for irrigation s ξ i therefore it is embedded in those quantities s r used in our derivations 31 l t 1 l t 1 θ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s t r t a s y l t γ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s t r t w h e r e γ 1 θ a s y θ θ a s y r t r t a s y here we have kept the same overall form of the equation as in the main text equation 6 but have now simplified it by dividing certain terms through by the quantity a s y that had appeared in the denominator of the 2nd rhs term of the equation this gives us a more compact equation whose terms we can carry through more easily in the derivations that will follow in contrast to equation 6 where we just have a single agent we have a representation of all of the other n 1 identical agents who are also pumping from the aquifer and whose aggregate pumping behavior is an exogenous quantity n 1 q ˆ to the single agent s maximization problem the net benefit function for water use is quadratic for each player i and includes the water that is pumped from the aquifer q t i as well as the surface water that is available and divided evenly over all n agents s t n this net benefit function incorporates the cost effect of having decreasing groundwater levels and increasing levels of lift such that 32 n b i w i a w i b 2 w i 2 e l t q t i a 1 2 b w i w i e l t q t i s t w t i q t i s t n a 1 2 b q t i s t n q t i s t n e l t q t i here the marginal costs of groundwater withdrawal which incorporate the unit energy cost e increase linearly with the depth to groundwater i e lift l t and is faced by all n agents the parameters a and b describe the marginal benefits and costs of groundwater withdrawals respectively and are shared by all players with the slope term being scaled according to the number of players i e b b n so that the aggregate benefit adds up to that given by the original feinerman knapp 19 model b as shown in table 1 of the main text therefore when describing the dynamic game problem of player i we can write out the infinite horizon dynamic problem facing player i as follows 33 v i l t max q t i a 1 2 b q t i s t n q t i s t n e l t q t i β v i l t 1 θ q t i n 1 q ˆ t θ s t r t a s y which we can simplify further by dropping the time subscripts 11 11 we have also simplified here further by dropping the expectations operator given that we are dealing with the case where the decision maker makes the pumping decision ex post of knowing the realization of surface water we can treat surface water as a known quantity to the decision maker s problem we do this because of the closed loop autonomous nature of the infinite horizon dynamic programming problem presented here in which only the current state of the state and control variables are relevant to the maximization problem of the decision maker in any given period therefore we can state the bellman equation in eqn 33 for player i as 34 v i l max q i a 1 2 b q i s n q i s n e l q i β v i l t γ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s t r t where we also use the more compact form of the equation of motion from equation eqn 31 the functions v i l represent the maximized value of the dynamic problem starting with the current level of the groundwater lift l for a given time period forward assuming that the actions taken in subsequent periods will be done optimally with the level of groundwater lift realized in later periods this recursive relationship linking the implied optimality of behavior from period to period captures the essence of bellman s principle of optimality 30 and holds within the context of a strategic game played dynamically by two or more players in order to describe the nature of the solution to the dynamic game problem for player i we begin from the stage zero problem in which the carry over value of the groundwater level is zero v 0 i l 0 making the player s problem myopic as is shown below 35 v 1 i l max q i a 1 2 b q i s n q i s n e l q i such that we obtain the first order conditions 36 a b q i o p t s n e l 0 from which we can immediately derive the optimal value of the decision variable as 37 q i o p t a e l b s n b a e l b s n with which we impose symmetry across all players such that q i o p t q ˆ q by substituting this back into the expression for the maximized value at stage one we obtain 12 12 note that w q i o p t s n a e l b s n s n a e l b v 1 i l a 1 2 b q s n q s n e l q a 1 2 b a e l b a e

are functions of the parameters of the problem at stage two of the recursion using the value function derived above to form the decision problem of player i in stage three we would obtain the

d 3 β d 2 e φ 1 based upon this we can see a clear pattern that carries through with each subsequent stage of the backward recursion process where for each stage k 1 we would have the parameters a k 1

defines the bellman equation and the underlying optimization problem for the infinite horizon dynamic game 65 v i l max w a q i s n 1 2 b q i s n 2 e l q i β a b a e l c a e l 2 d l s t l l 1 θ q i n 1 q ˆ θ s r a s y from the relationships in we have show the parameters a b c and d to be complex functions of the basic parameters of the groundwater extraction problem including the surface water inflow level s in fact the presence of s and the way it augments the available water that enters into the net benefit calculation is responsible for the last term d l of the value function we have derived here in the classic formulation of feinerman and knapp 19 where only pumped groundwater gives direct economic benefits and the surface water inflow only contributes to the recharge of the aquifer within the equation of motion the functional form of the infinite horizon value function would be strictly quadratic in a e l with only the terms associated with a b and c being present the interested and intrepid reader is invited to replicate the backward recursion process we have used for this case with only q i in the net benefits of the objective and verify this result from the steady state convergence of the relationships in eqn 60 we also get the parameters that define the reduced form decision rule that captures and replicates the solution of the dynamic programming problem in each step of the dynamic game namely 66 q i φ 1 a e l φ 2 and which represents the stationary markov equilibrium strategy for the players in this dynamic game for a given level of groundwater lift the equilibrium concept used in this paper is based on the definition of a markov strategy also known as a closed loop or feedback strategy given by dockner et al 44 in which the actions of each player depend on the past history of the game only through the current value of the state variable 45 the decision rule in equation eqn 66 embodies the type of policy function used in simulating such a closed loop feedback strategy and boils down to having a reaction function for each player that is defined by the basic parameters of the groundwater extraction problem namely q i q i l a b e β s r n θ a s y for each player we can write this more compactly as q i q i l ξ where ξ is a vector that embodies all the key parameters of the problem a b e β s r n θ a s y since the dynamic programming problem and hence the resulting solution of each player is independent of time the optimal value functions and equilibrium policy functions will also be time independent autonomous which will make our equilibrium stationary markov and sub game perfect such an equilibrium is defined for the strategy space of each player ω i q i q i q i l ξ such that v i l q i q j i v i l q i q j i q i ω i and holds for any level of lift to the groundwater table l and hence for any stage within the play of the dynamic game the solution method that we use to obtain the stationary markov equilibrium for this problem differs from the continuous time approach commonly employed by authors in the literature who solve infinite horizon differential game problems using the continuous time optimal control approach 44 46 in this case we adopt a discrete time dynamic programming approach similar to that of levhari and mirman 47 and eswaran and lewis 32 and adapted by negri 12 to the groundwater pumping problem in order to obtain a recursive relationship that describes the evolution of the parameters of each player s carry over value function for groundwater stock towards its infinite horizon value this will allow us to numerically obtain the solution to the problem such that the derived infinite horizon value function is consistent with the implied policy function that we obtain from the euler first order conditions of the dynamic problem e how augmentation value changes with the nature of the dynamic game in terms of the augmentation value of groundwater its calculation directly depends upon the behavioral outcomes of combined groundwater and surface water use as captured in equations eqn 4 and 13 if we express these in terms of the basic parameters of the kern county empirical case ignoring the averaging process for simplicity we obtain the following expression 67 a v b q ˆ t s e l t q ˆ t b s a q ˆ t s n 1 2 b q ˆ t s n 2 e l t q ˆ t a s n 1 2 b s n 2 which simplifies to the following case as n and s n 0 68 a v a q ˆ t 1 2 b q ˆ t 2 e l t q ˆ t a e l q ˆ t 1 2 b q ˆ t 2 and the optimal value of pumping itself converges to the following case as n given the form of the optimal pumping rule that we derived analytically as shown in equation eqn 29 based on these expressions we can see that 69 φ 1 γ β d e b b s n 2 e 2 γ β c θ s r b 2 e γ 2 β n c b s n b 0 φ 2 1 2 e γ β c b 2 e γ 2 β n c 1 b which gives us the result 70 q t o p t i m a l n q t a e l t b which allows us to simplify the expression for augmentation value av in eqn 68 as 71 a v a e l q ˆ t 1 2 b q ˆ t 2 a e l a e l b 1 2 b a e l b 2 1 2 a e l 2 b which is equivalent to the maximized value of the stage 1 optimization problem that was shown in the technical appendix part d at the beginning of the backward recursive derivation of the carry over value function see eqn 38 in this stage 1 problem we treated the carry over value us zero making it essentially a myopic extraction problem therefore the fact that the augmentation value converges to the maximized value of this case is not surprising f evaluating the gains to management of groundwater under dynamic game by considering the solutions to both the central planning problem and the dynamic game problem we can now proceed to evaluate the gains that might be realized under coordinated centralized control of groundwater pumping i e management several authors have noted that in many situations the gains to groundwater management are small when compared to the transactions costs that would be incurred in setting up the institutions necessary for implementing a coordinated management policy 23 48 49 brozovic et al 25 found that the gains to management increased greatly by considering the true hydrological nature of the reservoir and the more localized nature of pumping externalities and addressed a symmetric case in which the effects of pumping drawdown were uniformly felt by other users at any given radial distance by calculating the difference between the cumulative present values of net benefits that accrue to all players over the entire path of extraction under both social planning and purely myopic extraction we then have a measure of the gains that would be realized under central groundwater management the outcomes of the non cooperative extraction regime can also be compared to pure myopia to evaluate any differences or gains in cumulative net benefits over time and this can be compared to the gains realized under centralized control recall that the myopic outcome was captured in the model shown in equation 7 therefore using the outcomes of pumping and groundwater lift from the myopic extraction dynamic game and central planning solutions we can calculate the gains to centralized management over myopic extraction as shown follows 72 g a i n c p t 1 t t β t 1 i 1 n b i w i t c p e l t c p q i t c p t 1 t t β t 1 i 1 n b i w i t m y o p i c e l

b i w i t m y o p i c 2 e l t m y o p i c q i t m y o p i c using this scheme we re able to derive the values shown in table 3 of the main text in keeping with the sensitivity analysis that we do in the later sections of this technical annex we can also investigate how these increases in the sum of present value net benefits over the myopic case might change as we impose the constraint on groundwater pumping given in equation 17 we do this while also changing the value of l max which serves as the threshold for groundwater lift beyond which pumping is forced to zero the results are given below in figure f1 and show that the gain in the sum of present value net benefits to irrigation increases as the constraint on groundwater pumping becomes more stringent in the threshold for maximum groundwater lift this makes intuitive sense given that increasing the curtailment on pumping based on the level of groundwater lift causes the myopic case or those cases which converge towards it to run up against the pumping constraint much sooner than would otherwise be the case forcing it to lose the net benefits that it would have gained under pumping in those later periods this makes it perform comparatively much worse than under the case with a more conservative pumping schedule as is the case under the control of a central planner fig f1 sensitivity of the gains in the present value of net benefits in irrigation over the myopic case when imposing constraints on groundwater pumping under alternative thresholds for maximum gw lift across various extraction regimes source author calculations fig f1 as the numbers of players increase in the dynamic game those differences over the myopic case go towards zero as was seen before in table 3 and for the same reasons that applied in the case without a constraint on groundwater pumping g sensitivity analysis of stabilization and augmentation value to pumping limits below we demonstrate how the choice of threshold for groundwater lift beyond which pumping is not possible i e l max affects the model simulations such that we have to revise the value of w n s t a b l e to reflect the stable level of available water such that the following inequality holds over the model simulation horizon i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e this new value of w n s t a b l e is determined by inspection of the model simulation results under various values of l max and the way it changes across different numbers of players in the simulated dynamic game is shown in fig g1 below fig g1 sensitivity of stable water equivalent to maximum gw lift across various extraction regimes source author calculations fig g1 here we see that as the threshold for the groundwater pumping limit is lowered i e made more stringent the implied value of stable available water w n s t a b l e declines across all cases although at different points for the case of the centralized planner the decrease of w n s t a b l e below the original mean value of surface water inflow s as given in equation 16 doesn t happen until the threshold is lowered below 400 ft for the case of the dynamic game with 40 players by contrast the decrease happens continuously from the level of 600 ft downwards for this latter case the situation is very close to that of myopic extraction from the groundwater aquifer and the resultant mining of the aquifer brings the groundwater levels down much faster than in the fully optimal case of the centralized planner or n 1 in the dynamic game in such a case the threshold is reached much sooner and begins to impact the lhs of the inequality i 1 n q t i s t w n s t a b l e such that the rhs has to be revised downward in order for it to be satisfied at all points along the time horizon of the simulations this resultant impact on the value of stable available water w n s t a b l e has an effect on the stabilization value calculation and causes it to decrease relative to the case where there is no constraint on pumping at any point during the dynamic extraction game this comparative effect is captured in fig g2 below fig g2 stabilization values across various numbers of players and values of maximum gw lift source author calculations fig g2 the case where l max 600 ft is the most generous and does not become binding even under the nearly myopic extraction case for lower values of l max however there starts to be an effect as soon as the number of players in the dynamic game begins to increase this deviation though less striking is also seen in the calculation of augmentation value shown in fig g3 below fig g3 augmentation values across various numbers of players and values of maximum gw lift source author calculations fig g3 as was the case under no groundwater pumping constraint the augmentation value begins to decrease even under the most generous threshold for maximum groundwater lift l max due to the decrease in the marginal user cost that is implicit in the dynamic programming problem of the non cooperative extraction game once we start to deviate from the benchmark of efficiency set by the central planner this deviation is accelerated by the lowering of the threshold for groundwater lift in a way that is consistent with the effect on stabilization value observed previously it should be re iterated here that the effect we observe on stabilization and augmentation values from changing the threshold for groundwater lift on the pumping constraint as we increase the number of players comes through two different pathways as is stated above the impact on augmentation value comes directly from the effect of increasing the number of players in the dynamic game and the resulting effect that it has upon behavior in this case the incentives to conserve groundwater are gradually diminished thereby causing the accelerated pattern of groundwater pumping to increase the groundwater lift up to the point where it makes the constraint on pumping binding in the case of stabilization value the variation we see in fig g2 comes more indirectly through a change in behavior and the way in which it causes groundwater pumping to be curtailed at varying rates across the simulation horizon effectively limiting access to it and its stabilizing properties if we just consider the variation of stabilization value across varying levels of stable inflow holding the stochastic pattern of inflow that is used in the calculation s t constant and apply the formula for calculating stabilization value given in equation 19 we obtain the smooth variation shown in fig g4 below fig g4 stabilization values across various levels of stable surface water inflow source author calculations fig g4 so the variation in stabilization value that we see in fig g2 is a reflection of how the stable value of surface water inflow that we can impute from the various model simulation results is being changed as the different values of maximum groundwater lift that is used in the pumping constraint are being applied to the model the pattern of how this imputed stable equivalent value changes with the constraint threshold was shown in fig g1 and maps onto the corresponding stabilization value of groundwater according to the smooth relationship shown in fig g4 above 
8658,assessing the possible locations and evaluating the spatial distribution of hydropower potentials at the global and regional scale is crucial for planning future energy development activities this study assesses run of river based hydropower potential and evaluates potential sites under technical economic and environmental constraints globally the study used the recent 1965 2014 global runoff dataset 0 5 x 0 5 resolution for design discharge computation and 90 m 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem covering 90 n 60 s for topographical analysis the design discharges qd calculated for 30 75 and 95 flow dependability were used in the assessment and evaluations further the economic feasibility of identified potential sites was evaluated by developing empirical relations derived from the observed cost of electromechanical equipment to corresponding head h and installed power p globally a theoretical hydropower potential of 25 48 peta watt hours per year pwh yr at 95 flow dependability to 184 17 pwh yr at 30 flow dependability was estimated the energy ranges from 7 06 pwh yr to 49 05 pwh yr are technically feasible for the design discharge calculated from 95 to 30 flow dependability respectively after excluding environmentally unsuitable and economically less competitive levelized cost of electricity lcoe us 0 1 kwh potential sites it was estimated that an exploitable hydropower potential of 5 42 pwh yr at 95 flow dependability to 39 56 pwh yr at 30 flow dependability would be available globally keywords global hydropower potential economic evaluations costing of powerplants cost of electromechanical equipment 1 introduction rapid urbanization the continuous evolution of mechanized farming and growing industrialization are continuously increasing the energy demand the government policymakers and power developing companies make constant efforts to produce enhance power production from various sources to meet the growing needs of energy worldwide globally a common consensus has been reached for developing environmental friendly energy sources mainly to mitigate the effects of global warming and consequent natural hazards after the 2015 paris climate conference most countries worldwide are committed to substantially reducing green house gasses ghg emissions 1 on the agreements of sustainable development goals signed in 2015 many countries have strategically initiated the efforts of considering renewable energy sources as a primary source among several forms of renewable energy hydropower can be considered as more affordable and clean energy 2 3 in 2011 the united nations secretary general launched a sustainable energy for all initiative to increase the share of renewable energy by 36 in the global energy mix by 2030 4 in addition to this countries like canada indonesia nepal and uganda use hydropower to support and accelerate social and economic progress and thus reduce poverty by providing adequate power to their community 2 in 2020 power generation from hydropower was the world s largest renewable energy source of electricity with multiple non power benefits 5 currently the hydropower generation at the global level has been estimated to be 4 370 twh yr which is 63 of the renewable energy production and nearly 16 of the total energy production 6 7 generating hydropower has been growing increasingly along with the technological advancement in various aspects such as enhancing conversion efficiency economic feasibility automating the operation optimizing several systems etc 8 10 besides the advancement in hydroelectric technology the encouraging remarks of developing hydropower is because of its relatively low operation and maintenance cost able to manage the peak power demand and almost zero carbon emission however subject to the availability of relatively a denser river network having suitable terrain which favors hydropower developments the technical configuration of possible hydropower plants can either be a storage type dam and reservoir based or a run of river type weir or barrage with no or small pondage overall the potential hydropower assessments require the information of water resource availability and feasible head for installing operating various hydromechanical equipment in theory it is assumed that all possible potential sites can able to produce hydropower energy however planning to exploit all potential locations may not be possible due to several restrictions e g technical legal economic environmental and social 11 13 furthermore the variability and inconsistency of available discharge and available head are major barriers in the planning and designing of hydropower plants over the past decades several hydroelectric potential assessments have been conducted at various scales including the local and regional and some are at the continental level 14 17 in addition some previous studies have also attempted to assess and evaluate the global scale hydropower potential 12 18 20 however the estimated values vary from each other due to inconsistencies in data quality parameters considered and assumptions in addition hydropower analysis by its nature is sensitive for changes in any parameters particularly for changes in head and discharge pokhrel et al 20 estimated the global theoretical hydropower potential using a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution runoff and elevation data from second global soil wetness project gswp 2 and hdrok1 respectively however the study used a coarse resolution dem which could affects the reliability of the available hydropower potential estimations and also the study did not evaluate the technical and exploitable potential sites the study conducted by hoes et al 18 used a monthly and annually averaged runoff dataset prepared with a 0 5 x 0 5 spatial resolution combining the climate driven water balance model using the climate data and the river discharge measurements for the year 1971 2000 their study used a dem with a relatively coarse resolution 225 m at the equator further in the evaluation identified potential sites have not included the economic and environmental feasibility analyses thus more detailed analyses of hydropower estimation require a longer span and more recent hydrological data along with fine resolution dem studies conducted by zhou et al 12 and gernaat et al 19 assessed the global hydropower potential including the technical and exploitable potentials their study estimates the available global technical potential of 26 pwh yr and 13 7 pwh yr and a global exploitable potential of 16 pwh yr and 8 77 pwh yr respectively however these studies assessed the availability of potential sites at different intervals 55 km 12 and 25 km 19 with 30 flow dependability in addition to this their studies used a dem map available from hydrosheds which has a spatial extent between 56 s and 60 n 18 19 21 therefore the hydropower potential of countries located outside the specified spatial extent for example norway finland sweden northern parts of canada has not been included despite the claim that has been to assess hydropower globally the comparison of data and methods used in this study and two of the most recent studies are presented in appendix a to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first one developed for estimating the global run of river hydropower potential using relatively an error reduced finest resolution 90 m at the equator dem covering the land areas between 90 n 60 s nearly the entire land surface of the earth has covered except in the glacier in addition to this the runoff dataset derived from a quite adequate time series span and recent 1965 2014 climatic data and streamflow has been used for analysis the study identified and analyzed the theoretical and technical potential sites with a minimum interval of 500 m it also developed a new cost estimation empirical relation derived from the observed cost of electromechanical equipment s to corresponding head h and installed power p for estimating the cost of electromechanical equipment of each potential site and used it for further economic analysis and evaluation the specific objectives of the paper are to i identify the potential sites for a run of river hydropower development at the global scale and ii evaluate potential sites from the theoretical technical economic and environmental perspectives 2 data used 2 1 runoff and streamflow data this paper used the monthly gridded runoff dataset obtained from the study of ghiggi et al 22 to generate design discharge at each river raster cell the developers reconstructed the global runoff dataset using precipitation and temperature data from an atmospheric reanalysis for the years 1902 2014 they have also used observational streamflow data to calibrate and validate the runoff dataset independently the gridded runoff dataset prepared with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 is available in netcdf format for public use 22 2 2 digital elevation model dem a multi error removed improved terrain dem merit dem of a spatial resolution with 3 arcsec 90 m at the equator was used to extract elevation at each point to determine the available head merit dem is the most comprehensive error removed global topographic dataset developed by removing tree height bias stripe noise absolute bias and speckle noise from the publicly available spaceborne dem sources srtm3 v2 1 and aw3d 30 m v1 21 23 in addition a merit hydro a flow direction dataset developed from merit dem was used the dataset was prepared by yamazaki et al 21 that covers land areas between 90 n 60 s i e it includes the entire land area of the globe except for the glacier regions 2 3 a world protected area dataset and urban polygons a buffering distance of 1000 m was used to exclude possible potential sites closer to the protected areas such as world heritage sites national parks and towns the dataset obtained from the united nations environment world conservation monitoring centre unep wcmc 24 and global rural urban mapping project version 1 grumpv1 25 were used for excluding potential sites that fall closer to existing protected areas and urban polygons respectively 2 4 other datasets similarly a buffering distance of 1000 m was used to exclude the possible potential sites that overlap or enormously closer to existing dams reservoirs and lakes the global dams and reservoir datasets available at socioeconomic data and applications centre sedac 26 were used for identifying previously constructed dams reservoirs and existing lakes the global powerplant database prepared by world resource institute 27 was used for identifying the location of existing hydropower plants and corresponding installed capacity furthermore the population of each country in 2019 was collected from world bank global data centre 28 and the forecasted population data for the year 2050 and 2100 was accessed from the population pyramid net 29 3 methodology 3 1 background one of the main activities in developing conventional hydropower plants is constructing a barrier dam or weir across the river and directing the river water to the powerhouse with controlled conveyances the potential and kinetic energy of water falling from a certain head is a major driving force utilized for striking and spinning turbines coupled with the generator in the power plant this paper determines the available discharge and head in the global river networks and evaluates the available power and energy by a minimum of 500 m intervals at each location the study also evaluates the feasibility of identified potential sites from economic and environmental perspectives the procedures listed below were followed in the entire process using gis tools 1 the river network was developed on a global scale by calculating the flow accumulation for a minimum threshold of 10 000 grid cells 81 km2 based on that the available head was extracted from the dem 2 the flow direction and flow accumulation algorithms were used for determining possible design discharge of the river network along with each cell by processing the global runoff dataset section 3 3 accordingly the potential hydropower assessments were performed combining the available head and discharge extracted by points generated along the river at a minimum of 500 m interval 3 economic feasibility analysis was performed for the identified technical potential sites after exclusion of sites that are overlapping on environmentally protected locations urban polygons reservoirs wetlands and existing hydropower plants 3 2 hydropower potential estimation and categorization the governing equations for determining available power p and energy e of a specific location of a river segment is expressed as 1 p η γ q d h 2 e c f p t where p is the power in kw η is the overall efficiency of the power plant and γ is the unit weight of water 9 81 kn m3 q d is the design discharge m3 s h is the available head m neglecting the energy losses along with the conveyance structure e is energy in kwh c f is an average capacity factor and t is operational hours in a year generally the design discharge q d can be adjusted from the availability and seasonality of the river flow as 3 q d 0 q q min q q min q q d q max q d q max q min is the minimum discharge that should be released in the river for sustainable river ecology and the downstream demands q d is the design discharge that the water conveying structures and other power unit components can convey q max is the maximum river discharge that is beyond the design capacity of the water conveyance structure of the power plant however this study extracted 30 75 and 95 flow dependability separately and assessed the possible hydropower potential see section 3 3 the hydropower potential assessments are generally classified into theoretical technical and exploitable realizable potential 13 30 31 researchers have considered the realities of the study area and the nature of hydroelectric power plants in each of these categories to determine the maximum and minimum head discharge and intervals between successive power plants in this paper the details of each of these categorizations are described below 3 2 1 theoretical potential theoretical hydropower is the maximum gross potential that the river basin can produce without considering constraints 10 12 30 it represents the total energy potential of a given river considering only the available water in the catchment and its topography this study assessed the theoretical potential by neglecting the overall efficiency η and the capacity factor c f constraints based on the installed capacity the smallest hydropower plant type considered in this study is micro hydropower which commonly has a minimum installed capacity of 5 kw 32 the authors assumed that considering a minimum available discharge of 0 3 m3 s is safe to the environment and can provide enough potential energy to rotate the turbine with a minimum head of 1 m using equation 1 a combination of 1 m head 0 3 m3 s discharge and efficiency of 1 neglecting efficiency for theoretical potential analysis can produce a capacity of 3 kw which is assumed to represent the smallest micro hydropower plants locations in this study a minimum of 500 m allowable waterway length was used as an optimum interval to ensure the backwater effects of the downstream station to the tailrace of the upstream station pandey et al 16 and kusre et al 33 have used the same minimum horizontal distance as an optimum interval 3 2 2 technical potential due to technical financial and environmental constraints it is practically impossible to construct hydropower plants in all theoretically identified locations 13 17 34 at the catchment level the technical potential is usually smaller than the theoretical potential due to the constraints such as available firm flow available head the allowable distance between plants and powerhouses capacity factor and overall efficiencies of powerplant components due to these constraints a large portion of runoff cannot be available for energy development technically hydropower plants should have adequate waterway length head and discharge for optimal functioning it can be noted from recent studies that the waterway length varies between a series of power plants or the headwork and the powerhouse and is preferred to be a minimum of 500 m for the technical feasibility analyses 13 16 33 similarly a maximum waterway length can vary between 3000 m and 10000 m 13 16 33 35 to prevent the interference of one power plant from the other as well as to reduce the cost of canal and penstocks in this study potential sites having a minimum of 20 m head along with a minimum waterway length of 500 m and a maximum of 5000 m were filtered out and analyzed further it should also be noted that these thresholds are used for analyzing and comparing each potential site at a global scale however these figures may increase or decrease when including financial optimizations and considering other on site challenges and opportunities 3 2 3 exploitable realizable potential the exploitable potential is the technical potential that can realistically be developed considering the economic and environmental constraints 12 36 due to environmental concerns developing potential sites overlapping in the protected areas urban areas densely populated residents and existing dams and reservoirs are unacceptable in addition to this potential sites identified having a relatively higher net present cost of generation for energy generated over the project s lifetime are filtered and excluded see section 3 4 table 1 presents the technical parameters assumed environmental constraints and corresponding values used in this study 3 3 spatial data analysis and data extractions geospatial analysis was carried out to identify the suitable locations for power plant development and calculate the available potential of each stream by applying weibull s method 37 38 the runoff with 30 75 and 95 flow dependability was extracted for each cell 0 5 0 5 resolution from the monthly scale runoff dataset 22 a flow accumulation calculation was carried out by flow accumulation algorithm using a weight raster generated from runoff raster and flow direction raster to accumulate the discharges in raster cells into the nearest streams finally streams securing the discharge of 0 3 m3 s and above were extracted by assuming that it ensures a minimum adequate flow for the power units points with 500 m intervals were generated along a stream network to extract elevations from the dem pixel see section 3 2 1 the available head h in each of the points generated on the stream network was determined from the extracted elevation by considering the elevation difference between two consecutive neighboring points for theoretical potential assessment a waterway length of 500 m and a minimum head h of 1 m were used section 3 2 1 finally locations having a head h of 20 m and above 16 with a minimum waterway length of 500 m and a maximum of 5000 m searching once in 500 m interval were filtered and extracted for technical potential assessment fig 1 illustrates the step by step methodology used to identify and evaluate the theoretical technical and exploitable power potential 3 4 economic analysis and evaluation of exploitable potential the investment operation and maintenance costs were calculated for each technically and environmentally feasible potential site the levelized cost of electricity lcoe evaluation method was used to set up the threshold to filter economically feasible potential sites lcoe is the ratio of the sum of costs of the power plant and the sum of electrical energy over the project s lifetime 4 l c o e i cost t 1 l s o m cost 1 g t 1 f t 1 r t t 1 l s e t 1 r t where i cost is the initial investment cost om cost is the operation and maintenance cost in a year t f t is the fuel expenditure neglected for this study r is the discount rate g is the expected annual escalation rate of o m cost ls is the economic life year of the project and e t is the available energy in kwh in t year due to the limited available information of discount rate r across the world we referred irena report of the year 2019 for calculating the lcoe of renewable hydropower power generation costs the study used an average discount rate r of 7 5 for china and organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries and an average discount rate r 10 for other countries in the world 39 for this study an average discount rate of 8 and an annual o m cost escalation rate of 2 were used the economic life year of the power plants ls was assumed to be 30 years zhou et al 11 and gernaat et al 18 used a cost of 0 09us kwh and 0 1us kwh respectively as a threshold to filter economically viable potential sites it was found from the irena 2019 reports that the global weighted average lcoe of hydropower plants installed each year for the last decade 2010 2019 is varied between 0 037us kwh to 0 055us kwh 39 in addition the lcoe for other renewable energy sources concentrating solar systems and wind farms continuously declined to 0 068us kwh and below due to continuous technological improvements on the efficiency of their equipment and capacity factors 39 40 therefore this study assumed that potential sites with lcoe 0 1us kwh will not be further competitive and economically viable the study did not consider the cost escalations due to construction delays 3 5 costing of hydropower projects the overall cost of the hydropower plant includes the initial investment and the operation and maintenance cost previous studies conducted including many investigations and noted the relationships of hydropower installation investment costs of construction of the power plant and operation and maintenance costs for operating the power plant after construction 10 11 35 the cost of initial investment includes the direct and indirect costs of the project civil work costs hydraulic equipment costs electromechanical equipment costs transmission costs environmental effect mitigation costs compensation costs and preparations are considered as the direct cost of the power plant on the other hand administration and engineering costs costs for contingency and cost of annual or monthly interests during construction are considered as indirect costs for a proposed project therefore the total cost of the power plant t cost can be expressed as follows 5 t cost i cost o m cost where i cost and om cost are the initial investment costs and operation and maintenance costs of the power plant respectively the detail of each of these parameters is presented in the following sections 3 5 1 the cost of initial investment i cost several researchers attempted to develop mathematical correlations between the installed capacity head and cost of the development using statistical data collected from various hydropower plants located in the different study areas 11 41 43 the cost of initial investment i cost can be divided into the cost of the civil structure electromechanical equipment and ancillary installations although there is no clear formula available to express the cost of the civil structure and ancillary installations the review of kaldellis et al 11 suggested that it is possible to express the cost of the civil structure and ancillary installations as a function of the cost of electromechanical equipment and installations em cost by simplifying kaldellis et al 11 expressions the following equation eqn 6 was derived 6 i cost e m cost δ 1 1 f where f is the installation cost coefficient electromechanical interconnection development cost access tracks the value of f is a fraction ranges between 5 10 11 δ is civil structure cost coefficient and that can be expressed as a function of the cost of electromechanical equipment em cost the value of δ varies between 0 8 and 2 11 the higher value is taken when constructing a dam and long water conveyance structures including the penstock analysis reported in yildiz 43 irena 44 and carlsson 45 also support these assumptions previous studies express the cost of electromechanical equipment as a function of the available head h and power p 42 43 46 47 the expression in equation 7 is adopted from ogayar and vidal 46 7 e m cost a h b p c us the value of coefficients a b and c are determined by correlating the cost of electromechanical equipment as a function of the available head h and rated power p using regression analysis methods the observed statistical data collected by alvarado 48 for 81 selected hydropower projects in north america europe south america asia and africa fig 2 and archived in international water power dam construction organization was used in this study these data provide a clear picture of the cost of electromechanical equipment s with their corresponding available power p mw and help to compare and understand the variation in the cost the cost includes turbines governors valves cooling and drainage water systems cranes workshops generators transformers earthing systems control equipment telecommunications systems and auxiliary systems 48 equation 8 below is developed by applying logarithms and substituting the observed data of the cost em cost power p and head h and carrying out multiple linear regression between the two independent variables logp and logh 8 log e m cost 0 3568 0 13 log h 0 78 log p using the coefficients of equation 8 obtained from regression analysis the coefficients a b and c in equation 9 can be expressed as a e0 3568 b 0 13 and c 0 78 9 e m cos t m i l l i o n u s 1 488 h 0 13 p m w 0 78 us 2008 as shown in fig 3 below the simulation results using equation 9 and the observed electromechanical cost have a very good agreement we could not find the cumulative price increase from 2008 to 2021 at a global level in this study the average cumulative price increase of the united states from 2008 to 2021 increased by 23 03 49 was used to consider the expected escalation of the cost of electromechanical equipment and installations of power plants thus slightly modifying equation 9 and combining it with equation 6 the average investment cost icost of possible potential sites is approximated as follows 10 i cost m i l l i o n u s 1 83024 h 0 13 p m w 0 78 1 δ 1 f us 2021 3 5 2 operation and maintenance cost omcost after successful construction the power plant is expected to provide an uninterrupted power supply operations and maintenance facilities should always be kept in place while the project is in operation these costs are strongly dependent on the capacity of the power plant and the cost of investment thus 11 o m cost μ i cost μ is the operation and maintenance cost coefficient observed data based reports from irena 44 and iha 50 indicated the power plant s annual operation and maintenance cost ranges between 1 and 4 of the investment cost for this study it is assumed that 3 of the total investment cost will be used for annual operation and maintenance 4 results and discussion 4 1 general overview of global hydropower potential the study analyzed and evaluated the run of river hydropower potential to identify the possible locations from the worldwide spatial distributions it evaluated the capacity of potential hydropower plants considering the technical environmental and economic constraints the available theoretical technical and exploitable potential were assessed and evaluated for different flow dependability levels a 30 and 95 flow dependability were used to understand and assess the available potential during rainy and dry seasons additionally the 75 flow dependability was used to assess and evaluate the available potentials in intermediate flow conditions it should be noted that the estimations using a 30 flow dependability assume that the design discharge is available only during the first two or three months of the rainy season and does not continue throughout the year therefore the results associated with the 30 flow dependability might be slightly exaggerated on the other hand the 95 flow dependability result indicates the firm hydropower potential available throughout the year table 2 summarizes available installed capacity p in tw and average annual energy e in pwh yr in three dependability levels the installed capacity of theoretical hydropower potential ranges from 2 9 tw to 21 01 tw at 95 and 30 flow dependability respectively the result also shows that the corresponding available annual energy can be 25 48 pwh yr at 95 to 184 17 pwh yr at 30 dependability for the same dependability ranges the annual energy can be produced from technical potential sites ranges from 7 06 pw yr to 49 05 pw yr respectively the annual energy from the exploitable hydropower potential sites is estimated to be between 5 42 pwh yr to 39 56 pwh yr the theoretical potential power and energy is often larger than the technical potential following the theoretical potential technical potential has a larger magnitude than exploitable potential for example for a 30 flow dependability the study identifies the installed capacity of the overall theoretical potential of 21 01 tw the technical potential of 11 19 tw and the exploitable potential of 9 03 tw respectively this variation is associated with the parameters considered during evaluations see section 3 2 table 1 the effects of overall efficiencies η of power plant components and the capacity factor c f were considered to analyze the technical and exploitable potential but not for theoretical potential the exploitable potential was derived from the technical potential by excluding sites that are not economically and environmentally feasible for a 95 flow dependability from the 7 06 pwh yr available technical capacity 76 87 5 42 pwh yr is exploitable 1 4 pwh yr 19 83 of the technical potential has been excluded because of overlap or closer to the protected areas urban and waterbody the remaining 3 26 0 23 pwh yr with an lcoe above 0 1us kwh has been excluded from the exploitable potential category by assuming that it will not be competitive compared to several cost competitive energy generating options available today see section 3 4 studies have already been performed to estimate the global hydropower potential in the past 12 18 20 overall the hydropower potential estimated from this study is slightly more than the previous studies several factors might have caused the difference in the estimation of hydropower potentials such as differences in quality and spatial coverage of input data inconsistencies in definitions variations in parameter consideration and key assumptions on several factors for example pokhrel et al 20 and hoes et al 18 used an average of monthly and annual discharges available in a grid cell as a design discharge which is in general slightly smaller in magnitude than the flow at 30 flow dependability in addition to this pokhrel et al 19 used a coarse resolution 0 5 0 5 dem for head determination which might have ignored multiple potential sites within the grid and thus led to underestimating the hydropower potential compared to the study conducted by zhou et al 12 the present study for the 30 flow dependability slightly overestimates and at 75 flow dependability it has underestimated the overall potential their study estimates the theoretical technical and exploitable hydropower potential as 128 pwh yr 26 pwh yr and 16 pwh yr respectively having 0 5 0 5 resolution 12 the study showed that the theoretical hydropower potential had been calculated after extracting the available head by subtracting the elevation of the targeted grid from the elevation of the lowest grid in each country 12 moreover it is not very clear how the effect of including mountains and depressions the meandering nature of rivers and the availability of multiple rivers with different endings in many of the countries were handled on the other hand gernaat et al 19 analyze the technical and exploitable global hydropower potential at every 25 km interval and estimated 13 27 pwh yr and 8 77 pwh yr respectively since their study used a much longer interval that could ignore potential hydropower site possibilities in between the estimated results are lower than the estimations reported in this study furthermore these two studies used the dem from hydrosheds a spatial extent between 56 s and 60 n which has not included a significant portion globally the hydropower potential at 30 flow dependability is presented in table 3 and the results are compared with previous studies 4 2 available potential sites based on possible installed capacity there is no standardized international consensus for classifying potential hydropower sites based on their installed capacity however many countries and regions have their own classification standards to classify hydropower potentials based on installed capacity in this study the indian classification standard has been used to limit the range of the micro mini small medium and large scale for the analysis table 4 it is obvious that medium and large scale hydropower potential sites would share larger contributions of power generation for example with 30 flow dependability micro mini and small hydropower potential sites can produce 7 33 pwh yr which is 14 94 of the total technical potential about 2 02 of the total potential would be produced from potential sites that fall under the medium hydropower plant category the remaining 74 78 are mainly from the power plant of large scale hydropower however this cannot always happen throughout the year due to the seasonality of rain and runoff in fact most potential sites with a low flow during 30 dependability might have no sufficient flow at 75 and 95 flow dependability on the other hand for 95 flow dependability the average annual energy that micro mini and small hydropower potential sites can produce is about 2 24 pwh yr 31 7 of the total potential in addition to this the remaining 4 82 pwh yr can be produced possibly from medium and large hydropower potential sites table 4 despite the fact that a reasonable number of mini and micro hydropower potential sites are available from the list of technically viable sites the lcoe for most of these potential sites is greater than 0 1us kw the economic analysis excluded the majority of the possible mini and micro hydropower power plants because of their relatively higher lcoe it revealed that the small scale and mini hydropower plants might have relatively higher lcoe than the large and medium scale hydropower plants in addition to this a previous study by zhou et al 12 and the reports collected from actual small scale hydropower development experiences by irena 39 44 also support these findings furthermore the cost function formula is a function of the available head h and power production p in mw therefore an increase in head and reduction of design discharge might lead to slightly exaggerated cost estimation resulting in a slightly exaggerated lcoe table 4 shows that with 30 flow dependability the exploitable mini micro and small hydropower potential is almost 14 23 of the total annual potential and 75 58 is from possible large scale potential sites however this will not happen throughout the year in reality unless a storage structure that able to tap the runoff is available with a 95 flow dependability firm flow the exploitable mini micro and small hydropower potential is almost 29 9 of the total annual potential on the same dependability additionally 21 6 can be produced from locations suitable for a medium hydropower plant development and the remaining 48 52 from possible large scale power plant potential sites 4 3 spatial distribution of potential sites and global possibilities 4 3 1 asia the theoretical technical and exploitable hydropower potential availabilities vary from place to place at the continental and regional levels of all the continents asia the largest continent covers the greatest contribution in all categories from the global hydropower potential an overall average of 44 3 of the potential is available in asia 46 5 of the global exploitable hydropower potential is available in the region though the actual figures vary china russia myanmar and india account for approximately 87 of the total exploitable potential identified in asia and nearly 32 of the world s potential fig 4 fig 7 fig 8 despite the fact that several catchments have significant potential most of the available potential sites in india and china are located around the himalayan mountainous regions the availability of a considerable amount of rainfall significant contribution from snowmelt and the denser and steeper nature of stream networks made it suitable for hydropower development similarly the mountainous topography and higher annual rainfall availability in indonesia nepal and the northern part of pakistan help the countries contribute an average of 6 75 of the global hydropower potential figs 6 and 7 generally it is found that more than 85 of the technical potential in asia is exploitable 4 3 2 south america south america is the second largest contributor for technical and exploitable hydropower potential at a continent level with an average contribution of 21 15 and 25 8 respectively the higher annual rainfall distribution and rugged topography in the northwest to the east directions of the continent help peru brazil venezuela and colombia as the higher potential countries and a significant source of hydropower potential at a content level and at global figs 4 figs 7 and 8 similar to the asian continent 81 4 of the technical potential in south america is exploitable the remaining 18 6 is under the category of protected and or already developed 4 3 3 north and central america hydropower potential in canada and the united states dominates the continent s available potential and its global contribution from the 14 2 contribution estimated by this study almost 12 6 is from canada and united states the remaining 1 6 is from guatemala mexico and other north and central american countries as shown in fig 6 the northwestern mountainous region in the content is highly suitable for hydropower development 4 3 4 africa it is estimated that an average of 18 1 of the world s energy theoretical potential is available in africa the annual exploitable hydropower potential in the continent is estimated to be 640 twh yr at 95 flow dependability and 4220 twh yr at 30 flow dependability fig 4 about 96 5 of the potential sites are in sub saharan countries due to the high availability and distribution of rainfall in addition to stream density and networks fig 6 a b countries located in the congo volta niger and nile river basins have substantial hydropower potential due to higher rainfall high river network density and rugged and mountainous topography for example at 30 flow dependability congo the democratic republic of congo ethiopia angola and nigeria contribute about 56 3 of the available potential in the continent on the other hand northern africa somalia from the east and namibia from the south have minimal less than 2 3 contributions to the continental potential due to their aridity and topographically flat nature 4 3 5 europe in this study the contribution of europe to the global theoretical hydropower potential is estimated to be 7 3 on the other hand the technical and exploitable hydropower potential for the continent is estimated to be an average of 2 5 of the global hydropower potential the results also showed a significant variation between the technical and exploitable hydropower potential in europe compared to the other continents fig 4b for example at a 95 flow dependability the technical and exploitable potential is 276 07 twh yr and 110 24 twh yr respectively the available exploitable potential is even below half of the technical potential in sweden france spain germany and some other countries fig 7 and fig 8 as shown in fig 5 many parts of the continent are covered with protected areas towns previously developed storage reservoirs and previously developed hydropower plants therefore it can be noted that european countries are leading in developing most of the exploitable hydropower potential compared to others 4 3 6 oceania oceania contributes an average of 2 4 to the global hydropower potential the majority of the available potential in the region is located in papua new guinea and new zealand similar to china india and countries in south america the availability of higher average annual rainfall and their mountainous topographic situation made them suitable for hydropower development on the other hand australia the biggest landmass in the region has a smaller contribution this is because almost 80 of the area receives an annual average rainfall of less than 600 mm 51 in addition to this the majority of the area is sandy and gentle in topography 52 4 4 evaluations based on per capita availability the per capita availability of hydropower potential is a useful indicator to understand the abilities of countries for enhancing sustainable electricity generation especially from hydropower considering the current and future scenarios further this information help compares different sources of energy available inside their territory based on the population of 2019 2050 and 2100 we divide the sum of available exploitable hydropower potential in the country s boundary by the population of the country as shown in fig 9a b congo bhutan french new guinea papua new guinea guyana suriname iceland peru canada and bolivia are leading in the top list mainly because of the ratio of available energy to the current and future expected population is relatively higher except for the countries like canada congo and peru the potential contribution of these top leading countries to global and regional hydropower has not been significant however the excessive exploitable potential is available to meet their current and future demand from hydropower only using data sourced from our world in data 53 the average annual per capita electricity consumption of a typical household in 2019 in iceland is 56 8 mwh p yr and 24 mwh p yr in norway which is the biggest consumptions in the world for the same year the average annual per capita consumption in the united states and china is 12 mwh p yr 5 1 mwh p yr respectively in the year 2019 the average global annual per capita electricity consumption was 3 8 mwh yr using these actual consumptions as a base scenario at 30 flow dependability eight countries can meet the per capita consumption equivalent to the current per capita consumption in iceland using their hydropower potential alone similarly 16 countries can meet the current per capita consumption in norway and 57 countries can meet the current global average consumption for the current population using their exploitable hydropower potential alone available within their boundary furthermore at 95 flow dependability three countries can meet the average demand equivalent to an american citizen s current average per capita consumption 10 countries can meet the current chinese average per capita consumption and 13 countries can meet the average global per capita consumption it is very evident from the figures fig 9a b that the per capita hydropower potential availability in 2019 is expected to decrease in 2050 and 2100 due to population growth however variation in the population growth rate between countries can create variations in the decline rate of per capita availability for example in iceland canada guyana bhutan and suriname the per capita availability of energy in 2050 and 2100 is expected to be nearly equal to the per capita availability in 2019 because of their projected lower population growth rate on the other hand the per capita availability of countries like congo french guiana gabon namibia would significantly reduce in 2050 and 2100 due to expected rapid population growth 4 5 sensitivity analysis of parameters the influence of the parameters used in the economic analyses on the overall exploitable hydropower potential has been assessed through sensitivity analysis eight parameters have been selected and the change in the value of each of the parameters on the overall results of exploitable hydropower potential has been evaluated fig 10 a maximum of approximately 75 relative change by magnitude has been chosen on each parameter by keeping others constant the relative change in installation cost coefficient f civil structure cost coefficient δ and o m cost coefficient μ were assessed within the selected range of deviation in the parameters i e varied from 10 25 50 and 75 and compared to the base values i e no change in the parameters the relative change in the overall efficiency η was allowed to vary between 0 5 and 0 95 12 similarly the capacity factor c f of the power plant is allowed to vary between 23 and 95 mainly dependent on the specific plant or for which service the power plant is used i e baseload or peak load 54 however the global weighted average capacity factor of power plants constructed from 2010 to 2019 vary between 40 and 60 as presented in the reports of irena 2019 38 a base value of an average capacity factor of 50 has been used for this study the sensitivity analysis was conducted on the 30 flow dependability potential sites however it was noticed that 75 and 95 flow dependability yielded similar observations results are not shown here for brevity as illustrated in fig 10 the overall annual exploitable potential is highly sensitive to changes in capacity factor c f and overall efficiency η for example a 25 increase in the value of capacity factor c f and overall efficiency η increased the overall exploitable energy by 20 57 and 20 16 respectively the influence of the value lcoe is straightforward for lower values the lcoe is relatively sensitive than its higher values for example if an lcoe of 0 05 us is considered reduced by 50 the available energy potential is reduced by 9 3 on the other hand for an lcoe of 0 15 us increased by 50 the available energy potential can increase to only 1 the sensitivity of hydropower potential for the changes in the economic life year of the power plants ls discount rate r and civil structure cost coefficient δ is moderate the increasing the economic life year of the power plants ls or decreasing discount rate r directly influences the magnitude of lcoe which is the basic criteria to decide the feasibility of the potential site therefore despite its less sensitivity to the overall potential the influence of the change in project year ls is relatively stronger at its lower value than its higher value from the base value similarly o m cost coefficient μ and the installation cost coefficient f have relatively low sensitivity furthermore fig 10 also indicated that the discount rate r o m cost coefficient μ and the installation cost coefficient f have relatively more impact this is mainly due to their high value despite their overall influence being limited 5 limitations of the study this study used the runoff dataset developed by ghiggi 22 for hydrological modelling it may be noted that as compared to previous data sources the developers have improved the accuracy of the dataset through careful calibration and validation at multiple sites still it is difficult to conclude that it can fully represent the actual ground conditions throughout the entire world hence it may overestimate in some places and underestimate in some other places the study evaluated the available potential at 30 75 and 95 flow dependability for 30 flow dependability we assumed all identified potential sites would use the design discharge equivalent to a discharge at 30 flow dependability it cannot always happen in reality unless the available water on each stream and river is stored thus the results associated with this dependability might have slightly exaggerated and cannot always happen a dem of 90 m 90 m resolution has been used for spatial and hydrological analysis and evaluation it should be noted that this resolution is slightly coarser to identify assess and evaluate the exact hydropower potential locations especially for small scale hydropower types future studies might improve the results when dem of extremely high resolutions and improved vertical accuracies are available at a global level this study did not consider the possibilities of developing storage type hydropower plants underground powerhouse developments and pumped storage hydropower schemes without the help of specially designed very sophisticated programming and computers having high level processors it is impossible to define the dam axis dam height reservoir capacity and area affected by the spread of reservoir water at each location in all rivers at a global scale in addition it is difficult to collect detailed data such as the cost of damages of storage type hydropower plant due to the submerging of private and government properties at a global scale furthermore storage schemes tend to have a relatively high impact on the environment than run off river type power plants which is vague to evaluate from a cost perspective nevertheless including all these possibilities would increase the available energy from the potential sites and thus increase the opportunity for new additional potential sites to be identified it should be noted that the approach in this study does not replace the traditional on site survey based site selection analysis and evaluations the detailed on site study on a specific potential site may bring many additional opportunities and invite technical mechanisms for further improvement to boost the available potential or it may also reject in combination with land ownership issues geological issues and the like however this study can be used as a guideline for policymakers researchers and other stakeholders to focus on the identified potential locations and regions with focus on developing more hydropower as a primary and cheap energy source for those areas 6 conclusion the growing demand for energy has been continuously increasing along with the population growth this encourages to the development of more sustainable energy production in an environmentally acceptable form to identify the potential hydropower sites globally and estimate the power production the proper selection of dem data and accurate hydrologic data have significant implications on the analysis this paper evaluates the available river runoff hydropower potential worldwide from theoretical technical economic and environmental feasibility perspectives compared to the previous literature the present study used the most recent data having relatively accurate and a high error reduced dem covering the entire globe in both space and time the study tries to handle the seasonality of river flows by assessing the hydroelectric potential of rivers at 30 75 and 95 flow dependability the methodology developed in this study is mainly to determine the head discharge rated power annual electricity production and cost of development and operation and maintenance for each potential site the theoretical potential sites extracted using a specified parameter have been successfully evaluated from the technical economic and environmental feasibility perspectives the study revealed that asia is the highest contributor to the world having more exploitable hydropower potential availability with an average contribution of 46 53 north and south america continents have the potential of producing an average of 38 47 of the global hydropower potential together africa accounts for an average of 11 4 contribution of which significant magnitude is still undeveloped while the remaining 3 6 would be from europe countries in oceania china russia canada brazil united states myanmar india peru pakistan democratic republic of congo colombia indonesia will have the highest contributions at a country level these countries have a significant annual runoff due to their highest annual average rainfall compared to the other countries in addition to this their rugged and mountainous topography favors them to be suitable for hydropower development the economic analysis shows that the lcoe for almost 80 6 of the technical potential energy is below 0 1 kwh this indicates that in most aspects hydropower development is environmentally suitable and still economically cheap and preferable the study has also shown that in most cases the lcoe is getting small as the power plant production capacity is getting larger this indicates that developing large scale and medium scale hydropower potential is preferable over small scale mini and micro hydropower potential as far as electricity production costs are concerned however micro mini and small hydro also have competent economic viability compared to other renewable energy sources besides the cases explained above differences in parameter considerations and assumptions cost estimation approaches variable flow dependability and other related factors caused variations between estimation results of this study bringing more additional information into the research compared to previous recent studies further the estimate of hydropower potential obtained from this study can be considered more reliable as it uses updated and recent global runoff data dem with relatively better resolution and accuracy and the inclusion of a previously excluded area overall this study provides the guidelines to the policymakers researchers and other stakeholders to focus on the identified potential locations and consider hydropower as a primary and cheap energy source for those areas therefore the proposed approach in this study could be valuable for long term potential based energy development planning for large areas and also can be used to identify the most suitable potential sites for further on site survey analysis and design

the study used 225 m by 225 m resolution dem the study used a 90 m resolution dem from hydrosheds this dem covered from 56 s to 60 n and didn t cover the entire world due to these data limitations the study ignores part of canada norway poland parts of russia etc a merit dem was used it is a recently 2018 developed error reduced 90 m resolution dem it covers the entire world 90 n 60 s it includes northern parts of the world that have not been included 19 runoff the study used runoff data from the global runoff data set the data is available for the years 1970 2000 the study used runoff data from hydsheds similarly this runoff dataset has also covered from 56 s to 60 n and the data is available for the years 1970 2000 this study used a recently 2019 processed reconstructed runoff dataset ghiggi et al 21 and used from the year 1965 2014 its accuracy is relatively improved both spatially and temporally the use of this dataset in this study overcomes the limitations of previous studies and helps to obtain the enhanced results of global hydropower potential methodology the study used the elevation difference between a 225 m raster cell for the minimum head difference of 1 m the study used a minimum of 25 km interval between each potential site this might lead to unnecessarily missing skipping of several potential site possibilities in between this study identified potential sites with 500 m intervals horizontally for the head of 1 m drop for technical and economic analysis objective was to find a minimum technical head of 20 m and above for the length of sites varying between 500 and 5000 m coverage theoretical potential the study analyses the hydropower potential with 225 m intervals this study has limited analysis regarding the theoretical potential a comprehensive analysis has been performed and reported in the paper with 30 75 and 95 flow dependability technical potential ignored they have included the technical potential assessment but for the interval of 25 km a comprehensive analysis has been performed and reported in the paper at the interval of 500m 5000 m economical potential ignored the study reported the economic analysis results and claimed that the american and norwegian tender documents and user manuals had been used for analysis and evaluations this paper presents a detailed step followed for conducting economic analysis with all relevant empirical and analytical formulae in particular statistics based new empirical formula was developed from electro mechanical and powerhouse cost data which were collected from some of the global power plants environmental issue ignored environmental impacts were considered environmental impacts were considered 
8658,assessing the possible locations and evaluating the spatial distribution of hydropower potentials at the global and regional scale is crucial for planning future energy development activities this study assesses run of river based hydropower potential and evaluates potential sites under technical economic and environmental constraints globally the study used the recent 1965 2014 global runoff dataset 0 5 x 0 5 resolution for design discharge computation and 90 m 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem covering 90 n 60 s for topographical analysis the design discharges qd calculated for 30 75 and 95 flow dependability were used in the assessment and evaluations further the economic feasibility of identified potential sites was evaluated by developing empirical relations derived from the observed cost of electromechanical equipment to corresponding head h and installed power p globally a theoretical hydropower potential of 25 48 peta watt hours per year pwh yr at 95 flow dependability to 184 17 pwh yr at 30 flow dependability was estimated the energy ranges from 7 06 pwh yr to 49 05 pwh yr are technically feasible for the design discharge calculated from 95 to 30 flow dependability respectively after excluding environmentally unsuitable and economically less competitive levelized cost of electricity lcoe us 0 1 kwh potential sites it was estimated that an exploitable hydropower potential of 5 42 pwh yr at 95 flow dependability to 39 56 pwh yr at 30 flow dependability would be available globally keywords global hydropower potential economic evaluations costing of powerplants cost of electromechanical equipment 1 introduction rapid urbanization the continuous evolution of mechanized farming and growing industrialization are continuously increasing the energy demand the government policymakers and power developing companies make constant efforts to produce enhance power production from various sources to meet the growing needs of energy worldwide globally a common consensus has been reached for developing environmental friendly energy sources mainly to mitigate the effects of global warming and consequent natural hazards after the 2015 paris climate conference most countries worldwide are committed to substantially reducing green house gasses ghg emissions 1 on the agreements of sustainable development goals signed in 2015 many countries have strategically initiated the efforts of considering renewable energy sources as a primary source among several forms of renewable energy hydropower can be considered as more affordable and clean energy 2 3 in 2011 the united nations secretary general launched a sustainable energy for all initiative to increase the share of renewable energy by 36 in the global energy mix by 2030 4 in addition to this countries like canada indonesia nepal and uganda use hydropower to support and accelerate social and economic progress and thus reduce poverty by providing adequate power to their community 2 in 2020 power generation from hydropower was the world s largest renewable energy source of electricity with multiple non power benefits 5 currently the hydropower generation at the global level has been estimated to be 4 370 twh yr which is 63 of the renewable energy production and nearly 16 of the total energy production 6 7 generating hydropower has been growing increasingly along with the technological advancement in various aspects such as enhancing conversion efficiency economic feasibility automating the operation optimizing several systems etc 8 10 besides the advancement in hydroelectric technology the encouraging remarks of developing hydropower is because of its relatively low operation and maintenance cost able to manage the peak power demand and almost zero carbon emission however subject to the availability of relatively a denser river network having suitable terrain which favors hydropower developments the technical configuration of possible hydropower plants can either be a storage type dam and reservoir based or a run of river type weir or barrage with no or small pondage overall the potential hydropower assessments require the information of water resource availability and feasible head for installing operating various hydromechanical equipment in theory it is assumed that all possible potential sites can able to produce hydropower energy however planning to exploit all potential locations may not be possible due to several restrictions e g technical legal economic environmental and social 11 13 furthermore the variability and inconsistency of available discharge and available head are major barriers in the planning and designing of hydropower plants over the past decades several hydroelectric potential assessments have been conducted at various scales including the local and regional and some are at the continental level 14 17 in addition some previous studies have also attempted to assess and evaluate the global scale hydropower potential 12 18 20 however the estimated values vary from each other due to inconsistencies in data quality parameters considered and assumptions in addition hydropower analysis by its nature is sensitive for changes in any parameters particularly for changes in head and discharge pokhrel et al 20 estimated the global theoretical hydropower potential using a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution runoff and elevation data from second global soil wetness project gswp 2 and hdrok1 respectively however the study used a coarse resolution dem which could affects the reliability of the available hydropower potential estimations and also the study did not evaluate the technical and exploitable potential sites the study conducted by hoes et al 18 used a monthly and annually averaged runoff dataset prepared with a 0 5 x 0 5 spatial resolution combining the climate driven water balance model using the climate data and the river discharge measurements for the year 1971 2000 their study used a dem with a relatively coarse resolution 225 m at the equator further in the evaluation identified potential sites have not included the economic and environmental feasibility analyses thus more detailed analyses of hydropower estimation require a longer span and more recent hydrological data along with fine resolution dem studies conducted by zhou et al 12 and gernaat et al 19 assessed the global hydropower potential including the technical and exploitable potentials their study estimates the available global technical potential of 26 pwh yr and 13 7 pwh yr and a global exploitable potential of 16 pwh yr and 8 77 pwh yr respectively however these studies assessed the availability of potential sites at different intervals 55 km 12 and 25 km 19 with 30 flow dependability in addition to this their studies used a dem map available from hydrosheds which has a spatial extent between 56 s and 60 n 18 19 21 therefore the hydropower potential of countries located outside the specified spatial extent for example norway finland sweden northern parts of canada has not been included despite the claim that has been to assess hydropower globally the comparison of data and methods used in this study and two of the most recent studies are presented in appendix a to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first one developed for estimating the global run of river hydropower potential using relatively an error reduced finest resolution 90 m at the equator dem covering the land areas between 90 n 60 s nearly the entire land surface of the earth has covered except in the glacier in addition to this the runoff dataset derived from a quite adequate time series span and recent 1965 2014 climatic data and streamflow has been used for analysis the study identified and analyzed the theoretical and technical potential sites with a minimum interval of 500 m it also developed a new cost estimation empirical relation derived from the observed cost of electromechanical equipment s to corresponding head h and installed power p for estimating the cost of electromechanical equipment of each potential site and used it for further economic analysis and evaluation the specific objectives of the paper are to i identify the potential sites for a run of river hydropower development at the global scale and ii evaluate potential sites from the theoretical technical economic and environmental perspectives 2 data used 2 1 runoff and streamflow data this paper used the monthly gridded runoff dataset obtained from the study of ghiggi et al 22 to generate design discharge at each river raster cell the developers reconstructed the global runoff dataset using precipitation and temperature data from an atmospheric reanalysis for the years 1902 2014 they have also used observational streamflow data to calibrate and validate the runoff dataset independently the gridded runoff dataset prepared with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 is available in netcdf format for public use 22 2 2 digital elevation model dem a multi error removed improved terrain dem merit dem of a spatial resolution with 3 arcsec 90 m at the equator was used to extract elevation at each point to determine the available head merit dem is the most comprehensive error removed global topographic dataset developed by removing tree height bias stripe noise absolute bias and speckle noise from the publicly available spaceborne dem sources srtm3 v2 1 and aw3d 30 m v1 21 23 in addition a merit hydro a flow direction dataset developed from merit dem was used the dataset was prepared by yamazaki et al 21 that covers land areas between 90 n 60 s i e it includes the entire land area of the globe except for the glacier regions 2 3 a world protected area dataset and urban polygons a buffering distance of 1000 m was used to exclude possible potential sites closer to the protected areas such as world heritage sites national parks and towns the dataset obtained from the united nations environment world conservation monitoring centre unep wcmc 24 and global rural urban mapping project version 1 grumpv1 25 were used for excluding potential sites that fall closer to existing protected areas and urban polygons respectively 2 4 other datasets similarly a buffering distance of 1000 m was used to exclude the possible potential sites that overlap or enormously closer to existing dams reservoirs and lakes the global dams and reservoir datasets available at socioeconomic data and applications centre sedac 26 were used for identifying previously constructed dams reservoirs and existing lakes the global powerplant database prepared by world resource institute 27 was used for identifying the location of existing hydropower plants and corresponding installed capacity furthermore the population of each country in 2019 was collected from world bank global data centre 28 and the forecasted population data for the year 2050 and 2100 was accessed from the population pyramid net 29 3 methodology 3 1 background one of the main activities in developing conventional hydropower plants is constructing a barrier dam or weir across the river and directing the river water to the powerhouse with controlled conveyances the potential and kinetic energy of water falling from a certain head is a major driving force utilized for striking and spinning turbines coupled with the generator in the power plant this paper determines the available discharge and head in the global river networks and evaluates the available power and energy by a minimum of 500 m intervals at each location the study also evaluates the feasibility of identified potential sites from economic and environmental perspectives the procedures listed below were followed in the entire process using gis tools 1 the river network was developed on a global scale by calculating the flow accumulation for a minimum threshold of 10 000 grid cells 81 km2 based on that the available head was extracted from the dem 2 the flow direction and flow accumulation algorithms were used for determining possible design discharge of the river network along with each cell by processing the global runoff dataset section 3 3 accordingly the potential hydropower assessments were performed combining the available head and discharge extracted by points generated along the river at a minimum of 500 m interval 3 economic feasibility analysis was performed for the identified technical potential sites after exclusion of sites that are overlapping on environmentally protected locations urban polygons reservoirs wetlands and existing hydropower plants 3 2 hydropower potential estimation and categorization the governing equations for determining available power p and energy e of a specific location of a river segment is expressed as 1 p η γ q d h 2 e c f p t where p is the power in kw η is the overall efficiency of the power plant and γ is the unit weight of water 9 81 kn m3 q d is the design discharge m3 s h is the available head m neglecting the energy losses along with the conveyance structure e is energy in kwh c f is an average

and 95 flow dependability separately and assessed the possible hydropower potential see section 3 3 the hydropower potential assessments are generally classified into theoretical technical and exploitable realizable potential 13 30 31 researchers have considered the realities of the study area and the nature of hydroelectric power plants in each of these categories to determine the maximum and minimum head discharge and intervals between successive power plants in this paper the details of each of these categorizations are described below 3 2 1 theoretical potential theoretical hydropower is the maximum gross potential that the river basin can produce without considering constraints 10 12 30 it represents the total energy potential of a given river considering only the available water in the catchment and its topography this study assessed the theoretical potential by neglecting the overall efficiency η and the capacity factor c f constraints based on the installed capacity the smallest hydropower plant type considered in this study is micro hydropower which commonly has a minimum installed capacity of 5 kw 32 the authors assumed that considering a minimum available discharge of 0 3 m3 s is safe to the environment and can provide enough potential energy to rotate the turbine with a minimum head of 1 m using equation 1 a combination of 1 m head 0 3 m3 s discharge and efficiency of 1 neglecting efficiency for theoretical potential analysis can produce a capacity of 3 kw which is assumed to represent the smallest micro hydropower plants locations in this study a minimum of 500 m allowable waterway length was used as an optimum interval to ensure the backwater effects of the downstream station to the tailrace of the upstream station pandey et al 16 and kusre et al 33 have used the same minimum horizontal distance as an optimum interval 3 2 2 technical potential due to technical financial and environmental constraints it is practically impossible to construct hydropower plants in all theoretically identified locations 13 17 34 at the catchment level the technical potential is usually smaller than the theoretical potential due to the constraints such as available firm flow available head the allowable distance between plants and powerhouses capacity factor and overall efficiencies of powerplant components due to these constraints a large portion of runoff cannot be available for energy development technically hydropower plants should have adequate waterway length head and discharge for optimal functioning it can be noted from recent studies that the waterway length varies between a series of power plants or the headwork and the powerhouse and is preferred to be a minimum of 500 m for the technical feasibility analyses 13 16 33 similarly a maximum waterway length can vary between 3000 m and 10000 m 13 16 33 35 to prevent the interference of one power plant from the other as well as to reduce the cost of canal and penstocks in this study potential sites having a minimum of 20 m head along with a minimum waterway length of 500 m and a maximum of 5000 m were filtered out and analyzed further it should also be noted that these thresholds are used for analyzing and comparing each potential site at a global scale however these figures may increase or decrease when including financial optimizations and considering other on site challenges and opportunities 3 2 3 exploitable realizable potential the exploitable potential is the technical potential that can realistically be developed considering the economic and environmental constraints 12 36 due to environmental concerns developing potential sites overlapping in the protected areas urban areas densely populated residents and existing dams and reservoirs are unacceptable in addition to this potential sites identified having a relatively higher net present cost of generation for energy generated over the project s lifetime are filtered and excluded see section 3 4 table 1 presents the technical parameters assumed environmental constraints and corresponding values used in this study 3 3 spatial data analysis and data extractions geospatial analysis was carried out to identify the suitable locations for power plant development and calculate the available potential of each stream by applying weibull s method 37 38 the runoff with 30 75 and 95 flow dependability was extracted for each cell 0 5 0 5 resolution from the monthly scale runoff dataset 22 a flow accumulation calculation was carried out by flow accumulation algorithm using a weight raster generated from runoff raster and flow direction raster to accumulate the discharges in raster cells into the nearest streams finally streams securing the discharge of 0 3 m3 s and above were extracted by assuming that it ensures a minimum adequate flow for the power units points with 500 m intervals were generated along a stream network to extract elevations from the dem pixel see section 3 2 1 the available head h in each of the points generated on the stream network was determined from the extracted elevation by considering the elevation difference between two consecutive neighboring points for theoretical potential assessment a waterway length of 500 m and a minimum head h of 1 m were used section 3 2 1 finally locations having a head h of 20 m and above 16 with a minimum waterway length of 500 m and a maximum of 5000 m searching once in 500 m interval were filtered and extracted for technical potential assessment fig 1 illustrates the step by step methodology used to identify and evaluate the theoretical technical and exploitable power potential 3 4 economic analysis and evaluation of exploitable potential the investment operation and maintenance costs were calculated for each technically and environmentally feasible potential site the levelized cost of electricity lcoe evaluation method was used to set up the threshold to filter economically feasible potential sites lcoe is the ratio of the sum of costs of the power plant and the sum of electrical energy over the project s lifetime 4 l c o e i cost t 1 l s o m cost 1 g t 1 f t 1 r t t 1 l s e t 1 r t where i cost is the initial investment cost om cost is the operation and maintenance cost in a year t f t is the fuel expenditure neglected for this study r is the discount rate g is the expected annual escalation rate of o m cost ls is the economic life year of the project and e t is the available energy in kwh in t year due to the limited available information of discount rate r across the world we referred irena report of the year 2019 for calculating the lcoe of renewable hydropower power generation costs the study used an average discount rate r of 7 5 for china and organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries and an average discount rate r 10 for other countries in the world 39 for this study an average discount rate of 8 and an annual o m cost escalation rate of 2 were used the economic life year of the power plants ls was assumed to be 30 years zhou et al 11 and gernaat et al 18 used a cost of 0 09us kwh and 0 1us kwh respectively as a threshold to filter economically viable potential sites it was found from the irena 2019 reports that the global weighted average lcoe of hydropower plants installed each year for the last decade 2010 2019 is varied between 0 037us kwh to 0 055us kwh 39 in addition the lcoe for other renewable energy sources concentrating solar systems and wind farms continuously declined to 0 068us kwh and below due to continuous technological improvements on the efficiency of their equipment and capacity factors 39 40 therefore this study assumed that potential sites with lcoe 0 1us kwh will not be further competitive and economically viable the study did not consider the cost escalations due to construction delays 3 5 costing of hydropower projects the overall cost of the hydropower plant includes the initial investment and the operation and maintenance cost previous studies conducted including many investigations and noted the relationships of hydropower installation investment costs of construction of the power plant and operation and maintenance costs for operating the power plant after construction 10 11 35 the cost of initial investment includes the direct and indirect costs of the project civil work costs hydraulic equipment costs electromechanical equipment costs transmission costs environmental effect mitigation costs compensation costs and preparations are considered as the direct cost of the power plant on the other hand administration and engineering costs costs for contingency and cost of annual or monthly interests during construction are considered as indirect costs for a proposed project therefore the total cost of the power plant t cost can be expressed as follows 5 t cost i cost o m cost where i cost and om cost are the initial investment costs and operation and maintenance costs of the power plant respectively the detail of each of these parameters is presented in the following sections 3 5 1 the cost of initial investment i cost several researchers attempted to develop mathematical correlations between the installed capacity head and cost of the development using statistical data collected from various hydropower plants located in the different study areas 11 41 43 the cost of initial investment i cost can be divided into the cost of the civil structure electromechanical equipment and ancillary installations although there is no clear formula available to express the cost of the civil structure and ancillary installations the review of kaldellis et al 11 suggested that it is possible to express the cost of the civil structure and ancillary installations as a function of the cost of electromechanical equipment and installations em cost by simplifying kaldellis et al 11 expressions the following equation eqn 6 was derived 6 i cost e m cost δ 1 1 f where f is the installation cost coefficient electromechanical interconnection development cost access tracks the value of f is a fraction ranges between 5 10 11 δ is civil structure cost coefficient and that can be expressed as a function of the cost of electromechanical equipment em cost the value of δ varies between 0 8 and 2 11 the higher value is taken when constructing a dam and long water conveyance structures including the penstock analysis reported in yildiz 43 irena 44 and carlsson 45 also support these assumptions previous studies express the cost of electromechanical equipment as a function of the available head h and power p 42 43 46 47 the expression in equation 7 is adopted from ogayar and vidal 46 7 e m cost a h b p c us the value of coefficients a b and c are determined by correlating the cost of electromechanical equipment as a function of the available head h and rated power p using regression analysis methods the observed statistical data collected by alvarado 48 for 81 selected hydropower projects in north america europe south america asia and africa fig 2 and archived in international water power dam construction organization was used in this study these data provide a clear picture of the cost of electromechanical equipment s with their corresponding available power p mw and help to compare and understand the variation in the cost the cost includes turbines governors valves cooling and drainage water systems cranes workshops generators transformers earthing systems control equipment telecommunications systems and auxiliary systems 48 equation 8 below is developed by applying logarithms and substituting the observed data of the cost em cost power p and head h and carrying out multiple linear regression between the two independent variables logp and logh 8 log e m cost 0 3568 0 13 log h 0 78 log p using the coefficients of equation 8 obtained from regression analysis the coefficients a b and c in equation 9 can be expressed as a e0 3568 b 0 13 and c 0 78 9 e m cos t m i l l i o n u s 1 488 h 0 13 p m w 0 78 us 2008 as shown in fig 3 below the simulation results using equation 9 and the observed electromechanical cost have a very good agreement we could not find the cumulative price increase from 2008 to 2021 at a global level in this study the average cumulative price increase of the united states from 2008 to 2021 increased by 23 03 49 was used to consider the expected escalation of the cost of electromechanical equipment and installations of power plants thus slightly modifying equation 9 and combining it with equation 6 the average investment cost icost of possible potential sites is approximated as follows 10 i cost m i l l i o n u s 1 83024 h 0 13 p m w 0 78 1 δ 1 f us 2021 3 5 2 operation and maintenance cost omcost after successful construction the power plant is expected to provide an uninterrupted power supply operations and maintenance facilities should always be kept in place while the project is in operation these costs are strongly dependent on the capacity of the power plant and the cost of investment thus 11 o m cost μ i cost μ is the operation and maintenance cost coefficient observed data based reports from irena 44 and iha 50 indicated the power plant s annual operation and maintenance cost ranges between 1 and 4 of the investment cost for this study it is assumed that 3 of the total investment cost will be used for annual operation and maintenance 4 results and discussion 4 1 general overview of global hydropower potential the study analyzed and evaluated the run of river hydropower potential to identify the possible locations from the worldwide spatial distributions it evaluated the capacity of potential hydropower plants considering the technical environmental and economic constraints the available theoretical technical and exploitable potential were assessed and evaluated for different flow dependability levels a 30 and 95 flow dependability were used to understand and assess the available potential during rainy and dry seasons additionally the 75 flow dependability was used to assess and evaluate the available potentials in intermediate flow conditions it should be noted that the estimations using a 30 flow dependability assume that the design discharge is available only during the first two or three months of the rainy season and does not continue throughout the year therefore the results associated with the 30 flow dependability might be slightly exaggerated on the other hand the 95 flow dependability result indicates the firm hydropower potential available throughout the year table 2 summarizes available installed capacity p in tw and average annual energy e in pwh yr in three dependability levels the installed capacity of theoretical hydropower potential ranges from 2 9 tw to 21 01 tw at 95 and 30 flow dependability respectively the result also shows that the corresponding available annual energy can be 25 48 pwh yr at 95 to 184 17 pwh yr at 30 dependability for the same dependability ranges the annual energy can be produced from technical potential sites ranges from 7 06 pw yr to 49 05 pw yr respectively the annual energy from the exploitable hydropower potential sites is estimated to be between 5 42 pwh yr to 39 56 pwh yr the theoretical potential power and energy is often larger than the technical potential following the theoretical potential technical potential has a larger magnitude than exploitable potential for example for a 30 flow dependability the study identifies the installed capacity of the overall theoretical potential of 21 01 tw the technical potential of 11 19 tw and the exploitable potential of 9 03 tw respectively this variation is associated with the parameters considered during evaluations see section 3 2 table 1 the effects of overall efficiencies η of power plant components and the capacity factor c f were considered to analyze the technical and exploitable potential but not for theoretical potential the exploitable potential was derived from the technical potential by excluding sites that are not economically and environmentally feasible for a 95 flow dependability from the 7 06 pwh yr available technical capacity 76 87 5 42 pwh yr is exploitable 1 4 pwh yr 19 83 of the technical potential has been excluded because of overlap or closer to the protected areas urban and waterbody the remaining 3 26 0 23 pwh yr with an lcoe above 0 1us kwh has been excluded from the exploitable potential category by assuming that it will not be competitive compared to several cost competitive energy generating options available today see section 3 4 studies have already been performed to estimate the global hydropower potential in the past 12 18 20 overall the hydropower potential estimated from this study is slightly more than the previous studies several factors might have caused the difference in the estimation of hydropower potentials such as differences in quality and spatial coverage of input data inconsistencies in definitions variations in parameter consideration and key assumptions on several factors for example pokhrel et al 20 and hoes et al 18 used an average of monthly and annual discharges available in a grid cell as a design discharge which is in general slightly smaller in magnitude than the flow at 30 flow dependability in addition to this pokhrel et al 19 used a coarse resolution 0 5 0 5 dem for head determination which might have ignored multiple potential sites within the grid and thus led to underestimating the hydropower potential compared to the study conducted by zhou et al 12 the present study for the 30 flow dependability slightly overestimates and at 75 flow dependability it has underestimated the overall potential their study estimates the theoretical technical and exploitable hydropower potential as 128 pwh yr 26 pwh yr and 16 pwh yr respectively having 0 5 0 5 resolution 12 the study showed that the theoretical hydropower potential had been calculated after extracting the available head by subtracting the elevation of the targeted grid from the elevation of the lowest grid in each country 12 moreover it is not very clear how the effect of including mountains and depressions the meandering nature of rivers and the availability of multiple rivers with different endings in many of the countries were handled on the other hand gernaat et al 19 analyze the technical and exploitable global hydropower potential at every 25 km interval and estimated 13 27 pwh yr and 8 77 pwh yr respectively since their study used a much longer interval that could ignore potential hydropower site possibilities in between the estimated results are lower than the estimations reported in this study furthermore these two studies used the dem from hydrosheds a spatial extent between 56 s and 60 n which has not included a significant portion globally the hydropower potential at 30 flow dependability is presented in table 3 and the results are compared with previous studies 4 2 available potential sites based on possible installed capacity there is no standardized international consensus for classifying potential hydropower sites based on their installed capacity however many countries and regions have their own classification standards to classify hydropower potentials based on installed capacity in this study the indian classification standard has been used to limit the range of the micro mini small medium and large scale for the analysis table 4 it is obvious that medium and large scale hydropower potential sites would share larger contributions of power generation for example with 30 flow dependability micro mini and small hydropower potential sites can produce 7 33 pwh yr which is 14 94 of the total technical potential about 2 02 of the total potential would be produced from potential sites that fall under the medium hydropower plant category the remaining 74 78 are mainly from the power plant of large scale hydropower however this cannot always happen throughout the year due to the seasonality of rain and runoff in fact most potential sites with a low flow during 30 dependability might have no sufficient flow at 75 and 95 flow dependability on the other hand for 95 flow dependability the average annual energy that micro mini and small hydropower potential sites can produce is about 2 24 pwh yr 31 7 of the total potential in addition to this the remaining 4 82 pwh yr can be produced possibly from medium and large hydropower potential sites table 4 despite the fact that a reasonable number of mini and micro hydropower potential sites are available from the list of technically viable sites the lcoe for most of these potential sites is greater than 0 1us kw the economic analysis excluded the majority of the possible mini and micro hydropower power plants because of their relatively higher lcoe it revealed that the small scale and mini hydropower plants might have relatively higher lcoe than the large and medium scale hydropower plants in addition to this a previous study by zhou et al 12 and the reports collected from actual small scale hydropower development experiences by irena 39 44 also support these findings furthermore the cost function formula is a function of the available head h and power production p in mw therefore an increase in head and reduction of design discharge might lead to slightly exaggerated cost estimation resulting in a slightly exaggerated lcoe table 4 shows that with 30 flow dependability the exploitable mini micro and small hydropower potential is almost 14 23 of the total annual potential and 75 58 is from possible large scale potential sites however this will not happen throughout the year in reality unless a storage structure that able to tap the runoff is available with a 95 flow dependability firm flow the exploitable mini micro and small hydropower potential is almost 29 9 of the total annual potential on the same dependability additionally 21 6 can be produced from locations suitable for a medium hydropower plant development and the remaining 48 52 from possible large scale power plant potential sites 4 3 spatial distribution of potential sites and global possibilities 4 3 1 asia the theoretical technical and exploitable hydropower potential availabilities vary from place to place at the continental and regional levels of all the continents asia the largest continent covers the greatest contribution in all categories from the global hydropower potential an overall average of 44 3 of the potential is available in asia 46 5 of the global exploitable hydropower potential is available in the region though the actual figures vary china russia myanmar and india account for approximately 87 of the total exploitable potential identified in asia and nearly 32 of the world s potential fig 4 fig 7 fig 8 despite the fact that several catchments have significant potential most of the available potential sites in india and china are located around the himalayan mountainous regions the availability of a considerable amount of rainfall significant contribution from snowmelt and the denser and steeper nature of stream networks made it suitable for hydropower development similarly the mountainous topography and higher annual rainfall availability in indonesia nepal and the northern part of pakistan help the countries contribute an average of 6 75 of the global hydropower potential figs 6 and 7 generally it is found that more than 85 of the technical potential in asia is exploitable 4 3 2 south america south america is the second largest contributor for technical and exploitable hydropower potential at a continent level with an average contribution of 21 15 and 25 8 respectively the higher annual rainfall distribution and rugged topography in the northwest to the east directions of the continent help peru brazil venezuela and colombia as the higher potential countries and a significant source of hydropower potential at a content level and at global figs 4 figs 7 and 8 similar to the asian continent 81 4 of the technical potential in south america is exploitable the remaining 18 6 is under the category of protected and or already developed 4 3 3 north and central america hydropower potential in canada and the united states dominates the continent s available potential and its global contribution from the 14 2 contribution estimated by this study almost 12 6 is from canada and united states the remaining 1 6 is from guatemala mexico and other north and central american countries as shown in fig 6 the northwestern mountainous region in the content is highly suitable for hydropower development 4 3 4 africa it is estimated that an average of 18 1 of the world s energy theoretical potential is available in africa the annual exploitable hydropower potential in the continent is estimated to be 640 twh yr at 95 flow dependability and 4220 twh yr at 30 flow dependability fig 4 about 96 5 of the potential sites are in sub saharan countries due to the high availability and distribution of rainfall in addition to stream density and networks fig 6 a b countries located in the congo volta niger and nile river basins have substantial hydropower potential due to higher rainfall high river network density and rugged and mountainous topography for example at 30 flow dependability congo the democratic republic of congo ethiopia angola and nigeria contribute about 56 3 of the available potential in the continent on the other hand northern africa somalia from the east and namibia from the south have minimal less than 2 3 contributions to the continental potential due to their aridity and topographically flat nature 4 3 5 europe in this study the contribution of europe to the global theoretical hydropower potential is estimated to be 7 3 on the other hand the technical and exploitable hydropower potential for the continent is estimated to be an average of 2 5 of the global hydropower potential the results also showed a significant variation between the technical and exploitable hydropower potential in europe compared to the other continents fig 4b for example at a 95 flow dependability the technical and exploitable potential is 276 07 twh yr and 110 24 twh yr respectively the available exploitable potential is even below half of the technical potential in sweden france spain germany and some other countries fig 7 and fig 8 as shown in fig 5 many parts of the continent are covered with protected areas towns previously developed storage reservoirs and previously developed hydropower plants therefore it can be noted that european countries are leading in developing most of the exploitable hydropower potential compared to others 4 3 6 oceania oceania contributes an average of 2 4 to the global hydropower potential the majority of the available potential in the region is located in papua new guinea and new zealand similar to china india and countries in south america the availability of higher average annual rainfall and their mountainous topographic situation made them suitable for hydropower development on the other hand australia the biggest landmass in the region has a smaller contribution this is because almost 80 of the area receives an annual average rainfall of less than 600 mm 51 in addition to this the majority of the area is sandy and gentle in topography 52 4 4 evaluations based on per capita availability the per capita availability of hydropower potential is a useful indicator to understand the abilities of countries for enhancing sustainable electricity generation especially from hydropower considering the current and future scenarios further this information help compares different sources of energy available inside their territory based on the population of 2019 2050 and 2100 we divide the sum of available exploitable hydropower potential in the country s boundary by the population of the country as shown in fig 9a b congo bhutan french new guinea papua new guinea guyana suriname iceland peru canada and bolivia are leading in the top list mainly because of the ratio of available energy to the current and future expected population is relatively higher except for the countries like canada congo and peru the potential contribution of these top leading countries to global and regional hydropower has not been significant however the excessive exploitable potential is available to meet their current and future demand from hydropower only using data sourced from our world in data 53 the average annual per capita electricity consumption of a typical household in 2019 in iceland is 56 8 mwh p yr and 24 mwh p yr in norway which is the biggest consumptions in the world for the same year the average annual per capita consumption in the united states and china is 12 mwh p yr 5 1 mwh p yr respectively in the year 2019 the average global annual per capita electricity consumption was 3 8 mwh yr using these actual consumptions as a base scenario at 30 flow dependability eight countries can meet the per capita consumption equivalent to the current per capita consumption in iceland using their hydropower potential alone similarly 16 countries can meet the current per capita consumption in norway and 57 countries can meet the current global average consumption for the current population using their exploitable hydropower potential alone available within their boundary furthermore at 95 flow dependability three countries can meet the average demand equivalent to an american citizen s current average per capita consumption 10 countries can meet the current chinese average per capita consumption and 13 countries can meet the average global per capita consumption it is very evident from the figures fig 9a b that the per capita hydropower potential availability in 2019 is expected to decrease in 2050 and 2100 due to population growth however variation in the population growth rate between countries can create variations in the decline rate of per capita availability for example in iceland canada guyana bhutan and suriname the per capita availability of energy in 2050 and 2100 is expected to be nearly equal to the per capita availability in 2019 because of their projected lower population growth rate on the other hand the per capita availability of countries like congo french guiana gabon namibia would significantly reduce in 2050 and 2100 due to expected rapid population growth 4 5 sensitivity analysis of parameters the influence of the parameters used in the economic analyses on the overall exploitable hydropower potential has been assessed through sensitivity analysis eight parameters have been selected and the change in the value of each of the parameters on the overall results of exploitable hydropower potential has been evaluated fig 10 a maximum of approximately 75 relative change by magnitude has been chosen on each parameter by keeping others constant the relative change in installation cost coefficient f civil structure cost coefficient δ and o m cost coefficient μ were assessed within the selected range of deviation in the parameters i e varied from 10 25 50 and 75 and compared to the base values i e no change in the parameters the relative change in the overall efficiency η was allowed to vary between 0 5 and 0 95 12 similarly the capacity factor c f of the power plant is allowed to vary between 23 and 95 mainly dependent on the specific plant or for which service the power plant is used i e baseload or peak load 54 however the global weighted average capacity factor of power plants constructed from 2010 to 2019 vary between 40 and 60 as presented in the reports of irena 2019 38 a base value of an average capacity factor of 50 has been used for this study the sensitivity analysis was conducted on the 30 flow dependability potential sites however it was noticed that 75 and 95 flow dependability yielded similar observations results are not shown here for brevity as illustrated in fig 10 the overall annual exploitable potential is highly sensitive to changes in capacity factor c f and overall efficiency η for example a 25 increase in the value of capacity factor c f and overall efficiency η increased the overall exploitable energy by 20 57 and 20 16 respectively the influence of the value lcoe is straightforward for lower values the lcoe is relatively sensitive than its higher values for example if an lcoe of 0 05 us is considered reduced by 50 the available energy potential is reduced by 9 3 on the other hand for an lcoe of 0 15 us increased by 50 the available energy potential can increase to only 1 the sensitivity of hydropower potential for the changes in the economic life year of the power plants ls discount rate r and civil structure cost coefficient δ is moderate the increasing the economic life year of the power plants ls or decreasing discount rate r directly influences the magnitude of lcoe which is the basic criteria to decide the feasibility of the potential site therefore despite its less sensitivity to the overall potential the influence of the change in project year ls is relatively stronger at its lower value than its higher value from the base value similarly o m cost coefficient μ and the installation cost coefficient f have relatively low sensitivity furthermore fig 10 also indicated that the discount rate r o m cost coefficient μ and the installation cost coefficient f have relatively more impact this is mainly due to their high value despite their overall influence being limited 5 limitations of the study this study used the runoff dataset developed by ghiggi 22 for hydrological modelling it may be noted that as compared to previous data sources the developers have improved the accuracy of the dataset through careful calibration and validation at multiple sites still it is difficult to conclude that it can fully represent the actual ground conditions throughout the entire world hence it may overestimate in some places and underestimate in some other places the study evaluated the available potential at 30 75 and 95 flow dependability for 30 flow dependability we assumed all identified potential sites would use the design discharge equivalent to a discharge at 30 flow dependability it cannot always happen in reality unless the available water on each stream and river is stored thus the results associated with this dependability might have slightly exaggerated and cannot always happen a dem of 90 m 90 m resolution has been used for spatial and hydrological analysis and evaluation it should be noted that this resolution is slightly coarser to identify assess and evaluate the exact hydropower potential locations especially for small scale hydropower types future studies might improve the results when dem of extremely high resolutions and improved vertical accuracies are available at a global level this study did not consider the possibilities of developing storage type hydropower plants underground powerhouse developments and pumped storage hydropower schemes without the help of specially designed very sophisticated programming and computers having high level processors it is impossible to define the dam axis dam height reservoir capacity and area affected by the spread of reservoir water at each location in all rivers at a global scale in addition it is difficult to collect detailed data such as the cost of damages of storage type hydropower plant due to the submerging of private and government properties at a global scale furthermore storage schemes tend to have a relatively high impact on the environment than run off river type power plants which is vague to evaluate from a cost perspective nevertheless including all these possibilities would increase the available energy from the potential sites and thus increase the opportunity for new additional potential sites to be identified it should be noted that the approach in this study does not replace the traditional on site survey based site selection analysis and evaluations the detailed on site study on a specific potential site may bring many additional opportunities and invite technical mechanisms for further improvement to boost the available potential or it may also reject in combination with land ownership issues geological issues and the like however this study can be used as a guideline for policymakers researchers and other stakeholders to focus on the identified potential locations and regions with focus on developing more hydropower as a primary and cheap energy source for those areas 6 conclusion the growing demand for energy has been continuously increasing along with the population growth this encourages to the development of more sustainable energy production in an environmentally acceptable form to identify the potential hydropower sites globally and estimate the power production the proper selection of dem data and accurate hydrologic data have significant implications on the analysis this paper evaluates the available river runoff hydropower potential worldwide from theoretical technical economic and environmental feasibility perspectives compared to the previous literature the present study used the most recent data having relatively accurate and a high error reduced dem covering the entire globe in both space and time the study tries to handle the seasonality of river flows by assessing the hydroelectric potential of rivers at 30 75 and 95 flow dependability the methodology developed in this study is mainly to determine the head discharge rated power annual electricity production and cost of development and operation and maintenance for each potential site the theoretical potential sites extracted using a specified parameter have been successfully evaluated from the technical economic and environmental feasibility perspectives the study revealed that asia is the highest contributor to the world having more exploitable hydropower potential availability with an average contribution of 46 53 north and south america continents have the potential of producing an average of 38 47 of the global hydropower potential together africa accounts for an average of 11 4 contribution of which significant magnitude is still undeveloped while the remaining 3 6 would be from europe countries in oceania china russia canada brazil united states myanmar india peru pakistan democratic republic of congo colombia indonesia will have the highest contributions at a country level these countries have a significant annual runoff due to their highest annual average rainfall compared to the other countries in addition to this their rugged and mountainous topography favors them to be suitable for hydropower development the economic analysis shows that the lcoe for almost 80 6 of the technical potential energy is below 0 1 kwh this indicates that in most aspects hydropower development is environmentally suitable and still economically cheap and preferable the study has also shown that in most cases the lcoe is getting small as the power plant production capacity is getting larger this indicates that developing large scale and medium scale hydropower potential is preferable over small scale mini and micro hydropower potential as far as electricity production costs are concerned however micro mini and small hydro also have competent economic viability compared to other renewable energy sources besides the cases explained above differences in parameter considerations and assumptions cost estimation approaches variable flow dependability and other related factors caused variations between estimation results of this study bringing more additional information into the research compared to previous recent studies further the estimate of hydropower potential obtained from this study can be considered more reliable as it uses updated and recent global runoff data dem with relatively better resolution and accuracy and the inclusion of a previously excluded area overall this study provides the guidelines to the policymakers researchers and other stakeholders to focus on the identified potential locations and consider hydropower as a primary and cheap energy source for those areas therefore the proposed approach in this study could be valuable for long term potential based energy development planning for large areas and also can be used to identify the most suitable potential sites for further on site survey analysis and design

and helps to obtain the enhanced results of global hydropower potential methodology the study used the elevation difference between a 225 m raster cell for the minimum head difference of 1 m the study used a minimum of 25 km interval between each potential site this might lead to unnecessarily missing skipping of several potential site possibilities in between this study identified potential sites with 500 m intervals horizontally for the head of 1 m drop for technical and economic analysis objective was to find a minimum technical head of 20 m and above for the length of sites varying between 500 and 5000 m coverage theoretical potential the study analyses the hydropower potential with 225 m intervals this study has limited analysis regarding the theoretical potential a comprehensive

8659,human demand for adequate water resources and supplies has been and will continue to be a fundamental issue in the 21st century due to rapid population growth growing economies and globalization and increasing water pollution among others water withdrawals in regions which are already encountering scarcity will impose intensifying pressure on water resources locally and globally threatening the achievement of long term sustainable development targets decoupling has increasingly been recognized and incorporated in policy making as a way to reconcile limitless economic growth with environmental pressures filling evident literature gaps the current state and projected future decoupling factors of water withdrawals in relation to gdp are assessed through decoupling and regression analyzes for 155 countries and 12 potential socioeconomic development pathway scenarios findings suggest that average levels of water withdrawal decoupling are moderate in 2025 but will increase throughout the century in all countries by 2075 average water withdrawal decoupling becomes common and widespread with high decoupling factors across the world yet some countries and regions will continue to lag behind in this development gdp growth is the most significant driver of water withdrawals climate and regional differences among countries are major influential factors on decoupling outcomes more so than current country level income group classification altogether these results are of high significance to water resource managers and policy actors offering a chance to act proactively to change the course on global water resource and country specific development in this way decoupling provides a pathway to a more water wise world keywords water withdrawal growth decoupling global regions future scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways 1 introduction meeting the continuously increasing and unsustainable demand for water across the planet has been and will continue to be one of the major challenges facing humanity in the 21st century jaeger et al 1 jarvis 2 garrick and hahn 3 jaeger et al 1 jarvis 2 and garrick and hahn 3 define water scarcity as the marginal value of a unit of water highlighting its high variability across space and time while distinguishing it from water deficit although water scarcity has long been an issue 4 5 discussions on global water resources only became a central topic in international development and environmental policy with meetings like the first world water forum in 1997 and the world summit on sustainable development in 2002 6 however it was not until 2010 that the united nations general assembly unga explicitly recognized the human right to water calling it indispensable for the realization of all human rights and a dignified life 7 8 as a result access to safe and sufficient water emerged at the core of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development 9 therein it was acknowledged that apart from being a basic human necessity water availability as well as management plays a key role in sustainable development and the overall achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs due to its strong linkages with the other aspired and ambitious targets 9 thus the successful implementation of the 2030 sdg agenda hinges upon meeting sdg6 achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable water by 2030 10 despite the importance of water and the inter linkages to every desirable societal goal being understood the trends in water withdrawal and issues surrounding the topic of water are pointing the wrong way following an in depth review of sdg6 the high level political forum concluded that the world is not on track to achieve sdg6 by 2030 11 12 this statement comes as no surprise when looking at the historical development of water withdrawal which represents the total volume of water being removed from a water source a portion of which may be returned to said source and reused according to wada et al 13 during the last 100 years global water withdrawals increased six fold with no downward curve in sight yao et al 14 cite that this rise in water withdrawal came at twice the rate of population growth naturally water shortages became more of a problem over the past century 4 today the distribution of freshwater is highly uneven 15 with many regions being considered water scarce according to estimates water shortages or water stress are causing physical water scarcity for approximately one third of the planet s population 4 15 17 in fact it is predicted that most countries will experience water shortage and scarcity problems by the year 2025 18 20 several factors are at the root of these forecasts climate change has many detrimental effects on water availability 21 including the loss of significant freshwater reservoirs 20 rising population and living standards as well as increased food production are putting growing pressures on water resources 22 24 concerns about water pollution from agriculture and industry are mounting 25 and rapid urbanization only amplifies water demand and per capita shortages 26 27 counteracting factors to these negative impacts are the saturation of water need improved technologies or increased rainfall in many areas yet the overall downward trend will continue in summary the maximum global potential for the withdrawal of freshwater is approaching fast as the challenge of sustainable water use becomes continually more difficult 5 22 28 in this regard with water scarcity increasing and the craving for adequate water supplies inching closer to total water availability in various regions each water drop becomes increasingly valuable 13 29 30 hence the need for sustainable efficient and equitable water management is more urgent than ever to avert the impending crisis scholars have argued for shifting the focus away economic growth 31 38 on this subject increasing emphasis on the notion of sustainable development suggesting that economic growth can be reconciled with planetary boundaries 39 gave rise to the decoupling concept in short the term decoupling refers to breaking the link between environmental bads and economic goods 40 p 4 decoupling theorizes that the demand for resources like water can be curbed while economic and population growth continues 41 if gdp grows absolute decoupling happens when the growth rate of the environmental indicator such as water withdrawal stabilizes or decreases 40 alternatively relative decoupling suggests that said rate is less than gdp growth 40 ward et al 33 calls the argument of decoupling environmental impacts from economic growth appealing because it would justify gdp growth as a sustainable societal goal in this light decoupling became one of the major objectives of the organization for economic cooperation and development s oecd environmental strategy for the early 21st century 40 and has since been incorporated as a viable policy target in matters such as the sdgs 33 accordingly many scholars consider decoupling of gdp from the use of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions ghgs a prerequisite and logical necessity if sustainability targets are to be achieved 35 39 even though the importance of water and the worsening situation surrounding the vital resource is clear no comprehensive connection between the notion of decoupling and water withdrawal exists at the global level the present study addresses this apparent literature gap by performing a decoupling analysis of water withdrawals from 1995 to 2075 for 155 countries the motivations for this study are fourfold first there is a broad research base on the topic of water including analysis of past present and future water withdrawals however decoupling appears to be a missing piece in this literature as few studies specifically address decoupling of water withdrawals from gdp studies that do cover water decoupling tend to focus on the past or present whereas this research offers a look into the future second many water related studies have a narrow or regional scope however given the increasing importance of global drivers including climate change urbanization globalization and population growth assessing the issue from a global country level standpoint is essential 6 39 42 42 third whether climate change or economic and population growth are the most influential factors driving future water stress is a contested topic in this field similarly fourth there is ongoing debate whether or not the inverted u relationship between resources and gdp growth hypothesized by the environmental kuznets curve ekc is evident for water withdrawals 43 45 this study attempts to shed further light on these two discussions while comparing the impact of two different climate models and three shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios 46 further evidence may result due to the fact that this analysis looks beyond 2050 until 2075 unlike most studies with the established importance and motivation this study presents expected future decoupling trends for country level water withdrawals and shows how decoupling differs across geographical location climate conditions and income group classifications the objective of this paper is to provide a quantitative analysis that fills evident holes in the literature on the future world water situation this estimation is of high interest to water resource managers policymakers stakeholders in all industries and societies across the globe 47 49 it offers a chance to plan ahead for the forthcoming global water crisis and thereby try to avert the worst case scenario namely projecting these trajectories at the global country scale could be used to identify patterns of change serve as a foundation for addressing future challenges and highlight similarities and differences of water problems shared across the world 5 results suggest that water withdrawal decoupling is occurring and predicted to intensify throughout the course of the 21st century while moderate decoupling levels are achieved by 2025 on average these reach a higher average of above 0 67 1 highest by 2055 in 2075 average decoupling factors df lie above 0 77 although the trend points toward a decoupling increase in the latter half of the century countries like bosnia china and cambodia achieve high water withdrawal dfs as early as 2025 while some nations el salvador jamaica gambia etc lag behind in this development even in the long run although higher income countries are among the better performing countries in the short term lower income nations tend to catch up until 2075 on average south asian countries are predicted to have the highest rates of water withdrawal decoupling whereas latin america and caribbean as well as sub saharan africa states will tend to struggle on average in line the tropical climate zone will experience lower water withdrawal decoupling than others geographical location and climate conditions appear as more influential factors than income group classification when it comes to driving water withdrawal decoupling gdp growth is more important than current clustering of countries as low or high income for example presented findings yield little evidence that an inverted u ekc relationship exists for country level water withdrawals overall the results point to where policymakers and other stakeholders may search for best practice cases while also shedding light on which countries or regions need the most assistance in improving their future water situation coping strategies for a more promising outlook are discussed including technological improvements better governance and collaboration and virtual water trade the rest of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 reviews the existing literature on decoupling and on water withdrawals in sequence section 3 cites the data applied in this research section 4 presents decoupling results section 5 examines what influences water withdrawal decoupling section 6 interprets the findings while section 7 summarizes and concludes 2 literature review 2 1 decoupling since the beginning of the century decoupling has become a hotly debated topic in academic research and environmental policy making the most comprehensive look at this development is given by wiedenhofer et al 38 and haberl et al 39 their meta analyses illustrate the mounting research on the decoupling issue but also the aforementioned missing link to water at the worldwide country scale the authors find relative decoupling to be frequent for material use and ghg emissions however examples of long term absolute decoupling are rare for the few cases where absolute decoupling was observed the authors warn against generalizing because of specific circumstances such as decreasing resource use during economic crises such trends are expected around global shock events like the global financial crisis of 2008 or the covid 19 pandemic the analyzed literature shows that a continuation of past and ongoing trends will not yield absolute reductions in environmental inputs like water or in ghg emissions 6 39 50 52 additionally jackson and victor 53 establish that noticeable absolute decoupling falls short of the significant amount of decoupling necessary to meet the agreed climate and sdg objectives evidence found by the oecd 40 in their initial report was in line with haberl et al 39 on the topic of relative decoupling which they also judged as widespread in oecd member countries specifically on the issue at hand gilmont 54 55 41 highlighted three key mechanisms driving water resource decoupling 1 economic decoupling for instance a shift from an economy based on agriculture with substantial irrigated land toward other economic sectors through diversification or through other non water related changes 2 trade based decoupling such as virtual water trade through food imports and 3 natural water decoupling through improved technologies recycling and management in this light israel and spain are at the forefront showing significant water resource decoupling through trade and non natural resource substitution 50 54 in addition trade based decoupling has been occurring since the early 1960s in the middle east and north africa mena region while further decoupling can be achieved by targeting the users who consume the most water 55 further water decoupling evidence is brought forth by the oecd 56 report since the 1980s various oecd countries stabilized or reduced total and per capita water abstractions in particular a strong decoupling of water consumption levels from income growth can be discerned as per capita water consumption decreased by 6 5 across oecd member countries whereas gross national product per capita grew by 36 40 p 49 the sdg 6 indicator progress report 9 offers a specific example in this regard after 1980 water withdrawals in the united states remained constant until 2005 and decreased thereafter until 2010 9 meanwhile population and economic growth occurred over that time frame 9 suggesting that socioeconomic growth was decoupled from water withdrawals success in this area can be attributed to efficiency improvements in agricultural and manufacturing water withdrawals making the sector less water intensive through efficiency gains and recycling 40 it has not been analyzed whether how and at which scale these past trends will evolve throughout the 21st century across the globe a gap this research fills 2 2 water withdrawals and future predictions the present paper builds on previous work by alcamo et al 17 who identified future long term developments in global water resources with socioeconomic and climate change as the drivers other research also serves as a solid foundation in global water resource simulation 6 57 60 while using similar input data and climate scenarios the current assessment adds to this broad base by incorporating decoupling as well as varying ssp scenarios into the analysis the relationship between income as an important factor of water use has been well established 17 47 61 62 alcamo et al 17 find that growing withdrawals in the domestic sector due to income growth are the principal cause of increasing water stress in this regard the income effect is five to eleven times stronger than the impact of population growth 17 thus changing incomes will have a major influence on future water withdrawals and crises justifying the focus on water in relation to gdp in this research apart from income climate change is often cited as another significant driver 19 20 22 23 59 63 specifically schewe et al 22 predict that a global warming of two degrees celsius will lead to an additional 15 of the world s population facing severe water resource decreases whether income or climate change is the dominant factor in the developments of the future water situation is open to conjecture differences in effects are attributed to geographical location 61 with some regions being hurt more by rising temperatures levels than others the present study sheds further light on the discussion no matter which variable leads the charge the fact remains that due to rising living standards global warming and other influences a large fraction of the population will be confronted with chronic or absolute water scarcity due to rapidly dwindling supplies in turn this poses huge challenges for societies to adapt proactively in order to be better prepared for impending water crises many scholars have evidently shown that these crises are not only ongoing but also growing in size and magnitude nechifor and winning 64 highlight various studies projecting the future water demand in the face of socioeconomic development while kummu et al 5 review the historical development of water scarcity alcamo et al 58 arnell 59 alcamo et al 17 menzel and matovelle 61 schewe et al 22 gosling and arnell 23 among others forecast potential increases in water scarcity emerging hot spots that will be under severe water stress in the 2050s include many areas in the mena southern africa northern china as well as the west coast and northeast of latin america 17 on the other hand withdrawals are projected to stabilize or decrease in many industrialized nations due to per capita water use saturation lower population growth and technological innovations especially in the agricultural sector 17 this effect is not observed in developing countries until the second half of the century 17 although this broad literature base exists few have specifically incorporated the decoupling concept when looking at the future water situation in doing so this research advances the state of understanding global water resources and their management 2 3 the environmental kuznets curve frequently discussed in studies evolving the use of natural resources and gdp is the environmental kuznets curve ekc following kuznets 65 discovery of an inverted u relationship between the level of inequality and income per capita similar associations were made between environmental pressures and economic growth giving rise to the ekc the hypothesis holds that income growth will increase the pressure on an environmental indicator or a natural resource until a certain tipping point after which the trend reverses in this regard early studies were primarily focused on levels of pollution versus income 44 45 before more scholars attempted to find evidence of the inverted u relationship between natural resources and income however the literature base on the ekc correlation of water withdrawals and income remains narrow the first evidence on the inverted u relationship on this topic was presented by rock 66 in sequence gleick 67 cole 68 katz 43 gu et al 69 and others have examined the topic in various ways results of these studies are somewhat conflicting with some finding evidence of an inverted u relationship for example cole katz 68 43 while others do not for example gleick gu et al 67 69 in line with contrasting results from prior research katz 44 suggests that whether the ekc relationship exists for water withdrawals is highly dependent on not only the choice of datasets and methodology but also on country or region specific factors such as geography because of this katz duarte et al 44 45 dismiss the ekc as a poor predictor for country level patterns of water withdrawals limiting its use as a tool for predicting and planning broader criticisms of the ekc also exist elsewhere in literature 70 with no final judgment call made yet the present paper delivers more input on this discussion 3 data water withdrawal data at the country level is taken from the center for environmental systems research at the university of kassel http watclim cesr de included in the dataset are the years 1995 2025 2055 and 2075 due to lack of consistent and applicable country level data this dataset was chosen as the best available option water withdrawals per country are calculated using the watergap 2 2 water use model this is widely accepted as one of the best global hydrological models for research on water and is frequently used in water related studies 6 17 49 51 58 61 it is also the key model to compute comprehensive long term global or regional estimates of water withdrawals and availability 51 58 watergap projections depend on its parameter inputs which were left unchanged from alcamo et al 6 and alcamo et al 58 data for the three ssp scenarios analyzed is taken from the ssp database https tntcat iiasa ac at sspdb 46 this included country level gdp projections from 2010 until 2100 these gdp forecasts are differentiated by the relevant factors impacting economic growth such as demographic trends education globalization and trade openness technology etc 46 gdp data for the year 1995 is obtained from the world bank database https data worldbank org additional economic data for the control variables is also obtained from the world bank database these variables include the export share defined as exports of goods and services as a percentage of gdp the import share defined similarly as well as economic agriculture and industry shares both represented by percentage of gdp the share of agricultural land referring to the share of land area that is arable under permanent crops and under permanent pastures is also taken from the world bank population projections are obtained from the same dataset as the water withdrawal data http watclim cesr de the justification for including export and import shares separately is the following put simply both shares can have a significant impact on water withdrawals within a country a country whose economy heavily depends on exports will likely have higher water withdrawals in the sectors in which they produce the most exported goods industry for example on the other hand having a large import share may mean that the given country has lower water withdrawals because they are outsourcing water withdrawals to the exporting nations since the water is withdrawn for production in the latter this is reflected in 15 p 454 as many regions no longer depend solely on their local water resources but more and more on the combination of those with virtual water embedded in imports of water intensive products hence differences in supply chains can positively or negatively affect water withdrawals and need to be controlled for to appropriately assess the development of water withdrawals and dfs over time in similar fashion agriculture and industry are two of the largest water consuming sectors across the world in countries which rely heavily on these two sectors water withdrawals may increase disproportionately in relation to other nations not so dependent on agricultural and industrial production to control for this potential distortion agriculture and industry shares are included in the analysis all control variables except population growth are assumed to remain constant over the study period primarily because no reliable projections for future values and indicators exist in these cases this should be kept in mind when interpreting the results below as export import agricultural and industrial shares of gdp do tend to shift up and down over time however these minor shifts are not expected to cause major differences in the results as the effect size of these variables on the df is small and insignificant for some specifications table 1 presents summary statistics for the variables in the pooled dataset 3 1 country classifications the countries are clustered by several different classifications to assess where there are clustering of trends by different groups income groups are taken from the world bank database for the year 2020 https data worldbank org world bank s regional classifications centered around broad continents are taken to represent geographically defined regions lastly climate zones are defined through the field listing of the cia world factbook https www cia gov library publications the world factbook due to a lack of observations in each climate zone the original 10 climate zones are collapsed to four in the analysis the varying country classifications are shown in fig 1 3 2 water withdrawal scenarios a2 and b2 in this paper the impact of driving forces on water withdrawal are assessed assumptions and water withdrawal projections come from the a2 and b2 scenarios developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 71 two scenarios are applied to offset some of the high uncertainty of projections of water withdrawal drivers as done by alcamo et al 17 together they provide a broad range of estimates for important influential factors regarding water resources and absolute levels of future withdrawals 17 scenario a2 exhibits low population growth low to moderate economic growth accompanied by high increase in ghg emissions and climate change 17 however in comparison to other ipcc scenarios low levels of integration trade and technological diffusion are predicted alternatively b2 forecasts higher economic growth lower population and a strong emphasis on non climate related environmental policies as alcamo et al 17 highlight this results in lower rates of climate change than under a2 importantly these assumptions result in scenarios a2 projecting higher water withdrawals over time on average in comparison to scenarios b2 3 3 climate scenarios it is almost impossible to account for the high uncertainty regarding climate models it is attempted here through the application of two different models 1 the hadcm3 model of the hadley centre 72 73 and 2 the echam4 opyc3 model from the max planck institute of climatology 74 75 the aforementioned sources give a detailed description of each climate model in total the echam4 opyc3 climate model forecasts slightly lower water withdrawals over time the only difference between the two models is projected irrigation water withdrawals which are higher for the hadcm3 model domestic industrial and livestock water withdrawals over time are the same for both climate models 3 4 shared socioeconomic pathways ssps as predicting the future state of the world in any matter comes with much uncertainty the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps 76 framework has been adopted by various researchers it offers a way to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts socioeconomic development resource use adaptation and mitigation the framework was designed around a matrix combining climate forcing on one axis and socioeconomic conditions on the other a total of five ssp narratives exists providing descriptions of conceivable futures based on varying demographic economic lifestyle policy technological institutional and environmental changes 46 the five narratives are ssp1 sustainability ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 fragmented world ssp4 inequality ssp5 conventional development this analysis specifically focuses on ssp1 ssp2 and ssp5 in line with other literature on the topic 62 in this research the ssps are used to apply three possible ways in which societies will develop economically hence the major ssp input data are gdp projections over time the different ssp forecasts are reflected by the df differences produced by the three ssp scenarios for a detailed description of the ssps see moss et al o neill et al 77 78 and the iiasa ssp database https tntcat iiasa ac at sspdb with supplementary notes table 2 offers a summarized look at the most important points on the ssps incorporated in this analysis 46 the different input assumptions cause variations in gdp projections over time in most cases ssp5 results in the highest gdp growth for all years in the dataset followed by ssp1 with ssp2 having the lowest gdp projections for 2025 2055 and 2075 4 decoupling trends claims of a possible decoupling of gdp from resource use and environmental pressures were formulated as early as 1987 with un 79 reporting on the world s common future in sequence building on the prior concept of eco efficiency decoupling was advanced by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd in 2001 and has since become a crucial concept in sustainable development specifically decoupling entails increasing the efficiency with which value is derived from natural resources in order to reconcile indefinite economic growth with environmental sustainability 80 p 450 as defined above distinctions are made between absolute and relative decoupling however 55 argues that the differentiation between the two does not apply to water because global water resources are subject to spatial limitations instead of absolute scarcity additionally resource decoupling must be distinguished from impact decoupling 37 the latter concerns decoupling of gdp from ghg emissions whereas the former addresses decoupling of gdp from energy or material use 39 hence the present study focuses on resource decoupling gilmont 55 calls such decoupling analysis significant as it shows the political implications that decoupling has for resource use and security decoupling is measured using a decoupling factor which helps reveal long term opportunities for progressing toward sustainable development 40 to calculate the df we apply the following formula from the oecd 40 1 d f i t 1 e y i t e y i 0 where e represents the environmental pressure which in our case is percentage change in water withdrawal and y denotes the economic force which we measure using gdp growth the index denotes country i at time t the calculation is done in absolute values and is referenced to the base period denoted by t 0 which in our data is 1995 at best the df has a maximum value of 1 indicating absolute decoupling a value in between 0 and 1 suggests that some decoupling has occurred during the period whereas a negative value signals a coupling between the environmental pressure and gdp using the df simplifies cross country comparisons the oecd formula like any other potential decoupling formula does not come without critique for example casadio tarabusi and guarini 81 highlight several weaknesses of the oecd formula such as its boundedness at 1 with there being no lower bound as well as and the difficulty of distinguishing between absolute and relative decoupling hence the findings should be interpreted with some caution the use of three different ssps ssp1 ssp2 and ssp5 two different water withdrawal scenarios a2 and b2 and two different climate models hadcm3 and echam opyc3 across three future time periods 2025 2055 2075 results in a total of 36 scenarios being analyzed table 3 presents the average water withdrawal decoupling for each scenario in the analysis ssp5 conventional development scenarios consistently produce the highest dfs in each year this does not come unexpected as gdp growth is the highest in ssp5 and the df increases with higher rates of economic growth additionally b2 scenarios typically generate higher dfs than their a2 counterparts due to the fact that water withdrawal predictions are lower in b2 forecasts echam opyc3 scenarios yield higher decoupling results than hadcm3 models in most cases granted that differences are small the highest dfs in the second half of the century are produced by the echam opyc3 b2 ssp5 scenario on average water decoupling from gdp is relatively low until 2025 with a maximum average df of 0 45 fast forward 30 years and decoupling intensifies approaching values as high as 0 75 in 2075 decoupling is predicted to be common and widespread with some scenarios yielding dfs over 0 80 it is encouraging although not surprising to see this upward trend in water withdrawal decoupling over the course of the 21st century major reasons for increased decoupling over time are likely improved technologies greater water withdrawal efficiency and gdp growth however even in 2075 one or more countries depending on the scenario will still have negative decoupling of water withdrawal with the minimum df value being 0 74 jamaica in the years prior several more countries are predicted to produce negative dfs for example burundi has the lowest decoupling value for the year 2025 with 1 64 in the hadcm3 b2 ssp2 scenario on the other hand as early as 2025 some countries bosnia china etc experience extremely high water withdrawal decoupling with values above 0 89 the underlying calculated decoupling results form the basis for figs 2 and 3 these figures support the above discussed summary statistics for average water withdrawal decoupling per scenario in table 3 fig 2 illustrates the df distribution of each scenario the box plots depict global median values together with 25th to 75th percentile ranges whiskers represent 1st and 99th percentiles while outliers are presented as dots the figure shows that a lot of countries are still coupling in 2025 below the 0 threshold over time the positive trends are visible as the number of countries decoupling water withdrawals from economic growth consistently increases in this light the global median values rise the gap between the 25th and 75th percentile narrows outliers become fewer and many countries close the gap to those nations already producing high dfs as early as 2025 yet while some countries experience high water withdrawal decoupling others continuously lag behind with values below 0 overall the b2 scenarios paint the more optimistic picture with higher dfs over time for the remainder of the results section only decoupling results from the echam opyc3 ssp1 scenario are reported the reasoning for this is that it produces medium to high outcomes while following a desirable ssp1 scenario path that makes good progress toward sustainability and the sdgs see table 2 additionally b2 is considered a best case scenario in terms of societal and economic development as well as in respect to water withdrawal over time as it projects lower resource use than its a2 counterpart fig 3 illustrates decoupling results by income groups regions and climate zones fig 3a looks at the df by income groups based on the b2 scenario high and upper middle income countries perform better on average than countries on the lower income spectrum in 2025 by 2055 lower middle income countries catch up with the higher income nations while low income countries still lag behind in terms of water withdrawal decoupling when looking at median values however toward the end of the century there is little separation between the various income groups and their average decoupling performance in addition the minimum and maximum decoupling values for each income group show that there are positive high dfs and negative negative dfs examples in every faction for almost all years these trends hold for each ssp scenario in all b2 scenarios most income groups produce similar outcomes over time with low income countries catching up by 2075 this is not the case in a2 models in fact over time low income countries outperform higher income nations in these scenarios in a2 models lower income countries see relatively big rises in dfs in 2055 and 2075 in relation to the identical b2 models on the other hand higher income countries have better dfs in b2 than in a2 scenarios the main reason for this divergence is differences in water withdrawal projections between a2 and b2 models while higher income countries have lower levels of water withdrawal over time in b2 scenarios a2 models forecast increases in water withdrawals on the other hand low income countries have higher water withdrawals in b2 as opposed to a2 scenarios hence lower income nations have much lower dfs in b2 models while higher income countries perform better in these cases the opposite applies in a2 scenarios the dfs by regions are shown in fig 3b in the short run countries in europe and central asia north america as well as south asia produce the highest average dfs on the other hand latin american and caribbean and sub saharan africa perform by far the worst on average although these regions catch up slowly over time they do not reach the level of other regions by 2075 south asian countries are the best water withdrawal decoupling performers throughout the century on average fig 3c shows the df by climate zones here it is worth noting that the continental climate zone continuously sees the highest water withdrawal decoupling averages in all scenarios on the other hand countries with rather tropical climate lag behind and exhibit the highest variance among each other throughout the century while the results above clustered decoupling averages based on scenarios income groups regions and climate zones dfs by individual country are listed in appendix b specifically a ranking system was created to better visualize the decoupling performance of each of the 155 countries in the analysis in relation to others for each year in the study period countries were assigned a rank from 1 to 155 with 1 indicating highest df and 155 the opposite average ranks were calculated based on the individual country rank in each scenario the key takeaway of the ranked results is that industrialized countries are not necessarily ranked higher than emerging or still developing nations when it comes to future water withdrawal decoupling the main reason for this is likely the fact that the latter have higher rates of gdp growth in comparison to the former which are already highly developed and experience slower rates of economic growth this causes a ranking bias in favor of those countries with the highest projected gdp growths throughout the 21st century in addition countries performing well could be doing so because of water access issues for example countries like turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and iraq who all exhibit relatively high dfs throughout the 21st century also face high water stress see fig 5 this is concerning because resource constraints could paint a misleading decoupling picture such that high decoupling does not always represent a good thing hence it is important to not only look at the df but to complement it with an assessment of overall absolute trends in water withdrawals over time to paint a clearer picture of the future world water situation absolute withdrawal reductions are mainly occurring in developed countries and are more frequent in b2 scenarios this could be another indication for increased water stress rather than more efficient water withdrawal and use a more in depth and wholesome look at these developments is required beyond the findings of this research 5 what impacts decoupling past research has well established the link between the use of water resources and economic development to recap growing gdp is one of the principal causes of increasing water withdrawals and stress 17 47 61 62 the present study backs these findings fig 4 shows the relationship of per capita water withdrawal and per capita gdp in natural log terms for all the data points from the four years 1995 2025 2050 and 2075 the figure shows a positive correlation between the two variables this relationship is captured by the following regression model 2 l n w a t e r p e r c a p i t a i t β 0 β 1 l n g d p p e r c a p i t a i t β 2 l n g d p p e r c a p i t a i t 2 γ t β z z i t ε i t where w a t e r p c i t represents the log of per capita water withdrawal in country i in time t where time is represented by 1995 2025 2055 and 2075 the coefficients of interest in the first set of regressions are β 1 and β 2 the effect of log of per capita gdp and its squared term on per capita water withdrawal changes in a given country based on fig 4 β 1 is expected to be positive and significant while β 2 if significant is expected to be negative implying declining water withdrawal requirements over time relative decoupling the worst case scenario is β 2 being positive and significant suggesting an acceleration of per capita withdrawal quantity with gdp coupling for the variables natural log levels are used rather than growth terms this is done for two reasons first countries are at different stages of development and hence growth rates for lower income countries are expected to be higher relative to higher income countries since they have a lot of catching up to do second high income countries might have already achieved more efficient technologies that limit water withdrawals thus the potential for change is smaller here as well in contrast developing countries might still benefit greatly from technological improvements time fixed effects are represented by γ t to factor out trends over time control variable z i t includes population growth export import agricultural and industrial shares and the share of agricultural land summary statistics for these variables are presented in table 1 countries are assumed to have an independent slope and intercept therefore a fixed effects model is used the variation not explained by these variables is captured by the error term ε i t table 4 shows the results for various specifications of eq 2 all of which control for country fixed effects all regressions depict that water withdrawal increases with gdp at a decreasing rate which reinforces the prior results in suggesting that relative decoupling is occurring this relationship holds across the different regression specifications after controlling for time fixed effects columns 4 and 5 add additional region and income fixed effects which results in a slight decline of the l n g d p p c coefficient value implying that income and regions also impact decoupling very differently the ekc turning point was calculated by estimating the coefficients of the ln gdp per capita and its square terms or β 1 and β 2 respectively since it is a quadratic function the gdp values at which turning point happens is estimated as β 1 2 β 2 since we know how the gdp of each country is developing in relation to time we use linear trends to estimate which year the turning point will be achieved regardless of testing for various gdp forecasting measures the turning points are mostly estimated to be too far in the future to comment on or use as an underlying assumption of a robust and predictable relationship in this case table 5 shows eq 2 specification with controls added several factors play a role in water withdrawals changes with increasing population growth water withdrawals rise only marginally surprisingly higher export shares result in a slight decline in water withdrawals this could be attributed to high exporting countries already having better less water intensive technologies in place for the types of goods they are exporting for instance such countries may have implemented water efficient irrigation or other technologies at a greater scale than countries who are not as dependent on exports additionally these countries may focus on importing more water intensive products thereby reducing their water withdrawals through virtual water trade imports do not impact decoupling which is not surprising since imports embody withdrawals elsewhere having a higher share of agricultural land unsurprisingly increases withdrawals the last column in table 5 includes all controls to isolate their effects from the variable of interest tables 6 7 and 8 extend the analysis by exploring the impact of the control variables on withdrawals by region income group and climate zones each category is run separately to highlight which factors play a role in which region for all the regressions the full model specification shown in column 4 in table 5 is used for the various scenarios the tables highlight that differences between varying regions and climate zones become more evident for example in table 6 water withdrawals are positively correlated with gdp in all regions except in the mena and east asia and pacific eap where population growth is a bigger contributing factor to rising water withdrawals all regions show decreasing returns relative to gdp although some are not statistically significant in europe and central asia eca water withdrawals are significantly driven by agriculture and industry shares as well as the share of agricultural land furthermore given the expected population decline in eca the sign is also negative agriculture and industry shares are mostly net positive contributors to withdrawals while import and export shares reduce withdrawals across most regions the ekc turning points have already been crossed in eap and eca with the mena being next a clear divergence between a possible ekc relationship is evident between the various regions this supports katz 44 in that the ekc relationship is highly dependent on factors like geography making it a controversial measure table 7 shows the correlations of withdrawals by income groups interestingly all but low income nations show decreasing return to water withdrawals relative to gdp population growth contributes in all income groups while lower middle income countries see a decline in withdrawals relative to industry share the share of agricultural land is relevant for higher income groups again the ekc turning points are too far in the future to discuss with confidence table 8 illustrates the variations across the four climate zones water withdrawals are positively correlated with gdp at a decreasing rate in all climate zones population growth plays the most crucial role for all but the continental zone where the share of agricultural land and the industrial share of gdp are more relevant further results are mixed with different factors affecting withdrawals 6 discussion the above discussed results present whether water withdrawal decoupling is occurring throughout the world how water withdrawals are impacted by gdp growth and which factors are the most influential in driving decoupling across specific income groups regions and climate zones altogether they fulfill the objectives of this research attempting to assess country level water withdrawal decoupling trends and the connection to geographical location climate and income groups explaining why decoupling is happening in certain countries and not in others was beyond the scope of this analysis and input data the primary decoupling analysis portrays that water withdrawal decoupling intensifies throughout the 21st century by 2075 water withdrawal decoupling is predicted to be common and widespread across the globe averaging dfs as high as 0 86 overall ssp5 scenarios produce the highest average dfs due to their high economic growth projections followed by ssp1 with sustainable development at its core the findings add to the existing literature on decoupling suggesting that long term water withdrawal decoupling is possible and projected for the 21st century short run projections have higher income countries experiencing more water withdrawal decoupling than lower income countries the latter are projected to bridge the gap and catch up until 2075 in fact lower income nations actually outperform higher income nations in regard to average dfs in all a2 scenarios by the end of the study period when ranking all countries based on their decoupling scores see appendix b industrialized countries are not necessarily ranked higher than emerging or developing nations regional differences exist as countries in europe and central asia north america and south asia produce the highest average dfs latin american and caribbean as well as sub saharan africa lag behind overall decoupling trends regional location and climate zone are strongly associated with and appear as important drivers of country level water withdrawal decoupling outcomes contrarily income group differences only play a role in the short run with higher income nations averaging higher rates of decoupling however by 2075 this disparity becomes negligible as lower income countries catch up in this light overall gdp growth seems to be a more important factor than initial country level income clusters various scholars have identified the mena southern africa and latin america as emerging hot spots facing severe water stress by 2050 see figs 2 and 5 unfortunately these three regions were also identified as those with the lowest average water withdrawal decoupling across all continental regions see fig 3 placing increased attention on trying to generate greater water withdrawal decoupling through the below discussed coping strategies offers policymakers in these regions a chance to proactively fight the impending crises higher decoupling would help avert worst case water stress scenarios to visualize this relationship fig 5 illustrates countries dfs and their water stress levels however water withdrawal decoupling is very country context specific decoupling means different things for each country and it is not entirely clear why it is happening for some and not for others high dfs could for example result simply because access to water is an issue in this light limited water withdrawals due to a lack of the resource in the first place could result in misleadingly high water withdrawal dfs this is a concerning scenario exposing countries in the top right quadrant to high risk in relation to future water resources thus it is not only important to achieve greater efficiency in relation to water resources but to also keep track of absolute volumes of withdrawn water instances where absolute water withdrawal volumes decrease are mainly predicted to occur in developed countries and more frequently in b2 scenarios these trends need to be included in the bigger picture further this research attempted to shed more light on the ongoing discussion of a possible ekc relationship between water and gdp however signs do not point toward an evident robust inverted u relationship for water withdrawals and income at the country level limiting the usefulness of the ekc assumption in this regard 6 1 discussion on coping strategies two important questions remain unanswered how can the presented information be used and how can countries and regions struggling to make meaningful progress toward greater water withdrawal decoupling be guided toward the right direction first the analysis highlights that positive examples for water withdrawal decoupling exist across all income groups regions and climate zones as early as 2025 these should serve as best practice cases for struggling nations to aspire to for instance croatia can look to its neighbor bosnia to create equivalent long term water withdrawal decoupling success in this light countries like croatia could specifically assess how and with what means bosnia and others are achieving desired water withdrawal decoupling similarly even entire regions like the latin america and the caribbean may model themselves after thriving regions like south asia in this regard having projected dfs throughout the 21st century laid out allows policymakers to collaborate proactively and change the course of the future world water situation the fact that decoupling becomes common and widespread over time is an indicator for more efficient technologies paving the way toward greater water withdrawal productivity improved efficiency is also possible through water policy reforms as suggested by rosegrant et al 82 and more intelligently coordinated distribution 83 additionally increased research funding and better water system infrastructure can lead to advances in agricultural production per unit of water or water conservation efforts for example wallat 83 for this purpose governments industry and researchers need to work together collect information and openly share data 12 84 being a collective action problem 27 collaboration stakeholder engagement and regional water management solutions are essential in improving the outlook on looming water crises 85 many important projects on water are ongoing they range from new solutions on water supply technological innovations flood management climate change impacts to water resource and reuse management 12 in this light wastewater transformations are recognized as a major opportunity to alter water resource management and present several ways of curbing water withdrawals yet it must be acknowledged that strategies to cope with worsening water situations are regionally dependent for instance short medium and long run actions can be specifically tailored to sub saharan africa 86 following the suggestions of these authors could cause sub saharan africa to see an increase in long term water withdrawal decoupling additionally not all regions may be able to diversify their economy due to climate conditions and thus have to concentrate on other efforts a more global approach could rely on expanded virtual water trade among others 55 has identified virtual water trade as a way of alleviating national water limits porkka et al 15 highlight reduced exports of water intensive products as an option to reduce pressure on water resources along with more traditional hard and soft measures alternatively countries who have insufficient technologies may favor a switch to more imports of water intensive goods which can be produced more efficiently elsewhere 15 all the above strategies represent viable solutions to curb impending water crises around the world built on the mechanisms driving decoupling introduced by gilmont 54 55 41 in this way they would not only decrease their absolute water withdrawals but also increase water withdrawal decoupling a meaningful measure en route toward achieving the sdgs and overall sustainability it is recommended that policymakers and other stakeholders act today instead of tomorrow 7 conclusions the world water situation is becoming increasingly worse with more and more countries experiencing water stress and shortages this no longer primarily applies to developing countries but is happening all across the world even the world s leading nations are predicted to encounter water shortages under business as usual forecasts with 83 citing germany as an example the looming crises make sustainable water management a more pressing need now than ever before in this regard placing increased importance on decoupling water withdrawal from economic growth offers a viable solution for local regional and global policymakers for this reason the present study attempted to shed light on this topic which was identified as an evident gap in the current literature base by assessing 21st century water withdrawal decoupling projections in 155 countries in sum water withdrawal decoupling is predicted to increase throughout the course of the century and will become common and widespread by 2075 although some countries will seemingly be left behind in this development these are predominantly located in latin america and the caribbean as well as sub saharan africa however when ranking all countries based on their water withdrawal dfs industrialized nations are not necessarily ranked higher than emerging or still developing countries in fact many of the latter rank among the top especially toward the end of the study period this is likely due to high projected gdp growth in relation to 1995 in comparison with current high income nations who do not experience rapid economic growth anymore thus overall gdp growth is more important in driving high dfs than current income group designations in addition country specific climate zone and regional location appear to have greater impacts on water withdrawal decoupling than income group classifications it is also clear that the importance and significance of the various influential drivers varies among and within the different income groups regions or climate zones this is one of the reasons why we found little evidence in support of a possible ekc relationship between water withdrawals and gdp at the country level putting the usefulness of the ekc assumption for country level water withdrawals into question the calculated ekc turning points were mostly too far in the future to point toward a robust and clear inverted u relationship projecting water withdrawal decoupling at the global scale allows for the identification of best practices by countries who already produce high dfs for diagnosing problems in regions who are lagging behind and for pinpointing patterns of change these and more can be the starting point for future research additionally to paint a clearer picture dfs need to be complemented by holistic assessments of absolute water withdrawal reductions in depth analyses should look into explaining why decoupling is occurring in certain areas but not in others and specifically lay out best practices impending water crises across the globe can be tackled through many measures including technological advances water policy reforms collaboration in governance and science wastewater transformations virtual water trade etc insights into the trends and influential drivers of future water withdrawal decoupling from this study are hoped to provide input into the proper implementation of effective coping strategies for a better outlook on the world water situation in this way decoupling provides a pathway to a more water wise world credit authorship contribution statement felix dalstein conceptualization methodology formal analysis resources writing project administration asjad naqvi methodology validation

8659,human demand for adequate water resources and supplies has been and will continue to be a fundamental issue in the 21st century due to rapid population growth growing economies and globalization and increasing water pollution among others water withdrawals in regions which are already encountering scarcity will impose intensifying pressure on water resources locally and globally threatening the achievement of long term sustainable development targets decoupling has increasingly been recognized and incorporated in policy making as a way to reconcile limitless economic growth with environmental pressures filling evident literature gaps the current state and projected future decoupling factors of water withdrawals in relation to gdp are assessed through decoupling and regression analyzes for 155 countries and 12 potential socioeconomic development pathway scenarios findings suggest that average levels of water withdrawal decoupling are moderate in 2025 but will increase throughout the century in all countries by 2075 average water withdrawal decoupling becomes common and widespread with high decoupling factors across the world yet some countries and regions will continue to lag behind in this development gdp growth is the most significant driver of water withdrawals climate and regional differences among countries are major influential factors on decoupling outcomes more so than current country level income group classification altogether these results are of high significance to water resource managers and policy actors offering a chance to act proactively to change the course on global water resource and country specific development in this way decoupling provides a pathway to a more water wise world keywords water withdrawal growth decoupling global regions future scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways 1 introduction meeting the continuously increasing and unsustainable demand for water across the planet has been and will continue to be one of the major challenges facing humanity in the 21st century jaeger et al 1 jarvis 2 garrick and hahn 3 jaeger et al 1 jarvis 2 and garrick and hahn 3 define water scarcity as the marginal value of a unit of water highlighting its high variability across space and time while distinguishing it from water deficit although water scarcity has long been an issue 4 5 discussions on global water resources only became a central topic in international development and environmental policy with meetings like the first world water forum in 1997 and the world summit on sustainable development in 2002 6 however it was not until 2010 that the united nations general assembly unga explicitly recognized the human right to water calling it indispensable for the realization of all human rights and a dignified life 7 8 as a result access to safe and sufficient water emerged at the core of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development 9 therein it was acknowledged that apart from being a basic human necessity water availability as well as management plays a key role in sustainable development and the overall achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs due to its strong linkages with the other aspired and ambitious targets 9 thus the successful implementation of the 2030 sdg agenda hinges upon meeting sdg6 achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable water by 2030 10 despite the importance of water and the inter linkages to every desirable societal goal being understood the trends in water withdrawal and issues surrounding the topic of water are pointing the wrong way following an in depth review of sdg6 the high level political forum concluded that the world is not on track to achieve sdg6 by 2030 11 12 this statement comes as no surprise when looking at the historical development of water withdrawal which represents the total volume of water being removed from a water source a portion of which may be returned to said source and reused according to wada et al 13 during the last 100 years global water withdrawals increased six fold with no downward curve in sight yao et al 14 cite that this rise in water withdrawal came at twice the rate of population growth naturally water shortages became more of a problem over the past century 4 today the distribution of freshwater is highly uneven 15 with many regions being considered water scarce according to estimates water shortages or water stress are causing physical water scarcity for approximately one third of the planet s population 4 15 17 in fact it is predicted that most countries will experience water shortage and scarcity problems by the year 2025 18 20 several factors are at the root of these forecasts climate change has many detrimental effects on water availability 21 including the loss of significant freshwater reservoirs 20 rising population and living standards as well as increased food production are putting growing pressures on water resources 22 24 concerns about water pollution from agriculture and industry are mounting 25 and rapid urbanization only amplifies water demand and per capita shortages 26 27 counteracting factors to these negative impacts are the saturation of water need improved technologies or increased rainfall in many areas yet the overall downward trend will continue in summary the maximum global potential for the withdrawal of freshwater is approaching fast as the challenge of sustainable water use becomes continually more difficult 5 22 28 in this regard with water scarcity increasing and the craving for adequate water supplies inching closer to total water availability in various regions each water drop becomes increasingly valuable 13 29 30 hence the need for sustainable efficient and equitable water management is more urgent than ever to avert the impending crisis scholars have argued for shifting the focus away economic growth 31 38 on this subject increasing emphasis on the notion of sustainable development suggesting that economic growth can be reconciled with planetary boundaries 39 gave rise to the decoupling concept in short the term decoupling refers to breaking the link between environmental bads and economic goods 40 p 4 decoupling theorizes that the demand for resources like water can be curbed while economic and population growth continues 41 if gdp grows absolute decoupling happens when the growth rate of the environmental indicator such as water withdrawal stabilizes or decreases 40 alternatively relative decoupling suggests that said rate is less than gdp growth 40 ward et al 33 calls the argument of decoupling environmental impacts from economic growth appealing because it would justify gdp growth as a sustainable societal goal in this light decoupling became one of the major objectives of the organization for economic cooperation and development s oecd environmental strategy for the early 21st century 40 and has since been incorporated as a viable policy target in matters such as the sdgs 33 accordingly many scholars consider decoupling of gdp from the use of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions ghgs a prerequisite and logical necessity if sustainability targets are to be achieved 35 39 even though the importance of water and the worsening situation surrounding the vital resource is clear no comprehensive connection between the notion of decoupling and water withdrawal exists at the global level the present study addresses this apparent literature gap by performing a decoupling analysis of water withdrawals from 1995 to 2075 for 155 countries the motivations for this study are fourfold first there is a broad research base on the topic of water including analysis of past present and future water withdrawals however decoupling appears to be a missing piece in this literature as few studies specifically address decoupling of water withdrawals from gdp studies that do cover water decoupling tend to focus on the past or present whereas this research offers a look into the future second many water related studies have a narrow or regional scope however given the increasing importance of global drivers including climate change urbanization globalization and population growth assessing the issue from a global country level standpoint is essential 6 39 42 42 third whether climate change or economic and population growth are the most influential factors driving future water stress is a contested topic in this field similarly fourth there is ongoing debate whether or not the inverted u relationship between resources and gdp growth hypothesized by the environmental kuznets curve ekc is evident for water withdrawals 43 45 this study attempts to shed further light on these two discussions while comparing the impact of two different climate models and three shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios 46 further evidence may result due to the fact that this analysis looks beyond 2050 until 2075 unlike most studies with the established importance and motivation this study presents expected future decoupling trends for country level water withdrawals and shows how decoupling differs across geographical location climate conditions and income group classifications the objective of this paper is to provide a quantitative analysis that fills evident holes in the literature on the future world water situation this estimation is of high interest to water resource managers policymakers stakeholders in all industries and societies across the globe 47 49 it offers a chance to plan ahead for the forthcoming global water crisis and thereby try to avert the worst case scenario namely projecting these trajectories at the global country scale could be used to identify patterns of change serve as a foundation for addressing future challenges and highlight similarities and differences of water problems shared across the world 5 results suggest that water withdrawal decoupling is occurring and predicted to intensify throughout the course of the 21st century while moderate decoupling levels are achieved by 2025 on average these reach a higher average of above 0 67 1 highest by 2055 in 2075 average decoupling factors df lie above 0 77 although the trend points toward a decoupling increase in the latter half of the century countries like bosnia china and cambodia achieve high water withdrawal dfs as early as 2025 while some nations el salvador jamaica gambia etc lag behind in this development even in the long run although higher income countries are among the better performing countries in the short term lower income nations tend to catch up until 2075 on average south asian countries are predicted to have the highest rates of water withdrawal decoupling whereas latin america and caribbean as well as sub saharan africa states will tend to struggle on average in line the tropical climate zone will experience lower water withdrawal decoupling than others geographical location and climate conditions appear as more influential factors than income group classification when it comes to driving water withdrawal decoupling gdp growth is more important than current clustering of countries as low or high income for example presented findings yield little evidence that an inverted u ekc relationship exists for country level water withdrawals overall the results point to where policymakers and other stakeholders may search for best practice cases while also shedding light on which countries or regions need the most assistance in improving their future water situation coping strategies for a more promising outlook are discussed including technological improvements better governance and collaboration and virtual water trade the rest of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 reviews the existing literature on decoupling and on water withdrawals in sequence section 3 cites the data applied in this research section 4 presents decoupling results section 5 examines what influences water withdrawal decoupling section 6 interprets the findings while section 7 summarizes and concludes 2 literature review 2 1 decoupling since the beginning of the century decoupling has become a hotly debated topic in academic research and environmental policy making the most comprehensive look at this development is given by wiedenhofer et al 38 and haberl et al 39 their meta analyses illustrate the mounting research on the decoupling issue but also the aforementioned missing link to water at the worldwide country scale the authors find relative decoupling to be frequent for material use and ghg emissions however examples of long term absolute decoupling are rare for the few cases where absolute decoupling was observed the authors warn against generalizing because of specific circumstances such as decreasing resource use during economic crises such trends are expected around global shock events like the global financial crisis of 2008 or the covid 19 pandemic the analyzed literature shows that a continuation of past and ongoing trends will not yield absolute reductions in environmental inputs like water or in ghg emissions 6 39 50 52 additionally jackson and victor 53 establish that noticeable absolute decoupling falls short of the significant amount of decoupling necessary to meet the agreed climate and sdg objectives evidence found by the oecd 40 in their initial report was in line with haberl et al 39 on the topic of relative decoupling which they also judged as widespread in oecd member countries specifically on the issue at hand gilmont 54 55 41 highlighted three key mechanisms driving water resource decoupling 1 economic decoupling for instance a shift from an economy based on agriculture with substantial irrigated land toward other economic sectors through diversification or through other non water related changes 2 trade based decoupling such as virtual water trade through food imports and 3 natural water decoupling through improved technologies recycling and management in this light israel and spain are at the forefront showing significant water resource decoupling through trade and non natural resource substitution 50 54 in addition trade based decoupling has been occurring since the early 1960s in the middle east and north africa mena region while further decoupling can be achieved by targeting the users who consume the most water 55 further water decoupling evidence is brought forth by the oecd 56 report since the 1980s various oecd countries stabilized or reduced total and per capita water abstractions in particular a strong decoupling of water consumption levels from income growth can be discerned as per capita water consumption decreased by 6 5 across oecd member countries whereas gross national product per capita grew by 36 40 p 49 the sdg 6 indicator progress report 9 offers a specific example in this regard after 1980 water withdrawals in the united states remained constant until 2005 and decreased thereafter until 2010 9 meanwhile population and economic growth occurred over that time frame 9 suggesting that socioeconomic growth was decoupled from water withdrawals success in this area can be attributed to efficiency improvements in agricultural and manufacturing water withdrawals making the sector less water intensive through efficiency gains and recycling 40 it has not been analyzed whether how and at which scale these past trends will evolve throughout the 21st century across the globe a gap this research fills 2 2 water withdrawals and future predictions the present paper builds on previous work by alcamo et al 17 who identified future long term developments in global water resources with socioeconomic and climate change as the drivers other research also serves as a solid foundation in global water resource simulation 6 57 60 while using similar input data and climate scenarios the current assessment adds to this broad base by incorporating decoupling as well as varying ssp scenarios into the analysis the relationship between income as an important factor of water use has been well established 17 47 61 62 alcamo et al 17 find that growing withdrawals in the domestic sector due to income growth are the principal cause of increasing water stress in this regard the income effect is five to eleven times stronger than the impact of population growth 17 thus changing incomes will have a major influence on future water withdrawals and crises justifying the focus on water in relation to gdp in this research apart from income climate change is often cited as another significant driver 19 20 22 23 59 63 specifically schewe et al 22 predict that a global warming of two degrees celsius will lead to an additional 15 of the world s population facing severe water resource decreases whether income or climate change is the dominant factor in the developments of the future water situation is open to conjecture differences in effects are attributed to geographical location 61 with some regions being hurt more by rising temperatures levels than others the present study sheds further light on the discussion no matter which variable leads the charge the fact remains that due to rising living standards global warming and other influences a large fraction of the population will be confronted with chronic or absolute water scarcity due to rapidly dwindling supplies in turn this poses huge challenges for societies to adapt proactively in order to be better prepared for impending water crises many scholars have evidently shown that these crises are not only ongoing but also growing in size and magnitude nechifor and winning 64 highlight various studies projecting the future water demand in the face of socioeconomic development while kummu et al 5 review the historical development of water scarcity alcamo et al 58 arnell 59 alcamo et al 17 menzel and matovelle 61 schewe et al 22 gosling and arnell 23 among others forecast potential increases in water scarcity emerging hot spots that will be under severe water stress in the 2050s include many areas in the mena southern africa northern china as well as the west coast and northeast of latin america 17 on the other hand withdrawals are projected to stabilize or decrease in many industrialized nations due to per capita water use saturation lower population growth and technological innovations especially in the agricultural sector 17 this effect is not observed in developing countries until the second half of the century 17 although this broad literature base exists few have specifically incorporated the decoupling concept when looking at the future water situation in doing so this research advances the state of understanding global water resources and their management 2 3 the environmental kuznets curve frequently discussed in studies evolving the use of natural resources and gdp is the environmental kuznets curve ekc following kuznets 65 discovery of an inverted u relationship between the level of inequality and income per capita similar associations were made between environmental pressures and economic growth giving rise to the ekc the hypothesis holds that income growth will increase the pressure on an environmental indicator or a natural resource until a certain tipping point after which the trend reverses in this regard early studies were primarily focused on levels of pollution versus income 44 45 before more scholars attempted to find evidence of the inverted u relationship between natural resources and income however the literature base on the ekc correlation of water withdrawals and income remains narrow the first evidence on the inverted u relationship on this topic was presented by rock 66 in sequence gleick 67 cole 68 katz 43 gu et al 69 and others have examined the topic in various ways results of these studies are somewhat conflicting with some finding evidence of an inverted u relationship for example cole katz 68 43 while others do not for example gleick gu et al 67 69 in line with contrasting results from prior research katz 44 suggests that whether the ekc relationship exists for water withdrawals is highly dependent on not only the choice of datasets and methodology but also on country or region specific factors such as geography because of this katz duarte et al 44 45 dismiss the ekc as a poor predictor for country level patterns of water withdrawals limiting its use as a tool for predicting and planning broader criticisms of the ekc also exist elsewhere in literature 70 with no final judgment call made yet the present paper delivers more input on this discussion 3 data water withdrawal data at the country level is taken from the center for environmental systems research at the university of kassel http watclim cesr de included in the dataset are the years 1995 2025 2055 and 2075 due to lack of consistent and applicable country level data this dataset was chosen as the best available option water withdrawals per country are calculated using the watergap 2 2 water use model this is widely accepted as one of the best global hydrological models for research on water and is frequently used in water related studies 6 17 49 51 58 61 it is also the key model to compute comprehensive long term global or regional estimates of water withdrawals and availability 51 58 watergap projections depend on its parameter inputs which were left unchanged from alcamo et al 6 and alcamo et al 58 data for the three ssp scenarios analyzed is taken from the ssp database https tntcat iiasa ac at sspdb 46 this included country level gdp projections from 2010 until 2100 these gdp forecasts are differentiated by the relevant factors impacting economic growth such as demographic trends education globalization and trade openness technology etc 46 gdp data for the year 1995 is obtained from the world bank database https data worldbank org additional economic data for the control variables is also obtained from the world bank database these variables include the export share defined as exports of goods and services as a percentage of gdp the import share defined similarly as well as economic agriculture and industry shares both represented by percentage of gdp the share of agricultural land referring to the share of land area that is arable under permanent crops and under permanent pastures is also taken from the world bank population projections are obtained from the same dataset as the water withdrawal data http watclim cesr de the justification for including export and import shares separately is the following put simply both shares can have a significant impact on water withdrawals within a country a country whose economy heavily depends on exports will likely have higher water withdrawals in the sectors in which they produce the most exported goods industry for example on the other hand having a large import share may mean that the given country has lower water withdrawals because they are outsourcing water withdrawals to the exporting nations since the water is withdrawn for production in the latter this is reflected in 15 p 454 as many regions no longer depend solely on their local water resources but more and more on the combination of those with virtual water embedded in imports of water intensive products hence differences in supply chains can positively or negatively affect water withdrawals and need to be controlled for to appropriately assess the development of water withdrawals and dfs over time in similar fashion agriculture and industry are two of the largest water consuming sectors across the world in countries which rely heavily on these two sectors water withdrawals may increase disproportionately in relation to other nations not so dependent on agricultural and industrial production to control for this potential distortion agriculture and industry shares are included in the analysis all control variables except population growth are assumed to remain constant over the study period primarily because no reliable projections for future values and indicators exist in these cases this should be kept in mind when interpreting the results below as export import agricultural and industrial shares of gdp do tend to shift up and down over time however these minor shifts are not expected to cause major differences in the results as the effect size of these variables on the df is small and insignificant for some specifications table 1 presents summary statistics for the variables in the pooled dataset 3 1 country classifications the countries are clustered by several different classifications to assess where there are clustering of trends by different groups income groups are taken from the world bank database for the year 2020 https data worldbank org world bank s regional classifications centered around broad continents are taken to represent geographically defined regions lastly climate zones are defined through the field listing of the cia world factbook https www cia gov library publications the world factbook due to a lack of observations in each climate zone the original 10 climate zones are collapsed to four in the analysis the varying country classifications are shown in fig 1 3 2 water withdrawal scenarios a2 and b2 in this paper the impact of driving forces on water withdrawal are assessed assumptions and water withdrawal projections come from the a2 and b2 scenarios developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 71 two scenarios are applied to offset some of the high uncertainty of projections of water withdrawal drivers as done by alcamo et al 17 together they provide a broad range of estimates for important influential factors regarding water resources and absolute levels of future withdrawals 17 scenario a2 exhibits low population growth low to moderate economic growth accompanied by high increase in ghg emissions and climate change 17 however in comparison to other ipcc scenarios low levels of integration trade and technological diffusion are predicted alternatively b2 forecasts higher economic growth lower population and a strong emphasis on non climate related environmental policies as alcamo et al 17 highlight this results in lower rates of climate change than under a2 importantly these assumptions result in scenarios a2 projecting higher water withdrawals over time on average in comparison to scenarios b2 3 3 climate scenarios it is almost impossible to account for the high uncertainty regarding climate models it is attempted here through the application of two different models 1 the hadcm3 model of the hadley centre 72 73 and 2 the echam4 opyc3 model from the max planck institute of climatology 74 75 the aforementioned sources give a detailed description of each climate model in total the echam4 opyc3 climate model forecasts slightly lower water withdrawals over time the only difference between the two models is projected irrigation water withdrawals which are higher for the hadcm3 model domestic industrial and livestock water withdrawals over time are the same for both climate models 3 4 shared socioeconomic pathways ssps as predicting the future state of the world in any matter comes with much uncertainty the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps 76 framework has been adopted by various researchers it offers a way to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts socioeconomic development resource use adaptation and mitigation the framework was designed around a matrix combining climate forcing on one axis and socioeconomic conditions on the other a total of five ssp narratives exists providing descriptions of conceivable futures based on varying demographic economic lifestyle policy technological institutional and environmental changes 46 the five narratives are ssp1 sustainability ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 fragmented world ssp4 inequality ssp5 conventional development this analysis specifically focuses on ssp1 ssp2 and ssp5 in line with other literature on the topic 62 in this research the ssps are used to apply three possible ways in which societies will develop economically hence the major ssp input data are gdp projections over time the different ssp forecasts are reflected by the df differences produced by the three ssp scenarios for a detailed description of the ssps see moss et al o neill et al 77 78 and the iiasa ssp database https tntcat iiasa ac at sspdb with supplementary notes table 2 offers a summarized look at the most important points on the ssps incorporated in this analysis 46 the different input assumptions cause variations in gdp projections over time in most cases ssp5 results in the highest gdp growth for all years in the dataset followed by ssp1 with ssp2 having the lowest gdp projections for 2025 2055 and 2075 4 decoupling trends claims of a possible decoupling of gdp from resource use and environmental pressures were formulated as early as 1987 with un 79 reporting on the world s common future in sequence building on the prior concept of eco efficiency decoupling was advanced by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd in 2001 and has since become a crucial concept in sustainable development specifically decoupling entails increasing the efficiency with which value is derived from natural resources in order to reconcile indefinite economic growth with environmental sustainability 80 p 450 as defined above distinctions are made between absolute and relative decoupling however 55 argues that the differentiation between the two does not apply to water because global water resources are subject to spatial limitations instead of absolute scarcity additionally resource decoupling must be distinguished from impact decoupling 37 the latter concerns decoupling of gdp from ghg emissions whereas the former addresses decoupling of gdp from energy or material use 39 hence the present study focuses on resource decoupling gilmont 55 calls such decoupling analysis significant as it shows the political implications that decoupling has for resource use and security decoupling is measured using a decoupling factor which helps reveal long term opportunities for progressing toward sustainable development 40 to calculate the df we apply the following formula from the oecd 40 1 d f i t 1 e y i t e y i 0 where e represents the environmental pressure which in our case is percentage change in water withdrawal and y denotes the economic force which we measure using gdp growth the index denotes country i at time t the calculation is done in absolute values and is referenced to the base period denoted by t 0 which in our data is 1995 at best the df has a maximum value of 1 indicating absolute decoupling a value in between 0 and 1 suggests that some decoupling has occurred during the period whereas a negative value signals a coupling between the environmental pressure and gdp using the df simplifies cross country comparisons the oecd formula like any other potential decoupling formula does not come without critique for example casadio tarabusi and guarini 81 highlight several weaknesses of the oecd formula such as its boundedness at 1 with there being no lower bound as well as and the difficulty of distinguishing between absolute and relative decoupling hence the findings should be interpreted with some caution the use of three different ssps ssp1 ssp2 and ssp5 two different water withdrawal scenarios a2 and b2 and two different climate models hadcm3 and echam opyc3 across three future time periods 2025 2055 2075 results in a total of 36 scenarios being analyzed table 3 presents the average water withdrawal decoupling for each scenario in the analysis ssp5 conventional development scenarios consistently produce the highest dfs in each year this does not come unexpected as gdp growth is the highest in ssp5 and the df increases with higher rates of economic growth additionally b2 scenarios typically generate higher dfs than their a2 counterparts due to the fact that water withdrawal predictions are lower in b2 forecasts echam opyc3 scenarios yield higher decoupling results than hadcm3 models in most cases granted that differences are small the highest dfs in the second half of the century are produced by the echam opyc3 b2 ssp5 scenario on average water decoupling from gdp is relatively low until 2025 with a maximum average df of 0 45 fast forward 30 years and decoupling intensifies approaching values as high as 0 75 in 2075 decoupling is predicted to be common and widespread with some scenarios yielding dfs over 0 80 it is encouraging although not surprising to see this upward trend in water withdrawal decoupling over the course of the 21st century major reasons for increased decoupling over time are likely improved technologies greater water withdrawal efficiency and gdp growth however even in 2075 one or more countries depending on the scenario will still have negative decoupling of water withdrawal with the minimum df value being 0 74 jamaica in the years prior several more countries are predicted to produce negative dfs for example burundi has the lowest decoupling value for the year 2025 with 1 64 in the hadcm3 b2 ssp2 scenario on the other hand as early as 2025 some countries bosnia china etc experience extremely high water withdrawal decoupling with values above 0 89 the underlying calculated decoupling results form the basis for figs 2 and 3 these figures support the above discussed summary statistics for average water withdrawal decoupling per scenario in table 3 fig 2 illustrates the df distribution of each scenario the box plots depict global median values together with 25th to 75th percentile ranges whiskers represent 1st and 99th percentiles while outliers are presented as dots the figure shows that a lot of countries are still coupling in 2025 below the 0 threshold over time the positive trends are visible as the number of countries decoupling water withdrawals from economic growth consistently increases in this light the global median values rise the gap between the 25th and 75th percentile narrows outliers become fewer and many countries close the gap to those nations already producing high dfs as early as 2025 yet while some countries experience high water withdrawal decoupling others continuously lag behind with values below 0 overall the b2 scenarios paint the more optimistic picture with higher dfs over time for the remainder of the results section only decoupling results from the echam opyc3 ssp1 scenario are reported the reasoning for this is that it produces medium to high outcomes while following a desirable ssp1 scenario path that makes good progress toward sustainability and the sdgs see table 2 additionally b2 is considered a best case scenario in terms of societal and economic development as well as in respect to water withdrawal over time as it projects lower resource use than its a2 counterpart fig 3 illustrates decoupling results by income groups regions and climate zones fig 3a looks at the df by income groups based on the b2 scenario high and upper middle income countries perform better on average than countries on the lower income spectrum in 2025 by 2055 lower middle income countries catch up with the higher income nations while low income countries still lag behind in terms of water withdrawal decoupling when looking at median values however toward the end of the century there is little separation between the various income groups and their average decoupling performance in addition the minimum and maximum decoupling values for each income group show that there are positive high dfs and negative negative dfs examples in every faction for almost all years these trends hold for each ssp scenario in all b2 scenarios most income groups produce similar outcomes over time with low income countries catching up by 2075 this is not the case in a2 models in fact over time low income countries outperform higher income nations in these scenarios in a2 models lower income countries see relatively big rises in dfs in 2055 and 2075 in relation to the identical b2 models on the other hand higher income countries have better dfs in b2 than in a2 scenarios the main reason for this divergence is differences in water withdrawal projections between a2 and b2 models while higher income countries have lower levels of water withdrawal over time in b2 scenarios a2 models forecast increases in water withdrawals on the other hand low income countries have higher water withdrawals in b2 as opposed to a2 scenarios hence lower income nations have much lower dfs in b2 models while higher income countries perform better in these cases the opposite applies in a2 scenarios the dfs by regions are shown in fig 3b in the short run countries in europe and central asia north america as well as south asia produce the highest average dfs on the other hand latin american and caribbean and sub saharan africa perform by far the worst on average although these regions catch up slowly over time they do not reach the level of other regions by 2075 south asian countries are the best water withdrawal decoupling performers throughout the century on average fig 3c shows the df by climate zones here it is worth noting that the continental climate zone continuously sees the highest water withdrawal decoupling averages in all scenarios on the other hand countries with rather tropical climate lag behind and exhibit the highest variance among each other throughout the century while the results above clustered decoupling averages based on scenarios income groups regions and climate zones dfs by individual country are listed in appendix b specifically a ranking system was created to better visualize the decoupling performance of each of the 155 countries in the analysis in relation to others for each year in the study period countries were assigned a rank from 1 to 155 with 1 indicating highest df and 155 the opposite average ranks were calculated based on the individual country rank in each scenario the key takeaway of the ranked results is that industrialized countries are not necessarily ranked higher than emerging or still developing nations when it comes to future water withdrawal decoupling the main reason for this is likely the fact that the latter have higher rates of gdp growth in comparison to the former which are already highly developed and experience slower rates of economic growth this causes a ranking bias in favor of those countries with the highest projected gdp growths throughout the 21st century in addition countries performing well could be doing so because of water access issues for example countries like turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and iraq who all exhibit relatively high dfs throughout the 21st century also face high water stress see fig 5 this is concerning because resource constraints could paint a misleading decoupling picture such that high decoupling does not always represent a good thing hence it is important to not only look at the df but to complement it with an assessment of overall absolute trends in water withdrawals over time to paint a clearer picture of the future world water situation absolute withdrawal reductions are mainly occurring in developed countries and are more frequent in b2 scenarios this could be another indication for increased water stress rather than more efficient water withdrawal and use a more in depth and wholesome look at these developments is required beyond the findings of this research 5 what impacts decoupling past research has well established the link between the use of water resources and economic development to recap growing gdp is one of the principal causes of increasing water withdrawals and stress 17 47 61 62 the present study backs these findings fig 4 shows the relationship of per capita water withdrawal and per capita gdp in natural log terms for all the data points from the four years 1995 2025 2050 and 2075 the figure shows a positive correlation between the two variables this relationship is captured by the following regression model 2 l n w a t e r p e r c a p i t a i t β 0 β 1 l n g d p p e r c a p i t a i t β 2 l n g d p p e r c a p i t a i t 2 γ t β z z i t ε i t where w a t e r p c i t represents the log of per capita water withdrawal in country i in time t where time is represented by 1995 2025 2055 and 2075 the coefficients of interest in the first set of regressions are β 1 and β 2 the effect of log of per capita gdp and its squared term on per capita water withdrawal changes in a given country based on fig 4 β 1 is expected to be positive and significant while β 2 if significant is expected to be negative implying declining water withdrawal requirements over time relative decoupling the worst case scenario is β 2 being positive and significant suggesting an acceleration of per capita withdrawal quantity with gdp coupling for the variables natural log levels are used rather than growth terms this is done for two reasons first countries are at different stages of development and hence growth rates for lower income countries are expected to be higher relative to higher income countries since they have a lot of catching up to do second high income countries might have already achieved more efficient technologies that limit water withdrawals thus the potential for change is smaller here as well in contrast developing countries might still benefit greatly from technological improvements time fixed effects are represented by γ t to factor out trends over time control variable z i t includes population growth export import agricultural and industrial shares and the share of agricultural land summary statistics for these variables are presented in table 1 countries are assumed to have an independent slope and intercept therefore a fixed effects model is used the variation not explained by these variables is captured by the error term ε i t table 4 shows the results for various specifications of eq 2 all of which control for country fixed effects all regressions depict that water withdrawal increases with gdp at a decreasing rate which reinforces the prior results in suggesting that relative decoupling is occurring this relationship holds across the different regression specifications after controlling for time fixed effects columns 4 and 5 add additional region and income fixed effects which results in a slight decline of the l n g d p p c coefficient value implying that income and regions also impact decoupling very differently the ekc turning point was calculated by estimating the coefficients of the ln gdp per capita and its square terms or β 1 and β 2 respectively since it is a quadratic function the gdp values at which turning point happens is estimated as β 1 2 β 2 since we know how the gdp of each country is developing in relation to time we use linear trends to estimate which year the turning point will be achieved regardless of testing for various gdp forecasting measures the turning points are mostly estimated to be too far in the future to comment on or use as an underlying assumption of a robust and predictable relationship in this case table 5 shows eq 2 specification with controls added several factors play a role in water withdrawals changes with increasing population growth water withdrawals rise only marginally surprisingly higher export shares result in a slight decline in water withdrawals this could be attributed to high exporting countries already having better less water intensive technologies in place for the types of goods they are exporting for instance such countries may have implemented water efficient irrigation or other technologies at a greater scale than countries who are not as dependent on exports additionally these countries may focus on importing more water intensive products thereby reducing their water withdrawals through virtual water trade imports do not impact decoupling which is not surprising since imports embody withdrawals elsewhere having a higher share of agricultural land unsurprisingly increases withdrawals the last column in table 5 includes all controls to isolate their effects from the variable of interest tables 6 7 and 8 extend the analysis by exploring the impact of the control variables on withdrawals by region income group and climate zones each category is run separately to highlight which factors play a role in which region for all the regressions the full model specification shown in column 4 in table 5 is used for the various scenarios the tables highlight that differences between varying regions and climate zones become more evident for example in table 6 water withdrawals are positively correlated with gdp in all regions except in the mena and east asia and pacific eap where population growth is a bigger contributing factor to rising water withdrawals all regions show decreasing returns relative to gdp although some are not statistically significant in europe and central asia eca water withdrawals are significantly driven by agriculture and industry shares as well as the share of agricultural land furthermore given the expected population decline in eca the sign is also negative agriculture and industry shares are mostly net positive contributors to withdrawals while import and export shares reduce withdrawals across most regions the ekc turning points have already been crossed in eap and eca with the mena being next a clear divergence between a possible ekc relationship is evident between the various regions this supports katz 44 in that the ekc relationship is highly dependent on factors like geography making it a controversial measure table 7 shows the correlations of withdrawals by income groups interestingly all but low income nations show decreasing return to water withdrawals relative to gdp population growth contributes in all income groups while lower middle income countries see a decline in withdrawals relative to industry share the share of agricultural land is relevant for higher income groups again the ekc turning points are too far in the future to discuss with confidence table 8 illustrates the variations across the four climate zones water withdrawals are positively correlated with gdp at a decreasing rate in all climate zones population growth plays the most crucial role for all but the continental zone where the share of agricultural land and the industrial share of gdp are more relevant further results are mixed with different factors affecting withdrawals 6 discussion the above discussed results present whether water withdrawal decoupling is occurring throughout the world how water withdrawals are impacted by gdp growth and which factors are the most influential in driving decoupling across specific income groups regions and climate zones altogether they fulfill the objectives of this research attempting to assess country level water withdrawal decoupling trends and the connection to geographical location climate and income groups explaining why decoupling is happening in certain countries and not in others was beyond the scope of this analysis and input data the primary decoupling analysis portrays that water withdrawal decoupling intensifies throughout the 21st century by 2075 water withdrawal decoupling is predicted to be common and widespread across the globe averaging dfs as high as 0 86 overall ssp5 scenarios produce the highest average dfs due to their high economic growth projections followed by ssp1 with sustainable development at its core the findings add to the existing literature on decoupling suggesting that long term water withdrawal decoupling is possible and projected for the 21st century short run projections have higher income countries experiencing more water withdrawal decoupling than lower income countries the latter are projected to bridge the gap and catch up until 2075 in fact lower income nations actually outperform higher income nations in regard to average dfs in all a2 scenarios by the end of the study period when ranking all countries based on their decoupling scores see appendix b industrialized countries are not necessarily ranked higher than emerging or developing nations regional differences exist as countries in europe and central asia north america and south asia produce the highest average dfs latin american and caribbean as well as sub saharan africa lag behind overall decoupling trends regional location and climate zone are strongly associated with and appear as important drivers of country level water withdrawal decoupling outcomes contrarily income group differences only play a role in the short run with higher income nations averaging higher rates of decoupling however by 2075 this disparity becomes negligible as lower income countries catch up in this light overall gdp growth seems to be a more important factor than initial country level income clusters various scholars have identified the mena southern africa and latin america as emerging hot spots facing severe water stress by 2050 see figs 2 and 5 unfortunately these three regions were also identified as those with the lowest average water withdrawal decoupling across all continental regions see fig 3 placing increased attention on trying to generate greater water withdrawal decoupling through the below discussed coping strategies offers policymakers in these regions a chance to proactively fight the impending crises higher decoupling would help avert worst case water stress scenarios to visualize this relationship fig 5 illustrates countries dfs and their water stress levels however water withdrawal decoupling is very country context specific decoupling means different things for each country and it is not entirely clear why it is happening for some and not for others high dfs could for example result simply because access to water is an issue in this light limited water withdrawals due to a lack of the resource in the first place could result in misleadingly high water withdrawal dfs this is a concerning scenario exposing countries in the top right quadrant to high risk in relation to future water resources thus it is not only important to achieve greater efficiency in relation to water resources but to also keep track of absolute volumes of withdrawn water instances where absolute water withdrawal volumes decrease are mainly predicted to occur in developed countries and more frequently in b2 scenarios these trends need to be included in the bigger picture further this research attempted to shed more light on the ongoing discussion of a possible ekc relationship between water and gdp however signs do not point toward an evident robust inverted u relationship for water withdrawals and income at the country level limiting the usefulness of the ekc assumption in this regard 6 1 discussion on coping strategies two important questions remain unanswered how can the presented information be used and how can countries and regions struggling to make meaningful progress toward greater water withdrawal decoupling be guided toward the right direction first the analysis highlights that positive examples for water withdrawal decoupling exist across all income groups regions and climate zones as early as 2025 these should serve as best practice cases for struggling nations to aspire to for instance croatia can look to its neighbor bosnia to create equivalent long term water withdrawal decoupling success in this light countries like croatia could specifically assess how and with what means bosnia and others are achieving desired water withdrawal decoupling similarly even entire regions like the latin america and the caribbean may model themselves after thriving regions like south asia in this regard having projected dfs throughout the 21st century laid out allows policymakers to collaborate proactively and change the course of the future world water situation the fact that decoupling becomes common and widespread over time is an indicator for more efficient technologies paving the way toward greater water withdrawal productivity improved efficiency is also possible through water policy reforms as suggested by rosegrant et al 82 and more intelligently coordinated distribution 83 additionally increased research funding and better water system infrastructure can lead to advances in agricultural production per unit of water or water conservation efforts for example wallat 83 for this purpose governments industry and researchers need to work together collect information and openly share data 12 84 being a collective action problem 27 collaboration stakeholder engagement and regional water management solutions are essential in improving the outlook on looming water crises 85 many important projects on water are ongoing they range from new solutions on water supply technological innovations flood management climate change impacts to water resource and reuse management 12 in this light wastewater transformations are recognized as a major opportunity to alter water resource management and present several ways of curbing water withdrawals yet it must be acknowledged that strategies to cope with worsening water situations are regionally dependent for instance short medium and long run actions can be specifically tailored to sub saharan africa 86 following the suggestions of these authors could cause sub saharan africa to see an increase in long term water withdrawal decoupling additionally not all regions may be able to diversify their economy due to climate conditions and thus have to concentrate on other efforts a more global approach could rely on expanded virtual water trade among others 55 has identified virtual water trade as a way of alleviating national water limits porkka et al 15 highlight reduced exports of water intensive products as an option to reduce pressure on water resources along with more traditional hard and soft measures alternatively countries who have insufficient technologies may favor a switch to more imports of water intensive goods which can be produced more efficiently elsewhere 15 all the above strategies represent viable solutions to curb impending water crises around the world built on the mechanisms driving decoupling introduced by gilmont 54 55 41 in this way they would not only decrease their absolute water withdrawals but also increase water withdrawal decoupling a meaningful measure en route toward achieving the sdgs and overall sustainability it is recommended that policymakers and other stakeholders act today instead of tomorrow 7 conclusions the world water situation is becoming increasingly worse with more and more countries experiencing water stress and shortages this no longer primarily applies to developing countries but is happening all across the world even the world s leading nations are predicted to encounter water shortages under business as usual forecasts with 83 citing germany as an example the looming crises make sustainable water management a more pressing need now than ever before in this regard placing increased importance on decoupling water withdrawal from economic growth offers a viable solution for local regional and global policymakers for this reason the present study attempted to shed light on this topic which was identified as an evident gap in the current literature base by assessing 21st century water withdrawal decoupling projections in 155 countries in sum water withdrawal decoupling is predicted to increase throughout the course of the century and will become common and widespread by 2075 although some countries will seemingly be left behind in this development these are predominantly located in latin america and the caribbean as well as sub saharan africa however when ranking all countries based on their water withdrawal dfs industrialized nations are not necessarily ranked higher than emerging or still developing countries in fact many of the latter rank among the top especially toward the end of the study period this is likely due to high projected gdp growth in relation to 1995 in comparison with current high income nations who do not experience rapid economic growth anymore thus overall gdp growth is more important in driving high dfs than current income group designations in addition country specific climate zone and regional location appear to have greater impacts on water withdrawal decoupling than income group classifications it is also clear that the importance and significance of the various influential drivers varies among and within the different income groups regions or climate zones this is one of the reasons why we found little evidence in support of a possible ekc relationship between water withdrawals and gdp at the country level putting the usefulness of the ekc assumption for country level water withdrawals into question the calculated ekc turning points were mostly too far in the future to point toward a robust and clear inverted u relationship projecting water withdrawal decoupling at the global scale allows for the identification of best practices by countries who already produce high dfs for diagnosing problems in regions who are lagging behind and for pinpointing patterns of change these and more can be the starting point for future research additionally to paint a clearer picture dfs need to be complemented by holistic assessments of absolute water withdrawal reductions in depth analyses should look into explaining why decoupling is occurring in certain areas but not in others and specifically lay out best practices impending water crises across the globe can be tackled through many measures including technological advances water policy reforms collaboration in governance and science wastewater transformations virtual water trade etc insights into the trends and influential drivers of future water withdrawal decoupling from this study are hoped to provide input into the proper implementation of effective coping strategies for a better outlook on the world water situation in this way decoupling provides a pathway to a more water wise world credit authorship contribution statement felix dalstein conceptualization methodology formal analysis resources writing project administration asjad naqvi methodology validation
