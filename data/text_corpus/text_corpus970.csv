4850,this paper provides a review of over thirty years of research and investigation in the woodville karst plain wkp in northern florida which is representative of the floridan aquifer system a karst aquifer in the southeastern united states the wkp is a well developed karst region where over 40 km of subsurface conduits are mapped by divers and tracer tests and connected to wakulla spring one of the largest freshwater springs in the u s furthermore the conduit networks expand and interact with seawater via the connection to a submarine spring and impact groundwater flow cycle in the aquifer numerical models based on multiple field investigations have been developed to quantify the understanding of hydrogeologic processes in the wkp novel modeling approaches with capabilities were developed to simulate seawater and groundwater interaction in this dual permeability aquifer the wkp site has served as a valuable natural observatory for a series of studies documented in this paper to understand groundwater flow contaminant transport and seawater intrusion in the well developed karst subsurface system keywords karst dual permeability groundwater flow solute transport seawater intrusion 1 introduction karst is a unique landscape containing caves and extensive underground water systems that is developed by dissolution in the carbonate rocks such as limestone and gypsum ford and williams 1989 fourteen percent of earth s land surface consists of the carbonate rock outcrop that forms karst chen et al 2017a 2017b ford and williams 1989 reported that karst aquifer systems supply potable water to nearly 25 of the world s population in addition to drinking water resources the karst terrains are usually major resources for building materials and have economic benefits for example cave tourism typical karst features are sinkholes and dolines on land surface and the network of voids caves and conduits below the surface formed by the dissolution of the soluble carbonate rocks the open and porous nature of a karst aquifer combined with the dissolution of joints and fractures within the bedrocks over a geological time evolve complex subsurface conduit systems davis 1996 compared to a porous medium a karst aquifer is typically a dual porosity system where groundwater and solutes move rapidly through conduits ritter et al 2002 scanlon et al 2003 martin and dean 2001 indicated that water and solute exchanges between conduits and their porous media in a dual permeability karst aquifer system as a result karst aquifers are particularly vulnerable for groundwater contamination or seawater intrusion arthur et al 2007 kuniansky 2008 during a high flow event contaminants in the conduit system are actively pushed into the carbonate matrix because that water pressure in the conduit is higher than the matrix faulkner et al 2009 hu 2010 during a low flow event contaminants stored in the surrounding porous medium are slowly released into the conduit system and greatly extend the period of remediation besides contamination subsidence from sinkhole collapses are the other major geohazards in the karst region kuniansky et al 2016 gutiérrez et al 2008 classified sinkholes geohazards into two major types as cover collapse and cover subsidence and pointed out that both are sensitive to drought rainfall and groundwater level fluctuation additionally extreme precipitation urban expansion construction and well drilling can change the aquifer structure and groundwater level that increase the vulnerability of sinkhole geohazards in the karst region in recent years advanced techniques including lidar wu et al 2016 ert electrical resistivity tomography and gpr ground penetrating radar sevil et al 2017 and machine learning zhu et al 2020 have been adopted to identify and monitor karst sinkholes broadly karst research community has established multiple focal study sites to characterize the hydrogeology condition gain insights of physical processes and improve the predictive capabilities in karst regions for example the institute of geochemistry chinese academy of science established the puding karst ecological system research station since 2000s to study runoff response to climate change and human activities e g xu et al 2018a 2018b 2018c rocky desertification e g yang et al 2011 and soil co2 storage e g yang et al 2012 also in southwest china the team of unesco international karst research center and institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences maintained well investigated karst experimental sites at yaji and maocun near guilin a series of tracer tests e g jiang et al 2015 isotope analysis e g guo et al 2015 and soil characterizations e g huang et al 2015 hui et al 2015 have been aggregated to investigate the hydrogeological and karst carbon sink dynamic yang et al 2015 in slovenia podstenjšek springs catchment is an example of the experimental site that is well characterized by the team of karst research institute in slovenia and more widely karst research community in europe groundwater vulnerability estimation and risk mapping in this small karst watershed have been conducted using tracer tests ravbar and goldscheider 2007 cop method vías et al 2010 and electrical conductivity ravbar et al 2011 the gottesacker alpine karst system is another well mapped and geologically complex long term study site at the germany and austria border goldscheider 2008 and göppert et al 2005 used numerous tracer tests to investigate the limestone geological layers and the major flowpath connecting to three springs in the karst aquifer chen and goldscheider 2014 simulated groundwater flow in the catchment using a spatially distributed numerical model based on extensive pre existing geological mapping then improved the model by calibration chen et al 2017a 2017b 2018 in the united states an integrated interdisciplinary research effort has been established on the savoy experimental watershed led by the university of arkansas to investigate karst evolution at this site perne et al 2014 used numerical models to estimate the impacts of pressurized flow and free surface flow on karst conduit network evolution covington and vaughn 2019 estimated the co2 and karst dissolution rate dynamics under a changing flow condition the woodville karst plain wkp is representative of the highly karstified part of the floridan aquifer in the southeastern u s at the same time the wkp is also a representative site in the coastal karst regions fleury et al 2007 including mediterranean bakalowicz 2015 and yucatan karst regions bauer gottwein et al 2011 where a conduit system is interconnected between large springs and the ocean via submarine springs the wkp has one of the longest and most extensive mapped subsurface karst conduit networks in the world the wkp is unique subsurface passageways in the wkp are below the water table and fully saturated hypogenic karst except at connections with sinkholes and springs on land surface the wkp is vulnerable to sinkhole geohazards as the groundwater table is shallow and surface runoff enters the submerged conduit system rapidly through sinks part of the subsurface conduit network is connected directly to the gulf of mexico via submarine springs under different hydrologic conditions flow direction within conduit network can be either seaward when fresh groundwater discharges into the gulf at the submarine spring or landward when seawater intrudes via the same submarine springs seawater and groundwater interaction could have significant impacts on the groundwater flow field in the wkp because the topography is flat and the hydraulic gradients are small this synthesis paper reviews both the field investigations and modeling developments for understanding karst hydrogeology in the wkp in the end the paper highlights several key achievements and shared the insights for future karst research in the wkp and possibly other karst regions 2 site description and field investigations 2 1 hydrogeology conditions the woodville karst plain wkp encompasses about 1300 km2 and is bounded to the north by the cody scarp near the city of tallahassee to the west by the apalachicola national forest to the east by the water divide of st marks river and to the south by the gulf of mexico fig 1 rolling hills are the major topography in the study area and land surface altitudes range from 30 to 60 m above sea level asl at the north of the cody scarp south of the scarp land surface altitudes are generally less that 15 m asl characterized by closed basins typical of karst terrains the climate is humid subtropical with relatively high precipitation the average annual temperature in tallahassee is 19 4 celsius degree and the average annual precipitation is about 1557 mm per year the average potential evapotranspiration in the wkp ranged from 1319 to 1377 mm per year xu et al 2015a 2015b wakulla springs and spring creek springs complex scsc are the two major karst features on the surface and first magnitude springs in the wkp the group of wakulla springs is one of the largest springs in the floridan aquifer as well as the entire southeast of united states davis 1996 florida spring task force 2000 located 19 km from the shoreline 23 km upstream from the gulf along the wakulla river wakulla springs which has a single giant vent of 30 m diameter with several small vents nearby forms the headwaters of the wakulla river the depth of wakulla springs cave is estimated to be about 60 m near the origin extended to 100 m and even 120 m deep at some locations florida springs task force 2000 discharge at wakulla springs is nearly 11 m3 s during the dry season in average and peaks as large as 40 50 m3 s during a heavy rainfall event usually after a tropical storm or a hurricane the elevation of the riverbed at wakulla springs is about 1 5 m above sea level the elevation is critical in the groundwater flow field in the wkp and could determine that groundwater either discharging at the wakulla spring or diverting southward to the submarine scsc under different rainfall recharge and sea level conditions that are discussed in the following sections scsc are a group of 14 individual submarine spring vents near the shoreline and vents no 1 and no 10 are two major discharge spots florida springs task force 2000 the largest vent diameter can be as large as 15 m but the exact locations diameter and discharges of the vents are difficult to accurately explore and measure because they are submerged under sea level in the bay freshwater discharge is negligible or even reversely during the dry season when the vents are filled with seawater discharge however can be over 50 m3 s during a heavy rainfall event davis and verdi 2014 the upper floridan aquifer ufa is a part of the floridan aquifer system that underlies the entire state of florida and parts of georgia south carolina and alabama a comprehensive investigation of the hydrological framework in the wkp was conducted by miller 1986 and further explored by williams and kuniansky 2016 and briefly generalized in fig 2 most of hydrogeology research in the wkp focuses on the tertiary through quaternary age limestone dolostone clay and sand with varying degrees of lithification the paleocene clayton formation is a layer of low permeability massive calcareous marine clay on the bottom of the study area also the confining unit floridan aquifer system the eocene permeable limestone sediments are subdivided into three layers from the oldsmar formation on the bottom the avon park formation in the middle and the youngest ocala limestone layer the permeable to very permeable suwannee limestone formation is the only layer in oligocene series right above the oligocene sediments the chattahoochee formation the st marks formation and the hawthorn group are three miocene layers with significant different characteristics the bottom two layers are highly permeable to relatively impermeable in which dolostone is the major sediments in the chattahoochee formation with small portion of others components such as quartz sand clay calcite and limestone huddlestun 1988 and the st marks formation is predominantly fine to medium grained silty to sandy limestone however the hawthorn group is an impermeable layer with mostly clay and sand significantly different hydrological characteristics with the limestone formations huddlestun 1988 miccosukee formation represents the pliocene sediments with commonly sandy and silty clay the hawthorn group and miccosukee formation are not present at south of the cody scarp in most of the wkp domain and can be only observed in the northern part of the study area as an impermeable hydrogeological unit over most of the wkp the floridan aquifer system is considered unconfined as most of the more recent units that form the upper confining unit of the floridan aquifer are thin or absent in the south of the cody scarp williams and kuniansky 2016 in the quaternary system undifferentiated terrace and shallow marine deposit consists of the pleistocene sediments and the thin sand and gravel accumulation deposits are the major components of holocene series carbonate limestone is the major porous medium in the study area which is characterized by an uneven distribution of heterogeneous permeability due to extremely high permeable fractures and conduits bush and johnston 1988 openings in loosely cemented limestone and mosaics of many fractures and solution widened joints can be found in the study region davis 1996 many fractures cavities and conduits with sizes ranging from less than 0 3 m to larger than 15 m in diameter are observed in the wkp most field and modeling investigations were limited in the upper floridan aquifer ufa within 200 m deep below surface where karst features are mainly located the details of karst features are introduced in the following section 2 2 woodville karst plain project wkpp and conduit network the wkpp was established in 1985 and extended in the 1990s to map the underwater cave system underlying the wkp cave diving and dye tracers were employed to explore the subsurface karst conduit networks extensively from numerous springs and sinkholes in the wkp including wakulla springs the leon sinks cave system lost sink and the scsc near the coast cave diving activities are extremely difficult in the karst region due to the safety requirements and unknown subsurface environment and particularly dangerous when deep underwater passageways are explored or narrow conduits that extend long distances wkpp hold the world s record for the longest distance explored by divers specifically as far as 7860 m one way from wakulla spring at an average depth of 84 m the wkpp also holds the world s record for the longest traverse by divers between two known entry points 10 909 m one way between turner sink and wakulla springs at an average depth of 84 m the wkpp also holds the record for exploring and mapping more cave passageways below 64 m than any other organization in the world in total wkpp explorers have mapped and explored 54 km of conduit system in 2015 based on multiple news sources wkpp mapped an extended well developed conduit system beneath wakulla springs and further extended within the wkp starting at the main vent of wakulla springs cave explorers identified cave passages as tunnels with alphabetic letter designation the conduit system runs southwest until it meets the confluence of the north oriented b tunnel and the south oriented c tunnel fig 3 the b tunnel initially trends eastward then turns northward in the general direction of the southeast sprayfield of the city of tallahassee turf sink and st marks spring the main conduit then extends westward until it bifurcates at the junction of south north oriented a tunnel and the north south oriented d tunnel the a tunnel continues to the junction of the a and k tunnels the south oriented k tunnel eventually intersects with the r tunnel which runs northward into multiple creeks and sinkholes for example fisher creek black creek and emerald sink the major sources of regional recharge from northern wkp to wakulla springs south of the a tunnel is the q tunnel which trends southward towards the gulf coast and is presumed to connect with the scsc conduit system the exploration of the submarine caves scsc by cave divers was very difficult due to complicated flow conditions especially when seawater is siphoning however cave divers in scsc found an extensive karstic network joined by deep vertical conduits the submarine caves trended approximately 45 m to the north of the spring vent and reached a depth of about 50 m below sea level kincaid and werner 2008 the depths of scsc are believed to be approximate 90 m especially at no 1 and no 10 vents which are the biggest and major conduit outlets however divers were not able to reach the cave bottom therefore the estimated depth is only available by assuming the submarine spring has the same depth as wakulla springs davis and verdi 2014 the conduit systems at scsc are believed to separate as two tunnels in which one tunnel is oriented northeastward to wakulla springs and the other is oriented northwestward to lost creek along with the cave diver activities a series of tracer tests with dye have been used to identify and quantify the connectivity among sinks and springs within the wkp kincaid et al 2005 performed tracer tests from the leon sink system including fisher creek sink black creek sink emerald sink and ames sink group of swallets where they receive approximately 60 of the city of tallahassee s stormwater runoff southward to wakulla spring the results revealed that groundwater velocity ranged from 1500 to over 2000 m day through the portion of the conduit network the experiments highlighted that quantitative tracing results should be considered in modeling and predictive studies and rapid velocity reaffirmed the existence of high permeable groundwater flow pathways kincaid and werner 2008 further conducted tracer tests from the southeast sprayfield of tallahassee and turf pond sink to wakulla springs the tracers travelled 17 5 km in 56 days with an averaged velocity of 313 m day still two or five orders of magnitude faster than the transmissivity of 0 03 15 m day in the porous medium from pumping tests bush and johnston 1988 geochemical age data and isotope tracers katz et al 2004 to the south of wakulla spring tracer tests by kincaid et al 2012 reported the existence of extremely high permeable conduit networks connecting scsc wakulla spring and lost creeks where groundwater tracing velocity is found at 2 4 km day from lost creek sink to scsc radon isotope was also used as a natural tracer at scsc to investigate the conduit connectivity and suggested a direct connection between the deep and surficial aquifers through karst features dimova et al 2011 in summary tracer tests reveal the high permeable complicated subsurface connectivity exists and connects numerous karst features in the wkp 2 3 coastal processes and interaction with sea level evolution of carbonate rocks in the upper floridan aquifer and the development of large conduits are strongly related to the sea level fluctuation between the inland and present coastline in geological history large parts of the florida platform were exposed to karst formation processes during periods of low sea level resulting in deep conduits that are now part of submarine spring systems fleury et al 2007 the presence of submarine springs and conduits are passageways for seawater to move landward and potentially contaminated fresh water however the investigations of seawater intrusion which leads to brackish groundwater along the coast rarely addresses the groundwater flow inside of karst features fleury et al 2007 the wkp is a typical coastal karst aquifer with seawater intrusion where topography is extremely flat and the interaction between seawater and freshwater is particularly important and can be significant to the flow field groundwater flow and spring discharges in the wkp are affected by the coastal boundary condition loper et al 2005 reported that the discharge at wakulla springs is correlated with the tide level in apalachee bay particularly during storm event since the spring discharges responds to rainfall events with similar magnitude patterns and durations in late 2003 florida geological survey installed six falmouth 2d acm acoustic flowmeters in the conduits proximal to the main vent at wakulla spring these flowmeters are located between 85 and 95 m below land surface in the b c d ad ak and k tunnels fig 3 in late 2009 three additional meters were installed at three sites south of the wakulla vent one meter was placed in the conduit beneath revell sink approximately four miles southwest of wakulla spring and two meters were installed at scsc vent 1 and scsc vent 10 these nine flowmeters record five parameters at 15 min or hourly intervals average speed of flow electrical conductivity water pressure water temperature and average flow direction these meters are used in conjunction with a network of in situ level troll devices measuring the water levels in karst windows connected to the deeper conduit system the usgs also maintained a gage at scsc in 2007 recording gage height electrical conductivity salinity and the aggregate discharge for 12 of the 14 vents at scsc xu et al 2016 according to the three year observation of the spring discharges in the wkp from june 2007 to june 2010 davis and verdi 2014 developed the three phases of dynamic hydrologic conditions where seawater interacts with groundwater at the two major first magnitude springs wakulla spring and scsc via the connected conduit networks fig 4 the flow in scsc was most sensitive to rainfall and seawater intrusion and the flow in wakulla springs was affected by rainfall and the flow in scsc three repeating phases are summarized phase 1 occurred during low rainfall periods and was characterized by seawater backflow into the scsc caves the higher density seawater blocked fresh water flow and resulted in a higher equivalent fresh water head in scsc than in wakulla springs the blocked fresh water was diverted to wakulla springs approximately doubling its discharge phase 2 occurred when heavy rainfalls resulted in high creek flows to nearby sinkholes that purged the mixing seawater from the scsc caves phase 3 occurred after streams returned to base flow fig 5 the equivalent freshwater head in the subsurface conduit is calculated as high as 2 5 m when the scsc are filled with seawater assuming that the depth of the conduit network is 91 m same as the depth beneath wakulla spring seawater intrusion is possibly extended further inland as the equivalent freshwater head at scsc is even higher than the riverbed elevation at wakulla springs based on the ten year flowmeter data xu et al 2016 analyzed the spatial orientation of conduits in which the rising conductivity values are measured the geospatial pattern of maximum conductivity within the conduits and the spatiotemporal pattern associated with the periods of rising conductivity values strong evidence was reported that seawater could intrude as far as 22 km inland to wakulla spring this was not only the first documented case of seawater intrusion at scsc migrating to wakulla spring but also the longest documented extent of seawater intrusion through subsurface conduit networks in the wkp although salinity is still low and below drinking water standard near the wakulla springs this study affirms davis and verdi s 2014 seawater freshwater interaction conceptual model and raised the concerns of deteriorated seawater intrusion contamination in the wkp particularly under the conditions of sea level rise and more severe groundwater pumping in addition to seawater intrusion water quality issues of the dark colored water at wakulla spring have been observed with long durations in recent years and is relevant to the interaction of seawater and freshwater the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is believed as the source of dark water color in the system kulakowski 2010 sampled and quantified the cdom level by colorimetric light absorption for five blackwater intermittent streams draining into the sinks connected to wakulla springs and reported a relationship of changing precipitation groundwater usage and decreased water clarity at wakulla spring luzius et al 2018 collected the cdmo samples and confirmed the connectivity of wakulla spring with apalachicola national forest in the west boundary of the wkp the seasonality of dark water due to high concentration of cdmo in the inland spring comes from the forest and is affected by sea level rise and anthropogenic impacts periods of dark water color are consistent with the phase 1 of the groundwater flow cycling conceptual model davis and verdi 2014 elevated sea level in the recent years extends the equivalent freshwater head and extent of seawater intrusion at the scsc diverted the dark color water from the apalachicola national forest northward to the wakulla springs 3 modeling developments in the wkp 3 1 groundwater flow and solute transport modeling in a dual permeability karst system groundwater flow modeling development in the wkp started in the 1990s davis 1996 investigated the hydrogeology of the upper floridan aquifer and developed a modflow groundwater flow model within the north central florida and southwestern georgia where the wkp is a subset of the domain based on hydrogeological investigation the modflow model and particle tracking techniques were used to delineate the groundwater flow pattern in the area and estimate water resources availability for the city of tallahassee the calculated groundwater flow velocity ranges from 0 3 m day to 0 5 m day assuming a 25 porosity or 0 73 m day to 2 25 m day assuming a 5 porosity simulation results were found to be equivalent to analytical analysis based on the model developed by davis 1996 davis and katz 2007 updated the modflow model to enhance the understanding of the groundwater flow system for contamination remediation groundwater ages derived by geochemical analyses from tritium 3h chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 were used to determine effective porosity along with the flow model and particle tracking analysis an ensemble of modflow simulations were designed with different hydraulic conductivities to determine the 5 year probabilistic contributing areas of the water supply wells for the city of tallahassee davis et al 2010 subset the previous larger scale modflow model to focus on the wakulla spring springshed a refined resolution 150 meter long term 1986 2018 modflow groundwater flow and mt3dms solute transport model were developed to investigate the nitrate n movement from a treated municipal wastewater facility and other sources the refined model was calibrated to the discharge and nitrate n concentration measured at wakulla spring the flow and transport simulations started in 1966 when the wastewater sprayfield became operational nitrate n concentration at wakulla spring reached the highest level in 1986 when nitrate n loading peaked at about 600 000 kg yr the sprayfields were completely shut down in 2004 and the simulation continues through 2018 simulated nitrate n concentration decreases but contamination plumes remain in some regions after 2004 nitrate n transported rapidly through the high permeability karst conduit network accumulated in the downstream of the wakulla springshed and formed multiple disconnected contamination plumes in the wkp fig 6 the modflow model in davis et al 2010 implements the subsurface conduit network with large values of hydraulic conductivity and porosity however appropriate estimations of hydraulic conductivity and porosity are challenging at where conduits are well developed because the subsurface karst features are usually smaller than the 150 meter grid resolution in the model more importantly groundwater flow within the conduit networks usually become non laminar and is quantified as reynolds number which is low for laminar flow while high for turbulent flow darcy s law is invalid for describing groundwater flow when the reynolds number is greater than 10 reynolds number for groundwater flow in the subsurface karst conduit networks can be easily exceed the critical value to overcome this issue hybrid discrete continuum numerical models have been developed tested and verified as an appropriate approach to simulate groundwater flow in a dual permeability system for example the well developed karst aquifer with conduit networks kiraly 1998 hybrid models couple the conduit flow in the discrete pipes with darcian flow in the continuum porous medium for example clemens et al 1996 and liedl et al 2003 developed the cave carbonate aquifer void evolution model based on a hybrid approach later the discrete cfp conduit flow process package of modflow 2005 as modflow cfp was initially developed by shoemaker et al 2008 and further improved by reimann et al 2013 to enable simulations of unsaturated conduit flow conduit associated drainable storage cads and time variable boundary condition tvbc for the reasons discussed above the wkp modflow model in davis et al 2010 was further enhanced as the modflow cfp mode 1 by gallegos et al 2013 by replacing high permeability and porosity karst features with the pipes embedded in porous media explicitly the groundwater flow within a conduit is computed by the darcy weisbash equation which is applicable in both laminar and non laminar flow while the groundwater flow in the porous medium around the conduit features are still simulated by darcy s law the exchange flux between conduits and porous medium is calculated by a linear approximation of head difference at each conduit node embedded in the modflow grid cell gallegos et al 2013 compared modflow and modflow cfp results with observed discharge at two springs and found that the modflow cfp model more closely simulated peak discharge kuniansky 2016 further assessed the simulation results of modflow modflow cfp mode 1 and cfp mode 2 for the springflow at wakulla spring and found that the peak discharge is overestimated by modflow while underestimated by modflow cfp mode 1 nonetheless kuniansky 2016 reaffirmed that the ability to simulate non laminar flow is important for simulation of large storm events when non laminar flow affects discharge during the storm event if matching springflow hydrographs are desired in addition to groundwater flow modeling the hybrid discrete continuum model is further extended to simulate contaminant transport in the karst aquifer davis et al 2010 used mt3dms a widely used numerical model that uses the groundwater flow solution from modflow zheng and wang 1999 however mt3dms is only applicable for solute transport with darcian flow in a porous medium such as a sandstone or alluvial aquifer spiessl et al 2007 modified the mt3d source code and developed rumt3d three dimensional reactive underground multispecies transport a coupled reactive hybrid transport model with cave to simulate solute transport and chemical reactions in a karst aquifer xu et al 2015a utilized the cfpv2 remiann et al 2011 the research version of modflow cfp with the capabilities of coupling with umt3d to simulate hybrid flow and nitrate n transport in the wkp fig 6 this hybrid groundwater flow and transport model simulated the nitrate n contamination over a historical period the combination of cfpv2 and umt3d improved the nitrate n breakthrough curve prediction at the wakulla springs and verified that conduit networks are major passageways for contaminant transport in the wkp 3 2 modeling of groundwater interaction with seawater inspired by the conceptual model for groundwater flow cycling davis and verdi 2014 and previous field investigations xu et al 2015b modified the modflow cfp model by gallegos et al 2013 and implemented an equivalent freshwater head at scsc to simulate the three phase groundwater flow cycling described in davis and verdi 2014 equivalent freshwater heads are computed by the salinity measurements at the submarine scsc the simulated discharge at wakulla spring and scsc were compared with observed values the model predicted the discharges under sea level rise scenarios and reaffirmed with hypothesis that the increasing discharge at wakulla spring is potentially associated with the rising sea level from 1920 to 2020 fig 4 davis and verdi 2014 to improve the understanding of seawater intrusion through conduits in the modeling xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b xu et al 2018c developed a two dimensional density dependent seawat model guo and langevin 2002 along the transect of a subsurface conduit and evaluated the parameter sensitivities in the model the model simulates groundwater flow cycling under dry and wet rainfall conditions as well as boundary conditions such as sea level key simulation result included the estimation of seawater intrusion extent that could be as far as 3 km from the coastline through the deep subsurface conduit network the two dimensional seawat model along the transect of conduit network was further upscaled to a three dimensional model in the wkp subregion domain by xu et al 2019b to better evaluate the interaction of seawater and freshwater interaction and the mixing process compared to the nitrate n transport model in the wkp davis et al 2010 xu et al 2015a 2015b vertical discretization is refined in the three dimensional seawat model with 12 layers to be able to accurately represent the mixing zone between freshwater and seawater in the aquifer fig 7 most density dependent groundwater flow models for example seawat guo and langevin 2002 are only able to simulate darcian flow and assume a linear relationship between specific discharge and head gradient to improve the capability of simulating the interaction of seawater and freshwater in the karst aquifer with submarine conduit network for example the wkp novel density dependent hybrid discrete continuous numerical models have been developed xu and hu 2017 developed the vdfst cfp model to couple the density dependent groundwater flow and salt transport for the non darcian flow in the conduit and darcian flow in the porous medium the newly developed model was validated by benchmarking with multiple models including modflow modflow cfp and seawat under equivalent conditions xu et al 2019a further improved the vdfst cfp model by implementing double conduit networks and quantifying micro texture on the conduit wall by the goudar sonnad equation and considering macro structures as local head loss although the vdfst cfp model has many limitations for example is only able to simulate groundwater flow in the fully saturated conduit in the 2d spatial domain due to the computational constraints it is the first attempt to develop a hybrid discrete continuum numerical model for a density dependent groundwater flow coupled with salt transport the novel code developments prompted the modeling of seawater freshwater interaction and created a platform for incorporating more complicated physical and chemical processes in the coastal karst aquifer simulations 4 summary and future perspectives woodville karst plain wkp has become one of the most intensively investigated karst study sites in the world several major science achievements are highlighted as follows the wkpp mapped the longest conduit network recorded in the world and performed multiple tracer tests to characterize the hydrogeological dynamics extensively in the wkp kincaid and werner 2008 interaction between seawater and freshwater in the karst aquifer are observed loper et al 2005 characterized davis and verdi 2014 and quantified xu et al 2015a 2015b in a series of studies with the knowledge of the conduit network distribution and hydrogeology conditions from field studies the wkp became the first regional scale test site for application of the coupled groundwater flow and solute transport simulation within conduit and porous medium xu et al 2016 furthermore a novel density dependent discrete continuum hybrid numerical model was developed to simulate the extent of seawater intrusion through the subsurface conduit networks with the appropriate physical flow equations xu and hu 2017 the karst modeling established a framework for future developments including conduit evolution and contamination remediation xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b xu et al 2018c summarized several general challenges in karst research around the world including data limitations and new technologies modeling of karst flow and reactive transport as well as the karst hydrological systems to climate variability across multiple scales future research in the wkp faces those challenges for example although the subsurface conduit network is well explored beneath and near wakulla springs by cave diving activities the microstructure within the conduits is uncertain due to the difficulties of mapping their complex geometry karst conduit networks are simplified as pipes with homogeneous roughness factors everywhere in most numerical modeling studies which may lead to significant uncertainty in conduit flow simulations advanced mapping techniques could gain additional insights into roughness factors and conduit structure characterization for example kenney et al 2012 developed a neutrally buoyant sensor method for mapping a water pathway in the direction of subsurface conduit flow weidner et al 2017 developed a systematic approach for 3 d mapping of underwater caves that utilized the intersection of video light with the cave boundaries to describe the outline of the cave field explorations and modeling approaches for karst evolution and carbonate dissolution are widely studied in other karst experimental sites but rarely investigated in the wkp mostly because long term water quality geochemistry and isotope data are limited the story of the giant conduit network development processes in the wkp is still missing particularly additional work is required to improve the understanding of the limestone reaction rates and its interaction with geochemical species under the dynamic hydrological condition the hydrochemical model developed by de rooij and graham 2017 provides a possible method for understanding the processes however the current karst evolution models are still oversimplification of reactive transport processes that requires further investigations in the limited number of chemistry processes coarse spatial resolution and lack of validation historically contamination studies focused on nitrate and biowaste hazards from anthropogenic activities recently increasing attention has focused on the water quality issue in the wkp as a longer period of dark color water due to cdom has been observed at wakulla springs and other inland karst features luzius et al 2018 water clarity affects drinking water resources as well as economic benefits from tourisms at wakulla spring multiple studies have highlighted that rising sea level could have significant impacts on the hydrogeological condition in the wkp by extending seawater intrusion through submarine conduits diverting freshwater discharges at wakulla springs and deteriorated water quality however very few engineering studies have provided solutions to those environmental issues as well as the other karst geohazards for example natural and man induced land subsidence and sinkholes most previous modeling studies in the wkp used precipitation data measured from the sparse meteorological stations with simple interpolation also evapotranspiration data are usually estimated from empirical equations in previous studies as the measurements are unavailable high resolution remote sensing and reanalysis meteorological datasets for example prism daly et al 1994 daymet thornton et al 2014 and nldas cosgrove et al 2003 could potentially improve water budget in hydrological modeling the impacts of climate change are another challenge for karst science interaction between climate and hydrology have been addressed in several integrated hydrology models including pf wrf maxwell et al 2011 and wrf hydro gochis et al 2013 however climate change scenarios have rarely been integrated with dual permeability hydrology models and applied in karst regions with limited capabilities in simulating groundwater flow within the conduit these integrated hydrology models are advanced with physical based land surface models to study potential changes in vegetation which is still a research gap in the previous studies in the wkp integrated multi disciplinary models will be important for successful simulation of hydrological and biogeochemical responses in karst aquifers under climate change

4850,this paper provides a review of over thirty years of research and investigation in the woodville karst plain wkp in northern florida which is representative of the floridan aquifer system a karst aquifer in the southeastern united states the wkp is a well developed karst region where over 40 km of subsurface conduits are mapped by divers and tracer tests and connected to wakulla spring one of the largest freshwater springs in the u s furthermore the conduit networks expand and interact with seawater via the connection to a submarine spring and impact groundwater flow cycle in the aquifer numerical models based on multiple field investigations have been developed to quantify the understanding of hydrogeologic processes in the wkp novel modeling approaches with capabilities were developed to simulate seawater and groundwater interaction in this dual permeability aquifer the wkp site has served as a valuable natural observatory for a series of studies documented in this paper to understand groundwater flow contaminant transport and seawater intrusion in the well developed karst subsurface system keywords karst dual permeability groundwater flow solute transport seawater intrusion 1 introduction karst is a unique landscape containing caves and extensive underground water systems that is developed by dissolution in the carbonate rocks such as limestone and gypsum ford and williams 1989 fourteen percent of earth s land surface consists of the carbonate rock outcrop that forms karst chen et al 2017a 2017b ford and williams 1989 reported that karst aquifer systems supply potable water to nearly 25 of the world s population in addition to drinking water resources the karst terrains are usually major resources for building materials and have economic benefits for example cave tourism typical karst features are sinkholes and dolines on land surface and the network of voids caves and conduits below the surface formed by the dissolution of the soluble carbonate rocks the open and porous nature of a karst aquifer combined with the dissolution of joints and fractures within the bedrocks over a geological time evolve complex subsurface conduit systems davis 1996 compared to a porous medium a karst aquifer is typically a dual porosity system where groundwater and solutes move rapidly through conduits ritter et al 2002 scanlon et al 2003 martin and dean 2001 indicated that water and solute exchanges between conduits and their porous media in a dual permeability karst aquifer system as a result karst aquifers are particularly vulnerable for groundwater contamination or seawater intrusion arthur et al 2007 kuniansky 2008 during a high flow event contaminants in the conduit system are actively pushed into the carbonate matrix because that water pressure in the conduit is higher than the matrix faulkner et al 2009 hu 2010 during a low flow event contaminants stored in the surrounding porous medium are slowly released into the conduit system and greatly extend the period of remediation besides contamination subsidence from sinkhole collapses are the other major geohazards in the karst region kuniansky et al 2016 gutiérrez et al 2008 classified sinkholes geohazards into two major types as cover collapse and cover subsidence and pointed out that both are sensitive to drought rainfall and groundwater level fluctuation additionally extreme precipitation urban expansion construction and well drilling can change the aquifer structure and groundwater level that increase the vulnerability of sinkhole geohazards in the karst region in recent years advanced techniques including lidar wu et al 2016 ert electrical resistivity tomography and gpr ground penetrating radar sevil et al 2017 and machine learning zhu et al 2020 have been adopted to identify and monitor karst sinkholes broadly karst research community has established multiple focal study sites to characterize the hydrogeology condition gain insights of physical processes and improve the predictive capabilities in karst regions for example the institute of geochemistry chinese academy of science established the puding karst ecological system research station since 2000s to study runoff response to climate change and human activities e g xu et al 2018a 2018b 2018c rocky desertification e g yang et al 2011 and soil co2 storage e g yang et al 2012 also in southwest china the team of unesco international karst research center and institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences maintained well investigated karst experimental sites at yaji and maocun near guilin a series of tracer tests e g jiang et al 2015 isotope analysis e g guo et al 2015 and soil characterizations e g huang et al 2015 hui et al 2015 have been aggregated to investigate the hydrogeological and karst carbon sink dynamic yang et al 2015 in slovenia podstenjšek springs catchment is an example of the experimental site that is well characterized by the team of karst research institute in slovenia and more widely karst research community in europe groundwater vulnerability estimation and risk mapping in this small karst watershed have been conducted using tracer tests ravbar and goldscheider 2007 cop method vías et al 2010 and electrical conductivity ravbar et al 2011 the gottesacker alpine karst system is another well mapped and geologically complex long term study site at the germany and austria border goldscheider 2008 and göppert et al 2005 used numerous tracer tests to investigate the limestone geological layers and the major flowpath connecting to three springs in the karst aquifer chen and goldscheider 2014 simulated groundwater flow in the catchment using a spatially distributed numerical model based on extensive pre existing geological mapping then improved the model by calibration chen et al 2017a 2017b 2018 in the united states an integrated interdisciplinary research effort has been established on the savoy experimental watershed led by the university of arkansas to investigate karst evolution at this site perne et al 2014 used numerical models to estimate the impacts of pressurized flow and free surface flow on karst conduit network evolution covington and vaughn 2019 estimated the co2 and karst dissolution rate dynamics under a changing flow condition the woodville karst plain wkp is representative of the highly karstified part of the floridan aquifer in the southeastern u s at the same time the wkp is also a representative site in the coastal karst regions fleury et al 2007 including mediterranean bakalowicz 2015 and yucatan karst regions bauer gottwein et al 2011 where a conduit system is interconnected between large springs and the ocean via submarine springs the wkp has one of the longest and most extensive mapped subsurface karst conduit networks in the world the wkp is unique subsurface passageways in the wkp are below the water table and fully saturated hypogenic karst except at connections with sinkholes and springs on land surface the wkp is vulnerable to sinkhole geohazards as the groundwater table is shallow and surface runoff enters the submerged conduit system rapidly through sinks part of the subsurface conduit network is connected directly to the gulf of mexico via submarine springs under different hydrologic conditions flow direction within conduit network can be either seaward when fresh groundwater discharges into the gulf at the submarine spring or landward when seawater intrudes via the same submarine springs seawater and groundwater interaction could have significant impacts on the groundwater flow field in the wkp because the topography is flat and the hydraulic gradients are small this synthesis paper reviews both the field investigations and modeling developments for understanding karst hydrogeology in the wkp in the end the paper highlights several key achievements and shared the insights for future karst research in the wkp and possibly other karst regions 2 site description and field investigations 2 1 hydrogeology conditions the woodville karst plain wkp encompasses about 1300 km2 and is bounded to the north by the cody scarp near the city of tallahassee to the west by the apalachicola national forest to the east by the water divide of st marks river and to the south by the gulf of mexico fig 1 rolling hills are the major topography in the study area and land surface altitudes range from 30 to 60 m above sea level asl at the north of the cody scarp south of the scarp land surface altitudes are generally less that 15 m asl characterized by closed basins typical of karst terrains the climate is humid subtropical with relatively high precipitation the average annual temperature in tallahassee is 19 4 celsius degree and the average annual precipitation is about 1557 mm per year the average potential evapotranspiration in the wkp ranged from 1319 to 1377 mm per year xu et al 2015a 2015b wakulla springs and spring creek springs complex scsc are the two major karst features on the surface and first magnitude springs in the wkp the group of wakulla springs is one of the largest springs in the floridan aquifer as well as the entire southeast of united states davis 1996 florida spring task force 2000 located 19 km from the shoreline 23 km upstream from the gulf along the wakulla river wakulla springs which has a single giant vent of 30 m diameter with several small vents nearby forms the headwaters of the wakulla river the depth of wakulla springs cave is estimated to be about 60 m near the origin extended to 100 m and even 120 m deep at some locations florida springs task force 2000 discharge at wakulla springs is nearly 11 m3 s during the dry season in average and peaks as large as 40 50 m3 s during a heavy rainfall event usually after a tropical storm or a hurricane the elevation of the riverbed at wakulla springs is about 1 5 m above sea level the elevation is critical in the groundwater flow field in the wkp and could determine that groundwater either discharging at the wakulla spring or diverting southward to the submarine scsc under different rainfall recharge and sea level conditions that are discussed in the following sections scsc are a group of 14 individual submarine spring vents near the shoreline and vents no 1 and no 10 are two major discharge spots florida springs task force 2000 the largest vent diameter can be as large as 15 m but the exact locations diameter and discharges of the vents are difficult to accurately explore and measure because they are submerged under sea level in the bay freshwater discharge is negligible or even reversely during the dry season when the vents are filled with seawater discharge however can be over 50 m3 s during a heavy rainfall event davis and verdi 2014 the upper floridan aquifer ufa is a part of the floridan aquifer system that underlies the entire state of florida and parts of georgia south carolina and alabama a comprehensive investigation of the hydrological framework in the wkp was conducted by miller 1986 and further explored by williams and kuniansky 2016 and briefly generalized in fig 2 most of hydrogeology research in the wkp focuses on the tertiary through quaternary age limestone dolostone clay and sand with varying degrees of lithification the paleocene clayton formation is a layer of low permeability massive calcareous marine clay on the bottom of the study area also the confining unit floridan aquifer system the eocene permeable limestone sediments are subdivided into three layers from the oldsmar formation on the bottom the avon park formation in the middle and the youngest ocala limestone layer the permeable to very permeable suwannee limestone formation is the only layer in oligocene series right above the oligocene sediments the chattahoochee formation the st marks formation and the hawthorn group are three miocene layers with significant different characteristics the bottom two layers are highly permeable to relatively impermeable in which dolostone is the major sediments in the chattahoochee formation with small portion of others components such as quartz sand clay calcite and limestone huddlestun 1988 and the st marks formation is predominantly fine to medium grained silty to sandy limestone however the hawthorn group is an impermeable layer with mostly clay and sand significantly different hydrological characteristics with the limestone formations huddlestun 1988 miccosukee formation represents the pliocene sediments with commonly sandy and silty clay the hawthorn group and miccosukee formation are not present at south of the cody scarp in most of the wkp domain and can be only observed in the northern part of the study area as an impermeable hydrogeological unit over most of the wkp the floridan aquifer system is considered unconfined as most of the more recent units that form the upper confining unit of the floridan aquifer are thin or absent in the south of the cody scarp williams and kuniansky 2016 in the quaternary system undifferentiated terrace and shallow marine deposit consists of the pleistocene sediments and the thin sand and gravel accumulation deposits are the major components of holocene series carbonate limestone is the major porous medium in the study area which is characterized by an uneven distribution of heterogeneous permeability due to extremely high permeable fractures and conduits bush and johnston 1988 openings in loosely cemented limestone and mosaics of many fractures and solution widened joints can be found in the study region davis 1996 many fractures cavities and conduits with sizes ranging from less than 0 3 m to larger than 15 m in diameter are observed in the wkp most field and modeling investigations were limited in the upper floridan aquifer ufa within 200 m deep below surface where karst features are mainly located the details of karst features are introduced in the following section 2 2 woodville karst plain project wkpp and conduit network the wkpp was established in 1985 and extended in the 1990s to map the underwater cave system underlying the wkp cave diving and dye tracers were employed to explore the subsurface karst conduit networks extensively from numerous springs and sinkholes in the wkp including wakulla springs the leon sinks cave system lost sink and the scsc near the coast cave diving activities are extremely difficult in the karst region due to the safety requirements and unknown subsurface environment and particularly dangerous when deep underwater passageways are explored or narrow conduits that extend long distances wkpp hold the world s record for the longest distance explored by divers specifically as far as 7860 m one way from wakulla spring at an average depth of 84 m the wkpp also holds the world s record for the longest traverse by divers between two known entry points 10 909 m one way between turner sink and wakulla springs at an average depth of 84 m the wkpp also holds the record for exploring and mapping more cave passageways below 64 m than any other organization in the world in total wkpp explorers have mapped and explored 54 km of conduit system in 2015 based on multiple news sources wkpp mapped an extended well developed conduit system beneath wakulla springs and further extended within the wkp starting at the main vent of wakulla springs cave explorers identified cave passages as tunnels with alphabetic letter designation the conduit system runs southwest until it meets the confluence of the north oriented b tunnel and the south oriented c tunnel fig 3 the b tunnel initially trends eastward then turns northward in the general direction of the southeast sprayfield of the city of tallahassee turf sink and st marks spring the main conduit then extends westward until it bifurcates at the junction of south north oriented a tunnel and the north south oriented d tunnel the a tunnel continues to the junction of the a and k tunnels the south oriented k tunnel eventually intersects with the r tunnel which runs northward into multiple creeks and sinkholes for example fisher creek black creek and emerald sink the major sources of regional recharge from northern wkp to wakulla springs south of the a tunnel is the q tunnel which trends southward towards the gulf coast and is presumed to connect with the scsc conduit system the exploration of the submarine caves scsc by cave divers was very difficult due to complicated flow conditions especially when seawater is siphoning however cave divers in scsc found an extensive karstic network joined by deep vertical conduits the submarine caves trended approximately 45 m to the north of the spring vent and reached a depth of about 50 m below sea level kincaid and werner 2008 the depths of scsc are believed to be approximate 90 m especially at no 1 and no 10 vents which are the biggest and major conduit outlets however divers were not able to reach the cave bottom therefore the estimated depth is only available by assuming the submarine spring has the same depth as wakulla springs davis and verdi 2014 the conduit systems at scsc are believed to separate as two tunnels in which one tunnel is oriented northeastward to wakulla springs and the other is oriented northwestward to lost creek along with the cave diver activities a series of tracer tests with dye have been used to identify and quantify the connectivity among sinks and springs within the wkp kincaid et al 2005 performed tracer tests from the leon sink system including fisher creek sink black creek sink emerald sink and ames sink group of swallets where they receive approximately 60 of the city of tallahassee s stormwater runoff southward to wakulla spring the results revealed that groundwater velocity ranged from 1500 to over 2000 m day through the portion of the conduit network the experiments highlighted that quantitative tracing results should be considered in modeling and predictive studies and rapid velocity reaffirmed the existence of high permeable groundwater flow pathways kincaid and werner 2008 further conducted tracer tests from the southeast sprayfield of tallahassee and turf pond sink to wakulla springs the tracers travelled 17 5 km in 56 days with an averaged velocity of 313 m day still two or five orders of magnitude faster than the transmissivity of 0 03 15 m day in the porous medium from pumping tests bush and johnston 1988 geochemical age data and isotope tracers katz et al 2004 to the south of wakulla spring tracer tests by kincaid et al 2012 reported the existence of extremely high permeable conduit networks connecting scsc wakulla spring and lost creeks where groundwater tracing velocity is found at 2 4 km day from lost creek sink to scsc radon isotope was also used as a natural tracer at scsc to investigate the conduit connectivity and suggested a direct connection between the deep and surficial aquifers through karst features dimova et al 2011 in summary tracer tests reveal the high permeable complicated subsurface connectivity exists and connects numerous karst features in the wkp 2 3 coastal processes and interaction with sea level evolution of carbonate rocks in the upper floridan aquifer and the development of large conduits are strongly related to the sea level fluctuation between the inland and present coastline in geological history large parts of the florida platform were exposed to karst formation processes during periods of low sea level resulting in deep conduits that are now part of submarine spring systems fleury et al 2007 the presence of submarine springs and conduits are passageways for seawater to move landward and potentially contaminated fresh water however the investigations of seawater intrusion which leads to brackish groundwater along the coast rarely addresses the groundwater flow inside of karst features fleury et al 2007 the wkp is a typical coastal karst aquifer with seawater intrusion where topography is extremely flat and the interaction between seawater and freshwater is particularly important and can be significant to the flow field groundwater flow and spring discharges in the wkp are affected by the coastal boundary condition loper et al 2005 reported that the discharge at wakulla springs is correlated with the tide level in apalachee bay particularly during storm event since the spring discharges responds to rainfall events with similar magnitude patterns and durations in late 2003 florida geological survey installed six falmouth 2d acm acoustic flowmeters in the conduits proximal to the main vent at wakulla spring these flowmeters are located between 85 and 95 m below land surface in the b c d ad ak and k tunnels fig 3 in late 2009 three additional meters were installed at three sites south of the wakulla vent one meter was placed in the conduit beneath revell sink approximately four miles southwest of wakulla spring and two meters were installed at scsc vent 1 and scsc vent 10 these nine flowmeters record five parameters at 15 min or hourly intervals average speed of flow electrical conductivity water pressure water temperature and average flow direction these meters are used in conjunction with a network of in situ level troll devices measuring the water levels in karst windows connected to the deeper conduit system the usgs also maintained a gage at scsc in 2007 recording gage height electrical conductivity salinity and the aggregate discharge for 12 of the 14 vents at scsc xu et al 2016 according to the three year observation of the spring discharges in the wkp from june 2007 to june 2010 davis and verdi 2014 developed the three phases of dynamic hydrologic conditions where seawater interacts with groundwater at the two major first magnitude springs wakulla spring and scsc via the connected conduit networks fig 4 the flow in scsc was most sensitive to rainfall and seawater intrusion and the flow in wakulla springs was affected by rainfall and the flow in scsc three repeating phases are summarized phase 1 occurred during low rainfall periods and was characterized by seawater backflow into the scsc caves the higher density seawater blocked fresh water flow and resulted in a higher equivalent fresh water head in scsc than in wakulla springs the blocked fresh water was diverted to wakulla springs approximately doubling its discharge phase 2 occurred when heavy rainfalls resulted in high creek flows to nearby sinkholes that purged the mixing seawater from the scsc caves phase 3 occurred after streams returned to base flow fig 5 the equivalent freshwater head in the subsurface conduit is calculated as high as 2 5 m when the scsc are filled with seawater assuming that the depth of the conduit network is 91 m same as the depth beneath wakulla spring seawater intrusion is possibly extended further inland as the equivalent freshwater head at scsc is even higher than the riverbed elevation at wakulla springs based on the ten year flowmeter data xu et al 2016 analyzed the spatial orientation of conduits in which the rising conductivity values are measured the geospatial pattern of maximum conductivity within the conduits and the spatiotemporal pattern associated with the periods of rising conductivity values strong evidence was reported that seawater could intrude as far as 22 km inland to wakulla spring this was not only the first documented case of seawater intrusion at scsc migrating to wakulla spring but also the longest documented extent of seawater intrusion through subsurface conduit networks in the wkp although salinity is still low and below drinking water standard near the wakulla springs this study affirms davis and verdi s 2014 seawater freshwater interaction conceptual model and raised the concerns of deteriorated seawater intrusion contamination in the wkp particularly under the conditions of sea level rise and more severe groundwater pumping in addition to seawater intrusion water quality issues of the dark colored water at wakulla spring have been observed with long durations in recent years and is relevant to the interaction of seawater and freshwater the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is believed as the source of dark water color in the system kulakowski 2010 sampled and quantified the cdom level by colorimetric light absorption for five blackwater intermittent streams draining into the sinks connected to wakulla springs and reported a relationship of changing precipitation groundwater usage and decreased water clarity at wakulla spring luzius et al 2018 collected the cdmo samples and confirmed the connectivity of wakulla spring with apalachicola national forest in the west boundary of the wkp the seasonality of dark water due to high concentration of cdmo in the inland spring comes from the forest and is affected by sea level rise and anthropogenic impacts periods of dark water color are consistent with the phase 1 of the groundwater flow cycling conceptual model davis and verdi 2014 elevated sea level in the recent years extends the equivalent freshwater head and extent of seawater intrusion at the scsc diverted the dark color water from the apalachicola national forest northward to the wakulla springs 3 modeling developments in the wkp 3 1 groundwater flow and solute transport modeling in a dual permeability karst system groundwater flow modeling development in the wkp started in the 1990s davis 1996 investigated the hydrogeology of the upper floridan aquifer and developed a modflow groundwater flow model within the north central florida and southwestern georgia where the wkp is a subset of the domain based on hydrogeological investigation the modflow model and particle tracking techniques were used to delineate the groundwater flow pattern in the area and estimate water resources availability for the city of tallahassee the calculated groundwater flow velocity ranges from 0 3 m day to 0 5 m day assuming a 25 porosity or 0 73 m day to 2 25 m day assuming a 5 porosity simulation results were found to be equivalent to analytical analysis based on the model developed by davis 1996 davis and katz 2007 updated the modflow model to enhance the understanding of the groundwater flow system for contamination remediation groundwater ages derived by geochemical analyses from tritium 3h chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 were used to determine effective porosity along with the flow model and particle tracking analysis an ensemble of modflow simulations were designed with different hydraulic conductivities to determine the 5 year probabilistic contributing areas of the water supply wells for the city of tallahassee davis et al 2010 subset the previous larger scale modflow model to focus on the wakulla spring springshed a refined resolution 150 meter long term 1986 2018 modflow groundwater flow and mt3dms solute transport model were developed to investigate the nitrate n movement from a treated municipal wastewater facility and other sources the refined model was calibrated to the discharge and nitrate n concentration measured at wakulla spring the flow and transport simulations started in 1966 when the wastewater sprayfield became operational nitrate n concentration at wakulla spring reached the highest level in 1986 when nitrate n loading peaked at about 600 000 kg yr the sprayfields were completely shut down in 2004 and the simulation continues through 2018 simulated nitrate n concentration decreases but contamination plumes remain in some regions after 2004 nitrate n transported rapidly through the high permeability karst conduit network accumulated in the downstream of the wakulla springshed and formed multiple disconnected contamination plumes in the wkp fig 6 the modflow model in davis et al 2010 implements the subsurface conduit network with large values of hydraulic conductivity and porosity however appropriate estimations of hydraulic conductivity and porosity are challenging at where conduits are well developed because the subsurface karst features are usually smaller than the 150 meter grid resolution in the model more importantly groundwater flow within the conduit networks usually become non laminar and is quantified as reynolds number which is low for laminar flow while high for turbulent flow darcy s law is invalid for describing groundwater flow when the reynolds number is greater than 10 reynolds number for groundwater flow in the subsurface karst conduit networks can be easily exceed the critical value to overcome this issue hybrid discrete continuum numerical models have been developed tested and verified as an appropriate approach to simulate groundwater flow in a dual permeability system for example the well developed karst aquifer with conduit networks kiraly 1998 hybrid models couple the conduit flow in the discrete pipes with darcian flow in the continuum porous medium for example clemens et al 1996 and liedl et al 2003 developed the cave carbonate aquifer void evolution model based on a hybrid approach later the discrete cfp conduit flow process package of modflow 2005 as modflow cfp was initially developed by shoemaker et al 2008 and further improved by reimann et al 2013 to enable simulations of unsaturated conduit flow conduit associated drainable storage cads and time variable boundary condition tvbc for the reasons discussed above the wkp modflow model in davis et al 2010 was further enhanced as the modflow cfp mode 1 by gallegos et al 2013 by replacing high permeability and porosity karst features with the pipes embedded in porous media explicitly the groundwater flow within a conduit is computed by the darcy weisbash equation which is applicable in both laminar and non laminar flow while the groundwater flow in the porous medium around the conduit features are still simulated by darcy s law the exchange flux between conduits and porous medium is calculated by a linear approximation of head difference at each conduit node embedded in the modflow grid cell gallegos et al 2013 compared modflow and modflow cfp results with observed discharge at two springs and found that the modflow cfp model more closely simulated peak discharge kuniansky 2016 further assessed the simulation results of modflow modflow cfp mode 1 and cfp mode 2 for the springflow at wakulla spring and found that the peak discharge is overestimated by modflow while underestimated by modflow cfp mode 1 nonetheless kuniansky 2016 reaffirmed that the ability to simulate non laminar flow is important for simulation of large storm events when non laminar flow affects discharge during the storm event if matching springflow hydrographs are desired in addition to groundwater flow modeling the hybrid discrete continuum model is further extended to simulate contaminant transport in the karst aquifer davis et al 2010 used mt3dms a widely used numerical model that uses the groundwater flow solution from modflow zheng and wang 1999 however mt3dms is only applicable for solute transport with darcian flow in a porous medium such as a sandstone or alluvial aquifer spiessl et al 2007 modified the mt3d source code and developed rumt3d three dimensional reactive underground multispecies transport a coupled reactive hybrid transport model with cave to simulate solute transport and chemical reactions in a karst aquifer xu et al 2015a utilized the cfpv2 remiann et al 2011 the research version of modflow cfp with the capabilities of coupling with umt3d to simulate hybrid flow and nitrate n transport in the wkp fig 6 this hybrid groundwater flow and transport model simulated the nitrate n contamination over a historical period the combination of cfpv2 and umt3d improved the nitrate n breakthrough curve prediction at the wakulla springs and verified that conduit networks are major passageways for contaminant transport in the wkp 3 2 modeling of groundwater interaction with seawater inspired by the conceptual model for groundwater flow cycling davis and verdi 2014 and previous field investigations xu et al 2015b modified the modflow cfp model by gallegos et al 2013 and implemented an equivalent freshwater head at scsc to simulate the three phase groundwater flow cycling described in davis and verdi 2014 equivalent freshwater heads are computed by the salinity measurements at the submarine scsc the simulated discharge at wakulla spring and scsc were compared with observed values the model predicted the discharges under sea level rise scenarios and reaffirmed with hypothesis that the increasing discharge at wakulla spring is potentially associated with the rising sea level from 1920 to 2020 fig 4 davis and verdi 2014 to improve the understanding of seawater intrusion through conduits in the modeling xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b xu et al 2018c developed a two dimensional density dependent seawat model guo and langevin 2002 along the transect of a subsurface conduit and evaluated the parameter sensitivities in the model the model simulates groundwater flow cycling under dry and wet rainfall conditions as well as boundary conditions such as sea level key simulation result included the estimation of seawater intrusion extent that could be as far as 3 km from the coastline through the deep subsurface conduit network the two dimensional seawat model along the transect of conduit network was further upscaled to a three dimensional model in the wkp subregion domain by xu et al 2019b to better evaluate the interaction of seawater and freshwater interaction and the mixing process compared to the nitrate n transport model in the wkp davis et al 2010 xu et al 2015a 2015b vertical discretization is refined in the three dimensional seawat model with 12 layers to be able to accurately represent the mixing zone between freshwater and seawater in the aquifer fig 7 most density dependent groundwater flow models for example seawat guo and langevin 2002 are only able to simulate darcian flow and assume a linear relationship between specific discharge and head gradient to improve the capability of simulating the interaction of seawater and freshwater in the karst aquifer with submarine conduit network for example the wkp novel density dependent hybrid discrete continuous numerical models have been developed xu and hu 2017 developed the vdfst cfp model to couple the density dependent groundwater flow and salt transport for the non darcian flow in the conduit and darcian flow in the porous medium the newly developed model was validated by benchmarking with multiple models including modflow modflow cfp and seawat under equivalent conditions xu et al 2019a further improved the vdfst cfp model by implementing double conduit networks and quantifying micro texture on the conduit wall by the goudar sonnad equation and considering macro structures as local head loss although the vdfst cfp model has many limitations for example is only able to simulate groundwater flow in the fully saturated conduit in the 2d spatial domain due to the computational constraints it is the first attempt to develop a hybrid discrete continuum numerical model for a density dependent groundwater flow coupled with salt transport the novel code developments prompted the modeling of seawater freshwater interaction and created a platform for incorporating more complicated physical and chemical processes in the coastal karst aquifer simulations 4 summary and future perspectives woodville karst plain wkp has become one of the most intensively investigated karst study sites in the world several major science achievements are highlighted as follows the wkpp mapped the longest conduit network recorded in the world and performed multiple tracer tests to characterize the hydrogeological dynamics extensively in the wkp kincaid and werner 2008 interaction between seawater and freshwater in the karst aquifer are observed loper et al 2005 characterized davis and verdi 2014 and quantified xu et al 2015a 2015b in a series of studies with the knowledge of the conduit network distribution and hydrogeology conditions from field studies the wkp became the first regional scale test site for application of the coupled groundwater flow and solute transport simulation within conduit and porous medium xu et al 2016 furthermore a novel density dependent discrete continuum hybrid numerical model was developed to simulate the extent of seawater intrusion through the subsurface conduit networks with the appropriate physical flow equations xu and hu 2017 the karst modeling established a framework for future developments including conduit evolution and contamination remediation xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b xu et al 2018c summarized several general challenges in karst research around the world including data limitations and new technologies modeling of karst flow and reactive transport as well as the karst hydrological systems to climate variability across multiple scales future research in the wkp faces those challenges for example although the subsurface conduit network is well explored beneath and near wakulla springs by cave diving activities the microstructure within the conduits is uncertain due to the difficulties of mapping their complex geometry karst conduit networks are simplified as pipes with homogeneous roughness factors everywhere in most numerical modeling studies which may lead to significant uncertainty in conduit flow simulations advanced mapping techniques could gain additional insights into roughness factors and conduit structure characterization for example kenney et al 2012 developed a neutrally buoyant sensor method for mapping a water pathway in the direction of subsurface conduit flow weidner et al 2017 developed a systematic approach for 3 d mapping of underwater caves that utilized the intersection of video light with the cave boundaries to describe the outline of the cave field explorations and modeling approaches for karst evolution and carbonate dissolution are widely studied in other karst experimental sites but rarely investigated in the wkp mostly because long term water quality geochemistry and isotope data are limited the story of the giant conduit network development processes in the wkp is still missing particularly additional work is required to improve the understanding of the limestone reaction rates and its interaction with geochemical species under the dynamic hydrological condition the hydrochemical model developed by de rooij and graham 2017 provides a possible method for understanding the processes however the current karst evolution models are still oversimplification of reactive transport processes that requires further investigations in the limited number of chemistry processes coarse spatial resolution and lack of validation historically contamination studies focused on nitrate and biowaste hazards from anthropogenic activities recently increasing attention has focused on the water quality issue in the wkp as a longer period of dark color water due to cdom has been observed at wakulla springs and other inland karst features luzius et al 2018 water clarity affects drinking water resources as well as economic benefits from tourisms at wakulla spring multiple studies have highlighted that rising sea level could have significant impacts on the hydrogeological condition in the wkp by extending seawater intrusion through submarine conduits diverting freshwater discharges at wakulla springs and deteriorated water quality however very few engineering studies have provided solutions to those environmental issues as well as the other karst geohazards for example natural and man induced land subsidence and sinkholes most previous modeling studies in the wkp used precipitation data measured from the sparse meteorological stations with simple interpolation also evapotranspiration data are usually estimated from empirical equations in previous studies as the measurements are unavailable high resolution remote sensing and reanalysis meteorological datasets for example prism daly et al 1994 daymet thornton et al 2014 and nldas cosgrove et al 2003 could potentially improve water budget in hydrological modeling the impacts of climate change are another challenge for karst science interaction between climate and hydrology have been addressed in several integrated hydrology models including pf wrf maxwell et al 2011 and wrf hydro gochis et al 2013 however climate change scenarios have rarely been integrated with dual permeability hydrology models and applied in karst regions with limited capabilities in simulating groundwater flow within the conduit these integrated hydrology models are advanced with physical based land surface models to study potential changes in vegetation which is still a research gap in the previous studies in the wkp integrated multi disciplinary models will be important for successful simulation of hydrological and biogeochemical responses in karst aquifers under climate change

4851,the inverse relationship between water and sediment is hindering the regulation of sediment in silt laden rivers under natural conditions and insufficient water flow sediment deposits along river channels resulting in the accumulation of suspended river sediments above the ground level on both sides of the river then during flooding dam collapse and overflow can easily occur threatening the life of residents in floodplain the operation of upstream reservoirs to maximise the sediment transport capacity of downstream rivers into the sea is deemed the best strategy for the management of silt laden rivers however as incoming water and sediment form a dynamic system optimising the operation mode of reservoirs has become the most severe challenge in the field this study proposes a method to remodel the water sediment relationship of natural rivers by optimising the reservoir operation first data were collected and analysed to investigate sediment transport in the downstream river channel and the response relationship between erosion deposition then an empirical equation for calculating the desired incoming sediment was derived and the threshold for sedimentary transport balance in the lower reach of silt laden rivers was determined through mathematical modelling finally the reservoir operation mode was optimised within the threshold range to study the discharge process of the reservoir with the highest sediment transport efficiency downstream the yellow river in china exhibits the highest sediment concentration worldwide and was used as a case study to verify the practicability of the proposed method the critical threshold for sediment transport balance in the lower yellow river was determined to be 250 million tons the results demonstrate that the proposed method improved the sediment transport capacity of the lower reaches of the yellow river moreover it reduced the siltation of the xiaolangdi reservoir and the lower reaches of the yellow river the xiaolangdi reservoir can be jointly operated with the guxian reservoir which is under construction and is expected to maintain the bankfull discharge of the lower reaches of the yellow river at 4000 m3 for a long time the optimisation process described in this study can be used to improve the management of silt laden rivers abbreviations srss silt laden river system simulation yrcc yellow

m3 1 introduction generally rivers with annual average sediment concentration or transport exceeding 10 kg m3 and 100 million tons respectively are silt laden rivers there are 13 rivers worldwide with an annual sediment transport exceeding 100 million tons as shown in fig 1 among them china s yellow river exhibits the highest values with a maximum and average mainstream sediment concentration of 920 kg m3 and 35 kg m3 respectively zhang et al 2017 the intra and inter annual distribution of water and sediment in the yellow river is extremely unbalanced from an intra annual perspective flood season sees 60 of the annual water volume zhang 2018 and over 85 of the annual sediment inflow which is often concentrated in several storms and floods pan et al 2015 from an inter annual perspective the maximum sediment concentration was measured to be 3 91 billion tons in 1933 when the water volume was 56 10 billion m3 whereas the minimum sediment concentration was measured to be 330 million tons in 1987 though the water volume was only 20 40 billion m3 liu et al 2016 an unbalanced relationship between water and sediment in which water is relatively scarce and sediment relatively abundant is commonly found in silt laden rivers cai and rosegrant 2004 zhang et al 2018a this relationship is considered to be the root cause of siltation and riverbed uplift in the lower reach of river channels and notably leads to reduced flow capacity in the main channel xu et al 2009 naturally most silt laden rivers meander and achieve relative balance and stability compatible with their water and sediment conditions through evolution shen et al 2006 however this balance is only short lived in the long run severe siltation inevitably occurs in the lower reaches simultaneously forming beaches and troughs at bends during flooding overflow and diversion may occur consequently the breach is blocked or a new flow path is formed and the siltation process is restarted without human intervention such cycles would continue endlessly wang and li 2011 xia et al 2014 and each cycle would end catastrophically for example the diversion of the yellow river in 1855 affected over 10 million people in the anhui henan jiangsu and shandong provinces of china and caused huge economic losses qiu et al 2010 wang et al 2006 the objective of silt laden river management is to prevent downstream riverbed rise fei and wu 2015 many relevant studies have been conducted wu and zhang 2007 zhang et al 2018c 2019 which have yielded rich results that describe the sediment transport erosion and deposition processes xia et al 2016 and provide scientific and technological support for improving governance these research findings are related to the characteristics of water and sediment transport chih et al 2014 the law describing scouring and silting changes xu and cheng 2002 the amount of water used for sediment transport duan et al 2012 and the water and sediment conditions necessary to balance erosion and deposition zhang et al 2018d nevertheless the main measure to manage silt laden rivers remains the construction of reservoirs to provide combined regulation of water and sediment sheng et al 2017 the construction of reservoirs in the upper reaches of silt laden rivers changes the transport mechanism of incoming sediment and sediment in the lower reaches of rivers which in turn affects the operation of reservoirs zhang et al 2020 from the 1950s to the 1960s many reservoirs have been built on the mississippi river in the united states and the dams on both banks of the lower reaches have been heightened and strengthened the silt laden river system has achieved the highest intensity of engineering regulation and the densest construction of sediment control and guidance projects worldwide the reservoir intercepted a large amount of sediment in the mississippi river significantly reducing the amount of sediment transported to the sea elsey quirk et al 2019 but also provoking adverse effects the sediment deposition reduces the service life and the clear water discharged from the reservoir scours the downstream reach and hinders navigation the situation in the lower yellow river in china is similar to that in the mississippi river in the united states since the 1950s residents along the yellow river have constructed dikes to restrict the range of floods and protect floodplains yet the riverbed geometry has continued to deteriorate zhang et al 2017 the xiaolangdi reservoir built in 2010 controls the input to the lower yellow river since it was put into operation the downstream channels of the yellow river have been scoured along their entire courses li et al 2011 their beds have also been significantly armoured with an increase in the median diameter of sediment from 0 05 mm to 0 15 mm which undermined sediment transport efficiency wang et al 2019 optimisation of the reservoir operation mode has become an important challenge in current research li et al 2012 to further improve the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river channels and encourage sediment discharge into the sea reservoirs along silt laden rivers primarily serve to prevent floods and reduce siltation while taking into account the comprehensive utilisation of water resources in fact several studies on reservoir operation were conducted for regulating the water sediment relationship in silt laden rivers chen et al 2009 wei et al 2020 the operation methods in these studies differ in both content and form however they all make full use of the sediment transport capacity of downstream river channels during high flow river stages they also regulate the time and volume of storage and discharge to transport as much sediment as possible from the reservoir through the downstream river channels and into the sea su et al 2006 in the process of optimising the reservoir operation rules many studies have applied stochastic theory and generated stochastic hydrological data through the time series method according to the generated water and sediment data the probability of different discharge floods occurring under different conditions is predicted so as to modify the reservoir operation scheme and show the adaptability of the reservoir operation modes to incoming water and sediment lu et al 2018 sheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b in addition some researchers also propose the application of the latest intelligent algorithms to the real time optimisation of reservoir operation in silt laden rivers these models embody the concept of reservoir adaptive operation ali et al 2019 for example the kernel ridge regression model ali et al 2020b was used to analyse the amount of inflow water and sediment while the ensemble anfis based uncertainty assessment model ali et al 2018 was deployed to define the critical open discharge and sediment concentration ant colony optimisation random forest and other machine learning methods ali and prasad 2019 ali et al 2020a prasad et al 2019 were used to optimise the operation rules and change the critical open discharge and sediment concentration of the reservoir in real time according to the residual storage capacity of the reservoir during different periods wang et al 2020 storing clear water and discharging sediment is the common operation mode of silt laden rivers and reservoirs wang et al 2020 this artificially disturbs the soil in the riverbed downstream causing it to move and realising riverbed entrenchment and sediment discharge into the sea wang et al 2012 in other words the silt at the bottom of the river is stirred into suspension so that it can be discharged together with the natural flow resulting in desilting and sediment discharge li et al 2014 in this study optimisation of the operation mode of the xiaolangdi reservoir was carried out based on the case study of the lower reaches of the yellow river the main objective was to improve the sediment transport capacity of the lower reaches of sediment laden rivers particularly this study aimed to extend the service life of the reservoir regulate the storage and discharge of water in the reservoir and facilitate the transport of the sediment deposited in the reservoir and downstream river into the sea this was achieved by flexibly adjusting the inflow of water and sediment during the main flood season based on the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river during the large flow flood process according to the characteristics of sediment movement at different stages of reservoir operation first the collected data were analysed an empirical equation was derived and the observed behaviour was simulated to examine the sediment transport relationship of the river channel downstream of a reservoir and the response relationship between sediment deposition and the incoming sediment coefficient then the critical sediment threshold was identified to ensure sediment transport balance in the downstream river channel under the regulation of an upstream reservoir on this basis a refined operation mode for water and sediment regulation reservoirs on silt laden rivers was finally proposed the contribution of this study lays in the refinement of reservoir operation modes within the identified sediment threshold to ensure sediment transport equilibrium in the lower yellow river while maintaining ecological benignity in particular siltation reduction in both the reservoir and downstream river which was achieved by appropriately adjusting the reservoir operation requirements further facilitates the intended clear water storage and silt laden water discharge the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the methodology adopted in this study by detailing the employed technical roadmap and calculation procedure section 3 presents the details of a case study of the yellow river in terms of the study area engineering conditions and data sources and acquisition section 4 analyses the calculation results including an analysis of the impact of the xiaolangdi reservoir operation mode on erosion and deposition changes in the downstream river channel and a determination of the sediment transport balance threshold required to maintain ecological benignity these results are then used to propose a refined operation mode for the xiaolangdi reservoir section 5 details the necessity of constructing a backbone water conservancy project upstream of the xiaolangdi reservoir in the middle reaches of the yellow river to provide joint regulation in the future this necessity originates from the considerable difficulties experienced by the sole use of the xiaolangdi reservoir for water sediment regulation finally section 6 concludes this study 2 methodology 2 1 technical roadmap the overall technical roadmap of this study is shown in fig 2 first the sediment transport behaviour of downstream river channels was investigated further the response relationship between sediment deposition and the incoming sediment coefficient was explored by analysing experimental data then an empirical equation was derived and mathematical simulations were performed to establish a minimum sustainable inflow the sediment threshold of reservoir regulated silt laden rivers was identified as a precondition for maintaining ecological benignity on this basis the operation mode of the upstream reservoir was optimised to maximise erosion in the lower reaches of the silt laden rivers increasing to the greatest extent possible the sediment transport capacity and sediment discharge into the sea as shown in fig 2 there are five key steps in the optimisation of the upstream reservoir operation rules for the lower reach of silt laden rivers step 1 collect all design parameters and data recorded since the first operation of the reservoir this includes data for the floodplain area in the lower reach of silt laden rivers i e data on water and sediment inflow and sediment transport at key hydrological cross sections channel geometry detailing scouring and silting changes in key cross sections and measurements of water and sediment diversion step 2 based on the collected data qualitatively analyse erosion and deposition in the lower yellow river focusing on the impact of the reservoir water storage water sediment regulation and silt detention on the channel geometry and sediment transport efficiency step 3 propose a refined operation mode for the upstream reservoir to improve the sediment transport efficiency of the lower reaches of silt laden rivers assuming bankfull discharge step 4 use the unbalanced sediment transport model for suspended load to calculate the sediment transport capacity of the lower reaches of silt laden rivers under the refined operation mode of the upstream reservoir then compare it with the sediment threshold required to maintain ecological benignity if the sediment transport exceeds the threshold value continue to adjust the operation mode otherwise proceed to the next step step 5 compare the latest refined operation mode with the current and previously refined modes making continuous adjustments to the balanced sediment transport to ensure flood protection and ecological health the threshold for balanced sediment transport is critical for maintaining a sound river ecosystem in the lower reach of silt laden rivers and can be determined in two steps 1 use the empirical equation for balanced sediment transport to estimate the approximate interval for siltation and erosion in the lower reach of silt laden rivers 2 obtain an accurate value for the balanced sediment transport through detailed data based mathematical modelling the deployed data describe the different stages and periods of the joint water and sediment regulation provided by the upstream reservoir in flood and non flood seasons as well as the topographic data of lower reaches of silt laden rivers during the corresponding periods in this process two completely different methods i e an empirical calculation and mathematical modelling are used to generate data sequences that can be mutually verified and supplemented this ensures that the threshold obtained for the balanced sediment transport is reasonable and reliable 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 data analysis method the sediment transport capacity of silt laden rivers varies widely according to the water and sediment inflow conditions with sediment discharge generally increasing with inflow wei et al 2018 the response relationship for sediment transport can be obtained through regression analysis as follows cai et al 2020 1 w slj k 1 w xhw k 2 w sxhw c where the sediment outflow incoming water volume and incoming sediment quantity of the river section in question are wslj wxhw and wsxhw respectively k1 and k2 are coefficients and c is a constant if the volumes of water and sediment inflow are known the amount of sediment outflow can be directly estimated using eq 1 however water diversion in silt laden rivers is usually accompanied by sediment diversion so the erosion and deposition calculations must also consider the impact of water diversion the volume of erosion or deposition in the selected river section can be calculated as follows 2 w silt w sxhw w slj w sin where wsilt is the amount of erosion or deposition in which deposition is a positive value and erosion is a negative value and wsin is the amount of sediment diversion associated with water diversion then a diagram can be drawn to illustrate the relationship between the erosion deposition volume in the selected river section and the incoming sediment coefficient furthermore water and sediment collocation for erosion deposition balance in the downstream river can be analysed to estimate the incoming sediment quantity required to keep the downstream river from exhibiting either erosion or deposition this estimate corresponds to the threshold value of balanced sediment transport 2 2 2 sediment transport balance equation the basic equation describing sediment movement in terms of the riverbed sediment transport balance gradient can be derived from the water flow continuity equation uniform flow equation and sediment carrying capacity equation meng et al 2015 the sediment transport balance equation can be expressed as follows zhang 2017 3 j p k q s 0 5 n d 50 b 0 5 h 1 33 where jp is the balanced sediment transport gradient qs is the average sediment transport rate during flood season d 50 is the median diameter of suspended sediment in the river channel measured by the particle diameter agent method and expressed in mm n is the river roughness and b and h are the water surface width and water depth respectively corresponding to the average discharge q during the flood season expressed in m for a silt laden riverbed b 38 6 q 0 31 and h 0 081 q 0 44 finally k is an empirical coefficient ranging between 90 160 for most silt laden rivers herein a value of 140 is adopted for the lower reach of the yellow river the amount of sediment required to maintain the sediment transport balance can be calculated by defining qs as the amount of sediment during flood season ws divided by the duration of the flood season δt and then rearranging eq 3 as follows zhao et al 2005 4 w s b 0 5 h 1 33 j p kn d 50 2 δ t 2 2 3 mathematical modelling approach the processing conversion and parallel control platform was used to perform a silt laden river system simulation srss of the suspended load shang et al 2014 2016 the mathematical model of the srss operates on a daily suspended load basis taking into account the water sediment regulation effects of the current reservoir to facilitate the simulation of the actual hydrological process of sediment transport in the downstream reaches of silt laden rivers the governing equations for simulating the suspended load consist of the following four equations shang et al 2017 2019 the water flow continuity equation 5 dq dx q l 0 water flow motion equation 6 d dx q 2 a g a dz dx j u l q l 0 sediment continuity equation by sediment group 7 x q

the sediment concentration ad is the erosion and deposition cross sectional area ql is the lateral outflow inflow per unit of flow length for which outflow is positive and inflow is negative ul is the component of lateral outflow inflow velocity in the main flow direction qs is the lateral sediment transport rate per unit of flow length for which outflow is positive and inflow is negative γ s is the dry bulk density of the sediment zb is the riverbed elevation α is the saturation recovery coefficient calculated based on the collected data ω is the settling velocity s is the sediment carrying capacity of the water flow x is the flow length t is the time and k is the sediment group number to calculate the sediment carrying capacity of the water flow eq 9 was adopted from zhang et al 2004 as it is particularly applicable to floods with high sediment concentration an et al 2020 zhang et al 2004 this equation is written as follows zhang and zhang 1992 9 s k 0 0022 s u 3 κ γ s γ γ g h ω m l

index respectively of the sediment carrying capacity herein k 2 5 and m 0 62 the equations derived by zhang et al 2004 for calculating the settling velocity ω m are defined according to the flow

model accounts for the influence of different sediment concentrations on the settling velocity and sediment carrying capacity it can therefore adapt to the erosion and deposition changes at different sediment concentrations in silt laden rivers and can accordingly simulate the water level erosion and deposition volumes cross sectional flow and sediment concentration along the river channel 3 case study 3 1 study area the case study area stretched along the lower yellow river from the xiaolangdi reservoir to the bohai sea as shown in fig 3 the xiaolangdi reservoir is located in the last gorge along the middle reaches of the yellow river 128 km upstream of the huayuankou station below the xiaolangdi dam the yellow river main stream runs 881 km through the north china plain before emptying into the bohai sea in kenli county shandong province before the xiaolangdi reservoir was constructed the riverbed of the lower yellow river kept rising with sedimentation due to a small inflow with high sediment concentration the xiaolangdi reservoir controls 694000 km2 of drainage area representing 92 3 of the total yellow river basin engineering development tasks for this reservoir are focused on flood prevention ice jam prevention and silt reduction taking into account water supply irrigation and power generation requirements the xiaolangdi reservoir has a total storage capacity of 12 65 billion m3 including 7 55 billion m3 of sediment retention capacity since it started operating the reservoir has provided water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation and the downstream river channel has been scoured along its entire length as of april 2019 a total of 3 45 billion m3 of silt has been deposited in the reservoir and 3 billion tons have been scoured from the river channel lowering the riverbed by an average of 2 5 m 3 2 experimental setup erosion and deposition in the lower yellow river and consequently the amount of sediment required to ensure erosion deposition balance in its lower reaches are closely related to the incoming water sediment conditions as the runoff into the lower yellow river has continued to decrease since the 1960s the average annual water inflow has shrunk from 47 63 billion m3 in 1919 1959 to 25 05 billion m3 in 2000 2018 if the current changes continue at this pace the annual water inflow into the lower yellow river between 2020 and 2030 may range from approximately 21 billion m3 to 28 billion m3 with an average of 25 billion m3 the corresponding annual sediment inflow will average 300 million tons with a maximum of 800 million tons the river boundary conditions used in the model simulation are based on the river geometry prior to the 2018 flood season the effects of the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir in the current and refined operation modes on erosion deposition and sediment transport in the reservoir and lower river were examined assuming an annual average sediment inflow of 300 million tons to determine the threshold for downstream balanced sediment transport different incoming sediment scenarios were established and evaluated for the 50 years from 1959 to 2008 the annual average runoff was set to 25 billion m3 with annual average sediment discharges of 200 million 250 million and 300 million tons for incoming sediment scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively the particle size of the sediment was based on the actual measured value for the corresponding year the resulting runoff and sediment discharge processes in the different scenarios are shown in fig 4 recall that water diversion removes part of the sediment from the lower yellow river the collected data show that the average annual sediment concentration in diverted water is approximately 0 5 times that in the lower yellow river itself therefore to reflect the impact of water diversion on the quantity of sediment in the river it is necessary to understand the process of water diversion to accurately estimate the volume of diverted sediment according to different incoming water sediment conditions to meet the requirements of water use and processes for ecological economic and social development inside and outside the lower yellow river the water diversion from the lower reaches of the yellow river can be as high as 9 986 billion m3 the intra annual distribution of water volume in the lower yellow river is as shown in table 1 3 3 data acquisition the data used in this study mainly include hydrological and sediment data for the lower yellow river and design and actual operation data of the xiaolangdi reservoir all data were collected during this study or publicly released by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc herein mathematical modelling is the core technology to simulate the change in river water sediment and scouring and silting the parameters were calibrated and verified based on the data of reservoir scouring and silting collected since the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation in 1999 and data of scouring and silting change of downstream rivers since 1960 in addition the data of 306 non floodplain floods with peak flow exceeding 1000 m3 s in the lower reaches of the yellow river from 1960 to 2016 were collected and analysed to explore the characteristics of scouring silting and sediment transport during 2468 days of flood 14 hyper concentrated non floodplain floods i e floods with a maximum daily average sediment concentration exceeding 300 kg m3 were recorded during a period of 67 days these data are summarised as follows 1 hydrological and sediment data of the lower yellow river water and sediment inflow into the lower yellow river mainly originate from the mainstream and two tributaries the qinhe river and yiluo river the data describing the inflow and sediment in the main stream were provided by the xiaolangdi station called the sanmenxia station before the xiaolangdi reservoir was completed and the data describing the inflow and sediment from the two tributaries were provided by the heishiguan station hydrological data obtained at hydrological stations along the lower yellow river such as flow sediment transport rate sediment concentration and water level were compiled and released by the hydrological departments of the yrcc these hydrological stations include huayuankou jiahetan gaocun sunkou aishan luokou and lijin as shown in fig 2 the volume of erosion and deposition in the lower yellow river was calculated using the annual large cross section observations provided by the relevant hydrological department 2 actual design and operation data of the xiaolangdi reservoir the design parameters and operation rules were sourced from the design research report of the xiaolangdi water conservancy project prepared by yellow river engineering consulting co ltd yrec operation data such as water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation were provided by the xiaolangdi project management center under the ministry of water resources china 4 results and analysis 4 1 erosion and deposition changes in the lower yellow river owing to the xiaolangdi reservoir so far the xiaolangdi reservoir has blocked high sediment flood processes that could have caused sedimentation in the downstream river and has discharged clean water or high flow floodwater with low sediment concentration between 2002 and 2019 the average sediment concentration was less than 20 kg m3 in 45 out of the 49 high flow floods discharged from the xiaolangdi reservoir consequently the downstream river channel has been scoured along its entire length and the minimum bankfull discharge has increased from 1800 m3 s before the 2002 flood season to 4300 m3 s before the 2019 flood season however owing to long term scouring by clean water the riverbed sediment has coarsened in the lower reaches of the yellow river as a result the median diameter of riverbed sediment has increased from approximately 0 05 mm in 2000 to approximately 0 15 mm in 2019 and scouring efficiency has declined accordingly fig 5 compares the scouring efficiencies of the downstream river during the 2004 and 2019 flood seasons it can be seen that as the downstream river channel has scoured the sediment concentration has decreased the sediment concentration recovered by clean water at the lijin cross section has decreased from 16 kg m3 in 2004 to less than 8 kg m3 in 2019 table 2 shows the scouring and sediment transport efficiencies defined as the ratio of sediment volume to water inflow downstream and the ratio of sediment volume transported at the exit cross section to water inflow downstream respectively of non floodplain floods in the lower yellow river an analysis of the data in table 3 indicates that 1 when the sediment concentration of the floodwater moving downstream is less than 20 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the scouring efficiency of the downstream river channel is high but the sediment transport efficiency is low with a maximum of 27 7 kg m3 2 when the sediment concentration is in the range of 20 60 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the scouring efficiency decreases and the sediment transport efficiency remains low with a maximum of 40 98 kg m3 3 when the sediment concentration is in the range of 60 100 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the downstream river channel tends to silt instead of scour primarily in the section above gaocun otherwise the sediment transport efficiency increases to a maximum of 68 7 kg m3 4 when the sediment concentration is in the range of 100 200 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the downstream river channel significantly silts with slight sedimentation in the river section below gaocun and the sediment transport efficiency increases to 90 0 kg m3 5 when the sediment concentration surpasses 200 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the entire downstream river channel heavily silts and the sediment transport efficiency further increases to 97 4 kg m3 in summary with increasing sediment concentration in the downstream inflow the sediment transport efficiency of the downstream river channel increases whereas the scouring efficiency declines thus the sedimentation efficiency improves large flow flood processes with sediment concentrations exceeding 60 kg m3 can effectively transport sediment but may cause siltation in the downstream river channel in other words to improve the sediment transport capacity of the yellow river channel the xiaolangdi reservoir must discharge water with a high sediment concentration but this will likely lead to sedimentation in the downstream river channel thus a balance must be achieved between ensuring sediment flow with a high sediment concentration and maintaining the river channel profile 4 2 threshold value for balanced sediment transport in the lower yellow river 4 2 1 analysis of collected data based on the annual water and sediment volumes measured at the xiao hei wu stations i e the xiaolangdi heishiguan and wuzhi stations and the annual sediment volume measured at the lijin station between 1960 and 2015 the coefficient and index of the sediment carrying capacity can be

relatively high correlation with the measured results furthermore the dots shown in the scatter diagram of the calculated and measured sediment volumes at the lijin station fig 6 are concentrated on both sides of the 45 line also indicating high correlation between 1960 and 1986 the annual average water and sediment volumes at the xiao hei wu stations were measured to be 44 29 billion m3 and 1 175 billion tons respectively the annual average sediment volume at the lijin station during the same period was calculated to be 923 million tons which is approximately 1 greater than the measured value of 917 million tons between 1987 and 2015 the measured annual average water and sediment volumes at the xiao hei wu stations stood at 26 94 billion m3 and 408 million tons respectively the calculated annual average sediment volume at the lijin station during the same period was 284 million tons or approximately 7 greater than the measured value of 264 million tons during the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir between 1999 and 2015 the measured annual average water volume at the xiao hei wu stations decreased to 25 99 billion m3 and the measured annual average sediment volume decreased to 96 million tons the calculated annual average sediment volume at the lijin station during this period was 923 million tons i e approximately 5 less than the measured value of 136 million tons fig 5 clearly shows that the calculation results conform well to the actual situation implying high calculation accuracy based on the sediment transport relationship obtained by analysis of the collected data the sediment transport scouring and silting changes were examined under different incoming water sediment discharge conditions the results are presented in fig 7 note that the average annual sediment concentration at the lijin station downstream of the water diversion is approximately half that in the downstream water inflow thus given the amount of water diversion the amount of sediment diversion can be estimated under different incoming water sediment conditions to obtain the volume of sediment transported to the lijin station based on the information shown in fig 6 and assuming an annual average water inflow of 25 billion m3 into the lower yellow river the following conclusions can be drawn when the annual average sediment inflow from the xiaolangdi reservoir is 300 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 60 million tons 202 million tons of sediment are transported to the lijin station with 38 million tons being deposited or diverted in between when the annual average sediment inflow from the xiaolangdi reservoir is 260 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 52 million tons 185 million tons are transported to the lijin station with 23 million tons being deposited or diverted in between when the annual average sediment inflow from the xiaolangdi reservoir is 220 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 44 million tons 167 million tons are transported to the lijin station with 9 million tons being deposited or diverted in between when the annual average sediment inflow is 180 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 26 million tons 149 million tons are transported to the lijin station with 5 million tons being deposited or diverted in between these data indicate that with 25 billion m3 of water flowing into the lower yellow river if the incoming sediment exceeds 200 million tons the river downstream slightly silts in other words under this incoming water condition the sediment threshold required to maintain the erosion deposition balance in the lower yellow river is approximately 200 million tons next the water sediment collocation for downstream erosion deposition balance is analysed according to the response relationship between sediment deposition in the lower yellow river and the incoming sediment coefficient see fig 8 as shown in fig 7 there is a clear range of incoming sediment coefficients expressing the change from deposition to erosion in the downstream river channel when the incoming sediment coefficient exceeds 0 01 kg s m6 deposition dominates whereas when the incoming sediment coefficient is less than 0 01 kg s m6 erosion dominates thus the annual incoming sediment coefficient required to keep the downstream river channel from eroding or silting is approximately 0 01 kg s m6 for an annual average water inflow of 25 billion m3 with an incoming sediment coefficient of 0 01 kg s m6 the sediment threshold required to maintain the erosion deposition balance in the lower reaches of the yellow river is estimated to be 200 million tons 4 2 2 sediment transport balance equation assuming an average annual water inflow of 25 billion m3 and considering water diversion and actual water consumption along the lower yellow river the annual average water inflow at the aishan lijin section is approximately 19 billion m3 accordingly the water inflow in the flood season is approximately 9 5 billion m3 with an average flow rate of 894 m3 s for the aishan lijin section the river roughness is 0 014 the median diameter of suspended sediment is 0 018 mm converted to 0 031 mm by the particle diameter agent method and the average riverbed gradient is 0 1 per mile according to the sediment transport balance shown in eq 14 the sediment threshold at the aishan lijin section during flood season is calculated to be 170 million tons see table 4 however since 2000 the incoming sediment during the non flood season has reached 30 50 million tons again using eq 4 the sediment threshold required to maintain the sediment transport balance in the aishan lijin section outside of flood season is calculated to be 200 220 million tons 4 2 3 mathematical modelling this study used data collected from 1987 to 2015 to re verify the relevant model parameters after verification the saturation recovery coefficient in eq 8 was found to range from 0 02 to 0 04 in the erosion state and from 0 002 to 0 009 in the deposition state note that the coefficient value is larger for sections with small gradients and deep water and vice versa for most sections the coefficient value is in the range of 0 005 0 009 the erosion and deposition calculation results obtained by the verified model for the lower reaches are compared with the measured values presented in fig 9 it can be observed that the calculated values for both the deposition and erosion states conform to the measured values this demonstrates that the model can be reliably applied to simulate the critical state of the erosion deposition balance in rivers downstream of reservoirs using the srss model the erosion and deposition changes in the downstream river channel were calculated under different incoming sediment scenarios the resulting cumulative erosion deposition process is shown in fig 10 during the normal operation period of the xiaolangdi reservoir given an annual average water inflow of 25 billion m3 and under incoming sediment scenario 1 an annual average sediment inflow of 200 million tons the downstream river channel is generally scoured with a 50 year cumulative scouring volume of 740 million tons under incoming sediment scenario 3 an annual average sediment inflow of 300 million tons the downstream river channel exhibits a trend of siltation and uplift with a cumulative volume of 870 million tons of sediment deposited over 50 years under incoming sediment scenario 2 an annual average sediment inflow of 250 million tons erosion and deposition occur alternately in the downstream river channel effectively achieving a balance the above results indicate that given a 25 billion m3 water inflow into the lower yellow river the threshold for sediment transport balance is approximately 200 million tons according to the measurement based method and 200 220 million tons according to the equation based method however the former performs calculations on an annual basis whereas the latter does so according to flood non flood season therefore both methods fail to fully reflect the water sediment regulation effects of current structures such as the xiaolangdi reservoir the calculation results can however be used to represent conservative sediment transport balance thresholds in the future note that the threshold for sediment transport balance according to the mathematical model is 250 million tons a value greater than those obtained by the measurement based and equation based methods 4 3 optimisation of the xiaolangdi reservoir operation mode 4 3 1 optimised operation mode the current operation mode of the xiaolangdi reservoir was examined following the procedure shown in fig 2 the results indicate that the xiaolangdi reservoir should adjust its operation mode based on the erosion and deposition response of the downstream river channel to this end a refined operation mode is proposed as follows when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river remains at approximately 4000 m3 s the xiaolangdi reservoir may increase the discharge of water with a sediment concentration not greater than 100 kg m3 using a flow rate above 2500 m3 s after entering the lower reaches of the yellow river this flood process causes siltation in the middle section upstream of gaocun but does not have a major impact on the section downstream when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river exceeds 4500 m3 s a certain degree of siltation should be allowed the xiaolangdi reservoir may increase the discharge of water with sediment concentration not greater than 200 kg m3 using a flow rate above 2500 m3 s if the bankfull discharge of the downstream river falls below 4000 m3 s in the future the xiaolangdi reservoir can still be used for water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation by controlling the flow rate along the river channel 4 3 2 effects of refined operation mode first the effects of the current and refined operation modes of the xiaolangdi reservoir on the erosion deposition and sediment transport processes in the reservoir and downstream river channel were examined separately analysis was performed using the mathematical model for a scenario with 300 million tons of incoming sediment from the yellow river on the same basis the applicability of the refined operation mode was determined for a scenario with 800 million tons of incoming sediment 1 scenario with 300 million tons of incoming sediment fig 11 shows the calculation results for erosion and deposition in the xiaolangdi reservoir with 300 million tons of incoming sediment as shown in fig 11 a under the current operation mode the xiaolangdi reservoir is expected to stop retaining sediment in 2050 whereas the refined operation mode is expected to extend the period of sediment retention by 15 years as shown in fig 11 b under the current operation mode a cumulative 216 million tons of sediment will be deposited in the river over 50 years but under the refined operation mode the river channel will be better scoured potentially reducing sediment deposition by 543 million tons under the current operation mode and owing to large scale erosion in the river channel the bankfull discharge exceeds 4500 m3 s for 30 years and maintains a middle section flow of 4000 m3 s for 10 years only under the refined operation mode the bankfull discharge is in the range of 4000 4500 m3 s for 30 years of the 50 year calculation period in terms of sediment discharge under the current operation mode an annual average of 126 million tons of sediment can be transported to the sea at the lijin station during the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir whereas under the refined operation mode an additional 52 million tons can be transported reaching 178 million tons these results indicate that the refined operation mode better adheres to the objectives of the xiaolangdi reservoir in terms of water storage sediment retention water sediment regulation sediment discharge into the sea and downstream deposition reduction 2 scenario with 800 million tons of incoming sediment fig 12 shows the calculated erosion and deposition in the xiaolangdi reservoir for 800 million tons of incoming sediment under the current operation mode the xiaolangdi reservoir is expected to stop retaining sediment in 2030 under the refined operation mode the period of sediment retention is extended by 5 years owing to the slowdown of siltation as the xiaolangdi reservoir discharges sediment more frequently owing to water storage and sediment retention in the reservoir the discharge of clear water or floodwater with low sediment concentration under the current operation mode scours the downstream river channel to a larger extent than the refined operation mode however soon after the short sediment retention period ends deposition resumes on a large scale in the downstream river channel under the current operation mode the 50 year cumulative deposition is 1 25 billion tons higher than that under the refined operation mode as shown in fig 11 a the bankfull discharge in the downstream river channel is thus relatively large during the sediment retention period of the reservoir however a middle section flow of approximately 4000 m3 s can only be maintained for 7 years and flow is expected to drop to 2000 m3 s or less after 50 years in the refined operation mode the bankfull discharge remains at approximately 4000 m3 s for over 11 years and is expected to remain as high as 2300 m3 s after 50 years in terms of sediment discharge under the current operation mode an annual average of 382 million tons of sediment can be transported to the sea at the lijin station during the operation period of the xiaolangdi reservoir contrarily in the refined operation mode an additional 114 million tons can be transported reaching 496 million tons overall the xiaolangdi reservoir is expected to operate successfully in the proposed mode by maintaining the downstream bankfull discharge at approximately 4000 m3 s or above 4500 m3 s the water level can be reduced in a timely manner this can be achieved by discharging clear water with a sediment concentration of less than 100 kg m3 or discharging flow with a sediment concentration of less than 200 kg m3 both at a flow rate exceeding 2500 m3 s operating the xiaolangdi reservoir in this manner can slow down the siltation of both the reservoir and downstream river channel while improving the sediment transport capacity of the river channel furthermore a middle section flow of approximately 4000 m3 s can be maintained in the downstream river channel for a longer period of time the proposed revised operation mode thus ensures that the reservoir generates the full and comprehensive benefits it was designed to provide 5 discussion the construction of the xiaolangdi reservoir is a large scale water conservancy project in the middle reaches of the yellow river from november 1986 to october 1999 before the reservoir completion the average annual siltation in the downstream river channel reached 230 million tons while the bankfull discharge decreased to less than 2000 m3 s this increase in siltation and decline in flood discharge capacity was accompanied by a rise in the water level that seriously threatened the flood control safety of the lower reaches of the yellow river in october 1999 the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation to provide sediment interception and water sediment regulation since then the downstream river channel has been scoured and the minimum bankfull discharge has increased from 1800 m3 s before the 2002 flood season to 4300 m3 s before the 2019 flood season however long term scouring by clean water has coarsened the riverbed sediment in the lower reaches of the yellow river resulting in reduced scouring efficiency according to the analysis of this study the xiaolangdi reservoir needs to discharge the flow with large sediment concentration to improve the sediment transport capacity of the river channel therefore the xiaolangdi reservoir should modify its operation strategy in real time according to the current water and sediment conditions however the findings of this study suggest that under current engineering conditions it remains difficult for the xiaolangdi reservoir to solely provide water sediment regulation when the flow peaks the water level is high and the outflow sediment concentration is low however the water level must be lowered and the storage capacity limited for the reservoir to effectively discharge sediment therefore achieving the water sediment regulation mode proposed herein using only the xiaolangdi reservoir is challenging only when the upstream inflow is sufficiently large e g prediction exceeding 2500 m3 s can the xiaolangdi reservoir reduce its water level in order to discharge sediment in advance providing the proposed water sediment regulation however owing to the uncertainty of water and sediment inflow in the yellow river under natural conditions and the recent reduction in high flow water processes the downstream river channel will eventually heavily silt despite deployment of the refined operation mode therefore it is necessary to construct a backbone water conservancy project above the xiaolangdi reservoir on the yellow river mainstream this project should cooperate with the xiaolangdi reservoir to provide water and sediment regulation depending on the flow maintained in the middle section of the downstream river channel and the sediment deposition in the xiaolangdi reservoir naturally incoming water can be stored in a timely manner or used to scour the lower reaches of the yellow river and the xiaolangdi reservoir area this can restore the storage capacity of the xiaolangdi reservoir and maintain flood discharge and sediment transport functionality in the middle section of the downstream river channel for a longer period the guxian water conservancy project is one of the seven backbone projects on the yellow river main stream identified in the outline of the yellow river regulation and development plan this project is an important component of the yellow river water and sediment regulation system in february 2018 yrec completed its feasibility study report on the backbone guxian water conservancy project on the yellow river on june 19 2020 the ministry of water resources submitted the results of its own feasibility study to the national development and reform commission putting the construction of guxian water conservancy project on the agenda the guxian reservoir will be located on the northern mainstream of the middle reaches of the yellow river approximately 10 1 km upstream of the hukou waterfall it will have a total storage capacity of 12 942 billion m3 including a water and sediment regulation capacity of 2 010 billion m3 after completion the guxian reservoir will cooperate with the xiaolangdi reservoir to further improve sediment transport efficiency during flood season and raise the sediment threshold for sediment transport balance joint regulation by the guxian xiaolangdi reservoir group will primarily occur in mid to late june before the flood season and from july to september during the main flood season in mid to late june assuming that the stored water is sufficient for water supply needs water sediment regulation can be conducted if the stored water meets the process requirements 4000 m3 s flow at huayuankou station for over 5 days during the main flood season when the bankfull discharge in the downstream river channel is less than 4000 m3 s joint regulation can still focus on scouring the downstream river channel and restoring the flow capacity of the main channel when the bankfull discharge in the downstream river channel exceeds 4000 m3 s such joint regulation can create the high flow process required to maintain the middle section flow in the downstream river channel for a longer period of time removing the silt and sediment in the xiaolangdi reservoir area 6 conclusion unlike other reservoirs reservoirs in silt laden rivers are built to reduce sediment in the downstream rivers and discharge them into the sea by storing water detaining silt and regulating water and sediment under the current operation mode large amounts of sediment will deposit in a newly built reservoir and lead to the discharge of clear water consequently the sediment storage capacity and operation life of the reservoir will be reduced and navigation will be hindered because of downstream scouring identifying strategies to extend the service life of the reservoir and enhance the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river channel to discharge sediment into the sea has become a challenge for the current academic circle in this study an optimisation method of the regulation based operation mode of silt laden river reservoirs was proposed and verified through a case study on the lower reaches of the yellow river analysis of the collected data derivation of an empirical equation and mathematical simulation were deployed to investigate sediment transport in the downstream river channel further the response relationship between erosion deposition and the incoming sediment coefficient was studied then the amount of transported sediment and erosion deposition in the lower yellow river was calculated under different incoming water and sediment conditions to obtain a threshold for sediment transport balance finally given the computed threshold a refined operation mode for the xiaolangdi reservoir was proposed to further improve the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river channel the following conclusions can be drawn 1 since the onset of operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir the entire downstream river channel has been scoured resulting in a middle section with a bankfull discharge of approximately 4000 m3 s however the clear water flowing out of the xiaolangdi reservoir directly scours the riverbed increasing the median diameter of riverbed sediment from approximately 0 05 mm to approximately 0 15 mm thus reducing the scouring efficiency to fully utilise the xiaolangdi reservoir for water sediment regulation the sediment transport relationship of the lower yellow river and response relationship between the erosion deposition process and incoming sediment coefficient were investigated based on water sediment and erosion deposition data it was found that a larger sediment concentration in the downstream water inflow reduces the scouring efficiency or increases the deposition efficiency while improving the sediment transport efficiency of the downstream river 2 under the current conditions there remains room for optimisation of the operation mode of the xiaolangdi reservoir an improved operation mode could increase the sediment transport efficiency of the downstream river channel to maintain the scale of the middle section flow for a longer time the following mode was suggested when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river channel is approximately 4000 m3 s the xiaolangdi reservoir based on its current operation can increase the discharge of water with a sediment concentration of less than 100 kg m3 at a flow rate above 2500 m3 s this flooding process will cause deposition in the middle section of the lower reaches of the yellow river above gaocun but will not majorly impact the section below gaocun when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river channel exceeds 4500 m3 s a certain degree of deposition is allowed the xiaolangdi reservoir can accordingly increase the discharge of water with a sediment concentration below 200 kg m3 at a flow rate above 2500 m3 s if the bankfull discharge of the downstream river channel decreases to below 4000 m3 s in the future the xiaolangdi reservoir can still be used for water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation by controlling the flow rate along the river channel 3 at present the annual volume of water flowing into the lower yellow river fluctuates at approximately 25 billion m3 if only the xiaolangdi reservoir is deployed for sediment retention and water sediment regulation the threshold for sediment transport balance in the lower yellow river is 200 220 million tons considering the joint regulation by the xiaolangdi reservoir and associated downstream outflows the critical threshold for sediment transport balance in the lower yellow river can be increased to 250 million tons in other words joint operation can further improve the sediment transport efficiency and threshold for sediment transport balance during flood season to realise these improvements it is recommended that a backbone water conservancy project be constructed upstream of the xiaolangdi reservoir on the middle reaches of the main stream of the yellow river to support joint water sediment regulation with the xiaolangdi reservoir finally is should be noted that the xiaolangdi reservoir can easily discharge water at a flow exceeding 2500 m3 s nevertheless further research into the law of water flow and sediment movement in the reservoir area is required to increase the outflow sediment concentration to as high as 200 kg m3 according to the incoming water and sediment conditions in conclusion the benefits of this refined operation mode were quantified to provide technical support for the formulation of an upstream reservoir operation scheme for the management of the lower reaches of silt laden rivers this refined operation mode is intended to be integrated into the desilting operation plan for the xiaolangdi reservoir on the yellow river the results of this study are extremely relevant to river management research and make a clear and effective contribution to the body of knowledge by establishing the sediment balance threshold and using it to optimise the reservoir operation mode for improved downstream scouring and sediment transport 7 credit author statement yizi

4851,the inverse relationship between water and sediment is hindering the regulation of sediment in silt laden rivers under natural conditions and insufficient water flow sediment deposits along river channels resulting in the accumulation of suspended river sediments above the ground level on both sides of the river then during flooding dam collapse and overflow can easily occur threatening the life of residents in floodplain the operation of upstream reservoirs to maximise the sediment transport capacity of downstream rivers into the sea is deemed the best strategy for the management of silt laden rivers however as incoming water and sediment form a dynamic system optimising the operation mode of reservoirs has become the most severe challenge in the field this study proposes a method to remodel the water sediment relationship of natural rivers by optimising the reservoir operation first data were collected and analysed to investigate sediment transport in the downstream river channel and the response relationship between erosion deposition then an empirical equation for calculating the desired incoming sediment was derived and the threshold for sedimentary transport balance in the lower reach of silt laden rivers was determined through mathematical modelling finally the reservoir operation mode was optimised within the threshold range to study the discharge process of the reservoir with the highest sediment transport efficiency downstream the yellow river in china exhibits the highest sediment concentration worldwide and was used as a case study to verify the practicability of the proposed method the critical threshold for sediment transport balance in the lower yellow river was determined to be 250 million tons the results demonstrate that the proposed method improved the sediment transport capacity of the lower reaches of the yellow river moreover it reduced the siltation of the xiaolangdi reservoir and the lower reaches of the yellow river the xiaolangdi reservoir can be jointly operated with the guxian reservoir which is under construction and is expected to maintain the bankfull discharge of the lower reaches of the yellow river at 4000 m3 for a long time the optimisation process described in this study can be used to improve the management of silt laden rivers abbreviations srss silt laden river system simulation yrcc yellow

an annual sediment transport exceeding 100 million tons as shown in fig 1 among them china s yellow river exhibits the highest values with a maximum and average mainstream sediment concentration of 920 kg m3 and 35 kg m3 respectively zhang et al 2017 the intra and inter annual distribution of water and sediment in the yellow river is extremely unbalanced from an intra annual perspective flood season sees 60 of the annual water volume zhang 2018 and over 85 of the annual sediment inflow which is often concentrated in several storms and floods pan et al 2015 from an inter annual perspective the maximum sediment concentration was measured to be 3 91 billion tons in 1933 when the water volume was 56 10 billion m3 whereas the minimum sediment concentration was measured to be 330 million tons in 1987 though the water volume was only 20 40 billion m3 liu et al 2016 an unbalanced relationship between water and sediment in which water is relatively scarce and sediment relatively abundant is commonly found in silt laden rivers cai and rosegrant 2004 zhang et al 2018a this relationship is considered to be the root cause of siltation and riverbed uplift in the lower reach of river channels and notably leads to reduced flow capacity in the main channel xu et al 2009 naturally most silt laden rivers meander and achieve relative balance and stability compatible with their water and sediment conditions through evolution shen et al 2006 however this balance is only short lived in the long run severe siltation inevitably occurs in the lower reaches simultaneously forming beaches and troughs at bends during flooding overflow and diversion may occur consequently the breach is blocked or a new flow path is formed and the siltation process is restarted without human intervention such cycles would continue endlessly wang and li 2011 xia et al 2014 and each cycle would end catastrophically for example the diversion of the yellow river in 1855 affected over 10 million people in the anhui henan jiangsu and shandong provinces of china and caused huge economic losses qiu et al 2010 wang et al 2006 the objective of silt laden river management is to prevent downstream riverbed rise fei and wu 2015 many relevant studies have been conducted wu and zhang 2007 zhang et al 2018c 2019 which have yielded rich results that describe the sediment transport erosion and deposition processes xia et al 2016 and provide scientific and technological support for improving governance these research findings are related to the characteristics of water and sediment transport chih et al 2014 the law describing scouring and silting changes xu and cheng 2002 the amount of water used for sediment transport duan et al 2012 and the water and sediment conditions necessary to balance erosion and deposition zhang et al 2018d nevertheless the main measure to manage silt laden rivers remains the construction of reservoirs to provide combined regulation of water and sediment sheng et al 2017 the construction of reservoirs in the upper reaches of silt laden rivers changes the transport mechanism of incoming sediment and sediment in the lower reaches of rivers which in turn affects the operation of reservoirs zhang et al 2020 from the 1950s to the 1960s many reservoirs have been built on the mississippi river in the united states and the dams on both banks of the lower reaches have been heightened and strengthened the silt laden river system has achieved the highest intensity of engineering regulation and the densest construction of sediment control and guidance projects worldwide the reservoir intercepted a large amount of sediment in the mississippi river significantly reducing the amount of sediment transported to the sea elsey quirk et al 2019 but also provoking adverse effects the sediment deposition reduces the service life and the clear water discharged from the reservoir scours the downstream reach and hinders navigation the situation in the lower yellow river in china is similar to that in the mississippi river in the united states since the 1950s residents along the yellow river have constructed dikes to restrict the range of floods and protect floodplains yet the riverbed geometry has continued to deteriorate zhang et al 2017 the xiaolangdi reservoir built in 2010 controls the input to the lower yellow river since it was put into operation the downstream channels of the yellow river have been scoured along their entire courses li et al 2011 their beds have also been significantly armoured with an increase in the median diameter of sediment from 0 05 mm to 0 15 mm which undermined sediment transport efficiency wang et al 2019 optimisation of the reservoir operation mode has become an important challenge in current research li et al 2012 to further improve the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river channels and encourage sediment discharge into the sea reservoirs along silt laden rivers primarily serve to prevent floods and reduce siltation while taking into account the comprehensive utilisation of water resources in fact several studies on reservoir operation were conducted for regulating the water sediment relationship in silt laden rivers chen et al 2009 wei et al 2020 the operation methods in these studies differ in both content and form however they all make full use of the sediment transport capacity of downstream river channels during high flow river stages they also regulate the time and volume of storage and discharge to transport as much sediment as possible from the reservoir through the downstream river channels and into the sea su et al 2006 in the process of optimising the reservoir operation rules many studies have applied stochastic theory and generated stochastic hydrological data through the time series method according to the generated water and sediment data the probability of different discharge floods occurring under different conditions is predicted so as to modify the reservoir operation scheme and show the adaptability of the reservoir operation modes to incoming water and sediment lu et al 2018 sheng et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b in addition some researchers also propose the application of the latest intelligent algorithms to the real time optimisation of reservoir operation in silt laden rivers these models embody the concept of reservoir adaptive operation ali et al 2019 for example the kernel ridge regression model ali et al 2020b was used to analyse the amount of inflow water and sediment while the ensemble anfis based uncertainty assessment model ali et al 2018 was deployed to define the critical open discharge and sediment concentration ant colony optimisation random forest and other machine learning methods ali and prasad 2019 ali et al 2020a prasad et al 2019 were used to optimise the operation rules and change the critical open discharge and sediment concentration of the reservoir in real time according to the residual storage capacity of the reservoir during different periods wang et al 2020 storing clear water and discharging sediment is the common operation mode of silt laden rivers and reservoirs wang et al 2020 this artificially disturbs the soil in the riverbed downstream causing it to move and realising riverbed entrenchment and sediment discharge into the sea wang et al 2012 in other words the silt at the bottom of the river is stirred into suspension so that it can be discharged together with the natural flow resulting in desilting and sediment discharge li et al 2014 in this study optimisation of the operation mode of the xiaolangdi reservoir was carried out based on the case study of the lower reaches of the yellow river the main objective was to improve the sediment transport capacity of the lower reaches of sediment laden rivers particularly this study aimed to extend the service life of the reservoir regulate the storage and discharge of water in the reservoir and facilitate the transport of the sediment deposited in the reservoir and downstream river into the sea this was achieved by flexibly adjusting the inflow of water and sediment during the main flood season based on the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river during the large flow flood process according to the characteristics of sediment movement at different stages of reservoir operation first the collected data were analysed an empirical equation was derived and the observed behaviour was simulated to examine the sediment transport relationship of the river channel downstream of a reservoir and the response relationship between sediment deposition and the incoming sediment coefficient then the critical sediment threshold was identified to ensure sediment transport balance in the downstream river channel under the regulation of an upstream reservoir on this basis a refined operation mode for water and sediment regulation reservoirs on silt laden rivers was finally proposed the contribution of this study lays in the refinement of reservoir operation modes within the identified sediment threshold to ensure sediment transport equilibrium in the lower yellow river while maintaining ecological benignity in particular siltation reduction in both the reservoir and downstream river which was achieved by appropriately adjusting the reservoir operation requirements further facilitates the intended clear water storage and silt laden water discharge the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the methodology adopted in this study by detailing the employed technical roadmap and calculation procedure section 3 presents the details of a case study of the yellow river in terms of the study area engineering conditions and data sources and acquisition section 4 analyses the calculation results including an analysis of the impact of the xiaolangdi reservoir operation mode on erosion and deposition changes in the

the xiaolangdi reservoir section 5 details the necessity of constructing a backbone water conservancy project upstream of the xiaolangdi reservoir in the middle reaches of the yellow river to provide joint regulation in the future this necessity originates from the considerable difficulties experienced by the sole use of the xiaolangdi reservoir for water sediment regulation finally section 6 concludes this study 2 methodology 2 1 technical roadmap the overall technical roadmap of this study is shown in fig 2 first the sediment transport behaviour of downstream river channels was investigated further the response relationship between sediment deposition and the incoming sediment coefficient was explored by analysing experimental data then an empirical equation was derived and mathematical simulations were performed to establish a minimum sustainable inflow the sediment threshold of reservoir regulated silt laden rivers was identified as a precondition for maintaining ecological benignity on this basis the operation mode of the upstream reservoir was optimised to maximise erosion in the lower reaches of the silt laden rivers increasing to the greatest extent possible the sediment transport capacity and sediment discharge into the sea as shown in fig 2 there are five key steps in the optimisation of the upstream reservoir operation rules for the lower reach of silt laden rivers step 1 collect all design parameters and data recorded since the first operation of the reservoir this includes data for the floodplain area in the lower reach of silt laden rivers i e data on water and sediment inflow and sediment transport at key hydrological cross sections channel geometry detailing scouring and silting changes in key cross sections and measurements of water and sediment diversion step 2 based on the collected data qualitatively analyse erosion and deposition in the lower yellow river focusing on the impact of the reservoir water storage water sediment regulation and silt detention on the channel geometry and sediment transport efficiency step 3 propose a refined operation mode for the upstream reservoir to improve the sediment transport efficiency of the lower reaches of silt laden rivers assuming bankfull discharge step 4 use the unbalanced sediment transport model for suspended load to calculate the sediment transport capacity of the lower reaches of silt laden rivers under the refined operation mode of the upstream reservoir then compare it with the sediment threshold required to maintain ecological benignity if the sediment transport exceeds the threshold value continue to adjust the operation mode otherwise proceed to the next step step 5 compare the latest refined operation mode with the current and previously refined modes making continuous adjustments to the balanced sediment transport to ensure flood protection and ecological health the threshold for balanced sediment transport is critical for maintaining a sound river ecosystem in the lower reach of silt laden rivers and can be determined in two steps 1 use the empirical equation for balanced sediment transport to estimate the approximate interval for siltation and erosion in the lower reach of silt laden rivers 2 obtain an accurate value for the balanced sediment transport through detailed data based mathematical modelling the deployed data describe the different stages and periods of the joint water and sediment regulation provided by the upstream reservoir in flood and non flood seasons as well as the topographic data of lower reaches of silt laden rivers during the corresponding periods in this process two completely different methods i e an empirical calculation and mathematical modelling are used to generate data sequences that can be mutually verified and supplemented this ensures that the threshold obtained for the balanced sediment transport is reasonable and reliable 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 data analysis method the sediment transport capacity of silt laden rivers varies widely according to the water and sediment inflow conditions with sediment discharge generally increasing with inflow wei et al 2018 the response relationship for sediment transport can be obtained through regression analysis as follows cai et al 2020 1 w slj k 1 w xhw k 2 w sxhw c where the sediment outflow incoming water volume and incoming sediment quantity of the river section in question are wslj wxhw and wsxhw respectively k1 and k2 are coefficients and c is a constant if the volumes of water and sediment inflow are known the amount of sediment outflow can be directly estimated using eq 1 however water diversion in silt laden rivers is usually accompanied by sediment diversion so the erosion and deposition calculations must also consider the impact of water diversion the volume of erosion or deposition in the selected river section can be calculated as follows 2 w silt w sxhw w slj w sin where wsilt is the amount of erosion or deposition in which deposition is a positive value and erosion is a negative value and wsin is the amount of sediment diversion associated with water diversion then a diagram can be drawn to illustrate the relationship between the erosion deposition volume in the selected river section and the incoming sediment coefficient furthermore water and sediment collocation for erosion deposition balance in the downstream river can be analysed to estimate the incoming sediment quantity required to keep the downstream river from exhibiting either erosion or deposition this estimate corresponds to the threshold value of balanced sediment transport 2 2 2 sediment transport balance equation the basic equation describing sediment movement in terms of the riverbed sediment transport balance gradient can be derived from the water flow continuity equation uniform flow equation and sediment carrying capacity equation meng et al 2015 the sediment transport balance equation can be expressed as follows zhang 2017 3 j p k q s 0 5 n d 50 b 0 5 h 1 33 where jp is the balanced sediment transport gradient qs is the average sediment transport rate during flood season d 50 is the median diameter of suspended sediment in the river channel measured by the particle diameter agent method and expressed in mm n is the river roughness and b and h are the water surface width and water depth respectively corresponding to the average discharge q during the flood season expressed in m for a silt laden riverbed b 38 6 q 0 31 and h 0 081 q 0 44 finally k is an empirical coefficient ranging between 90 160 for most silt laden rivers herein a value of 140 is adopted for the lower reach of the yellow river the amount of sediment required to maintain the sediment transport balance can be calculated by defining qs as the amount of sediment during flood season ws divided by the duration of the flood season δt and then rearranging eq 3 as follows zhao et al 2005 4 w s b 0 5 h 1 33 j p kn d 50 2 δ t 2 2 3 mathematical modelling approach the processing conversion and parallel control platform was used to perform a silt laden river system simulation srss of the suspended load shang et al 2014 2016 the mathematical model of the srss operates on a daily suspended load basis taking into account the water sediment regulation effects of the current reservoir to facilitate the simulation of the actual hydrological process of sediment transport in the downstream reaches of silt laden rivers the governing equations for simulating the suspended load consist of the following four equations shang et al 2017 2019 the water flow continuity equation 5 dq dx q l 0 water flow motion equation 6 d dx q 2 a g a dz dx j u l q l 0 sediment continuity equation by sediment group 7 x q

it is particularly applicable to floods with high sediment concentration an et al 2020 zhang et al 2004 this equation is written as follows zhang and zhang 1992 9 s k 0 0022 s u 3 κ γ s γ γ g h ω m l

model accounts for the influence of different sediment concentrations on the settling velocity and sediment carrying capacity it can therefore adapt to the erosion and deposition changes at different sediment concentrations in silt laden rivers and can accordingly simulate the water level erosion and deposition volumes cross sectional flow and sediment concentration along the river channel 3 case study 3 1 study area the case study area stretched along the lower yellow river from the xiaolangdi reservoir to the bohai sea as shown in fig 3 the xiaolangdi reservoir is located in the last gorge along the middle reaches of the yellow river 128 km upstream of the huayuankou station below the xiaolangdi dam the yellow river main stream runs 881 km through the north china plain before emptying into the bohai sea in kenli county shandong province before the xiaolangdi reservoir was constructed the riverbed of the lower yellow river kept rising with sedimentation due to a small inflow with high sediment concentration the xiaolangdi reservoir controls 694000 km2 of drainage area representing 92 3 of the total yellow river basin engineering development tasks for this reservoir are focused on flood prevention ice jam prevention and silt reduction taking into account water supply irrigation and power generation requirements the xiaolangdi reservoir has a total storage capacity of 12 65 billion m3 including 7 55 billion m3 of sediment retention capacity since it started operating the reservoir has provided water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation and the downstream river channel has been scoured along its entire length as of april 2019 a total of 3 45 billion m3 of silt has been deposited in the reservoir and 3 billion tons have been scoured from the river channel lowering the riverbed by an average of 2 5 m 3 2 experimental setup erosion and deposition in the lower yellow river and consequently the amount of sediment required to ensure erosion deposition balance in its lower reaches are closely related to the incoming water sediment conditions as the runoff into the lower yellow river has continued to decrease since the 1960s the average annual water inflow has shrunk from 47 63 billion m3 in 1919 1959 to 25 05 billion m3 in 2000 2018 if the current changes continue at this pace the annual water inflow into the lower yellow river between 2020 and 2030 may range from approximately 21 billion m3 to 28 billion m3 with an average of 25 billion m3 the corresponding annual sediment inflow will average 300 million tons with a maximum of 800 million tons the river boundary conditions used in the model simulation are based on the river geometry prior to the 2018 flood season the effects of the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir in the current and refined operation modes on erosion deposition and sediment transport in the reservoir and lower river were examined assuming an annual average sediment inflow of 300 million tons to determine the threshold for downstream balanced sediment transport different incoming sediment scenarios were established and evaluated for the 50 years from 1959 to 2008 the annual average runoff was set to 25 billion m3 with annual average sediment discharges of 200 million 250 million and 300 million tons for incoming sediment scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively the particle size of the sediment was based on the actual measured value for the corresponding year the resulting runoff and sediment discharge processes in the different scenarios are shown in fig 4 recall that water diversion removes part of the sediment from the lower yellow river the collected data show that the average annual sediment concentration in diverted water is approximately 0 5 times that in the lower yellow river itself therefore to reflect the impact of water diversion on the quantity of sediment in the river it is necessary to understand the process of water diversion to accurately estimate the volume of diverted sediment according to different incoming water sediment conditions to meet the requirements of water use and processes for ecological economic and social development inside and outside the lower yellow river the water diversion from the lower reaches of the yellow river can be as high as 9 986 billion m3 the intra annual distribution of water volume in the lower yellow river is as shown in table 1 3 3 data acquisition the data used in this study mainly include hydrological and sediment data for the lower yellow river and design and actual operation data of the xiaolangdi reservoir all data were collected during this study or publicly released by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc herein mathematical modelling is the core technology to simulate the change in river water sediment and scouring and silting the parameters were calibrated and verified based on the data of reservoir scouring and silting collected since the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation in 1999 and data of scouring and silting change of downstream rivers since 1960 in addition the data of 306 non floodplain floods with peak flow exceeding 1000 m3 s in the lower reaches of the yellow river from 1960 to 2016 were collected and analysed to explore the characteristics of scouring silting and sediment transport during 2468 days of flood 14 hyper concentrated non floodplain floods i e floods with a maximum daily average sediment concentration exceeding 300 kg m3 were recorded during a period of 67 days these data are summarised as follows 1 hydrological and sediment data of the lower yellow river water and sediment inflow into the lower yellow river mainly originate from the mainstream and two tributaries the qinhe river and yiluo river the data describing the inflow and sediment in the main stream were provided by the xiaolangdi station called the sanmenxia station before the xiaolangdi reservoir was completed and the data describing the inflow and sediment from the two tributaries were provided by the heishiguan station hydrological data obtained at hydrological stations along the lower yellow river such as flow sediment transport rate sediment concentration and water level were compiled and released by the hydrological departments of the yrcc these hydrological stations include huayuankou jiahetan gaocun sunkou aishan luokou and lijin as shown in fig 2 the volume of erosion and deposition in the lower yellow river was calculated using the annual large cross section observations provided by the relevant hydrological department 2 actual design and operation data of the xiaolangdi reservoir the design parameters and operation rules were sourced from the design research report of the xiaolangdi water conservancy project prepared by yellow river engineering consulting co ltd yrec operation data such as water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation were provided by the xiaolangdi project management center under the ministry of water resources china 4 results and analysis 4 1 erosion and deposition changes in the lower yellow river owing to the xiaolangdi reservoir so far the xiaolangdi reservoir has blocked high sediment flood processes that could have caused sedimentation in the downstream river and has discharged clean water or high flow floodwater with low sediment concentration between 2002 and 2019 the average sediment concentration was less than 20 kg m3 in 45 out of the 49 high flow floods discharged from the xiaolangdi reservoir consequently the downstream river channel has been scoured along its entire length and the minimum bankfull discharge has increased from 1800 m3 s before the 2002 flood season to 4300 m3 s before the 2019 flood season however owing to long term scouring by clean water the riverbed sediment has coarsened in the lower reaches of the yellow river as a result the median diameter of riverbed sediment has increased from approximately 0 05 mm in 2000 to approximately 0 15 mm in 2019 and scouring efficiency has declined accordingly fig 5 compares the scouring efficiencies of the downstream river during the 2004 and 2019 flood seasons it can be seen that as the downstream river channel has scoured the sediment concentration has decreased the sediment concentration recovered by clean water at the lijin cross section has decreased from 16 kg m3 in 2004 to less than 8 kg m3 in 2019 table 2 shows the scouring and sediment transport efficiencies defined as the ratio of sediment volume to water inflow downstream and the ratio of sediment volume transported at the exit cross section to water inflow downstream respectively of non floodplain floods in the lower yellow river an analysis of the data in table 3 indicates that 1 when the sediment concentration of the floodwater moving downstream is less than 20 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the scouring efficiency of the downstream river channel is high but the sediment transport efficiency is low with a maximum of 27 7 kg m3 2 when the sediment concentration is in the range of 20 60 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the scouring efficiency decreases and the sediment transport efficiency remains low with a maximum of 40 98 kg m3 3 when the sediment concentration is in the range of 60 100 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the downstream river channel tends to silt instead of scour primarily in the section above gaocun otherwise the sediment transport efficiency increases to a maximum of 68 7 kg m3 4 when the sediment concentration is in the range of 100 200 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the downstream river channel significantly silts with slight sedimentation in the river section below gaocun and the sediment transport efficiency increases to 90 0 kg m3 5 when the sediment concentration surpasses 200 kg m3 and the flow rate exceeds 2500 m3 s the entire downstream river channel heavily silts and the sediment transport efficiency further increases to 97 4 kg m3 in summary with increasing sediment concentration in the downstream inflow the sediment transport efficiency of the downstream river channel increases whereas the scouring efficiency declines thus the sedimentation efficiency improves large flow flood processes with sediment concentrations exceeding 60 kg m3 can effectively transport sediment but may cause siltation in the downstream river channel in other words to improve the sediment transport capacity of the yellow river channel the xiaolangdi reservoir must discharge water with a high sediment concentration but this will likely lead to sedimentation in the downstream river channel thus a balance must be achieved between ensuring sediment flow with a high sediment concentration and maintaining the river channel profile 4 2 threshold value for balanced sediment transport in the lower yellow river 4 2 1 analysis of collected data based on the annual water and sediment volumes measured at the xiao hei wu stations i e the xiaolangdi heishiguan and wuzhi stations and the annual sediment volume measured at the lijin station between 1960 and 2015 the coefficient and index of the sediment carrying capacity can be determined through regression analysis 14 w slj 0 0172 w xhw 0 441 w sxhw 3 626 where the correlation coefficient r2 is 0 976 as shown in table 3 and the standard deviation σ σ is 1 12 indicating relatively high correlation with the measured results furthermore the dots shown in the scatter diagram of the calculated and measured sediment volumes at the lijin station fig 6 are concentrated on both sides of the 45 line also indicating high correlation between 1960 and 1986 the annual average water and sediment volumes at the xiao hei wu stations were measured to be 44 29 billion m3 and 1 175 billion tons respectively the annual average sediment volume at the lijin station during the same period was calculated to be 923 million tons which is approximately 1 greater than the measured value of 917 million tons between 1987 and 2015 the measured annual average water and sediment volumes at the xiao hei wu stations stood at 26 94 billion m3 and 408 million tons respectively the calculated annual average sediment volume at the lijin station during the same period was 284 million tons or approximately 7 greater than the measured value of 264 million tons during the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir between 1999 and 2015 the measured annual average water volume at the xiao hei wu stations decreased to 25 99 billion m3 and the measured annual average sediment volume decreased to 96 million tons the calculated annual average sediment volume at the lijin station during this period was 923 million tons i e approximately 5 less than the measured value of 136 million tons fig 5 clearly shows that the calculation results conform well to the actual situation implying high calculation accuracy based on the sediment transport relationship obtained by analysis of the collected data the sediment transport scouring and silting changes were examined under different incoming water sediment discharge conditions the results are presented in fig 7 note that the average annual sediment concentration at the lijin station downstream of the water diversion is approximately half that in the downstream water inflow thus given the amount of water diversion the amount of sediment diversion can be estimated under different incoming water sediment conditions to obtain the volume of sediment transported to the lijin station based on the information shown in fig 6 and assuming an annual average water inflow of 25 billion m3 into the lower yellow river the following conclusions can be drawn when the annual average sediment inflow from the xiaolangdi reservoir is 300 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 60 million tons 202 million tons of sediment are transported to the lijin station with 38 million tons being deposited or diverted in between when the annual average sediment inflow from the xiaolangdi reservoir is 260 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 52 million tons 185 million tons are transported to the lijin station with 23 million tons being deposited or diverted in between when the annual average sediment inflow from the xiaolangdi reservoir is 220 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 44 million tons 167 million tons are transported to the lijin station with 9 million tons being deposited or diverted in between when the annual average sediment inflow is 180 million tons the amount of sediment diversion is estimated to be 26 million tons 149 million tons are transported to the lijin station with 5 million tons being deposited or diverted in between these data indicate that with 25 billion m3 of water flowing into the lower yellow river if the incoming sediment exceeds 200 million tons the river downstream slightly silts in other words under this incoming water condition the sediment threshold required to maintain the erosion deposition balance in the lower yellow river is approximately 200 million tons next the water sediment collocation for downstream erosion deposition balance is analysed according to the response relationship between sediment deposition in the lower yellow river and the incoming sediment coefficient see fig 8 as shown in fig 7 there is a clear range of incoming sediment coefficients expressing the change from deposition to erosion in the downstream river channel when the incoming sediment coefficient exceeds 0 01 kg s m6 deposition dominates whereas when the incoming sediment coefficient is less than 0 01 kg s m6 erosion dominates thus the annual incoming sediment coefficient required to keep the downstream river channel from eroding or silting is approximately 0 01 kg s m6 for an annual average water inflow of 25 billion m3 with an incoming sediment coefficient of 0 01 kg s m6 the sediment threshold required to maintain the erosion deposition balance in the lower reaches of the yellow river is estimated to be 200 million tons 4 2 2 sediment transport balance equation assuming an average annual water inflow of 25 billion m3 and considering water diversion and actual water consumption along the lower yellow river the annual average water inflow at the aishan lijin section is approximately 19 billion m3 accordingly the water inflow in the flood season is approximately 9 5 billion m3 with an average flow rate of 894 m3 s for the aishan lijin section the river roughness is 0 014 the median diameter of suspended sediment is 0 018 mm converted to 0 031 mm by the particle diameter agent method and the average riverbed gradient is 0 1 per mile according to the sediment transport balance shown in eq 14 the sediment threshold at the aishan lijin section during flood season is calculated to be 170 million tons see table 4 however since 2000 the incoming sediment during the non flood season has reached 30 50 million tons again using eq 4 the sediment threshold required to maintain the sediment transport balance in the aishan lijin section outside of flood season is calculated to be 200 220 million tons 4 2 3 mathematical modelling this study used data collected from 1987 to 2015 to re verify the relevant model parameters after verification the saturation recovery coefficient in eq 8 was found to range from 0 02 to 0 04 in the erosion state and from 0 002 to 0 009 in the deposition state note that the coefficient value is larger for sections with small gradients and deep water and vice versa for most sections the coefficient value is in the range of 0 005 0 009 the erosion and deposition calculation results obtained by the verified model for the lower reaches are compared with the measured values presented in fig 9 it can be observed that the calculated values for both the deposition and erosion states conform to the measured values this demonstrates that the model can be reliably applied to simulate the critical state of the erosion deposition balance in rivers downstream of reservoirs using the srss model the erosion and deposition changes in the downstream river channel were calculated under different incoming sediment scenarios the resulting cumulative erosion deposition process is shown in fig 10 during the normal operation period of the xiaolangdi reservoir given an annual average water inflow of 25 billion m3 and under incoming sediment scenario 1 an annual average sediment inflow of 200 million tons the downstream river channel is generally scoured with a 50 year cumulative scouring volume of 740 million tons under incoming sediment scenario 3 an annual average sediment inflow of 300 million tons the downstream river channel exhibits a trend of siltation and uplift with a cumulative volume of 870 million tons of sediment deposited over 50 years under incoming sediment scenario 2 an annual average sediment inflow of 250 million tons erosion and deposition occur alternately in the downstream river channel effectively achieving a balance the above results indicate that given a 25 billion m3 water inflow into the lower yellow river the threshold for sediment transport balance is approximately 200 million tons according to the measurement based method and 200 220 million tons according to the equation based method however the former performs calculations on an annual basis whereas the latter does so according to flood non flood season therefore both methods fail to fully reflect the water sediment regulation effects of current structures such as the xiaolangdi reservoir the calculation results can however be used to represent conservative sediment transport balance thresholds in the future note that the threshold for sediment transport balance according to the mathematical model is 250 million tons a value greater than those obtained by the measurement based and equation based methods 4 3 optimisation of the xiaolangdi reservoir operation mode 4 3 1 optimised operation mode the current operation mode of the xiaolangdi reservoir was examined following the procedure shown in fig 2 the results indicate that the xiaolangdi reservoir should adjust its operation mode based on the erosion and deposition response of the downstream river channel to this end a refined operation mode is proposed as follows when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river remains at approximately 4000 m3 s the xiaolangdi reservoir may increase the discharge of water with a sediment concentration not greater than 100 kg m3 using a flow rate above 2500 m3 s after entering the lower reaches of the yellow river this flood process causes siltation in the middle section upstream of gaocun but does not have a major impact on the section downstream when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river exceeds 4500 m3 s a certain degree of siltation should be allowed the xiaolangdi reservoir may increase the discharge of water with sediment concentration not greater than 200 kg m3 using a flow rate above 2500 m3 s if the bankfull discharge of the downstream river falls below 4000 m3 s in the future the xiaolangdi reservoir can still be used for water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation by controlling the flow rate along the river channel 4 3 2 effects of refined operation mode first the effects of the current and refined operation modes of the xiaolangdi reservoir on the erosion deposition and sediment transport processes in the reservoir and downstream river channel were examined separately analysis was performed using the mathematical model for a scenario with 300 million tons of incoming sediment from the yellow river on the same basis the applicability of the refined operation mode was determined for a scenario with 800 million tons of incoming sediment 1 scenario with 300 million tons of incoming sediment fig 11 shows the calculation results for erosion and deposition in the xiaolangdi reservoir with 300 million tons of incoming sediment as shown in fig 11 a under the current operation mode the xiaolangdi reservoir is expected to stop retaining sediment in 2050 whereas the refined operation mode is expected to extend the period of sediment retention by 15 years as shown in fig 11 b under the current operation mode a cumulative 216 million tons of sediment will be deposited in the river over 50 years but under the refined operation mode the river channel will be better scoured potentially reducing sediment deposition by 543 million tons under the current operation mode and owing to large scale erosion in the river channel the bankfull discharge exceeds 4500 m3 s for 30 years and maintains a middle section flow of 4000 m3 s for 10 years only under the refined operation mode the bankfull discharge is in the range of 4000 4500 m3 s for 30 years of the 50 year calculation period in terms of sediment discharge under the current operation mode an annual average of 126 million tons of sediment can be transported to the sea at the lijin station during the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir whereas under the refined operation mode an additional 52 million tons can be transported reaching 178 million tons these results indicate that the refined operation mode better adheres to the objectives of the xiaolangdi reservoir in terms of water storage sediment retention water sediment regulation sediment discharge into the sea and downstream deposition reduction 2 scenario with 800 million tons of incoming sediment fig 12 shows the calculated erosion and deposition in the xiaolangdi reservoir for 800 million tons of incoming sediment under the current operation mode the xiaolangdi reservoir is expected to stop retaining sediment in 2030 under the refined operation mode the period of sediment retention is extended by 5 years owing to the slowdown of siltation as the xiaolangdi reservoir discharges sediment more frequently owing to water storage and sediment retention in the reservoir the discharge of clear water or floodwater with low sediment concentration under the current operation mode scours the downstream river channel to a larger extent than the refined operation mode however soon after the short sediment retention period ends deposition resumes on a large scale in the downstream river channel under the current operation mode the 50 year cumulative deposition is 1 25 billion tons higher than that under the refined operation mode as shown in fig 11 a the bankfull discharge in the downstream river channel is thus relatively large during the sediment retention period of the reservoir however a middle section flow of approximately 4000 m3 s can only be maintained for 7 years and flow is expected to drop to 2000 m3 s or less after 50 years in the refined operation mode the bankfull discharge remains at approximately 4000 m3 s for over 11 years and is expected to remain as high as 2300 m3 s after 50 years in terms of sediment discharge under the current operation mode an annual average of 382 million tons of sediment can be transported to the sea at the lijin station during the operation period of the xiaolangdi reservoir contrarily in the refined operation mode an additional 114 million tons can be transported reaching 496 million tons overall the xiaolangdi reservoir is expected to operate successfully in the proposed mode by maintaining the downstream bankfull discharge at approximately 4000 m3 s or above 4500 m3 s the water level can be reduced in a timely manner this can be achieved by discharging clear water with a sediment concentration of less than 100 kg m3 or discharging flow with a sediment concentration of less than 200 kg m3 both at a flow rate exceeding 2500 m3 s operating the xiaolangdi reservoir in this manner can slow down the siltation of both the reservoir and downstream river channel while improving the sediment transport capacity of the river channel furthermore a middle section flow of approximately 4000 m3 s can be maintained in the downstream river channel for a longer period of time the proposed revised operation mode thus ensures that the reservoir generates the full and comprehensive benefits it was designed to provide 5 discussion the construction of the xiaolangdi reservoir is a large scale water conservancy project in the middle reaches of the yellow river from november 1986 to october 1999 before the reservoir completion the average annual siltation in the downstream river channel reached 230 million tons while the bankfull discharge decreased to less than 2000 m3 s this increase in siltation and decline in flood discharge capacity was accompanied by a rise in the water level that seriously threatened the flood control safety of the lower reaches of the yellow river in october 1999 the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation to provide sediment interception and water sediment regulation since then the downstream river channel has been scoured and the minimum bankfull discharge has increased from 1800 m3 s before the 2002 flood season to 4300 m3 s before the 2019 flood season however long term scouring by clean water has coarsened the riverbed sediment in the lower reaches of the yellow river resulting in reduced scouring efficiency according to the analysis of this study the xiaolangdi reservoir needs to discharge the flow with large sediment concentration to improve the sediment transport capacity of the river channel therefore the xiaolangdi reservoir should modify its operation strategy in real time according to the current water and sediment conditions however the findings of this study suggest that under current engineering conditions it remains difficult for the xiaolangdi reservoir to solely provide water sediment regulation when the flow peaks the water level is high and the outflow sediment concentration is low however the water level must be lowered and the storage capacity limited for the reservoir to effectively discharge sediment therefore achieving the water sediment regulation mode proposed herein using only the xiaolangdi reservoir is challenging only when the upstream inflow is sufficiently large e g prediction exceeding 2500 m3 s can the xiaolangdi reservoir reduce its water level in order to discharge sediment in advance providing the proposed water sediment regulation however owing to the uncertainty of water and sediment inflow in the yellow river under natural conditions and the recent reduction in high flow water processes the downstream river channel will eventually heavily silt despite deployment of the refined operation mode therefore it is necessary to construct a backbone water conservancy project above the xiaolangdi reservoir on the yellow river mainstream this project should cooperate with the xiaolangdi reservoir to provide water and sediment regulation depending on the flow maintained in the middle section of the downstream river channel and the sediment deposition in the xiaolangdi reservoir naturally incoming water can be stored in a timely manner or used to scour the lower reaches of the yellow river and the xiaolangdi reservoir area this can restore the storage capacity of the xiaolangdi reservoir and maintain flood discharge and sediment transport functionality in the middle section of the downstream river channel for a longer period the guxian water conservancy project is one of the seven backbone projects on the yellow river main stream identified in the outline of the yellow river regulation and development plan this project is an important component of the yellow river water and sediment regulation system in february 2018 yrec completed its feasibility study report on the backbone guxian water conservancy project on the yellow river on june 19 2020 the ministry of water resources submitted the results of its own feasibility study to the national development and reform commission putting the construction of guxian water conservancy project on the agenda the guxian reservoir will be located on the northern mainstream of the middle reaches of the yellow river approximately 10 1 km upstream of the hukou waterfall it will have a total storage capacity of 12 942 billion m3 including a water and sediment regulation capacity of 2 010 billion m3 after completion the guxian reservoir will cooperate with the xiaolangdi reservoir to further improve sediment transport efficiency during flood season and raise the sediment threshold for sediment transport balance joint regulation by the guxian xiaolangdi reservoir group will primarily occur in mid to late june before the flood season and from july to september during the main flood season in mid to late june assuming that the stored water is sufficient for water supply needs water sediment regulation can be conducted if the stored water meets the process requirements 4000 m3 s flow at huayuankou station for over 5 days during the main flood season when the bankfull discharge in the downstream river channel is less than 4000 m3 s joint regulation can still focus on scouring the downstream river channel and restoring the flow capacity of the main channel when the bankfull discharge in the downstream river channel exceeds 4000 m3 s such joint regulation can create the high flow process required to maintain the middle section flow in the downstream river channel for a longer period of time removing the silt and sediment in the xiaolangdi reservoir area 6 conclusion unlike other reservoirs reservoirs in silt laden rivers are built to reduce sediment in the downstream rivers and discharge them into the sea by storing water detaining silt and regulating water and sediment under the current operation mode large amounts of sediment will deposit in a newly built reservoir and lead to the discharge of clear water consequently the sediment storage capacity and operation life of the reservoir will be reduced and navigation will be hindered because of downstream scouring identifying strategies to extend the service life of the reservoir and enhance the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river channel to discharge sediment into the sea has become a challenge for the current academic circle in this study an optimisation method of the regulation based operation mode of silt laden river reservoirs was proposed and verified through a case study on the lower reaches of the yellow river analysis of the collected data derivation of an empirical equation and mathematical simulation were deployed to investigate sediment transport in the downstream river channel further the response relationship between erosion deposition and the incoming sediment coefficient was studied then the amount of transported sediment and erosion deposition in the lower yellow river was calculated under different incoming water and sediment conditions to obtain a threshold for sediment transport balance finally given the computed threshold a refined operation mode for the xiaolangdi reservoir was proposed to further improve the sediment transport capacity of the downstream river channel the following conclusions can be drawn 1 since the onset of operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir the entire downstream river channel has been scoured resulting in a middle section with a bankfull discharge of approximately 4000 m3 s however the clear water flowing out of the xiaolangdi reservoir directly scours the riverbed increasing the median diameter of riverbed sediment from approximately 0 05 mm to approximately 0 15 mm thus reducing the scouring efficiency to fully utilise the xiaolangdi reservoir for water sediment regulation the sediment transport relationship of the lower yellow river and response relationship between the erosion deposition process and incoming sediment coefficient were investigated based on water sediment and erosion deposition data it was found that a larger sediment concentration in the downstream water inflow reduces the scouring efficiency or increases the deposition efficiency while improving the sediment transport efficiency of the downstream river 2 under the current conditions there remains room for optimisation of the operation mode of the xiaolangdi reservoir an improved operation mode could increase the sediment transport efficiency of the downstream river channel to maintain the scale of the middle section flow for a longer time the following mode was suggested when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river channel is approximately 4000 m3 s the xiaolangdi reservoir based on its current operation can increase the discharge of water with a sediment concentration of less than 100 kg m3 at a flow rate above 2500 m3 s this flooding process will cause deposition in the middle section of the lower reaches of the yellow river above gaocun but will not majorly impact the section below gaocun when the bankfull discharge of the downstream river channel exceeds 4500 m3 s a certain degree of deposition is allowed the xiaolangdi reservoir can accordingly increase the discharge of water with a sediment concentration below 200 kg m3 at a flow rate above 2500 m3 s if the bankfull discharge of the downstream river channel decreases to below 4000 m3 s in the future the xiaolangdi reservoir can still be used for water storage sediment retention and water sediment regulation by controlling the flow rate along the river channel 3 at present the annual volume of water flowing into the lower yellow river fluctuates at approximately 25 billion m3 if only the xiaolangdi reservoir is deployed for sediment retention and water sediment regulation the threshold for sediment transport balance in the lower yellow river is 200 220 million tons considering the joint regulation by the xiaolangdi reservoir and associated downstream outflows the critical threshold for sediment transport balance in the lower yellow river can be increased to 250 million tons in other words joint operation can further improve the sediment transport efficiency and threshold for sediment transport balance during flood season to realise these improvements it is recommended that a backbone water conservancy project be constructed upstream of the xiaolangdi reservoir on the middle reaches of the main stream of the yellow river to support joint water sediment regulation with the xiaolangdi reservoir finally is should be noted that the xiaolangdi reservoir can easily discharge water at a flow exceeding 2500 m3 s nevertheless further research into the law of water flow and sediment movement in the reservoir area is required to increase the outflow sediment concentration to as high as 200 kg m3 according to the incoming water and sediment conditions in conclusion the benefits of this refined operation mode were quantified to provide technical support for the formulation of an upstream reservoir operation scheme for the management of the lower reaches of silt laden rivers this refined operation mode is intended to be integrated into the desilting operation plan for the xiaolangdi reservoir on the yellow river the results of this study are extremely relevant to river management research and make a clear and effective contribution to the body of knowledge by establishing the sediment balance threshold and using it to optimise the reservoir operation mode for improved downstream scouring and sediment transport 7 credit author statement yizi

4852,agricultural practices induced pollution runoff has been widely acknowledged to be a significant source of nutrients fueling cyanobacterial bloom the impact of topdressing activities on cyanobacterial bloom phenology key parameters for depicting bloom process however has not been verified taking lake erhai a typical eutrophic plateau lake as an example this study explored the spatio temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extent for surface cyanobacterial bloom based on phycocyanin pigment series retrieved from satellite and investigated the bloom responses to environmental forces the results showed that higher intensity and earlier onset bloom with a larger coverage extent mainly occurred in the northern region we identified three distinct cyanobacterial bloom growth patterns with large inter annual variability in their bloom initiation timing bit the earlier bit is highly linked to elevated total nitrogen level and decreased wind speed the bloom amplitude is mainly related to summer tn in 2003 2011 while associated with winter tn tp ratio tn total nitrogen tp total phosphorus during 2016 2019 additionally we found direct evidence linking agricultural topdressing and the bit of a typical autumn bloom after one week for the topdressing practice the bits lagged by approximately average 23 days coinciding with high rainfall intensity our research demonstrates the topdressing activity should be reduced through agricultural planting adjustments high tn and tp loss crops should be prohibited planting adjustments should decrease high tp loss crop plantings in response to regional environmental forces keywords cyanobacterial bloom phycocyanin pigment phenology metrics agricultural topdressing practices erhai lake 1 introduction overuse of chemical fertilizers e g nitrogen and phosphorus in intensive production related to the global expansion of industrialized agriculture and the intensification of conventional agricultural practices has resulted in increased runoff and subsequently a high level of water pollution into aquatic ecosystems beman et al 2005 huisman et al 2018 this induces eutrophication and frequently occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom in water bodies guan et al 2020 o neil et al 2012 further posing severe environmental and ecological problems for inland waters understanding the critical temporal points during the cyanobacteria growth season could uncover the workings of the bloom process not merely the temporally associated bloom frequencies mishra et al 2019 the initiation date peak timing and amplitude of cyanobacterial blooms are used to define the phenology of cyanobacterial bloom palmer et al 2015 long term monitoring of cyanobacterial bloom phenology will significantly improve our understanding of the driving mechanism behind these cyanobacterial blooms huisman et al 2018 huang et al 2020 moreover this knowledge could suggest effective means for controlling blooms related to human impacts on the environment paerl and barnard 2020 however lack of long term on site measurements of cyanobacteria in traditional methods presents difficulties in quantifying the cyanobacterial bloom phenology satellite remote sensing providing favorable spatial and temporal coverage has exhibited as an extractive tool for investigating long term cyanobacterial bloom phenology hu et al 2010 previous researches have applied remote sensing technology to quantify cyanobacterial bloom phenology based on an intermediary such as floating algal index fai and chlorophyll a chla pigment in particular chla is a universal index for all phytoplankton while the fai is generally to characterize the intense cyanobacterial blooms or surface floating algae scums hu et al 2010 however little research to date has utilized cyanobacterial phycocyanin pigment pc concentration as an intermediary for the quantification of cyanobacterial bloom phenology pc is generally considered a diagnostic pigment for capturing cyanobacterial bloom qi et al 2014 and a biological indicator for eutrophication than physiochemical indicators nitrogen n or phosphorus p which merely act as indirect indicators remotely sensed pc time series have great potential for investigating the temporal pattern of cyanobacteria and further qualification of cyanobacteria phenology palmer et al 2015 shi et al 2019a 2019b as a proxy for cyanobacteria presence satellite estimated pc concentration can be retrieved robustly using the pc index pci algorithm which is immune to disturbances and is not sensitive to perturbations from submerged macrophytes and other floating mats in surface water qi et al 2014 therefore the pci algorithm provides a solid foundation for establishing long term records of pc products and cyanobacterial bloom phenology moreover the bloom phenology is influenced by several potential driving forces gittings et al 2018 yang et al 2016 sasaoka et al 2011 such as nutrient enrichment shi et al 2019a 2019b duan et al 2014 and meteorology variability zhang et al 2012 marchese et al 2017 among these influential factors the lake nutrient level plays a crucial role in prompting cyanobacterial growth and dominating phytoplankton group and relatively responsive to human intervention shi et al 2017 huo et al 2019 topdressing fertilization activity is the primary human intervention especially in agricultural dominated areas inappropriate topdressing fertilization schemes i e quantity and timing lead to excess nutrient exports via surface runoff from surrounding watersheds tang et al 2012a 2012b li et al 2020 agricultural planting in erhai lake basin is the main reason for the water pollution of erhai lake hu et al 2018 lake erhai faced with a big challenge stems from runoff from the fertilizers and pesticides applied to the surrounding farmland and the pollution from the farmland account for at least 60 of the pollutants entering the lake guo et al 2001 even though most studies have reached a consensus that agricultural runoff could fuel phytoplankton bloom especially in intensive farm areas the impact of topdressing on the phytoplankton bloom phenology was not verified by observations this study fills this gap by linking the exogenous agriculture pollution induced by topdressing and cyanobacterial bloom phenology thereby providing a scientific reference for agricultural planting structure adjustment in this study satellite estimated pc dataset was used to obtain the spatio temporal distribution of cyanobacterial bloom features using the gaussian fitting model and linear unmixing model during 2003 2011 and 2016 2019 then the bloom response to environmental factors is analyzed to uncover the driving forces of bloom dynamics finally the impact of topdressing on bloom phenology was verified 2 material and method 2 1 study area erhai lake 25 57 25 36 n 100 05 100 17 e fig 1 was selected as our study area as it is a typical semi deep plateau freshwater lake and the main water resource for residents of dali city in yunnan province of southwestern china this lake is considered to be in the representative preliminary eutrophic stage wang et al 2015 shang et al 2012 the lake s total area is approximately 251 km2 erhai lake has an average annual temperature of 15 1 c and exhibits significant seasonal precipitation in 2003 2019 about 80 rainfall was in the wet season from may to october also the rice growing season paddy rice or maize is the predominant crop in summer with the growth stages from may to september and cultivated commonly in rotation with winter crops primarily include garlic broad beans oilseed rape and wheat with the growing season from october to april li et al 2018a 2018b there are three prominent rivers flowing into the lake contributing to 60 of the total water inflow in the north of erhai lake basin these include the miju the luoshi and the yongan rivers cao et al 2018 which carry large scale agricultural pollutants liu et al 2019 2 2 data source and pre processing this study s primary datasets included satellite estimated pc time series field measurements involving phytoplankton species composition data and auto monitoring measurements from water quality gauges other data sets such as field sampling measurements extracted from tang et al 2012a tang et al 2012b and liu et al 2011 and data collected from statistical yearbooks dataset meteorological gauge and auxiliary monthly water environment data were also employed in this study these data required preprocessing before they could be fed into the following analysis satellite estimated pc concentrations over periods of 2003 2011 and 2016 2019 were retrieved and validated based on the pci algorithm according to qi et al 2014 using rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc data the rrc datasets were obtained by using the rayleigh correction module embedded in sentinel application platform image processor snap version 7 1 to remove molecular rayleigh scattering effects evident in the images collected by the medium resolution instrument sensor meris onboard the envisat satellite 2003 2011 and ocean land color instrument olci on the sentinel 3 satellite 2016 2019 then the rrc dataset was used to calculate the pc index pci the pci is as follows 1 pci r rc 620 r rc 620 2 r rc 620 r rc 560 620 560 665 560 r rc 665 r rc 560 the pci is constructed here as the spectral differences between local rrc trough at 620 nm diagnosed distinctive absorption peak and baseline formed between rrc 560 and rrc 665 which has been demonstrated a reliable index for estimating pc pigment concentrations or identifying cyanobacterial bloom qi et al 2014 the estimated pc were obtained through model development and validation based on the pci method proposed by qi et al 2014 field measurements are obtained covering different periods water samples surface water and ditch water measurements from four typical crop rotation systems in 2009 along the basins of miju river and luoshi river which were arranged in lines from the north bank of erhai lake northwards covering all seven towns in situ data of phytoplankton species composition were obtained from june to november covering cyanobacteria growing season in 2016 the daily total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp from the main inflow rivers during 2016 2018 were obtained from auto monitoring water quality gauges datasets were collected from statistical records compiled by government agencies yearly agricultural industry related data in dali city during 1995 2018 were derived from the statistical yearbooks of yunnan province daily meteorological datasets such as rainfall rainf mm sunshine duration sundur h wind speed wspd m s and air pressure airprs hpa were sourced from the national meteorological administration of china http data cma cn and used to calculate the corresponding monthly climatological data additionally rainfall intensity ri mm is here defined as monthly maximum consecutive 5 day rainfall auxiliary monthly datasets including water temperature wtemp c nutrient tn and tp mg l were obtained from the bureau of erhai protection and administration of dali satellite estimated pc time series were used for the retrieval of phenology metrics and bloom coverage all the monthly environmental forcing data were used to calculate the corresponding seasonal mean sub seasonal early middle late mean data the seasonal and sub seasonal mean data such as tn tp wtemp rainf ri sundur wspd and airprs were all included in the multi linear regression to account for their impacts on cyanobacterial bloom phenology 2 3 retrieval of phenology metrics and bloom coverage the phenology metrics and coverage were main features for characterizing cyanobacterial blooms fig 2 presents a flowchart to show how the phenology features and coverage extent of cyanobacterial bloom were extracted based on the estimated in record phycocyanin pigment pc time series derived from all segments of the entire lake these include the bloom initiation timing bit bloom peaking time bpt bloom amplitude ba bloom duration bd and bloom coverage the primary dataset used for phenology metrics determination is the satellite estimated pc concentrations the pc concentration series were obtained through model development and validation based on the pci algorithm defined as equation 1 and 2 using rrc products such as rrc 620 rrc 560 and rrc 665 which are obtained by a preprocessing procedure followed by the approach described in qi et al 2014 these pc time series were then used for the preprocessing procedure the binning and filtering procedure reduces the effect of outliers at an appropriate temporal resolution for describing the bloom phenology an 8 day composite pc time series was created by binning and median averaging in a preprocessing step for phenological metrics extraction in view of the limited amount of valid satellite data then the resulting 8 day binned data are filtered using the savizky golay approach palmer et al 2015 the cyanobacterial bloom with higher amplitude and longer duration in the annual cycle is considered as the criteria for determining the primary bloom a gaussian fitting procedure for extracting primary bloom phenological metrics was performed given the condition that secondary bloom may occur in addition to primary bloom in an annual period a two peak gaussian function eq 3 for describing two peak characteristics of the annual bloom was fitted to the filtered composite pc dataset and subsequently the baseline of phenological metrics for the primary bloom was extracted to increase the goodness of the phenological fitting procedure the baseline of metrics from the identified primary bloom was then taken as initiation parameters for further adjusted gaussian fitting eq 4 based on the algorithm proposed by park et al 2019 the best fitted parameters were finally obtained using the least squares method through the iterated procedure 3 c x c 0 i 1 2 h i exp x t pi 2 2 σ i 2 4 c x c 0 h exp x t p 2 2 σ 2 d 1 exp x t p 2 σ in these two equations c 0 is the background pc concentration baseline pc level determined by the fitted function h is the ba which is the highest value of pc during the bloom event t p is the bpt date at which the pc reaches its maximum value σ is the bloom width x is the time step and d represents the residual pc concentration the bit was determined from the fitted pc time series using two groups of methods a threshold method and inflection point detection method were applied wang et al 2019 for a dynamic threshold method bitdt or t i eq 5 was identified as the date when the fitted function reaches a specific percentage 50 of the annual maximum amplitude similar to the relative threshold method of zhai et al 2011 another approach for inflection point detection in the smoothed annual pc time series curve was also adopted to determine the bit from the annual pc series for the curvature method the bitip is defined as when the rate of change in pc curvature reached the local maximum given that rapid and excessive cyanobacterial growth is commonly referred to as a bloom the average of the above two bits was considered as the robust bit when the difference is below 20 days 5 t i t p 1 17 σ the bd is defined as the period from initiation to when the pc concentration change decreases to 50 of the amplitude equivalent to twice the difference between bit and bpt moreover the bloom intensity map was obtained by calculating the ratio of the ba and its corresponding bd in a pixel by pixel procedure apart from the phenological feature extraction approach partial pixel cyanobacteria coverage was determined based on a long term estimated pc dataset using a linear unmixing algorithm the method proposed by hu et al 2010 was employed given the linear design of pci facilitates pixel unmixing the preprocessing step for the unmixing algorithm determines the threshold for non algal and full algal pixels however little research has taken a pc range for classifying the bloom level here bloom thresholds were determined according to an empirical logarithm and piece wise linear relationship between satellite estimated pc and in situ cyanobacteria biomass and cell density proportion among available matchups derived from water samples n 28 specifically as shown in fig s1 pc s ability to indicate cyanobacteria abundance proportion is reduced as the proportion of cyanobacteria abundance becomes saturated with pcs additionally cyanobacteria comprising more than 80 of phytoplankton cell density were considered dominant cyanobacteria orr et al 2010 thus when cyanobacteria constitute more than 80 of the phytoplankton cell density above 41ug l by pc level this pc level is considered a threshold for sparse bloom meanwhile the dense bloom threshold by pc level is defined as 334ug l with 100 cyanobacterial biomass proportion therefore we took the pc value of pixel p c pixel below 41ug l and above 334ug l as the threshold of the nonalgal pixel p c th sparse and full algal pixel p c th dense respectively in between p c th sparse and p c th dense p c pixel is normalized to obtain the ratio of partial coverage for the corresponding mixed pixel α pixel as follow 6 α pixel p c pixel p c th sparse p c th dense p c th sparse as such the corresponding coverage can be obtained by a pixel s coverage 0 09 km2 multiplied by α pixel when the pixel pc value is more than p c densebloom the cyanobacteria coverage is considered as 0 09 km2 the whole coverage in each image is obtained by summing all the coverage for each available pixel 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extension lake erhai shows distinct spatial and temporal heterogeneity for the bloom phenology metrics i e bit and ba especially in the northern lake as shown in fig 3 the average bit in the northern region was nine days earlier than the bit for the entire lake the bit in the entire lake ranged from 179 to 327 according to the day of the year doy with annual average bit of 246 the average bit in the entire lake was nearly the same as the average bit in the central or southern lake the highest ba was observed in the north region followed by the central and south areas as listed in table1 the top three high ba value ranked in order of decreasing priority occurring in 2003 2006 and 2008 with the mean value of 1419 76 μgl 1 while the top three low value ranked in the same order occurring in 2018 2005 and 2010 with the average value of 16 86 μgl 1 no temporal trend was observed during 2003 2011 in the annual mean ba while in 2016 2019 the annual average ba showed a weak declining trend specifically the ba decreased apparently from 2016 139 2ug l to 2018 21 8ug l and rebounded 2 5 times higher in 2019 than that in 2018 the summertime ba over the period 2016 2019 remained low as compared to the other seasons fig 3 apart from analyzing the magnitude of the ba in the inter annual blooms all the annual cyanobacteria growth cycles can be grouped into three dominant seasonal cycles such as early peak late peak and winter max by normalizing 52 annual pc time series derived from different regions fig 4 as shown in fig 4a the seasonal cycle characterized by an early season peak with the pc value increasing from may and decreasing from its peak in june or july to a minimum in october was labeled early peak average bit reaching doy 173 specifically the blooms occurring in 2003 and 2006 belong to the early peak group with the highest average ba up to 1162 6ug l and shortest bd reaching 62 days the late peak seasonal cycle average bit reaching doy 173 is characterized by a summer pc minimum then a longer late summer or early autumn elevated period from july through october fig 4b as displayed in fig 4c the seasonal cycle characterized by a weak summer pc maximum for a short period and distinct elevated levels in late autumn then to its peak in early winter was denoted as winter max with bit reaching doy 319 for example the blooms occurring in 2016 and 2017 were grouped to the winter max mode with higher ba and shorter bd than the late peak mode these results suggest that about 70 percent of all annual pc fitting time series were labeled as the lake peak mode or typical autumn bloom pattern while the early peak and winter max mode accounted for comparably about 15 of the total thus the lake peak mode appears the primary cyanobacteria growth periods whereas other modes seem to result from inter annual environmental changes the spatial heterogeneity of bloom coverage in regions is similar to the ba s spatial heterogeneity with the highest bloom coverage observed in the north region followed by central and south areas fig 5 as shown in table1 during 2003 2011 the average bloom coverage area was 207 4 km2 for ba 420 μgl 1 specifically large summer blooms occurred in july 2003 and august 2006 with the maximum coverage extent of 233 7 and 181 0 km2 respectively in contrast in 2016 2019 a widespread reduction in the spatial extent was particularly apparent with a trough occurring in 2018 the maximum area of 14 4 km2 in the growing season and bloom coverage increased slightly in 2019 with a maximum of 56 4 km2 in particular winter bloom coverage reached about 163 9 and 125 9 km2 occurring in december 2016 and 2017 table1 meanwhile the typical autumn bloom coverage has an average value of 49 7 38 8 km2 detailed spatial and temporal differences of the bit and bloom intensity were shown in fig 6 in 2003 and 2006 the bloom occurrence was earliest with the average doy 174 9 and showed consistent spatial variation fig 6a along with the most extensive bloom coverage of 207 4 km2 in the entire lake in contrast the entire lake experienced a distinct delayed bit in 2016 and 2017 except for the northern area fig 6b shows that the strongest bloom intensity was observed in the northern and central regions of lake erhai in 2003 35 7 μgl 1day 1 and 2006 3 0 μgl 1day 1 overall these blooms showed earlier onset and stronger intensity in the northern lake than other parts of the lake in addition the observed bloom intensity pattern was found to be consistent with the spatial distribution of nutrient sources obtained by li et al 2018a li et al 2018b and li et al 2020 thus the northern lake turns out to be an ideal location for cyanobacterial blooms owing to the effect of the surrounding agricultural activities 3 2 cyanobacterial bloom phenology linked with meteorological factors and lake water quality a strengthened summer tn and weakened autumn wspd significantly lead to an earlier onset of the blooms in the period 2003 2011 as shown in fig 7 a the years 2003 2006 marked by the earlier bit in 2003 2011 the regression results for the bit showed that early summer tn and early autumn wspd were the primary contributors explaining 87 of the inter annual variation in bit p 0 01 table 2 fig 7b it was clear that the bit was delayed in the period 2003 2011 when summer tn decreased and autumn wspd increased simultaneously according to this relationship the impact of the tn and wspd on the bit was quantitatively estimated considering their contribution and variability as presented in fig 7c the bit was delayed by about 91 days in 2007 as compared to the bit in 2006 while the bloom occurred around 43 days later in 2004 than in 2003 the decrease of tn in 2006 2007 is similar to that in 2003 2004 which is 0 23 and 0 24 mg l respectively in contrast the increase of wspd 0 2 m s in 2006 2007 was four times that in 2003 2004 0 05 m s the decrease in the combined effect of the tn and wspd during 2006 2007 was just half than that during 2003 2004 these results show that although the wind speed increased greatly and tn decreased little between the two periods the joint interpretation of tn and wspd decreased not that much because tn alone could account for 60 of the variability of bits in contrast low late summer wspd significantly leads to earlier cyanobacterial bloom onset for period 2016 2019 based on the regression result as shown in fig 7d and fig 7e an advance trend of the bloom was noticeable with reduced wspd 30 days year 1 p 0 05 the linear regression for the bit shows that late summer wspd explained up to 93 5 of the observed total variation in the bit p 0 05 table 2 fig 7f indeed low wind speed plays a prerequisite role in forming cyanobacteria surface cyanobacteria aggregation especially when the wind speed is 3 4 m s zhang et al 2012 the effect of wind speed on bloom phenology is also revealed by zhang et al 2012 and shi et al 2019a shi et al 2019b that low wind speed could advance cyanobacterial bloom in lake taihu the inter annual bit variances were grouped according to the bloom type to explore their seasonal responses to potential environmental factors as presented in fig 8 the wtemp and sundur exhibit a distinct correlation with the bit variance this indicates that the bit was delayed significantly with the decrease in late summer sunshine hours r 0 76 p 0 05 and with the warmer water temperature in early autumn r 0 71 fig 8 in particular the negative relation between the bit and sunshine hours was also found by zhang et al 2012 indicating that elevated light duration promotes cyanobacteria dominance also the results suggest that blooms occurring in summer generally witnessed lower early autumn wtemp while blooms occurring in winter were subject to a higher early autumn wtemp in the lake erhai area especially for bloom occurrence in winter cyanobacterial bloom onset in winter is related to the increase in water temperature trombetta et al 2019 the regression result for the bloom amplitude ba and environmental factors suggests that the tn appears to be the primary nutrient fueling the bloom in 2003 2011 while tn tp ratio became the main factor prompting the bloom in 2016 2019 for instance as for the ba in 2003 2011 the summer tn and rainfall intensity ri explained 61 9 and 24 7 of the ba variation p 0 01 table 2 indicating that the enhanced amplitude is significantly correlated with both increased summer tn and ri moreover cyanobacterial species without n fixing ability i e microcystis were found to generally dominate in summer and autumn and form the bloom yu et al 2014 in addition the increase in tn level is likely to induce cyanobacterial bloom therefore the relationship between tn and the ba in 2003 2011 has more to do with the rising tn driving increased cyanobacterial bloom rather than the n fixing cyanobacteria i e anabaena producing a large amount of tn by fixing nitrogen in the atmosphere in contrast winter tn tp ratio in 2016 2019 accounted for 91 3 of the ba variations and is negative with bloom amplitude suggesting bloom amplitude tended to increase when tn tp decreases 3 3 nutrient n and p effects of agricultural activities in erhai lake basin crops vary in their n and p fertilizer rate owing to their unique fertilizer requirements for instance as shown in fig 9 a crop garlic exhibits the highest n application rate followed by maize while broad bean shows the highest p application rate meanwhile in the northern lake basin the three crops displayed higher sown areas than other crops with an average of 4004 hm2 following rice which covered the largest extent thus crops such as garlic broad bean and maize contributed to a higher risk of n and p loss inter annual variability of agricultural activities is shown in fig 9b by depicting fertilizer amount and sown area for crop planting as for the long term fertilizer n and p application in dali city a distinct reduction occurred in 2018 following a slowly decreasing trend from 2013 to 2017 resulting from the strict control of external nutrient loadings with regards to the sown area for crop planting garlic cultivation was banned in the whole basin in 2018 and the beans rotated together with garlic decreased by 24 0 in the same year in contrast an abrupt increase in maize sown area of 15 6 was observed in 2018 followed by an increasing trend from 2009 to 2017 additionally the vegetable sown area in dali city presented a significant increasing trend by 2129 1 tons year 1 p 0 001 from 2011 to 2018 in particular n and p fertilizer application rates of leaf vegetables in dali are up to 1200 and 1500 kg hm2 sun et al 2016 also agricultural nonpoint source pollution mainly results from tn and tp runoff in garlic and maize lands across the northern area of erhai lake cheng et al 2010 accordingly apart from garlic cultivation other crops such as maize with high n fertilizer use broad bean with high p use and vegetable planting with high n and p fertilization should also be considered interestingly during 2016 2019 the bloom amplitude trough in 2018 was observed and was in coincidence with strict implemented policy for agricultural planting structure adjustment represented by the ban on garlic cultivation in the whole basin the rotation systems of which has been demonstrated to result in highest n loss and higher p loss than other rotations tang et al 2012a 2012b li et al 2018a 2018b 3 4 impact of topdressing activities on the phenological characteristics of cyanobacterial bloom 3 4 1 nutrient state of three inflowing tributaries and lake erhai there exists a decreasing trend in nutrients tn and tp of the three tributaries during jun 2016 and jun 2019 as shown in the upper panel of fig 10 a both the tn and tp levels of the miju river the largest inflow of lake exhibited a slight decrease trend a decreasing trend in tp level was both observed in luoshi and yongan river meanwhile a marked decreasing trend in the tn level of yongan river was observed while the luoshi river showed a significant increasing trend in tn level fig 10a lower and middle panel the distinct inter annual and seasonal variability in tn and tp levels were observed in lake erhai fig 10b the annual mean tp level exhibited an apparent decrease trend in 2016 2019 the 2003 2019 tp time series showed that the tp level in summer and autumn was about 1 57 times higher than other seasons fig 10b upper panel specifically for the period 2016 2018 tp level in autumn and winter decreased significantly in contrast in 2003 and 2006 two peaks of the tn level were observed simultaneously in summer and autumn while the tn level decreased progressively and remained at a relatively stable level of around 0 5 mg l in all seasons after 2010 although the tn level was elevated a bit in autumn during 2016 2019 fig 10b middle panel in general the combined results for the nutrient state of lake and bloom dynamics indicate that summer bloom was alleviated through reasonable control of the tn level in lake erhai meanwhile during 2016 2018 there was a decreasing trend in autumn and winter tp this decrease in the tp level in autumn and winter alleviated the bloom in 2018 based on the link between winter tn tp and the bloom amplitude the autumn tp level increased once again in 2019 and probably resulted in a bit larger bloom in the autumn of 2019 these results suggest that lake erhai is generally co limited by n and p in summer and autumn while limited by p in winter and spring as shown in the lower panel of fig 10b lake erhai generally exhibited n p co limitation in the summer and autumn while it showed p only limitation mostly in winter and spring season following the tn tp ratio criteria as proposed by qin et al 2020 for indicating potential lake nutrient limitation in particular the summer and autumn seasons are in the rainy season covering may to october in this period rice cropping was the primary agricultural activity in the lake erhai basin and the fertilization application in this hot period of cropping contributes to the plenty of n and p runoff losses from intensive agricultural watersheds due to the synchrony between extreme rainfall and fertilization events especially topdressing activities thus lake erhai appears to limited by the fertilizer application induced nutrient runoff during cropping in the summer and autumn seasons 3 4 2 relationship between topdressing and phenological metrics as shown in fig 11 a garlic rice and broad bean rice planting modes were major crop rotation systems in the northern watershed of erhai lake suffering from the maximum amount of runoff tn losses and tp losses at 17 82 kg hm2 and 3 26 kg hm2 respectively then garlic rice rotation produces most runoff tn losses and relatively high tp losses owing to the positive relationship between nutrient n loss in farmland with fertilizer application amount li et al 2018a 2018b the amount of chemical fertilizer application was the highest during the garlic rice rotation the effect of the topdressing application on the tn and tp levels in the surface and ditch water of farmland is revealed during the second primary topdressing period from july 10th to july 15 in 2009 fig 11b a substantial increase of 74 in tp and 35 in tn was observed in cropland s surface water on the just beginning date july 10th of topdressing fertilization about a week later than the ending date of this topdressing period the tn and tp levels in ditch water reached their peak at 5 83 mg l a four fold increase and 0 32 mg l a five fold increase on july 21th this was the time of the ditch nutrient peak when the rainfall reached 42 8 mm notably a one week window seven days after fertilizer application for each topdressing range is also optimal in this study consistent with cui et al 2020 and xue et al 2014 the results suggested that surface water in cropland overflows into the surrounding ditches acting as the major pathway of farmland surface runoff through surface runoff after a certain amount of rainfall rainfall reached 30 mm d thus nutrients increase in surface water of farmland and afterward in ditch water is primarily due to the amount of chemical fertilizer application in the topdressing practices moreover the timing of topdressing application turns out to be the critical period of nutrient runoff losses especially at the critical growth stages of rice crop the synchrony between topdressing fertilization and extreme rainfall events indicates the high probability of n and p runoff happened during the fertilization period providing sufficient nutrients for cyanobacterial bloom occurrence with the introduction of satellite estimated pc time series in 2009 the effect of the topdressing application on cyanobacterial bloom phenology is revealed in fig 11c the bit of this typical autumn bloom was july 29 th about eight days later following the ditch nutrient peak timing this nutrient peak timing in ditch water was just the end of the one week window before which the nearest topdressing event is finished indicating the risk period of runoff tn and tp losses the bpt occurred on september 10th nine days later than the end of the third topdressing range in particular during the three topdressing periods from the earliest may 25th to august 20th the days with rainfall more than 30 mm d lasted for a week the maximum rainfall value was 87 6 mm d occurring on august 13th as such given the coincidence of such massive rainfall events especially shortly after the topdressing activities any remaining excess nutrients in surface water of farmland after the topdressing application entered into ditches from the ridge of field and produced runoff then feed into nearby river channels miju river or luoshi river and finally directly flooded into the northern lake providing sufficient nutrients for cyanobacteria growth resulting in a rapid increase in the pc concentrations surrounding the corresponding inlet further we calculated the time lag for each bit with ditch nutrient peak timing induced from the nearest topdressing event in the whole study period and the distribution of time lag was presented in fig 12 with an average of 23 18 days the bits for summer bloom occurring in 2003 and 2006 are close to the first primary topdressing range indicating that the topdressing event from may 25th to june 10 provided a nutrient basis for summer bloom by contrast the time lags for winter blooms occurrence in 2016 and 2017 were relatively larger with the value 38 and 74 respectively in particular most bits of autumn bloom were observed occurring close to the second topdressing period additionally the time lag in the whole period was significantly positively correlated with autumn water temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 implications for environment protection in lake erhai our research shows a link between fertilizer topdressing application and cyanobacterial blooms for example a sharp drop in fertilizer application was highly associated with alleviated bloom in 2018 as such mitigation strategies for addressing the ongoing challenge could be drawn from this link as other researchers have indicated source control strategy aiming to reduce excess fertilizer n and p application is preferred for agricultural runoff pollution control zou et al 2019 xia et al 2020 accordingly we concur that the first and foremost strategy to mitigate bloom occurrences in lake erhai should focus on reducing the amount and the frequency of fertilizer topdressing it can be inferred from the results of this study that a reduction in nutrient runoff could be realized by several approaches such as reducing the application rate of applied fertilizer on a specific area of cropland or switching land allocation from a fertilizer intensive crop to a fertilizer saving crop indeed switching land allocation is an effective method to optimize a reasonable planting structure and avoid high fertilizer input for example a shift from cultivating staple food crops requiring high fertilizer to preferentially cultivating crops such as flowers rapes medicinal materials and other crops with higher profits for producers and smaller amounts of fertilizer additions is necessary from the perspective of external pollution control banning garlic planting in the whole watershed in 2018 could reduce the loss of large amount n although there was an unexpected increase in the tn level of lake erhai occurring in 2018 the tn level observed in the lake has remained at a constant low level owing to the consistent control strategy which results in little influence on the occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom much efforts have been made to reduce high n export and it turns out that high n export needs to be prohibited however the tp level has not been controlled more importantly the tp level has been demonstrated to be the primary driver for cyanobacterial bloom in lake erhai in recent years therefore our results suggest the need to reduce conventional p fertilizer application in crop production regions and high p loss crops in rotation crop systems i e broad bean wheat should be considered strictly bans stimulate adjustment of planting structure which in turn affects fertilizer use in particular typical fertilizer intensive crops including maize and leaf vegetables are increasingly cultivated over wider areas of land in the study area under such a cultivation trend the p management strategy should be strengthened the consistent suggestion could also be found in fan et al 2020 4 2 uncertainty and limitations the mutation feature of bloom in a shorter period observed by satellite would bring uncertainty in pc time series analysis procedures such as 8 day pc composition and the savizky golay approach although meris olci provides an ideally revisit time of three days at the equator in cloud free conditions the actual temporal resolution of available image series in this research is limited with an average of 4 7 4 8 days owing to contaminations such as high cloud cover in addition a uniform number of images per year are required for time series analysis for this reason the eight days was selected as the temporal resolution and 8 day composite series were subsequently generated when more than one observation per 8 day bin was available in this study area although composite median averaging would bring information loss and could not capture short term blooms moreover it would take about seven days for the cyanobacterial biomass to double and dominated the phytoplankton groups with a slow growing rate of 0 1d 1 wynne et al 2010 therefore 8 day pc composition is sufficient to capture the cyanobacterial bloom phenology seasonal trend in the growing stages of surface cyanobacteria the savizky golay smoothing procedure would filter out the high frequency noise induced by the occurrence of short term bloom throughout the annual cycle for cyanobacteria growth resulting in a negative impact on the gaussian fitting process for phenology metrics extracting however our results suggest that though the bloom amplitude varied in the seasonal and inter annual scale distinct seasonal blooms with relatively high signal noise ratio have been frequently observed in this eutrophic lake since 2003 thus the smoothing procedure filtering the short term bloom would have little impact on cyanobacterial blooms with a relatively high signal noise ratio moreover the importance of observational noise would be weaker in areas with high bloom amplitude but more significant in regions with low seasonal bloom amplitude versus noise level ferreira et al 2014 therefore the uncertainty brought by savizky golay approach would not have much impact on the results 5 conclusions in this study cyanobacterial bloom phenology and its responses to environmental forces were explored in lake erhai we explored the spatio temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extent for surface cyanobacterial bloom based on 13 year phycocyanin pigment series retrieved from satellite using gaussian fitting and linear unmixing models during period 2003 2011 and 2016 2019 the result indicates that high intensity and early onset bloom were identified with a large coverage extent in the north lake showing three dominant growth patterns such as early peak late peak and winter max mode this exploration of bloom phenology responses to environmental forces shows that the tn and tp were found to the most impacts on bloom amplitude moreover elevated early summer tn and weakened early autumn wind speeds contributed to early onset bloom in 2003 2011 while reduced late summer wind speed led to earlier bit in 2016 2019 fluctuating tp level fueled the blooms over the period 2016 2019 occurring primarily in autumn and winter as the tn level was stable and under effective control evidence for the impact of fertilizer topdressing application on cyanobacterial bloom phenology in the northern watersheds was observed indicating that given the coincidence of such massive rainfall events especially shortly after the topdressing activities any remaining excess nutrients in surface water of farmland after the topdressing application entered into ditches from the ridge of field and produced runoff then feed into nearby river channels and finally provide sufficient nutrient for cyanobacteria growth in the receiving lake moreover in coincidence with high rainfall intensity the bits lagged by approximately an average of 23 days behind a one week window for the topdressing practice the results of this research have implications for the protection of lake erhai as part of agricultural planting structure adjustment implements strict bans on garlic cultivation in the whole basin indeed positively alleviated cyanobacterial bloom by reducing the topdressing fertilization moreover adjustment of planting structure turns out to be an effective measure for reducing fertilizer topdressings since tn pollution has been under control crops such as leaf vegetables and wheat with high tp loss should be reduced or eliminated our research verified the link between topdressing and cyanobacterial bloom in such a typical early eutrophication plateau lake this would help guide for agricultural transformation from traditional planting towards more economically and environmentally friendly practices similar work for reducing topdressing activities during sensitive periods for cyanobacterial bloom and optimizing planting structure

4852,agricultural practices induced pollution runoff has been widely acknowledged to be a significant source of nutrients fueling cyanobacterial bloom the impact of topdressing activities on cyanobacterial bloom phenology key parameters for depicting bloom process however has not been verified taking lake erhai a typical eutrophic plateau lake as an example this study explored the spatio temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extent for surface cyanobacterial bloom based on phycocyanin pigment series retrieved from satellite and investigated the bloom responses to environmental forces the results showed that higher intensity and earlier onset bloom with a larger coverage extent mainly occurred in the northern region we identified three distinct cyanobacterial bloom growth patterns with large inter annual variability in their bloom initiation timing bit the earlier bit is highly linked to elevated total nitrogen level and decreased wind speed the bloom amplitude is mainly related to summer tn in 2003 2011 while associated with winter tn tp ratio tn total nitrogen tp total phosphorus during 2016 2019 additionally we found direct evidence linking agricultural topdressing and the bit of a typical autumn bloom after one week for the topdressing practice the bits lagged by approximately average 23 days coinciding with high rainfall intensity our research demonstrates the topdressing activity should be reduced through agricultural planting adjustments high tn and tp loss crops should be prohibited planting adjustments should decrease high tp loss crop plantings in response to regional environmental forces keywords cyanobacterial bloom phycocyanin pigment phenology metrics agricultural topdressing practices erhai lake 1 introduction overuse of chemical fertilizers e g nitrogen and phosphorus in intensive production related to the global expansion of industrialized agriculture and the intensification of conventional agricultural practices has resulted in increased runoff and subsequently a high level of water pollution into aquatic ecosystems beman et al 2005 huisman et al 2018 this induces eutrophication and frequently occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom in water bodies guan et al 2020 o neil et al 2012 further posing severe environmental and ecological problems for inland waters understanding the critical temporal points during the cyanobacteria growth season could uncover the workings of the bloom process not merely the temporally associated bloom frequencies mishra et al 2019 the initiation date peak timing and amplitude of cyanobacterial blooms are used to define the phenology of cyanobacterial bloom palmer et al 2015 long term monitoring of cyanobacterial bloom phenology will significantly improve our understanding of the driving mechanism behind these cyanobacterial blooms huisman et al 2018 huang et al 2020 moreover this knowledge could suggest effective means for controlling blooms related to human impacts on the environment paerl and barnard 2020 however lack of long term on site measurements of cyanobacteria in traditional methods presents difficulties in quantifying the cyanobacterial bloom phenology satellite remote sensing providing favorable spatial and temporal coverage has exhibited as an extractive tool for investigating long term cyanobacterial bloom phenology hu et al 2010 previous researches have applied remote sensing technology to quantify cyanobacterial bloom phenology based on an intermediary such as floating algal index fai and chlorophyll a chla pigment in particular chla is a universal index for all phytoplankton while the fai is generally to characterize the intense cyanobacterial blooms or surface floating algae scums hu et al 2010 however little research to date has utilized cyanobacterial phycocyanin pigment pc concentration as an intermediary for the quantification of cyanobacterial bloom phenology pc is generally considered a diagnostic pigment for capturing cyanobacterial bloom qi et al 2014 and a biological indicator for eutrophication than physiochemical indicators nitrogen n or phosphorus p which merely act as indirect indicators remotely sensed pc time series have great potential for investigating the temporal pattern of cyanobacteria and further qualification of cyanobacteria phenology palmer et al 2015 shi et al 2019a 2019b as a proxy for cyanobacteria presence satellite estimated pc concentration can be retrieved robustly using the pc index pci algorithm which is immune to disturbances and is not sensitive to perturbations from submerged macrophytes and other floating mats in surface water qi et al 2014 therefore the pci algorithm provides a solid foundation for establishing long term records of pc products and cyanobacterial bloom phenology moreover the bloom phenology is influenced by several potential driving forces gittings et al 2018 yang et al 2016 sasaoka et al 2011 such as nutrient enrichment shi et al 2019a 2019b duan et al 2014 and meteorology variability zhang et al 2012 marchese et al 2017 among these influential factors the lake nutrient level plays a crucial role in prompting cyanobacterial growth and dominating phytoplankton group and relatively responsive to human intervention shi et al 2017 huo et al 2019 topdressing fertilization activity is the primary human intervention especially in agricultural dominated areas inappropriate topdressing fertilization schemes i e quantity and timing lead to excess nutrient exports via surface runoff from surrounding watersheds tang et al 2012a 2012b li et al 2020 agricultural planting in erhai lake basin is the main reason for the water pollution of erhai lake hu et al 2018 lake erhai faced with a big challenge stems from runoff from the fertilizers and pesticides applied to the surrounding farmland and the pollution from the farmland account for at least 60 of the pollutants entering the lake guo et al 2001 even though most studies have reached a consensus that agricultural runoff could fuel phytoplankton bloom especially in intensive farm areas the impact of topdressing on the phytoplankton bloom phenology was not verified by observations this study fills this gap by linking the exogenous agriculture pollution induced by topdressing and cyanobacterial bloom phenology thereby providing a scientific reference for agricultural planting structure adjustment in this study satellite estimated pc dataset was used to obtain the spatio temporal distribution of cyanobacterial bloom features using the gaussian fitting model and linear unmixing model during 2003 2011 and 2016 2019 then the bloom response to environmental factors is analyzed to uncover the driving forces of bloom dynamics finally the impact of topdressing on bloom phenology was verified 2 material and method 2 1 study area erhai lake 25 57 25 36 n 100 05 100 17 e fig 1 was selected as our study area as it is a typical semi deep plateau freshwater lake and the main water resource for residents of dali city in yunnan province of southwestern china this lake is considered to be in the representative preliminary eutrophic stage wang et al 2015 shang et al 2012 the lake s total area is approximately 251 km2 erhai lake has an average annual temperature of 15 1 c and exhibits significant seasonal precipitation in 2003 2019 about 80 rainfall was in the wet season from may to october also the rice growing season paddy rice or maize is the predominant crop in summer with the growth stages from may to september and cultivated commonly in rotation with winter crops primarily include garlic broad beans oilseed rape and wheat with the growing season from october to april li et al 2018a 2018b there are three prominent rivers flowing into the lake contributing to 60 of the total water inflow in the north of erhai lake basin these include the miju the luoshi and the yongan rivers cao et al 2018 which carry large scale agricultural pollutants liu et al 2019 2 2 data source and pre processing this study s primary datasets included satellite estimated pc time series field measurements involving phytoplankton species composition data and auto monitoring measurements from water quality gauges other data sets such as field sampling measurements extracted from tang et al 2012a tang et al 2012b and liu et al 2011 and data collected from statistical yearbooks dataset meteorological gauge and auxiliary monthly water environment data were also employed in this study these data required preprocessing before they could be fed into the following analysis satellite estimated pc concentrations over periods of 2003 2011 and 2016 2019 were retrieved and validated based on the pci algorithm according to qi et al 2014 using rayleigh corrected reflectance rrc data the rrc datasets were obtained by using the rayleigh correction module embedded in sentinel application platform image processor snap version 7 1 to remove molecular rayleigh scattering effects evident in the images collected by the medium resolution instrument sensor meris onboard the envisat satellite 2003 2011 and ocean land color instrument olci on the sentinel 3 satellite 2016 2019 then the rrc dataset was used to calculate the pc index pci the pci is as follows 1 pci r rc 620 r rc 620 2 r rc 620 r rc 560 620 560 665 560 r rc 665 r rc 560 the pci is constructed here as the spectral differences between local rrc trough at 620 nm diagnosed distinctive absorption peak and baseline formed between rrc 560 and rrc 665 which has been demonstrated a reliable index for estimating pc pigment concentrations or identifying cyanobacterial bloom qi et al 2014 the estimated pc were obtained through model development and validation based on the pci method proposed by qi et al 2014 field measurements are obtained covering different periods water samples surface water and ditch water measurements from four typical crop rotation systems in 2009 along the basins of miju river and luoshi river which were arranged in lines from the north bank of erhai lake northwards covering all seven towns in situ data of phytoplankton species composition were obtained from june to november covering cyanobacteria growing season in 2016 the daily total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp from the main inflow rivers during 2016 2018 were obtained from auto monitoring water quality gauges datasets were collected from statistical records compiled by government agencies yearly agricultural industry related data in dali city during 1995 2018 were derived from the statistical yearbooks of yunnan province daily meteorological datasets such as rainfall rainf mm sunshine duration sundur h wind speed wspd m s and air pressure airprs hpa were sourced from the national meteorological administration of china http data cma cn and used to calculate the corresponding monthly climatological data additionally rainfall intensity ri mm is here defined as monthly maximum consecutive 5 day rainfall auxiliary monthly datasets including water temperature wtemp c nutrient tn and tp mg l were obtained from the bureau of erhai protection and administration of dali satellite estimated pc time series were used for the retrieval of phenology metrics and bloom coverage all the monthly environmental forcing data were used to calculate the corresponding seasonal mean sub seasonal early middle late mean data the seasonal and sub seasonal mean data such as tn tp wtemp rainf ri sundur wspd and airprs were all included in the multi linear regression to account for their impacts on cyanobacterial bloom phenology 2 3 retrieval of phenology metrics and bloom coverage the phenology metrics and coverage were main features for characterizing cyanobacterial blooms fig 2 presents a flowchart to show how the phenology features and coverage extent of cyanobacterial bloom were extracted based on the estimated in record phycocyanin pigment pc time series derived from all segments of the entire lake these include the bloom initiation timing bit bloom peaking time bpt bloom amplitude ba bloom duration bd and bloom coverage the primary dataset used for phenology metrics determination is the satellite estimated pc concentrations the pc concentration series were obtained through model development and validation based on the pci algorithm defined as equation 1 and 2 using rrc products such as rrc 620 rrc 560 and rrc 665 which are obtained by a preprocessing procedure followed by the approach described in qi et al 2014 these pc time series were then used for the preprocessing procedure the binning and filtering procedure reduces the effect of outliers at an appropriate temporal resolution for describing the bloom phenology an 8 day composite pc time series was created by binning and median averaging in a preprocessing step for phenological metrics extraction in view of the limited amount of valid satellite data then the resulting 8 day binned data are filtered using the savizky golay approach palmer et al 2015 the cyanobacterial bloom with higher amplitude and longer duration in the annual cycle is considered as the criteria for determining the primary bloom a gaussian fitting procedure for extracting primary bloom phenological metrics was performed given the condition that secondary bloom may occur in addition to primary bloom in an annual period a two peak gaussian function eq 3 for describing two peak characteristics of the annual bloom was fitted to the filtered composite pc dataset and subsequently the baseline of phenological metrics for the primary bloom was extracted to increase the goodness of the phenological fitting procedure the baseline of metrics from the identified primary bloom was then taken as initiation parameters for further adjusted gaussian fitting eq 4 based on the algorithm proposed by park et al 2019 the best fitted parameters were finally obtained using the least squares method through the iterated procedure 3 c x c 0 i 1 2 h i exp x t pi 2 2 σ i 2 4 c x c 0 h exp x t p 2 2 σ 2 d 1 exp x t p 2 σ in these two equations c 0 is the background pc concentration baseline pc level determined by the fitted function h is the ba which is the highest value of pc during the bloom event t p is the bpt date at which the pc reaches its maximum value σ is the bloom width x is the time step and d represents the residual pc concentration the bit was determined from the fitted pc time series using two groups of methods a threshold method and inflection point detection method were applied wang et al 2019 for a dynamic threshold method bitdt or t i eq 5 was identified as the date when the fitted function reaches a specific percentage 50 of the annual maximum amplitude similar to the relative threshold method of zhai et al 2011 another approach for inflection point detection in the smoothed annual pc time series curve was also adopted to determine the bit from the annual pc series for the curvature method the bitip is defined as when the rate of change in pc curvature reached the local maximum given that rapid and excessive cyanobacterial growth is commonly referred to as a bloom the average of the above two bits was considered as the robust bit when the difference is below 20 days 5 t i t p 1 17 σ the bd is defined as the period from initiation to when the pc concentration change decreases to 50 of the amplitude equivalent to twice the difference between bit and bpt moreover the bloom intensity map was obtained by calculating the ratio of the ba and its corresponding bd in a pixel by pixel procedure apart from the phenological feature extraction approach partial pixel cyanobacteria coverage was determined based on a long term estimated pc dataset using a linear unmixing algorithm the method proposed by hu et al 2010 was employed given the linear design of pci facilitates pixel unmixing the preprocessing step for the unmixing algorithm determines the threshold for non algal and full algal pixels however little research has taken a pc range for classifying the bloom level here bloom thresholds were determined according to an empirical logarithm and piece wise linear relationship between satellite estimated pc and in situ cyanobacteria biomass and cell density proportion among available matchups derived from water samples n 28 specifically as shown in fig s1 pc s ability to indicate cyanobacteria abundance proportion is reduced as the proportion of cyanobacteria abundance becomes saturated with pcs additionally cyanobacteria comprising more than 80 of phytoplankton cell density were considered dominant cyanobacteria orr et al 2010 thus when cyanobacteria constitute more than 80 of the phytoplankton cell density above 41ug l by pc level this pc level is considered a threshold for sparse bloom meanwhile the dense bloom threshold by pc level is defined as 334ug l with 100 cyanobacterial biomass proportion therefore we took the pc value of pixel p c pixel below 41ug l and above 334ug l as the threshold of the nonalgal pixel p c th sparse and full algal pixel p c th dense respectively in between p c th sparse and p c th dense p c pixel is normalized to obtain the ratio of partial coverage for the corresponding mixed pixel α pixel as follow 6 α pixel p c pixel p c th sparse p c th dense p c th sparse as such the corresponding coverage can be obtained by a pixel s coverage 0 09 km2 multiplied by α pixel when the pixel pc value is more than p c densebloom the cyanobacteria coverage is considered as 0 09 km2 the whole coverage in each image is obtained by summing all the coverage for each available pixel 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extension lake erhai shows distinct spatial and temporal heterogeneity for the bloom phenology metrics i e bit and ba especially in the northern lake as shown in fig 3 the average bit in the northern region was nine days earlier than the bit for the entire lake the bit in the entire lake ranged from 179 to 327 according to the day of the year doy with annual average bit of 246 the average bit in the entire lake was nearly the same as the average bit in the central or southern lake the highest ba was observed in the north region followed by the central and south areas as listed in table1 the top three high ba value ranked in order of decreasing priority occurring in 2003 2006 and 2008 with the mean value of 1419 76 μgl 1 while the top three low value ranked in the same order occurring in 2018 2005 and 2010 with the average value of 16 86 μgl 1 no temporal trend was observed during 2003 2011 in the annual mean ba while in 2016 2019 the annual average ba showed a weak declining trend specifically the ba decreased apparently from 2016 139 2ug l to 2018 21 8ug l and rebounded 2 5 times higher in 2019 than that in 2018 the summertime ba over the period 2016 2019 remained low as compared to the other seasons fig 3 apart from analyzing the magnitude of the ba in the inter annual blooms all the annual cyanobacteria growth cycles can be grouped into three dominant seasonal cycles such as early peak late peak and winter max by normalizing 52 annual pc time series derived from different regions fig 4 as shown in fig 4a the seasonal cycle characterized by an early season peak with the pc value increasing from may and decreasing from its peak in june or july to a minimum in october was labeled early peak average bit reaching doy 173 specifically the blooms occurring in 2003 and 2006 belong to the early peak group with the highest average ba up to 1162 6ug l and shortest bd reaching 62 days the late peak seasonal cycle average bit reaching doy 173 is characterized by a summer pc minimum then a longer late summer or early autumn elevated period from july through october fig 4b as displayed in fig 4c the seasonal cycle characterized by a weak summer pc maximum for a short period and distinct elevated levels in late autumn then to its peak in early winter was denoted as winter max with bit reaching doy 319 for example the blooms occurring in 2016 and 2017 were grouped to the winter max mode with higher ba and shorter bd than the late peak mode these results suggest that about 70 percent of all annual pc fitting time series were labeled as the lake peak mode or typical autumn bloom pattern while the early peak and winter max mode accounted for comparably about 15 of the total thus the lake peak mode appears the primary cyanobacteria growth periods whereas other modes seem to result from inter annual environmental changes the spatial heterogeneity of bloom coverage in regions is similar to the ba s spatial heterogeneity with the highest bloom coverage observed in the north region followed by central and south areas fig 5 as shown in table1 during 2003 2011 the average bloom coverage area was 207 4 km2 for ba 420 μgl 1 specifically large summer blooms occurred in july 2003 and august 2006 with the maximum coverage extent of 233 7 and 181 0 km2 respectively in contrast in 2016 2019 a widespread reduction in the spatial extent was particularly apparent with a trough occurring in 2018 the maximum area of 14 4 km2 in the growing season and bloom coverage increased slightly in 2019 with a maximum of 56 4 km2 in particular winter bloom coverage reached about 163 9 and 125 9 km2 occurring in december 2016 and 2017 table1 meanwhile the typical autumn bloom coverage has an average value of 49 7 38 8 km2 detailed spatial and temporal differences of the bit and bloom intensity were shown in fig 6 in 2003 and 2006 the bloom occurrence was earliest with the average doy 174 9 and showed consistent spatial variation fig 6a along with the most extensive bloom coverage of 207 4 km2 in the entire lake in contrast the entire lake experienced a distinct delayed bit in 2016 and 2017 except for the northern area fig 6b shows that the strongest bloom intensity was observed in the northern and central regions of lake erhai in 2003 35 7 μgl 1day 1 and 2006 3 0 μgl 1day 1 overall these blooms showed earlier onset and stronger intensity in the northern lake than other parts of the lake in addition the observed bloom intensity pattern was found to be consistent with the spatial distribution of nutrient sources obtained by li et al 2018a li et al 2018b and li et al 2020 thus the northern lake turns out to be an ideal location for cyanobacterial blooms owing to the effect of the surrounding agricultural activities 3 2 cyanobacterial bloom phenology linked with meteorological factors and lake water quality a strengthened summer tn and weakened autumn wspd significantly lead to an earlier onset of the blooms in the period 2003 2011 as shown in fig 7 a the years 2003 2006 marked by the earlier bit in 2003 2011 the regression results for the bit showed that early summer tn and early autumn wspd were the primary contributors explaining 87 of the inter annual variation in bit p 0 01 table 2 fig 7b it was clear that the bit was delayed in the period 2003 2011 when summer tn decreased and autumn wspd increased simultaneously according to this relationship the impact of the tn and wspd on the bit was quantitatively estimated considering their contribution and variability as presented in fig 7c the bit was delayed by about 91 days in 2007 as compared to the bit in 2006 while the bloom occurred around 43 days later in 2004 than in 2003 the decrease of tn in 2006 2007 is similar to that in 2003 2004 which is 0 23 and 0 24 mg l respectively in contrast the increase of wspd 0 2 m s in 2006 2007 was four times that in 2003 2004 0 05 m s the decrease in the combined effect of the tn and wspd during 2006 2007 was just half than that during 2003 2004 these results show that although the wind speed increased greatly and tn decreased little between the two periods the joint interpretation of tn and wspd decreased not that much because tn alone could account for 60 of the variability of bits in contrast low late summer wspd significantly leads to earlier cyanobacterial bloom onset for period 2016 2019 based on the regression result as shown in fig 7d and fig 7e an advance trend of the bloom was noticeable with reduced wspd 30 days year 1 p 0 05 the linear regression for the bit shows that late summer wspd explained up to 93 5 of the observed total variation in the bit p 0 05 table 2 fig 7f indeed low wind speed plays a prerequisite role in forming cyanobacteria surface cyanobacteria aggregation especially when the wind speed is 3 4 m s zhang et al 2012 the effect of wind speed on bloom phenology is also revealed by zhang et al 2012 and shi et al 2019a shi et al 2019b that low wind speed could advance cyanobacterial bloom in lake taihu the inter annual bit variances were grouped according to the bloom type to explore their seasonal responses to potential environmental factors as presented in fig 8 the wtemp and sundur exhibit a distinct correlation with the bit variance this indicates that the bit was delayed significantly with the decrease in late summer sunshine hours r 0 76 p 0 05 and with the warmer water temperature in early autumn r 0 71 fig 8 in particular the negative relation between the bit and sunshine hours was also found by zhang et al 2012 indicating that elevated light duration promotes cyanobacteria dominance also the results suggest that blooms occurring in summer generally witnessed lower early autumn wtemp while blooms occurring in winter were subject to a higher early autumn wtemp in the lake erhai area especially for bloom occurrence in winter cyanobacterial bloom onset in winter is related to the increase in water temperature trombetta et al 2019 the regression result for the bloom amplitude ba and environmental factors suggests that the tn appears to be the primary nutrient fueling the bloom in 2003 2011 while tn tp ratio became the main factor prompting the bloom in 2016 2019 for instance as for the ba in 2003 2011 the summer tn and rainfall intensity ri explained 61 9 and 24 7 of the ba variation p 0 01 table 2 indicating that the enhanced amplitude is significantly correlated with both increased summer tn and ri moreover cyanobacterial species without n fixing ability i e microcystis were found to generally dominate in summer and autumn and form the bloom yu et al 2014 in addition the increase in tn level is likely to induce cyanobacterial bloom therefore the relationship between tn and the ba in 2003 2011 has more to do with the rising tn driving increased cyanobacterial bloom rather than the n fixing cyanobacteria i e anabaena producing a large amount of tn by fixing nitrogen in the atmosphere in contrast winter tn tp ratio in 2016 2019 accounted for 91 3 of the ba variations and is negative with bloom amplitude suggesting bloom amplitude tended to increase when tn tp decreases 3 3 nutrient n and p effects of agricultural activities in erhai lake basin crops vary in their n and p fertilizer rate owing to their unique fertilizer requirements for instance as shown in fig 9 a crop garlic exhibits the highest n application rate followed by maize while broad bean shows the highest p application rate meanwhile in the northern lake basin the three crops displayed higher sown areas than other crops with an average of 4004 hm2 following rice which covered the largest extent thus crops such as garlic broad bean and maize contributed to a higher risk of n and p loss inter annual variability of agricultural activities is shown in fig 9b by depicting fertilizer amount and sown area for crop planting as for the long term fertilizer n and p application in dali city a distinct reduction occurred in 2018 following a slowly decreasing trend from 2013 to 2017 resulting from the strict control of external nutrient loadings with regards to the sown area for crop planting garlic cultivation was banned in the whole basin in 2018 and the beans rotated together with garlic decreased by 24 0 in the same year in contrast an abrupt increase in maize sown area of 15 6 was observed in 2018 followed by an increasing trend from 2009 to 2017 additionally the vegetable sown area in dali city presented a significant increasing trend by 2129 1 tons year 1 p 0 001 from 2011 to 2018 in particular n and p fertilizer application rates of leaf vegetables in dali are up to 1200 and 1500 kg hm2 sun et al 2016 also agricultural nonpoint source pollution mainly results from tn and tp runoff in garlic and maize lands across the northern area of erhai lake cheng et al 2010 accordingly apart from garlic cultivation other crops such as maize with high n fertilizer use broad bean with high p use and vegetable planting with high n and p fertilization should also be considered interestingly during 2016 2019 the bloom amplitude trough in 2018 was observed and was in coincidence with strict implemented policy for agricultural planting structure adjustment represented by the ban on garlic cultivation in the whole basin the rotation systems of which has been demonstrated to result in highest n loss and higher p loss than other rotations tang et al 2012a 2012b li et al 2018a 2018b 3 4 impact of topdressing activities on the phenological characteristics of cyanobacterial bloom 3 4 1 nutrient state of three inflowing tributaries and lake erhai there exists a decreasing trend in nutrients tn and tp of the three tributaries during jun 2016 and jun 2019 as shown in the upper panel of fig 10 a both the tn and tp levels of the miju river the largest inflow of lake exhibited a slight decrease trend a decreasing trend in tp level was both observed in luoshi and yongan river meanwhile a marked decreasing trend in the tn level of yongan river was observed while the luoshi river showed a significant increasing trend in tn level fig 10a lower and middle panel the distinct inter annual and seasonal variability in tn and tp levels were observed in lake erhai fig 10b the annual mean tp level exhibited an apparent decrease trend in 2016 2019 the 2003 2019 tp time series showed that the tp level in summer and autumn was about 1 57 times higher than other seasons fig 10b upper panel specifically for the period 2016 2018 tp level in autumn and winter decreased significantly in contrast in 2003 and 2006 two peaks of the tn level were observed simultaneously in summer and autumn while the tn level decreased progressively and remained at a relatively stable level of around 0 5 mg l in all seasons after 2010 although the tn level was elevated a bit in autumn during 2016 2019 fig 10b middle panel in general the combined results for the nutrient state of lake and bloom dynamics indicate that summer bloom was alleviated through reasonable control of the tn level in lake erhai meanwhile during 2016 2018 there was a decreasing trend in autumn and winter tp this decrease in the tp level in autumn and winter alleviated the bloom in 2018 based on the link between winter tn tp and the bloom amplitude the autumn tp level increased once again in 2019 and probably resulted in a bit larger bloom in the autumn of 2019 these results suggest that lake erhai is generally co limited by n and p in summer and autumn while limited by p in winter and spring as shown in the lower panel of fig 10b lake erhai generally exhibited n p co limitation in the summer and autumn while it showed p only limitation mostly in winter and spring season following the tn tp ratio criteria as proposed by qin et al 2020 for indicating potential lake nutrient limitation in particular the summer and autumn seasons are in the rainy season covering may to october in this period rice cropping was the primary agricultural activity in the lake erhai basin and the fertilization application in this hot period of cropping contributes to the plenty of n and p runoff losses from intensive agricultural watersheds due to the synchrony between extreme rainfall and fertilization events especially topdressing activities thus lake erhai appears to limited by the fertilizer application induced nutrient runoff during cropping in the summer and autumn seasons 3 4 2 relationship between topdressing and phenological metrics as shown in fig 11 a garlic rice and broad bean rice planting modes were major crop rotation systems in the northern watershed of erhai lake suffering from the maximum amount of runoff tn losses and tp losses at 17 82 kg hm2 and 3 26 kg hm2 respectively then garlic rice rotation produces most runoff tn losses and relatively high tp losses owing to the positive relationship between nutrient n loss in farmland with fertilizer application amount li et al 2018a 2018b the amount of chemical fertilizer application was the highest during the garlic rice rotation the effect of the topdressing application on the tn and tp levels in the surface and ditch water of farmland is revealed during the second primary topdressing period from july 10th to july 15 in 2009 fig 11b a substantial increase of 74 in tp and 35 in tn was observed in cropland s surface water on the just beginning date july 10th of topdressing fertilization about a week later than the ending date of this topdressing period the tn and tp levels in ditch water reached their peak at 5 83 mg l a four fold increase and 0 32 mg l a five fold increase on july 21th this was the time of the ditch nutrient peak when the rainfall reached 42 8 mm notably a one week window seven days after fertilizer application for each topdressing range is also optimal in this study consistent with cui et al 2020 and xue et al 2014 the results suggested that surface water in cropland overflows into the surrounding ditches acting as the major pathway of farmland surface runoff through surface runoff after a certain amount of rainfall rainfall reached 30 mm d thus nutrients increase in surface water of farmland and afterward in ditch water is primarily due to the amount of chemical fertilizer application in the topdressing practices moreover the timing of topdressing application turns out to be the critical period of nutrient runoff losses especially at the critical growth stages of rice crop the synchrony between topdressing fertilization and extreme rainfall events indicates the high probability of n and p runoff happened during the fertilization period providing sufficient nutrients for cyanobacterial bloom occurrence with the introduction of satellite estimated pc time series in 2009 the effect of the topdressing application on cyanobacterial bloom phenology is revealed in fig 11c the bit of this typical autumn bloom was july 29 th about eight days later following the ditch nutrient peak timing this nutrient peak timing in ditch water was just the end of the one week window before which the nearest topdressing event is finished indicating the risk period of runoff tn and tp losses the bpt occurred on september 10th nine days later than the end of the third topdressing range in particular during the three topdressing periods from the earliest may 25th to august 20th the days with rainfall more than 30 mm d lasted for a week the maximum rainfall value was 87 6 mm d occurring on august 13th as such given the coincidence of such massive rainfall events especially shortly after the topdressing activities any remaining excess nutrients in surface water of farmland after the topdressing application entered into ditches from the ridge of field and produced runoff then feed into nearby river channels miju river or luoshi river and finally directly flooded into the northern lake providing sufficient nutrients for cyanobacteria growth resulting in a rapid increase in the pc concentrations surrounding the corresponding inlet further we calculated the time lag for each bit with ditch nutrient peak timing induced from the nearest topdressing event in the whole study period and the distribution of time lag was presented in fig 12 with an average of 23 18 days the bits for summer bloom occurring in 2003 and 2006 are close to the first primary topdressing range indicating that the topdressing event from may 25th to june 10 provided a nutrient basis for summer bloom by contrast the time lags for winter blooms occurrence in 2016 and 2017 were relatively larger with the value 38 and 74 respectively in particular most bits of autumn bloom were observed occurring close to the second topdressing period additionally the time lag in the whole period was significantly positively correlated with autumn water temperature r 0 6 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 implications for environment protection in lake erhai our research shows a link between fertilizer topdressing application and cyanobacterial blooms for example a sharp drop in fertilizer application was highly associated with alleviated bloom in 2018 as such mitigation strategies for addressing the ongoing challenge could be drawn from this link as other researchers have indicated source control strategy aiming to reduce excess fertilizer n and p application is preferred for agricultural runoff pollution control zou et al 2019 xia et al 2020 accordingly we concur that the first and foremost strategy to mitigate bloom occurrences in lake erhai should focus on reducing the amount and the frequency of fertilizer topdressing it can be inferred from the results of this study that a reduction in nutrient runoff could be realized by several approaches such as reducing the application rate of applied fertilizer on a specific area of cropland or switching land allocation from a fertilizer intensive crop to a fertilizer saving crop indeed switching land allocation is an effective method to optimize a reasonable planting structure and avoid high fertilizer input for example a shift from cultivating staple food crops requiring high fertilizer to preferentially cultivating crops such as flowers rapes medicinal materials and other crops with higher profits for producers and smaller amounts of fertilizer additions is necessary from the perspective of external pollution control banning garlic planting in the whole watershed in 2018 could reduce the loss of large amount n although there was an unexpected increase in the tn level of lake erhai occurring in 2018 the tn level observed in the lake has remained at a constant low level owing to the consistent control strategy which results in little influence on the occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom much efforts have been made to reduce high n export and it turns out that high n export needs to be prohibited however the tp level has not been controlled more importantly the tp level has been demonstrated to be the primary driver for cyanobacterial bloom in lake erhai in recent years therefore our results suggest the need to reduce conventional p fertilizer application in crop production regions and high p loss crops in rotation crop systems i e broad bean wheat should be considered strictly bans stimulate adjustment of planting structure which in turn affects fertilizer use in particular typical fertilizer intensive crops including maize and leaf vegetables are increasingly cultivated over wider areas of land in the study area under such a cultivation trend the p management strategy should be strengthened the consistent suggestion could also be found in fan et al 2020 4 2 uncertainty and limitations the mutation feature of bloom in a shorter period observed by satellite would bring uncertainty in pc time series analysis procedures such as 8 day pc composition and the savizky golay approach although meris olci provides an ideally revisit time of three days at the equator in cloud free conditions the actual temporal resolution of available image series in this research is limited with an average of 4 7 4 8 days owing to contaminations such as high cloud cover in addition a uniform number of images per year are required for time series analysis for this reason the eight days was selected as the temporal resolution and 8 day composite series were subsequently generated when more than one observation per 8 day bin was available in this study area although composite median averaging would bring information loss and could not capture short term blooms moreover it would take about seven days for the cyanobacterial biomass to double and dominated the phytoplankton groups with a slow growing rate of 0 1d 1 wynne et al 2010 therefore 8 day pc composition is sufficient to capture the cyanobacterial bloom phenology seasonal trend in the growing stages of surface cyanobacteria the savizky golay smoothing procedure would filter out the high frequency noise induced by the occurrence of short term bloom throughout the annual cycle for cyanobacteria growth resulting in a negative impact on the gaussian fitting process for phenology metrics extracting however our results suggest that though the bloom amplitude varied in the seasonal and inter annual scale distinct seasonal blooms with relatively high signal noise ratio have been frequently observed in this eutrophic lake since 2003 thus the smoothing procedure filtering the short term bloom would have little impact on cyanobacterial blooms with a relatively high signal noise ratio moreover the importance of observational noise would be weaker in areas with high bloom amplitude but more significant in regions with low seasonal bloom amplitude versus noise level ferreira et al 2014 therefore the uncertainty brought by savizky golay approach would not have much impact on the results 5 conclusions in this study cyanobacterial bloom phenology and its responses to environmental forces were explored in lake erhai we explored the spatio temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extent for surface cyanobacterial bloom based on 13 year phycocyanin pigment series retrieved from satellite using gaussian fitting and linear unmixing models during period 2003 2011 and 2016 2019 the result indicates that high intensity and early onset bloom were identified with a large coverage extent in the north lake showing three dominant growth patterns such as early peak late peak and winter max mode this exploration of bloom phenology responses to environmental forces shows that the tn and tp were found to the most impacts on bloom amplitude moreover elevated early summer tn and weakened early autumn wind speeds contributed to early onset bloom in 2003 2011 while reduced late summer wind speed led to earlier bit in 2016 2019 fluctuating tp level fueled the blooms over the period 2016 2019 occurring primarily in autumn and winter as the tn level was stable and under effective control evidence for the impact of fertilizer topdressing application on cyanobacterial bloom phenology in the northern watersheds was observed indicating that given the coincidence of such massive rainfall events especially shortly after the topdressing activities any remaining excess nutrients in surface water of farmland after the topdressing application entered into ditches from the ridge of field and produced runoff then feed into nearby river channels and finally provide sufficient nutrient for cyanobacteria growth in the receiving lake moreover in coincidence with high rainfall intensity the bits lagged by approximately an average of 23 days behind a one week window for the topdressing practice the results of this research have implications for the protection of lake erhai as part of agricultural planting structure adjustment implements strict bans on garlic cultivation in the whole basin indeed positively alleviated cyanobacterial bloom by reducing the topdressing fertilization moreover adjustment of planting structure turns out to be an effective measure for reducing fertilizer topdressings since tn pollution has been under control crops such as leaf vegetables and wheat with high tp loss should be reduced or eliminated our research verified the link between topdressing and cyanobacterial bloom in such a typical early eutrophication plateau lake this would help guide for agricultural transformation from traditional planting towards more economically and environmentally friendly practices similar work for reducing topdressing activities during sensitive periods for cyanobacterial bloom and optimizing planting structure

4853,transient flow of geofluids caused by a well production in a subsurface formation is a phenomenon of enormous importance in hydrology geosciences and engineering geofluid transient flow has been proved to be a nonlinear physical process dominated by qpg quadratic pressure gradient much research has indicated that neglecting a qpg term in flow models by assuming small pressure gradients can cause significant errors in predicted pressures despite the existence and importance of qpg limited research on nonlinear qpg models has been performed when compared with the traditional linear flow models on the basis of the previous linear and nonlinear qpg models a comprehensive geofluid flow model for a well in a subsurface formation was established and solved a general solution method for this model and its general solutions were obtained for vertical and horizontal wells in ordinary fractured and fractured vuggy formations next flow regimes and typical transient flow characteristics were thoroughly analyzed by using a series of standard type curves then the differences in type curves between linear and nonlinear qpg models were qualitatively and quantitatively studied afterwards model validations and production predictions were performed this comprehensive model contained various specific modeling situations some modeling situations that were reported in the previous studies were well reviewed in this paper the other previously unreported modelling situations were firstly studied and exhibited in this paper at the end the existing problems pending to be solved were put forward and future work on nonlinear qpg models was suggested this paper is very helpful in understanding the qpg dominated transient flow behavior more profoundly keywords geofluid flow porosity

quadratic pressure gradient chen et al 2001 finjord 1990 giachetti and maroscia 2008 liang et al 2001 marshall 2009 the governing equation of liquid flow in porous media derived according to darcy s law and the principle of mass conservation essentially contains a nonlinear qpg term guo and nie 2013 gave a detailed derivation process of the governing equation with the qpg term in the traditional linear flow models the qpg term in their governing equations was directly ignored by assuming small pressure gradients and small compressibility of geofluids in formations to simplify these equations for research convenience however such a simplification can cause significant differences or errors in predicted pressures and pressure solutions between nonlinear and linear models braeuning et al 1998 claimed that an assumption of small pressure gradients can cause significant errors during certain operations such as large drawdown flows and large pressure pulse testing chakrabarty et al 1993a pointed out that a maximum relative error can be of the order of 10 cao et al 2004 concluded that a relative difference in long time pressure solutions reached about 8 guo and nie 2013 performed well test interpretations for a real petroleum well by using their qpg model and compared the interpretation results with those using a conventional linear model they found that relative differences in the parameter values of formation permeability a well skin factor and external boundary distance were 18 53 29 63 and 10 38 respectively in fact differences or errors caused by qpg are not a constant but differ with different formation properties fluid properties and production operations braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a jelmert and vik 1996 odeh and babu 1998 wang and dusseault 1991 generally the differences or errors increase with the elapse of time an increase in a production injection rate and geofluid viscosity and compressibility and a decrease in formation permeability and thickness braeuning et al 1998 chen and zhang 2009 guo and nie 2013 lu et al 2015 wang et al 2013 except for groundwater and petroleum in the past gas transport in subsurface formations aroused many particular concerns and researches in hydrological sciences for example subsurface gas flow to a barometric pumping well was modeled in a single zone you et al 2010 or a multilayer unsaturated zone you et al 2011a in addition induced gas flow in the unsaturated zone you et al 2011b and tide induced airflow in a layered unsaturated zone li et al 2011 2012a were also well investigated furthermore other researches related to subsurface gas transport were available such as air permeability determination for unsaturated zones li et al 2012b soil vapor extraction you and zhan 2012 and diffusive and advective fluxes of gas phase vocs volatile organic compounds you and zhan 2013 these researches did not touch upon the nonlinear gas flow issue sometimes gas flow in subsurface formations also shows nonlinearity especially in high pressure deep formations guo and nie 2013 derived a nonlinear governing equation of gas flow through subsurface porous media via an equation of state of real gas which was the equation of state of ideal gas amended by a gas compressibility factor the derived governing equation includes a nonlinear term that contains a quadratic derivative term of pressure square because the governing equation of gas flow can be linearized by a gas pseudo pressure function guo and nie 2013 the qpg issue of gas flow was rarely studied in the past recently kumar and govindarajan 2020 derived the qpg dominated governing equation of gas flow in high pressure fractured formations by assuming the parameter group of p μ gf z to be a constant under high pressure conditions thus the qpg dominated governing equation of gas flow is completely the same as that of liquid flow kumar and govindarajan 2020 established and solved a one dimensional qpg model for gas flow in a high pressure fractured formation at present more complex gas flow models with respect to qpg have not been found many publications are available about the research on nonlinear qpg models of liquid flow early in 1989 a steady state flow qpg model for a vertical well was presented finjord and aadnoy 1989 later a transient flow qpg model for a vertical well in a single porosity formation was established and solved through variable modifications cao et al 2004 chakrabarty et al 1993a b jelmert and vik 1996 odeh and babu 1998 wang and dusseault 1991 and a special variable rate well test by using this qpg model was studied braeuning et al 1998 afterwards more complicated qpg models for a vertical well were established and solved such as a fractal qpg model tong and wang 2005 a spherical flow qpg model nie and ding 2010 and a transient flow qpg model for a dual porosity formation bai and roegiers 1994 bai et al 1994 li et al 2015 and a multiple zone composite formation wang et al 2013 then a transient flow qpg model for a horizontal well in a single porosity formation lu et al 2015 one dimensional and radial qpg models with a consideration of a moving boundary in a low permeability formation liu and yao 2015 liu et al 2016 and a one dimensional qpg model of fluid in a vertical hydraulic fracture abbasi et al 2017 were established and solved a transient flow qpg model of a multiple fractured horizontal well ren and guo 2017 was also studied recently ren et al 2019 conducted an application of a modified blasingame production analysis by using a nonlinear qpg model for a vertical well abbasi et al 2019 modeled a transient shape factor with a consideration of qpg in fractured reservoirs definitely more complex qpg models and other related topic research with a consideration of qpg are the current research trends about qpg based on the solutions of nonlinear qpg models we can plot a series of transient pressure curves to analyze the transient flow behavior of geofluids in subsurface formations braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a b guo and nie 2013 especially the standard bi logarithmic type curves of pressure and pressure derivatives with respect to time are the most convenient to recognize the flow regimes and analyze the transient flow characteristics corbett et al 2012 wang et al 2018 different well types and different formation types produce different transient flow behaviors the common well types are vertical wells and horizontal wells the common formation types are ordinary single porosity fractured dual porosity and fractured vuggy triple porosity formations cherubini et al 2014 huang and goltz 2015 ruiz constán et al 2018 vanderzalm et al 2013 for dual porosity and triple porosity formations there exists the inter porosity flow of geofluids between different media de swaan 1976 warren and root 1963 three kinds of inter porosity flow patterns pseudo steady unsteady and mixed also produce different transient flow behaviors nie et al 2011 2012b table 1 listed the present research status about linear models and nonlinear qpg models for vertical and horizontal wells in different formations when considering different inter porosity flow patterns we listed 6 situations see column 4 in table 1 that can be separately considered in model studies for a vertical well in the three types of formations the linear models in situations ① ⑥ have been researched see column 5 in table 1 but the nonlinear qpg models were studied only in situations ① ② and ⑤ see column 6 in table 1 for a horizontal well in the three types of formations the linear models in situations ① ② and ④ have been reported see column 7 in table 1 but only a nonlinear qpg model in situation ① was available see the last column in table 1 obviously at present vertical well models are more abundant than horizontal well models and linear models are far more abundant than nonlinear qpg models therefore the main tasks of this paper are to 1 conduct a critical review on the present research status of flow models and then newly report the other unreported situations in table 1 for vertical and horizontal wells in ordinary fractured and fractured vuggy formations 2 conduct an integrated review on the definition and significance of qpg 3 on the basis of the previous research on linear and nonlinear qpg models establish a comprehensive geofluid flow model for a well in a subsurface formation with separate considerations of situations ① ⑥ in table 1 4 develop a general method for this model and its general solutions 5 plot a series of standard type curves for transient flow behavior analyses 6 analyze flow regimes and typical transient flow characteristics in different situations using type curves 7 make qualitative and quantitative comparisons between linear and nonlinear qpg models 8 validate the nonlinear qpg models and predict production pressure drops and 9 put forward the existing problems and suggestions for future work this paper will help in understanding qpg dominated transient flow behaviors for wells in subsurface formations more profoundly 2 qpg definition and significance when single phase fluid flow in an isothermal porous formation obeys darcy s law and fluid density depends exponentially on pore pressure the derived governing equation includes a nonlinear term that is the second power of pressure gradient the second power is called qpg quadratic pressure gradient and the nonlinear term is called the qpg term as shown fig a 1 the governing equation with the qpg term for liquid flow in subsurface porous media was deduced in detail by many publications wang and dusseault 1991 guo and nie 2013 liu et al 2016 abbasi et al 2019 and omitted here by assuming a small pressure gradient and a small fluid compressibility in porous media to ignore the qpg term the nonlinear governing equation is reduced to the conventional linear governing equation therefore the linear equation is an approximation and simplification of the nonlinear qpg equation in fact fluid flow in porous media is a complex nonlinear process as a matter of fact nonlinear qpg models have a self validation property because they are automatically validated by comparisons in the pressure curves with the conventional linear models by setting the qpg coefficient β as zero guo and nie 2013 liu et al 2016 in addition a geofluid flow model with the nonlinear qpg equation can be validated via a comparison with a numerical simulation abbasi et al 2019 did a model validation for a one dimensional flow in a homogenous and isotropic porous media via a comparison with a numerical simulation see fig 1 the pressure transients of the analytical model showed a very good agreement with those of the numerical simulation as shown in fig 1 especially for gas flow in subsurface porous media when the equation of state of real gas is considered as the equation of state of ideal gas amended by a gas compressibility factor the derived governing equation also includes a nonlinear term that contains a quadratic derivative term of pressure square see fig a 1 in appendix a it is interesting that the nonlinear governing equation of gas can be linearized by a gas pseudo pressure function ψ guo and nie 2013 which is defined as ψ p 0 p p μ gf z d p see fig a 1 in appendix a therefore the qpg issue was not specially mentioned in the past under high pressure conditions the parameter group of p μ gf z in the definition of ψ can be deemed as a constant kumar and govindarajan 2020 so the gas pseudo pressure function can be reduced to a pure pressure function that is completely the same as that of liquid flow under low pressure conditions the nonlinear gas flow issue can easily be addressed by introducing the gas pseudo pressure function to conveniently solve the governing equation a group of dimensionless parameters is defined the nonlinear qpg term in the dimensionless governing equation contains a dimensionless coefficient β that is a function of fluid compressibility c gf fluid viscosity μ gf well production injection rate q formation permeability k and thickness h because pressure gradient depends on the flow environment of fluid in formations μ gf k h etc and q the impact of the dimensional qpg term is completely converted to that of β β is usually in the range of 0 001 to 0 1 the impact of β on pressure transients is very obvious when β 0 01 and relatively weak when β 0 01 for a subsurface formation with a high pressure a low permeability a thin thickness a high viscosity of geofluid and a large production injection rate the value of β may usually exceed 0 01 in this situation neglect of qpg in the governing equation will lead to remarkable errors in production pressure drop predictions and formation parameter interpretations the prediction errors of production pressure drop may exceed 50 in some special conditions on the contrary qpg can be ignored when β 0 01 in engineering applications because the prediction errors may be less than 2 in real applications for most groundwater flow problems the groundwater density is a constant so the qpg dominated flow does not prevail however under enormous pressure variation conditions such as large pressure drawdown tests and large rates caused by a water well production from a deep formation or a water well injection into a formation especially by a horizontal well the errors by ignoring the nonlinear qpg term in the flow equation are remarkable compared with groundwater flow in the past the qpg dominated petroleum flow was prevailing because petroleum is easier to compress than water unquestionably the qpg dominated gas flow should be most worthy of attention owing to the strong compressibility of gas the main pros and cons of qpg are generalized in fig a 1 no matter pros or cons it is a fact that the nonlinear qpg equation is more precise than the conventional linear equation in predicting pressure transients in the following sections we will exhibit how β affects pressure transients positively in theoretical analyses and real case applications 3 conceptual geofluid flow modeling 3 1 a well production in a confined formation single phase geofluid such as groundwater and petroleum is assumed to be extracted using a single vertical well or a single horizontal well at a constant production rate in a confined formation e g aquifer petroleum layer geofluid flow in the confined formation conforms to darcy s law and fluid gravity is ignored the confined formation is assumed to be horizontal and of equal thickness the top and bottom interfaces of the confined formation with the confining beds are impermeable the external boundary of the confined formation in the horizontal plane may be infinite or closed or of constant pressure before well production pressure is uniformly distributed in formation the conceptual geofluid flow diagram is shown in fig 2 it is noted that fluids may be injected through a well into subsurface formations if we use a negative rate q to substitute the production rate q we can obtain the model of injection wells 3 2 conceptual multiple porosity media in a confined formation three common formation types are considered the first type is the single porosity formation which is the ordinary formation without fractures and vugs the second type is the dual porosity formation which is composed of natural fracture and matrix the dual porosity formation is also called as the naturally fractured formation altinörs and önder 2008 cherubini et al 2014 huang and goltz 2015 önder 1998 the third type is the triple porosity formation which is composed of natural fracture vug and matrix the triple porosity formation is also called as the naturally fractured vuggy formation such as some carbonate formation fan et al 2011 ruiz constán et al 2018 vanderzalm et al 2013 fig 3 shows the conceptual diagram of dual porosity media in a fractured formation the formation system consists of fracture and matrix subsystems there exists the inter porosity flow of geofluid from matrix to fracture subsystems two assumptions on the geometric shape of matrix blocks are considered one is the arbitrary shape see fig 3a and the other is the spherical see fig 3b the arbitrary shape matrix blocks nie et al 2012b warren and root 1963 and the spherical matrix blocks de swaan 1976 nie et al 2012b are used for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern respectively the pseudo steady inter porosity flow hypothesizes equal pressure in matrix subsystem at any time that is to say the pressure in matrix subsystem is independent of coordinate location but a function of time the unsteady inter porosity flow means that the pressures everywhere in matrix subsystem are not equal that is to say the pressure in matrix subsystem is a function of time and coordinate location fig 4 shows the conceptual diagram of triple porosity media in a fractured vuggy formation the formation system consists of fracture vug and matrix subsystems there exist the inter porosity flows of geofluid from matrix to fracture subsystems and from vug to fracture subsystems the inter porosity flow between matrix and vug subsystems is assumed negligible the same geometric shape assumptions as matrix blocks in dual porosity media above arbitrary shape vugs and spherical vugs are also considered for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern respectively three situations about inter porosity flows for matrix and vug subsystems are considered one is the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern for matrix and vug subsystems fig 4a another is the mixed inter flow pattern that means the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern for matrix subsystem and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern for vug subsystem fig 4b the other is the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern for matrix and vug subsystems fig 4c especially additional assumptions are needed for the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern matrix blocks and vugs are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the formation nie et al 2011 2012b every matrix block has the same spherical radius noted as r 1 see fig 3b and every vug has the same spherical radius noted as r 2 see fig 4b the pressure distribution in matrix block or vug is spherically symmetric geofluid flows from the center of matrix blocks or vugs into fractures and the pressure at the spherical surface of matrix blocks or vugs equals to the fracture pressure 3 3 conceptual flow routes of geofluid in a confined formation fig 5 shows the conceptual diagram flow routes of geofluid for a well in different formations it is usually supposed that fracture permeability is larger than vug permeability and vug permeability is larger than matrix permeability therefore for both fractured and fractured vuggy formations the medium directly connected with the wellbore is assumed as the fracture subsystem liu et al 2003 wu et al 2004 the outflow geofluid from the vug and matrix subsystems is both towards the fracture subsystem the inter porosity flow from the vug subsystem is prior to that from the matrix subsystem because the vug permeability is larger than matrix permeability corbett et al 2012 nie et al 2012a wu et al 2011 4 mathematical model for a well in a confined formation 4 1 coordinate system for a vertical well model a radial coordinate r with the coordinate origin at the center of the vertical wellbore in the horizontal plane is needed guo and nie 2013 li et al 2015 for a horizontal well model except a radial coordinate r with the coordinate origin at the center of the horizontal wellbore in the horizontal plane fig 6 a a perpendicular coordinate z with the coordinate origin from the bottom boundary in the vertical plane is also needed fig 6b and c and the perpendicular distance of the horizontal wellbore to the bottom boundary is noted as z w guo et al 2012 lu et al 2015 nie et al 2012a 4 2 qpg dominated mathematical model for a

p md t d if we use the letter f to substitute the subscript m in the fourth and fifth terms in eq 25 and then put them into eqs 2 4 6 9 and 12 we will gain the corresponding governing equations for a horizontal well in a fractured formation fig 3 and fig 5c or a fractured vuggy formation fig 4 and fig 5d for example by putting the substituted fourth and fifth terms into eq 2 we can gain the governing equation for a horizontal well in a dual porosity formation with the consideration of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern 26 2 p fd r d 2 1 r d p fd r d β p fd r d 2 1 h d 2 2 p fd z d 2 β h d 2 p fd z d 2 λ mf e 2 s p md p fd e 2 s p fd t d in addition eqs 3 5 7 8 10 11 13 15 and 21 24 for a vertical well are also suitable to a horizontal well it is noted that the inner and external boundary conditions for a vertical well are different from a horizontal well a point source condition at constant rate production can be employed in the modeling of a horizontal well 27 lim r d 0 r d p j d r d 1 j m f for a horizontal well except the external formation boundary in horizontal plane that can be described by eqs 18 20 the top and bottom boundary in vertical plane fig 6 must be taken into consideration closed top and bottom boundaries can be respectively described by 28 p d z d z d 1 0 29 p d z d z d 0 0 by the way if we delete the nonlinear quadratic pressure gradient terms in the governing equations eqs 1 2 4 6 9 11 12 14 25 and 26 the mathematical model will become a conventional linear mathematical model for a well in a confined formation the definitions and units of all the parameters in the above mathematical model are shown in the sections of nomenclature and appendix b the model solutions are shown in appendix c 5 transient flow behavior in a confined formation 5 1 transient flow behavior of a vertical well 1 for a single porosity formation the transient pressure is the response of the transient flow of geofluid in a formation fig 7 shows the transient pressure curves when the well skin factor s is equal to 0 and the dimensionless wellbore storage coefficient c d is equal to 1000 for a vertical well in a single porosity formation in fig 7 curve ① is the pressure curve of the conventional linear model and curves ② ④ are the pressure curves of nonlinear qpg model when the coefficient of qpg term β is equal to 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 respectively it can be seen from fig 7 that there exists obvious difference in transient pressure between linear and nonlinear models and the pressure curve of the nonlinear model is lower than that of the linear model according to the definition of dimensionless pressure see appendix b a lower pressure curve means a smaller production pressure drop of the vertical well in a single porosity formation therefore if we use the conventional linear model to predict the transient pressure we will gain a lager value of production pressure drop than that of using the nonlinear qpg model fig 8 shows the semi logarithmic curves of pressure transients in the same model parameter values as fig 7 it can be seen from fig 8 that the curves in the late time take on a linear line with a slope which indicates the iarf infinite acting radial flow regime braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a 1993b in comparison with the curves fig 7 and the semi logarithmic curves fig 8 the standard bi logarithmic type curves of pressure and pressure derivatives shown in fig 9 are more convenient to recognize the flow regimes and analyze the transient flow characteristics corbett et al 2012 wang et al 2018 wang and yi 2017 2018 an entire flow process can easily be discerned from figs 9 and 10 i regime i is the pure wellbore storage regime slope of pressure and the pressure derivative both equal one there are no differences in type curves between the linear and nonlinear models because the geofluid in the formation does not start to flow in this regime ii regime ii is the wellbore storage and skin effect regime shape of the derivative curve is a hump the nonlinearity of geofluid flow positively influences the pressure transients a larger c d and a larger s will lead to a higher hump shape braeuning et al 1998 guo and nie 2013 iii regime iii is the iarf infinite acting radial flow regime the most obvious differences between the linear and nonlinear models are shown in this regime for the conventional linear model the logarithmic value of pressure derivatives is equal to 0 5 and the pressure derivative curve locates at a horizontal line see the 0 5 line in fig 9 however the pressure derivative curve of the nonlinear model does not conform to the 0 5 line law also called the law of a horizontal line of zero slope corbett et al 2012 guo and nie 2013 nie et al 2012a as time elapses the pressure derivative curves gradually deviate from the 0 5 line a larger β results in a lager curve deviation of the nonlinear model from the linear model see curves ② ④ in fig 9 iv regime iv is the boundary controlled regime for a constant pressure boundary the pressure derivative curves go down and ultimately converge at a point and at this time the transient flow becomes a ssf steady state flow for a closed boundary the pressure derivative curves go up and ultimately become an inclined line with a slope and at this time the transient flow becomes a pssf pseudo steady state flow the slope of the inclined line is just equal to one also called the law of an inclined line of unit slope for the conventional linear model and slightly smaller than one for the nonlinear qpg model corbett et al 2012 guo and nie 2013 nie et al 2012a a farther boundary distance to the well will cause a delay of the boundary response in conclusion except for the pure wellbore storage regime the type curves in the other regimes are affected by the coefficient of qpg term β the curves of the nonlinear model gradually deviate from those of the linear model with the elapse of time the deviation of pressure derivative curve is more obvious than that of pressure curve for the same β a larger β means a stronger nonlinearity on the type curves 2 for a dual porosity formation fig 3 and fig 5a figs 11 and 12 show the standard type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a vertical well in an infinite fractured formation the same four flow regimes can easily be discerned from figs 11 and 12 regimes i ii are the same as those in a single porosity formation regime iii is the inter porosity flow regime of matrix to fracture subsystems regime iii is the iarf regime of the total formation system in regime iii the pressure derivative curves are concave which is the typical characteristic of a dual porosity media for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern the concave curves are v shaped al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 corbett et al 2012 for the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern the concave curves are flatter nie et al 2012b the concave curves are dominated by the capacitance coefficients of fracture and matrix subsystems ω f and ω m and the inter porosity flow factor of matrix to fracture subsystems λ mf a larger λ mf than 10 6 will make the concaves in figs 11 and 12 move left and a larger ω m than 0 9 will make the concaves deeper corbett et al 2012 nie et al 2012a 2012b in figs 11 and 12 curves ① are the type curves of the conventional linear model and curves ② and ③ are the type curves of nonlinear qpg model when the coefficient of qpg term β is equal to 0 01 and 0 05 respectively as shown in figs 11 and 12 the type curves of the nonlinear model deviate from those of the linear model the dual porosity model has the same boundary controlled regime as the single porosity model in the following we will not exhibit the type curves in the boundary controlled regime 3 for a triple porosity formation fig 4 and fig 5b figs 13 15 show the standard type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow the mixed inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a vertical well in an infinite fractured vuggy formation the same five flow regimes can easily be discerned from figs 13 15 regimes i ii v are the same as those in a fractured formation regimes iii and iv are the inter porosity flow regimes of vug to fracture subsystems and matrix to fracture subsystems respectively there are two concaves in the pressure derivative curves which is the typical characteristic of a triple porosity media the first concave on the left is dominated by the capacitance coefficients of fracture and vug subsystems ω f and ω v and the inter porosity flow factor of vug to fracture subsystems λ vf the second concave on the right is dominated by the capacitance coefficients of fracture and matrix subsystems ω f and ω m and the inter porosity flow factor of matrix to fracture subsystems λ mf a larger λ vf than 10 6 will make the first concaves in figs 13 15 move left and a larger ω v than 0 15 will make the first concaves deeper a larger λ mf than 10 8 will make the second concaves in figs 13 15 move left and a larger ω m than 0 84 will make the second concaves deeper probably a larger λ mf can result in misshapen concaves when the inter porosity flow of marix to fracture subsystems starts before the inter porosity flow of vug to fracture subsystems has finished guo et al 2012 for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern the two concaves are v shaped for the mixed inter porosity flow pattern the first concave on the left is flat and the second concave on the right is v shaped for the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern the two concaves are flat the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern leads to a v shaped concave and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern leads to a flat concave in figs 13 15 curves ① are the type curves of the linear model and curves ② and ③ are the type curves of nonlinear qpg model the influence of the coefficient of qpg term on the type curves for the fractured vuggy formation is similar to that for the ordinary fractured formation 5 2 transient flow behavior of a horizontal well 1 for a single porosity formation fig 16 shows the type curves for a horizontal well in an infinite formation without a consideration of wellbore storage effect curves ① in fig 16 are the type curves of the conventional linear model and curves ② ④ in fig 16 are the type curves of the nonlinear qpg model three main flow regimes can be observed i regime i is the early vertical radial flow regime the first radial flow regime geofluid in the formation radially flows into the horizontal wellbore in the vertical plane and the streamlines are orthogonal to the axis of the horizontal wellbore lu et al 2015 nie et al 2012a as shown in fig 17 a the type curves in this regime are controlled by skin factor s formation thickness h perpendicular distance of wellbore to the formation bottom z w and the ratio of horizontal permeability to perpendicular permeability k h k p in theory the pressure derivative curve of the conventional linear model in this regime is absolutely horizontal when k h k p is equal to one nie et al 2012a a larger thickness will cause a longer duration of this regime for a very thin formation it is hard to observe this regime from the type curves ii regime ii is the mid horizontal linear flow regime after the pressure wave caused by the horizontal well production reaches to the top and bottom boundaries the early vertical radial regime ends and the mid horizontal linear flow starts in this regime geofluid in the formation linearly flows into the horizontal wellbore in the horizontal plane and the streamlines are parallel lines and orthogonal to the axis of the horizontal wellbore lu et al 2015 nie et al 2012a as shown in fig 17b the pressure derivative curve in this regime takes on an inclined straight line the type curves in this regime are mainly controlled by horizontal well length l a longer horizontal length directly results in a longer duration of this linear flow regime iv regime iii is the late horizontal pseudo radial flow the first radial flow regime in this regime the geofluid in the area far away from the horizontal wellbore pseudo radially flows into the area near the horizontal wellbore as shown in fig 17c the characteristics of type curves in the pseudo radial flow regime of the horizontal well model are similar to those in the radial flow regime of the vertical well model the pressure derivative curves of the conventional linear horizontal well model converged to 0 5 line see curve ① in fig 16 the pressure derivative curves of the nonlinear horizontal well model do not conform to the 0 5 line law and they are located down the 0 5 line and are slightly inclined instead of horizontal see curves ② ④ in fig 16 in a word the differences in type curves associated with the linear and nonlinear models increase with the increase of the coefficient of qpg term and the elapse of time 2 for a dual porosity formation fig 3 and fig 5c figs 18 and 19 show the type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a horizontal well in an infinite fractured formation without a consideration of wellbore storage effect compared with the type curves of an infinite single porosity formation fig 16 after the mid horizontal linear flow regime an additional inter porosity flow regime of matrix to fracture subsystems can be discerned from figs 18 and 19 the pressure derivative curves have a v shaped concave fig 18 and a flat concave fig 19 for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern respectively a larger ω m than 0 9 will make the concaves deeper a larger λ mf than 10 9 will make the concave move left and probably result in a misshapen concave and a shorter inclined straight line of the pressure derivative curve in the mid horizontal linear flow regime and in this situation it means that the inter porosity flow starts before the linear flow regime has finished guo et al 2012 figs 18 and 19 also apparently show the strong influence of the coefficient of qpg term on the type curves 3 for a triple porosity formation fig 4 and fig 5d figs 20 22 show the type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow the mixed inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a horizontal well in an infinite fractured vuggy formation compared with the type curves of an infinite single porosity formation fig 16 after the mid horizontal linear flow regime two additional inter porosity flow regimes can be discerned from figs 20 22 the first concave on the left is the response of vug to fracture subsystems and the second concave on the right is the response of matrix to fracture subsystems just like the triple porosity model of vertical well the type curves of the triple porosity model of horizontal well are still controlled by the model parameters of ω f ω v ω m λ vf λ mf and β in the same way 5 3 quantitative analysis of nonlinear influence dv and rdv can be employed to show the quantitative differences between type curves guo and nie 2013 lu et al 2015 30 dv value of linear model value of nonlinear model 31 rdv dv value of linear model 100 where dv is the differential value between linear model and nonlinear model and rdv is the relative differential value between linear model and nonlinear model 1 quantitative analysis for the single porosity model of a vertical well table 2 shows the quantitative differences of nonlinear influence on the type curves of a vertical well in a single porosity formation for β 0 01 the pressure values and the pressure derivative values in table 2 are corresponding to curves ① and ② in fig 9 the table shows that dimensionless pressure and its derivative differ between the linear and nonlinear models for example when t d c d 103 dv and rdv of pressure are 0 2504 and 3 43 respectively and dv and rdv of pressure derivative are 0 0351 and 6 91 respectively the rdv of the pressure derivative 6 91 is greater than that of pressure 3 43 at a fixed time t d c d 103 fig 23 a and 23b are rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively for a vertical well in a single porosity formation except for the pure wellbore storage regime regime i in fig 9 rdv of pressure increase over time fig 23a in the infinite acting radial flow regime regime iii in fig 9 rdv of pressure derivative increase over time fig 23b in the wellbore storage and skin effect regime regime ii in fig 9 rdv of pressure derivative increases first and then decreases owing to the wellbore storage effect braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a it can be observed from fig 9 that rdvs of pressure and pressure derivative increase in parallel with β in general qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the nonlinearity dominated by qpg influences the transient flow behavior of geofluid in a confined formation positively the nonlinear qpg models are more accurate than the conventional linear models to portrait the transient flow behavior of geofluid in confined formations 2 quantitative analysis for the single porosity model of a horizontal well table 3 shows the quantitative differences of nonlinear influence on the type curves of a horizontal well in a single porosity formation for β 0 01 the pressure values and the pressure derivative values in table 3 are corresponding to curves ① and ② in fig 16 the table shows that dimensionless pressure and its derivative differ between the linear and nonlinear models when t d c d 105 rdvs of pressure and pressure derivative are 4 64 and 6 16 respectively fig 24 a and 24b are rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively for a horizontal well in a single porosity formation it can be seen from fig 24 that rdvs increase over time and in parallel with β 3 quantitative analysis with the effect of fractured formation parameters here we take the vertical well model with a consideration of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern as an example to demonstrate the effect of fractured formation parameters λ mf ω f ω m on the calculated rdvs by setting s 0 c d 1 ω f 0 1 and ω m 0 9 we simulated the type curves dominated by λ mf 10 5 and λ mf 10 6 β 0 and β 0 05 respectively for a vertical well in a dual porosity formation as shown in fig 25 a we also calculated the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative as shown in fig 25b it can be seen from fig 25b that the rdv curves of pressure derivative take on an inclined concave in the inter porosity flow regime rdv curves for λ mf 10 5 and λ mf 10 6 differ only in the inter porosity flow regime fig 26 a and b show the type curves dominated by different ω f ω m and β and the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively rdv curves for ω f 0 2 and ω m 0 8 and ω f 0 1 and ω m 0 9 differ not only in the inter porosity flow regime but also in the skin effect and early fracture flow regimes a larger ω f means a larger amount of geofluid stored in the fracture subsystem accordingly the supply ability of geofluid from the fracture subsystem to the wellbore is relatively stronger for a larger ω f for the same rate production the flow speed of geofluid and the pressure gradient in the fracture subsystem with a larger ω f are lower than those with a smaller ω f a larger pressure gradient makes the nonlinearity of qpg more intense and results in larger rdvs therefore the rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative for ω f 0 2 are below those for ω f 0 1 in the skin effect and fracture flow regimes 4 quantitative analysis with the effect of fractured vuggy formation parameters the effect of λ mf and λ vf on the calculated rdvs for a triple porosity formation is similar to that of λ mf for a dual porosity formation here we only demonstrate the effect of ω f ω v and ω m on the calculated rdvs to better investigate the effect of ω v and eliminate the effect of ω f by setting ω f 0 01 we simulated the type curves dominated by ω v 0 15 ω m 0 84 and ω v 0 3 ω m 0 69 β 0 and β 0 05 respectively as shown in fig 27 a we also calculated the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative as shown in fig 27b it can be seen from fig 27b that the rdv curves of pressure derivative take on two inclined concaves in the inter porosity flow regimes of vug to fracture subsystems and matrix to fracture subsystems respectively rdv curves dominated by ω v and ω m differ only in the inter porosity flow regimes because vug permeability is far larger than matrix permeability rdv curves are more sensitive to ω v than ω m therefore it can be seen from fig 27b that the differences in rdv curves in the inter porosity flow regime of vug to fracture subsystems are more obvious than those in the inter porosity flow regime of matrix to fracture subsystems fig 28 a and b show the type curves dominated by different ω f ω v ω m and β and the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively rdv curves for ω f 0 1 ω v 0 2 and ω m 0 7 and ω f 0 01 ω v 0 15 and ω m 0 84 are different in all the flow regimes except the pure wellbore storage and infinite acting radial flow regimes the rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative for ω f 0 1 are below those for ω f 0 01 in the skin effect and early fracture flow regimes because fracture permeability is assumed to be larger than vug permeability and far larger than matrix permeability rdv curves are more sensitive to ω f than ω v and ω v than ω m therefore it can be seen from fig 28b that the differences in rdv curves in the early fracture flow regime are more obvious than those in the inter porosity flow regimes 6 model validation via a real case application guo and nie 2013 did well test interpretations on the pressure buildup testing data of a vertical oil well in a sandstone reservoir with an edge water drive the formation thickness is 3 m the porosity is 0 21 the compressibility of formation rock is 0 0038 mpa 1 the oil compressibility is 0 0034 mpa 1 the oil viscosity is 20 08 mpa s the oil volume factor is 1 089 the well radius is 0 062 m and the production rate of the well before shutting in is 24 5 m3 d the dimensionless matching curves and the dimensional matching curves from well test interpretations are shown in fig 29 the nonlinear qpg model and the conventional linear model for a vertical well in an ordinary formation were used in the well test interpretations it can be seen from fig 29 that the curve matching effects by using the two models are satisfactory in all the flow regimes which are consistent with fig 10 the interpretation results are shown in table 4 the rdv of c s is zero because wellbore pressure is not affected by qpg in the pure wellbore storage regime the rdvs of s k m and r e are 29 63 18 53 and 10 38 respectively the coefficient β is 0 0287 the interpretation results by using the qpg model are more precise than those by using the linear model because the linear model is a simplification and approximation of the qpg model 7 probable β value and production prediction 7 1 probable β value according to β definition β q b gf μ gf c gf 2 π k hm h it is proportional to well production rate q geofluid viscosity μ gf and inversely proportional to formation permeability k m and formation thickness h a larger production rate in a lager pressure drop causes a larger β formations with low permeability heavy oil or thin thickness have a larger β causing the influence of nonlinearity to be more intense for these formations based on the parameter values of the above example well from guo and nie 2013 we calculated a group of probable β values by changing the parameter values of k m h μ gf and q as shown in table 5 in the table case ① is the example well data cases ⑥ and ⑦ can be deemed as water wells because μ gf and c gf are 1 mpa s and 0 00044 mpa 1 respectively in the same formation the β value of a horizontal well is surely larger than that of a vertical well simply because a horizontal well usually has a larger production rate than a vertical well cases ② and ⑥ can be deemed as a horizontal well production at a rate of 86 5 m3 d and 150 m3 d respectively 7 2 production prediction 1 production pressure drop prediction for a vertical oil well by assuming an infinite boundary we simulated a vertical oil well production for case ① in table 5 to predict production pressure drop δp with the elapse of time t the production pressure drop curves with units are shown in fig 30 the figure shows the same nonlinear trend as the theoretical model figures see figs 7 9 and 23 the rdvs of the predicted pressure drops increase with the elapse of time it can be seen from fig 30d that the rdv of δp is smaller than 5 within 100 h and can reach up to 10 beyond 106h usually too large pressure drop is not realistic for low pressure formations because the production pressure drop must below the formation pressure therefore for a well production at a small rate in a low pressure oil reservoir the prediction error produced by using the conventional linear model can be ignored in engineering applications however for a low pressure formation fluids can be injected through an injection well into the formation at a large rate in this situation the use of the conventional linear model undoubtedly will cause noteworthy errors in pressure drop predictions of fluid injection in addition for a high pressure formation a well production may easily cause a large pressure drop so the qpg term should be considered in large pressure drop predictions recent years many ultra high pressure formations were found for example in the central graben of the north sea that is a prolific hydrocarbon province the formation pressures in egret heron and skua fields stricker et al 2016 are 85 6 86 8 mpa 86 8 mpa and 63 7 66 8 mpa respectively definitely the use of the conventional linear models in such ultra high pressure formations will cause conspicuous errors 2 production pressure drop prediction for a horizontal oil well by assuming a 100 m horizontal length and a zero skin factor we also simulated a horizontal oil well production for case ② in table 5 as shown in fig 31 the rdv of δp exceeds 10 at t 0 3 h 30 at t 1000 h and 40 at t 106h compared with fig 30 fig 31 shows very large rdvs in production pressure drop predictions during the production period therefore in the same formation the application of the conventional linear model in horizontal wells will cause far greater errors than that in vertical wells 3 production pressure drop prediction for a vertical water well by assuming s 0 and c d 1 c s 0 02 m3 mpa we simulated a vertical water well production for case ⑦ in table 5 as shown in fig 32 the rdv of δp is smaller than 2 during the production period especially for a short production time within 100 h the rdv of δp is smaller than 0 4 the rdvs of the water well are smaller than those of the oil well of case ① mainly because the compressibility of water is smaller than that of oil therefore the prediction error produced by using the conventional linear model can be ignored in engineering applications 4 production pressure drop prediction for a horizontal water well by assuming a 100 m horizontal length and a zero skin factor we also simulated a horizontal water well production for case ⑥ in table 5 as shown in fig 33 the rdv of δp exceeds 2 at t 2 h 3 5 at t 1000 h and 6 at t 106h compared with fig 32 fig 33 shows relatively large rdvs in production pressure drop predictions a longer horizontal well may be put into production at a larger rate rdv may be larger for a longer horizontal well because it is proportional to well production rate therefore the prediction error caused by using the conventional linear model is advised not to be neglected for horizontal water wells at a large rate production especially for long horizontal wells 8 problems and future work based on the previous research work and the newly reported work in this article the following problems are still pending to be solved 1 the wellbore storage effect has not been considered in nonlinear qpg models of a horizontal well in confined formations the wellbore storage effect is defined immediately after a production start up or shut in when the pressure behavior at early times is dominated by the compressibility and volume of the wellbore fluid the wellbore storage effect is a phenomenon of objective existence for a well production from subsurface formations like qpg flow models with a consideration of the wellbore storage effect will predict the transient pressure behavior at the bottom of a well more precise in the conventional linear model of a horizontal well at a constant rate production by using duhamel s principle debnath 2012 nie et al 2012a ozkan and raghavan 1991a 1991b the wellbore storage factor can be considered by 32 p wd p sd 1 c d u 2 p sd where p wd is the response of a well with storage in laplace space p sd is the response of a well without storage in laplace space the wellbore storage effect of a horizontal well is more obvious than that of a vertical well because the wellbore volume of a horizontal well is larger than that of a vertical well the wellbore storage effect should be considered in horizontal well models however duhamel s principle is used to solve linear inhomogeneous differential equations debnath 2012 instead of nonlinear differential equations therefore at present it is a challenge of how to solve a nonlinear qpg model of a horizontal well with the consideration of wellbore storage factor 2 more complex model assumptions that were successfully considered in conventional linear models have not been considered in nonlinear qpg models for fractured and fractured vuggy formations at present only the single permeability flow situation that the fracture subsystem is assumed as the only pass way of geofluid into wellbore has been considered in nonlinear qpg models for fractured and fractured vuggy formations the dual permeability flow situation camacho velázquez et al 2005 guo et al 2012 that geofluid in both matrix and fracture subsystems simultaneously flows into wellbore has not been considered the solution of the conventional linear model with a dual permeability flow assumption is more complicated than that with a single permeability flow assumption and it has not the same expression form as a single porosity model and a different f u therefore solving a nonlinear qpg model with a dual permeability flow assumption will be a hard work in addition discrete fractures gläser et al 2017 kozuskanich et al 2012 weir 1999 have not been used in nonlinear qpg models dual permeability flow of geofluids and discrete fracture distribution in fractured formations are accord with the practical situation 3 more formation types have not been considered in nonlinear qpg models such as multi layered formation riva et al 2012 zhuang et al 2015 leaky confined formation aquifer feng and zhan 2015 meng et al 2015 unconfined formation aquifer hu and chen 2008 huang et al 2016 zhan 2002 and inclined formations pauritsch et al 2015 verhoest and troch 2000 the impact of qpg on transient flow behaviors of geofluids in these formation types may be more conspicuous than that in the single horizontal formation 4 more situations about well production systems have not been considered in nonlinear qpg models such as partially penetrating well meng et al 2015 mishra et al 2012 slanted well tsou et al 2010 zhan 2002 fractured well birdsell et al 2015 tokunaga 2020 and pumping well feng and zhan 2015 malama et al 2009 because the existed nonlinear qpg models for a constant rate production are suitable for artesian wells like the type of horizontal well the nonlinearity of qpg for these well types may be very strong when compared with the type of vertical well 5 more nonlinear factors have not been involved in nonlinear qpg models such as permeability stress sensitivity chen et al 2019 hupet et al 2005 and non darcian flows cherubini et al 2014 meng et al 2015 geofluid flow in subsurface formations is a nonlinear process dominated by multiple factors nonlinear models that include multiple nonlinear factors will depict transient flow behaviors more realistic 6 multiphase geofluid flow jackson et al 2018 sheng and thompson 2013 has not been involved in nonlinear qpg models in reality many wells produce the mixture of different kinds of geofluids such as the mixture of oil and water in this situation multiphase flow models with the qpg term will be more useful than the single qpg models 7 rate transient analysis is an interesting topic the impact of qpg on rate transients for different types of well in various formation conditions is suggested to be investigated in the future according to the above problems existed in the present work on the nonlinear qpg model there are lots of research works that are needed to be further performed in the future the qpg dominated transient flow behavior in more complicated conditions is expected to be modeled and reported 9 conclusions in this paper a comprehensive review of modeling the qpg dominated transient flow behavior for a well in a confined formation was reported a series of conceptual geofluid flow models for vertical and horizontal wells in ordinary fractured and fractured vuggy formations were comparatively and graphically depicted in detail the corresponding mathematical models with the nonlinear qpg term were established and the general solutions of these vertical and horizontal well models in different formations were obtained the qpg dominated transient flow behaviors in different conditions were comparatively simulated and analyzed by using a series of type curves particular focus on the qualitative and quantitative differences in type curves between the linear and nonlinear models was given model validations and production predictions were also conducted general conclusions of this review are summarized as follows 1 like the linear flow models when a fracture subsystem is assumed as the only pass way to a wellbore the qpg dominated nonlinear flow models for both vertical and horizontal wells in multiple porosity formations have the same expression form of solutions in the laplace space as in a single porosity formation but a different function of f u 2 in comparison with the conventional linear models the same flow regimes can be discerned from the type curves of the nonlinear qpg models 3 except for a pure wellbore storage regime the pressure and its derivative curves of a nonlinear qpg model are obviously lower than those of a conventional linear model with the same model parameter values therefore if we use a conventional linear model to predict the transient pressure we will gain a lager value of production pressure drop than that of using a nonlinear qpg model 4 a pressure derivative curve of a nonlinear model does not conform to the law of a horizontal line of zero slope in an iarf infinite acting radial flow regime and the law of an inclined line of unit slope in a pssf pseudo steady state flow regime controlled by a closed boundary 5 dv and rdv are good tools to quantitatively analyze the differences in type curves between linear and nonlinear models in an iarf regime dv and rdv of pressure and its derivative increase with the elapse of time and in parallel with the coefficient of the qpg term rdv of the pressure derivative is greater than that of pressure at a fixed time fractured vugyy formation parameters such as ω f ω v and λ mf have remarkable impact on rdvs 6 formation property parameters gained via real test interpretations by using the qpg model are more precise than those by using the conventional linear model in the example well interpretations for a 0 0287 value of β the interpretation rdvs of permeability and skin factor are 29 63 and 18 53 respectively 7 neglect of qpg may lead to remarkable errors in production pressure drop prediction the prediction errors may exceed 50 when β 0 01 and may be 2 when β 0 01 in the same formation conditions the prediction error for a horizontal well is far larger than that for a vertical well the prediction errors for oil wells are usually larger than those for water wells an obvious prediction error above 6 may be easily reached for horizontal water wells at a moderate rate production 8 qpg is suggested to be retained in the governing equation especially for a subsurface formation with a high pressure a low permeability a thin thickness a high viscosity of geofluid and a well production injection at a high rate even for low viscous water qpg is of much significance to obtain more precise results in transient pressure predictions 9 the nonlinearity dominated by qpg influences the transient flow behavior of geofluid in confined formations positively and many problems existing in the present work are still pending to be solved therefore the qpg dominated transient flow behavior should be further

linear flow models the solution of a multiple porosity model of both vertical and horizontal wells in laplace space has been proven by many researches corbett et al 2012 nie et al 2012a b sarma and aziz 2006 wu et al 2004 to have the same expression form of solution as a single porosity model and the only difference is the different expression in the function of f u for the qpg dominated flow models for vertical wells in laplace space the solutions of a dual porosity model with the pseudo steady inter porosity flow and a triple porosity model with the unsteady inter porosity flow also have been proven by li et al 2015 nie et al 2009 respectively to have the same expression form as a single porosity model and a different f u by using the same methods as li et al 2015 nie et al 2009 it will be easy to prove that all the qpg dominated flow models for both vertical and horizontal wells presented in this article do have the same expression form and a different f u for a single porosity ordinary formation the function of f u is expressed as eq c 5 for a multiple porosity formation the expressions of f u are as follows 1 for a dual porosity formation fig 3 when the pseudo steady inter

4853,transient flow of geofluids caused by a well production in a subsurface formation is a phenomenon of enormous importance in hydrology geosciences and engineering geofluid transient flow has been proved to be a nonlinear physical process dominated by qpg quadratic pressure gradient much research has indicated that neglecting a qpg term in flow models by assuming small pressure gradients can cause significant errors in predicted pressures despite the existence and importance of qpg limited research on nonlinear qpg models has been performed when compared with the traditional linear flow models on the basis of the previous linear and nonlinear qpg models a comprehensive geofluid flow model for a well in a subsurface formation was established and solved a general solution method for this model and its general solutions were obtained for vertical and horizontal wells in ordinary fractured and fractured vuggy formations next flow regimes and typical transient flow characteristics were thoroughly analyzed by using a series of standard type curves then the differences in type curves between linear and nonlinear qpg models were qualitatively and quantitatively studied afterwards model validations and production predictions were performed this comprehensive model contained various specific modeling situations some modeling situations that were reported in the previous studies were well reviewed in this paper the other previously unreported modelling situations were firstly studied and exhibited in this paper at the end the existing problems pending to be solved were put forward and future work on nonlinear qpg models was suggested this paper is very helpful in understanding the qpg dominated transient flow behavior more profoundly keywords geofluid flow porosity

flow phenomena the transient flow of geofluids e g groundwater and petroleum in subsurface formations e g aquifers and oil bearing layers is of particular importance and interest to hydrologists water scientists fluid mechanics scientists geologists petroleum engineers and related researchers chen et al 2006 mishra et al 2012 pauritsch et al 2015 it was proved to be of nonlinearity dominated by qpg quadratic pressure gradient chen et al 2001 finjord 1990 giachetti and maroscia 2008 liang et al 2001 marshall 2009 the governing equation of liquid flow in porous media derived according to darcy s law and the principle of mass conservation essentially contains a nonlinear qpg term guo and nie 2013 gave a detailed derivation process of the governing equation with the qpg term in the traditional linear flow models the qpg term in their governing equations was directly ignored by assuming small pressure gradients and small compressibility of geofluids in formations to simplify these equations for research convenience however such a simplification can cause significant differences or errors in predicted pressures and pressure solutions between nonlinear and linear models braeuning et al 1998 claimed that an assumption of small pressure gradients can cause significant errors during certain operations such as large drawdown flows and large pressure pulse testing chakrabarty et al 1993a pointed out that a maximum relative error can be of the order of 10 cao et al 2004 concluded that a relative difference in long time pressure solutions reached about 8 guo and nie 2013 performed well test interpretations for a real petroleum well by using their qpg model and compared the interpretation results with those using a conventional linear model they found that relative differences in the parameter values of formation permeability a well skin factor and external boundary distance were 18 53 29 63 and 10 38 respectively in fact differences or errors caused by qpg are not a constant but differ with different formation properties fluid properties and production operations braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a jelmert and vik 1996 odeh and babu 1998 wang and dusseault 1991 generally the differences or errors increase with the elapse of time an increase in a production injection rate and geofluid viscosity and compressibility and a decrease in formation permeability and thickness braeuning et al 1998 chen and zhang 2009 guo and nie 2013 lu et al 2015 wang et al 2013 except for groundwater and petroleum in the past gas transport in subsurface formations aroused many particular concerns and researches in hydrological sciences for example subsurface gas flow to a barometric pumping well was modeled in a single zone you et al 2010 or a multilayer unsaturated zone you et al 2011a in addition induced gas flow in the unsaturated zone you et al 2011b and tide induced airflow in a layered unsaturated zone li et al 2011 2012a were also well investigated furthermore other researches related to subsurface gas transport were available such as air permeability determination for unsaturated zones li et al 2012b soil vapor extraction you and zhan 2012 and diffusive and advective fluxes of gas phase vocs volatile organic compounds you and zhan 2013 these researches did not touch upon the nonlinear gas flow issue sometimes gas flow in subsurface formations also shows nonlinearity especially in high pressure deep formations guo and nie 2013 derived a nonlinear governing equation of gas flow through subsurface porous media via an equation of state of real gas which was the equation of state of ideal gas amended by a gas compressibility factor the derived governing equation includes a nonlinear term that contains a quadratic derivative term of pressure square because the governing equation of gas flow can be linearized by a gas pseudo pressure function guo and nie 2013 the qpg issue of gas flow was rarely studied in the past recently kumar and govindarajan 2020 derived the qpg dominated governing equation of gas flow in high pressure fractured formations by assuming the parameter group of p μ gf z to be a constant under high pressure conditions thus the qpg dominated governing equation of gas flow is completely the same as that of liquid flow kumar and govindarajan 2020 established and solved a one dimensional qpg model for gas flow in a high pressure fractured formation at present more complex gas flow models with respect to qpg have not been found many publications are available about the research on nonlinear qpg models of liquid flow early in 1989 a steady state flow qpg model for a vertical well was presented finjord and aadnoy 1989 later a transient flow qpg model for a vertical well in a single porosity formation was established and solved through variable modifications cao et al 2004 chakrabarty et al 1993a b jelmert and vik 1996 odeh and babu 1998 wang and dusseault 1991 and a special variable rate well test by using this qpg model was studied braeuning et al 1998 afterwards more complicated qpg models for a vertical well were established and solved such as a fractal qpg model tong and wang 2005 a spherical flow qpg model nie and ding 2010 and a transient flow qpg model for a dual porosity formation bai and roegiers 1994 bai et al 1994 li et al 2015 and a multiple zone composite formation wang et al 2013 then a transient flow qpg model for a horizontal well in a single porosity formation lu et al 2015 one dimensional and radial qpg models with a consideration of a moving boundary in a low permeability formation liu and yao 2015 liu et al 2016 and a one dimensional qpg model of fluid in a vertical hydraulic fracture abbasi et al 2017 were established and solved a transient flow qpg model of a multiple fractured horizontal well ren and guo 2017 was also studied recently ren et al 2019 conducted an application of a modified blasingame production analysis by using a nonlinear qpg model for a vertical well abbasi et al 2019 modeled a transient shape factor with a consideration of qpg in fractured reservoirs definitely more complex qpg models and other related topic research with a consideration of qpg are the current research trends about qpg based on the solutions of nonlinear qpg models we can plot a series of transient pressure curves to analyze the transient flow behavior of geofluids in subsurface formations braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a b guo and nie 2013 especially the standard bi logarithmic type curves of pressure and pressure derivatives with respect to time are the most convenient to recognize the flow regimes and analyze the transient flow characteristics corbett et al 2012 wang et al 2018 different well types and different formation types produce different transient flow behaviors the common well types are vertical wells and horizontal wells the common formation types are ordinary single porosity fractured dual porosity and fractured vuggy triple porosity formations cherubini et al 2014 huang and goltz 2015 ruiz constán et al 2018 vanderzalm et al 2013 for dual porosity and triple porosity formations there exists the inter porosity flow of geofluids between different media de swaan 1976 warren and root 1963 three kinds of inter porosity flow patterns pseudo steady unsteady and mixed also produce different transient flow behaviors nie et al 2011 2012b table 1 listed the present research status about linear models and nonlinear qpg models for vertical and horizontal wells in different formations when considering different inter porosity flow patterns we listed 6 situations see column 4 in table 1 that can be separately considered in model studies for a vertical well in the three types of formations the linear models in situations ① ⑥ have been researched see column 5 in table 1 but the nonlinear qpg models were studied only in situations ① ② and ⑤ see column 6 in table 1 for a horizontal well in the three types of formations the linear models in situations ① ② and ④ have been reported see column 7 in table 1 but only a nonlinear qpg model in situation ① was available see the last column in table 1 obviously at present vertical well models are more abundant than horizontal well models and linear models are far more abundant than nonlinear qpg models therefore the main tasks of this paper are to 1 conduct a critical review on the present research status of flow models and then newly report the other unreported situations in table 1 for vertical and horizontal wells in ordinary fractured and fractured vuggy formations 2 conduct an integrated review on the definition and significance of qpg 3 on the basis of the previous research on linear and nonlinear qpg models establish a comprehensive geofluid flow model for a well in a subsurface formation with separate considerations of situations ① ⑥ in table 1 4 develop a general method for this model and its general solutions 5 plot a series of standard type curves for transient flow behavior analyses 6 analyze flow regimes and typical transient flow characteristics in different situations using type curves 7 make qualitative and quantitative comparisons between linear and nonlinear qpg models 8 validate the nonlinear qpg models and predict production pressure drops and 9 put forward the existing problems and suggestions for future work this paper will help in understanding qpg dominated transient flow behaviors for wells in subsurface formations more profoundly 2 qpg definition and significance when single phase fluid flow in an isothermal porous formation obeys darcy s law and fluid density depends exponentially on pore pressure the derived governing equation includes a nonlinear term that is the second power of pressure gradient the second power is called qpg quadratic pressure gradient and the nonlinear term is called the qpg term as shown fig a 1 the governing equation with the qpg term for liquid flow in subsurface porous media was deduced in detail by many publications wang and dusseault 1991 guo and nie 2013 liu et al 2016 abbasi et al 2019 and omitted here by assuming a small pressure gradient and a small fluid compressibility in porous media to ignore the qpg term the nonlinear governing equation is reduced to the conventional linear governing equation therefore the linear equation is an approximation and simplification of the nonlinear qpg equation in fact fluid flow in porous media is a complex nonlinear process as a matter of fact nonlinear qpg models have a self validation property because they are automatically validated by comparisons in the pressure curves with the conventional linear models by setting the qpg coefficient β as zero guo and nie 2013 liu et al 2016 in addition a geofluid flow model with the nonlinear qpg equation can be validated via a comparison with a numerical simulation abbasi et al 2019 did a model validation for a one dimensional flow in a homogenous and isotropic porous media via a comparison with a numerical simulation see fig 1 the pressure transients of the analytical model showed a very good agreement with those of the numerical simulation as shown in fig 1 especially for gas flow in subsurface porous media when the equation of state of real gas is considered as the equation of state of ideal gas amended by a gas compressibility factor the derived governing equation also includes a nonlinear term that contains a quadratic derivative term of pressure square see fig a 1 in appendix a it is interesting that the nonlinear governing equation of gas can be linearized by a gas pseudo pressure function ψ guo and nie 2013 which is defined as ψ p 0 p p μ gf z d p see fig a 1 in appendix a therefore the qpg issue was not specially mentioned in the past under high pressure conditions the parameter group of p μ gf z in the definition of ψ can be deemed as a constant kumar and govindarajan 2020 so the gas pseudo pressure function can be reduced to a pure pressure function that is completely the same as that of liquid flow under low pressure conditions the nonlinear gas flow issue can easily be addressed by introducing the gas pseudo pressure function to conveniently solve the governing equation a group of dimensionless parameters is defined the nonlinear qpg term in the dimensionless governing equation contains a dimensionless coefficient β that is a function of fluid compressibility c gf fluid viscosity μ gf well production injection rate q formation permeability k and thickness h because pressure gradient depends on the flow environment of fluid in formations μ gf k h etc and q the impact of the dimensional qpg term is completely converted to that of β β is usually in the range of 0 001 to 0 1 the impact of β on pressure transients is very obvious when β 0 01 and relatively weak when β 0 01 for a subsurface formation with a high pressure a low permeability a thin thickness a high viscosity of geofluid and a large production injection rate the value of β may usually exceed 0 01 in this situation neglect of qpg in the governing equation will lead to remarkable errors in production pressure drop predictions and formation parameter interpretations the prediction errors of production pressure drop may exceed 50 in some special conditions on the contrary qpg can be ignored when β 0 01 in engineering applications because the prediction errors may be less than 2 in real applications for most groundwater flow problems the groundwater density is a constant so the qpg dominated flow does not prevail however under enormous pressure variation conditions such as large pressure drawdown tests and large rates caused by a water well production from a deep formation or a water well injection into a formation especially by a horizontal well the errors by ignoring the nonlinear qpg term in the flow equation are remarkable compared with groundwater flow in the past the qpg dominated petroleum flow was prevailing because petroleum is easier to compress than water unquestionably the qpg dominated gas flow should be most worthy of attention owing to the strong compressibility of gas the main pros and cons of qpg are generalized in fig a 1 no matter pros or cons it is a fact that the nonlinear qpg equation is more precise than the conventional linear equation in predicting pressure transients in the following sections we will exhibit how β affects pressure transients positively in theoretical analyses and real case applications 3 conceptual geofluid flow modeling 3 1 a well production in a confined formation single phase geofluid such as groundwater and petroleum is assumed to be extracted using a single vertical well or a single horizontal well at a constant production rate in a confined formation e g aquifer petroleum layer geofluid flow in the confined formation conforms to darcy s law and fluid gravity is ignored the confined formation is assumed to be horizontal and of equal thickness the top and bottom interfaces of the confined formation with the confining beds are impermeable the external boundary of the confined formation in the horizontal plane may be infinite or closed or of constant pressure before well production pressure is uniformly distributed in formation the conceptual geofluid flow diagram is shown in fig 2 it is noted that fluids may be injected through a well into subsurface formations if we use a negative rate q to substitute the production rate q we can obtain the model of injection wells 3 2 conceptual multiple porosity media in a confined formation three common formation types are considered the first type is the single porosity formation which is the ordinary formation without fractures and vugs the second type is the dual porosity formation which is composed of natural fracture and matrix the dual porosity formation is also called as the naturally fractured formation altinörs and önder 2008 cherubini et al 2014 huang and goltz 2015 önder 1998 the third type is the triple porosity formation which is composed of natural fracture vug and matrix the triple porosity formation is also called as the naturally fractured vuggy formation such as some carbonate formation fan et al 2011 ruiz constán et al 2018 vanderzalm et al 2013 fig 3 shows the conceptual diagram of dual porosity media in a fractured formation the formation system consists of fracture and matrix subsystems there exists the inter porosity flow of geofluid from matrix to fracture subsystems two assumptions on the geometric shape of matrix blocks are considered one is the arbitrary shape see fig 3a and the other is the spherical see fig 3b the arbitrary shape matrix blocks nie et al 2012b warren and root 1963 and the spherical matrix blocks de swaan 1976 nie et al 2012b are used for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern respectively the pseudo steady inter porosity flow hypothesizes equal pressure in matrix subsystem at any time that is to say the pressure in matrix subsystem is independent of coordinate location but a function of time the unsteady inter porosity flow means that the pressures everywhere in matrix subsystem are not equal that is to say the pressure in matrix subsystem is a function of time and coordinate location fig 4 shows the conceptual diagram of triple porosity media in a fractured vuggy formation the formation system consists of fracture vug and matrix subsystems there exist the inter porosity flows of geofluid from matrix to fracture subsystems and from vug to fracture subsystems the inter porosity flow between matrix and vug subsystems is assumed negligible the same geometric shape assumptions as matrix blocks in dual porosity media above arbitrary shape vugs and spherical vugs are also considered for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern respectively three situations about inter porosity flows for matrix and vug subsystems are considered one is the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern for matrix and vug subsystems fig 4a another is the mixed inter flow pattern that means the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern for matrix subsystem and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern for vug subsystem fig 4b the other is the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern for matrix and vug subsystems fig 4c especially additional assumptions are needed for the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern matrix blocks and vugs are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the formation nie et al 2011 2012b every matrix block has the same spherical radius noted as r 1 see fig 3b and every vug has the same spherical radius noted as r 2 see fig 4b the pressure distribution in matrix block or vug is spherically symmetric geofluid flows from the center of matrix blocks or vugs into fractures and the pressure at the spherical surface of matrix blocks or vugs equals to the fracture pressure 3 3 conceptual flow routes of geofluid in a confined formation fig 5 shows the conceptual diagram flow routes of geofluid for a well in different formations it is usually supposed that fracture permeability is larger than vug permeability and vug permeability is larger than matrix permeability therefore for both fractured and fractured vuggy formations the medium directly connected with the wellbore is assumed as the fracture subsystem liu et al 2003 wu et al 2004 the outflow geofluid from the vug and matrix subsystems is both towards the fracture subsystem the inter porosity flow from the vug subsystem is prior to that from the matrix subsystem because the vug permeability is larger than matrix permeability corbett et al 2012 nie et al 2012a wu et al 2011 4 mathematical model for a well in a confined formation 4 1 coordinate system for a vertical well model a radial coordinate r with the coordinate origin at the center of the vertical wellbore in the horizontal plane is needed guo and nie 2013 li et al 2015 for a horizontal well model except a radial coordinate r with the coordinate origin at the center of the horizontal wellbore in the horizontal plane fig 6 a a perpendicular coordinate z with the coordinate origin from the bottom boundary in the vertical plane is also needed fig 6b and c and the perpendicular distance of the horizontal wellbore to the bottom boundary is noted as z w guo et al 2012 lu et al 2015 nie et al 2012a 4 2 qpg dominated mathematical model for a

horizontal well in a fractured formation fig 3 and fig 5c or a fractured vuggy formation fig 4 and fig 5d for example by putting the substituted fourth and fifth terms into eq 2 we can gain the governing equation for a horizontal well in a dual porosity formation with the consideration of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern 26 2 p fd r d 2 1 r d p fd r d β p fd r d 2 1 h d 2 2 p fd

external boundary conditions for a vertical well are different from a horizontal well a point source condition at constant rate production can be employed in the modeling of a horizontal well 27 lim r d 0 r d p j d r d 1 j m f for a horizontal well except the external formation boundary in horizontal plane that can be described by eqs 18 20 the top and bottom boundary in vertical plane fig 6 must

terms in the governing equations eqs 1 2 4 6 9 11 12 14 25 and 26 the mathematical model will become a conventional linear mathematical model for a well in a confined formation the definitions and units of all the parameters in the above mathematical model are shown in the sections of nomenclature and appendix b the model solutions are shown in appendix c 5 transient flow behavior in a confined formation 5 1 transient flow behavior of a vertical well 1 for a single porosity formation the transient pressure is the response of the transient flow of geofluid in a formation fig 7 shows the transient pressure curves when the well skin factor s is equal to 0 and the dimensionless wellbore storage coefficient c d is equal to 1000 for a vertical well in a single porosity formation in fig 7 curve ① is the pressure curve of the conventional linear model and curves ② ④ are the pressure curves of nonlinear qpg model when the coefficient of qpg term β is equal to 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 respectively it can be seen from fig 7 that there exists obvious difference in transient pressure between linear and nonlinear models and the pressure curve of the nonlinear model is lower than that of the linear model according to the definition of dimensionless pressure see appendix b a lower pressure curve means a smaller production pressure drop of the vertical well in a single porosity formation therefore if we use the conventional linear model to predict the transient pressure we will gain a lager value of production pressure drop than that of using the nonlinear qpg model fig 8 shows the semi logarithmic curves of pressure transients in the same model parameter values as fig 7 it can be seen from fig 8 that the curves in the late time take on a linear line with a slope which indicates the iarf infinite acting radial flow regime braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a 1993b in comparison with the curves fig 7 and the semi logarithmic curves fig 8 the standard bi logarithmic type curves of pressure and pressure derivatives shown in fig 9 are more convenient to recognize the flow regimes and analyze the transient flow characteristics corbett et al 2012 wang et al 2018 wang and yi 2017 2018 an entire flow process can easily be discerned from figs 9 and 10 i regime i is the pure wellbore storage regime slope of pressure and the pressure derivative both equal one there are no differences in type curves between the linear and nonlinear models because the geofluid in the formation does not start to flow in this regime ii regime ii is the wellbore storage and skin effect regime shape of the derivative curve is a hump the nonlinearity of geofluid flow positively influences the pressure transients a larger c d and a larger s will lead to a higher hump shape braeuning et al 1998 guo and nie 2013 iii regime iii is the iarf infinite acting radial flow regime the most obvious differences between the linear and nonlinear models are shown in this regime for the conventional linear model the logarithmic value of pressure derivatives is equal to 0 5 and the pressure derivative curve locates at a horizontal line see the 0 5 line in fig 9 however the pressure derivative curve of the nonlinear model does not conform to the 0 5 line law also called the law of a horizontal line of zero slope corbett et al 2012 guo and nie 2013 nie et al 2012a as time elapses the pressure derivative curves gradually deviate from the 0 5 line a larger β results in a lager curve deviation of the nonlinear model from the linear model see curves ② ④ in fig 9 iv regime iv is the boundary controlled regime for a constant pressure boundary the pressure derivative curves go down and ultimately converge at a point and at this time the transient flow becomes a ssf steady state flow for a closed boundary the pressure derivative curves go up and ultimately become an inclined line with a slope and at this time the transient flow becomes a pssf pseudo steady state flow the slope of the inclined line is just equal to one also called the law of an inclined line of unit slope for the conventional linear model and slightly smaller than one for the nonlinear qpg model corbett et al 2012 guo and nie 2013 nie et al 2012a a farther boundary distance to the well will cause a delay of the boundary response in conclusion except for the pure wellbore storage regime the type curves in the other regimes are affected by the coefficient of qpg term β the curves of the nonlinear model gradually deviate from those of the linear model with the elapse of time the deviation of pressure derivative curve is more obvious than that of pressure curve for the same β a larger β means a stronger nonlinearity on the type curves 2 for a dual porosity formation fig 3 and fig 5a figs 11 and 12 show the standard type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a vertical well in an infinite fractured formation the same four flow regimes can easily be discerned from figs 11 and 12 regimes i ii are the same as those in a single porosity formation regime iii is the inter porosity flow regime of matrix to fracture subsystems regime iii is the iarf regime of the total formation system in regime iii the pressure derivative curves are concave which is the typical characteristic of a dual porosity media for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern the concave curves are v shaped al ghamdi and ershaghi 1996 corbett et al 2012 for the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern the concave curves are flatter nie et al 2012b the concave curves are dominated by the capacitance coefficients of fracture and matrix subsystems ω f and ω m and the inter porosity flow factor of matrix to fracture subsystems λ mf a larger λ mf than 10 6 will make the concaves in figs 11 and 12 move left and a larger ω m than 0 9 will make the concaves deeper corbett et al 2012 nie et al 2012a 2012b in figs 11 and 12 curves ① are the type curves of the conventional linear model and curves ② and ③ are the type curves of nonlinear qpg model when the coefficient of qpg term β is equal to 0 01 and 0 05 respectively as shown in figs 11 and 12 the type curves of the nonlinear model deviate from those of the linear model the dual porosity model has the same boundary controlled regime as the single porosity model in the following we will not exhibit the type curves in the boundary controlled regime 3 for a triple porosity formation fig 4 and fig 5b figs 13 15 show the standard type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow the mixed inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a vertical well in an infinite fractured vuggy formation the same five flow regimes can easily be discerned from figs 13 15 regimes i ii v are the same as those in a fractured formation regimes iii and iv are the inter porosity flow regimes of vug to fracture subsystems and matrix to fracture subsystems respectively there are two concaves in the pressure derivative curves which is the typical characteristic of a triple porosity media the first concave on the left is dominated by the capacitance coefficients of fracture and vug subsystems ω f and ω v and the inter porosity flow factor of vug to fracture subsystems λ vf the second concave on the right is dominated by the capacitance coefficients of fracture and matrix subsystems ω f and ω m and the inter porosity flow factor of matrix to fracture subsystems λ mf a larger λ vf than 10 6 will make the first concaves in figs 13 15 move left and a larger ω v than 0 15 will make the first concaves deeper a larger λ mf than 10 8 will make the second concaves in figs 13 15 move left and a larger ω m than 0 84 will make the second concaves deeper probably a larger λ mf can result in misshapen concaves when the inter porosity flow of marix to fracture subsystems starts before the inter porosity flow of vug to fracture subsystems has finished guo et al 2012 for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern the two concaves are v shaped for the mixed inter porosity flow pattern the first concave on the left is flat and the second concave on the right is v shaped for the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern the two concaves are flat the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern leads to a v shaped concave and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern leads to a flat concave in figs 13 15 curves ① are the type curves of the linear model and curves ② and ③ are the type curves of nonlinear qpg model the influence of the coefficient of qpg term on the type curves for the fractured vuggy formation is similar to that for the ordinary fractured formation 5 2 transient flow behavior of a horizontal well 1 for a single porosity formation fig 16 shows the type curves for a horizontal well in an infinite formation without a consideration of wellbore storage effect curves ① in fig 16 are the type curves of the conventional linear model and curves ② ④ in fig 16 are the type curves of the nonlinear qpg model three main flow regimes can be observed i regime i is the early vertical radial flow regime the first radial flow regime geofluid in the formation radially flows into the horizontal wellbore in the vertical plane and the streamlines are orthogonal to the axis of the horizontal wellbore lu et al 2015 nie et al 2012a as shown in fig 17 a the type curves in this regime are controlled by skin factor s formation thickness h perpendicular distance of wellbore to the formation bottom z w and the ratio of horizontal permeability to perpendicular permeability k h k p in theory the pressure derivative curve of the conventional linear model in this regime is absolutely horizontal when k h k p is equal to one nie et al 2012a a larger thickness will cause a longer duration of this regime for a very thin formation it is hard to observe this regime from the type curves ii regime ii is the mid horizontal linear flow regime after the pressure wave caused by the horizontal well production reaches to the top and bottom boundaries the early vertical radial regime ends and the mid horizontal linear flow starts in this regime geofluid in the formation linearly flows into the horizontal wellbore in the horizontal plane and the streamlines are parallel lines and orthogonal to the axis of the horizontal wellbore lu et al 2015 nie et al 2012a as shown in fig 17b the pressure derivative curve in this regime takes on an inclined straight line the type curves in this regime are mainly controlled by horizontal well length l a longer horizontal length directly results in a longer duration of this linear flow regime iv regime iii is the late horizontal pseudo radial flow the first radial flow regime in this regime the geofluid in the area far away from the horizontal wellbore pseudo radially flows into the area near the horizontal wellbore as shown in fig 17c the characteristics of type curves in the pseudo radial flow regime of the horizontal well model are similar to those in the radial flow regime of the vertical well model the pressure derivative curves of the conventional linear horizontal well model converged to 0 5 line see curve ① in fig 16 the pressure derivative curves of the nonlinear horizontal well model do not conform to the 0 5 line law and they are located down the 0 5 line and are slightly inclined instead of horizontal see curves ② ④ in fig 16 in a word the differences in type curves associated with the linear and nonlinear models increase with the increase of the coefficient of qpg term and the elapse of time 2 for a dual porosity formation fig 3 and fig 5c figs 18 and 19 show the type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a horizontal well in an infinite fractured formation without a consideration of wellbore storage effect compared with the type curves of an infinite single porosity formation fig 16 after the mid horizontal linear flow regime an additional inter porosity flow regime of matrix to fracture subsystems can be discerned from figs 18 and 19 the pressure derivative curves have a v shaped concave fig 18 and a flat concave fig 19 for the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern and the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern respectively a larger ω m than 0 9 will make the concaves deeper a larger λ mf than 10 9 will make the concave move left and probably result in a misshapen concave and a shorter inclined straight line of the pressure derivative curve in the mid horizontal linear flow regime and in this situation it means that the inter porosity flow starts before the linear flow regime has finished guo et al 2012 figs 18 and 19 also apparently show the strong influence of the coefficient of qpg term on the type curves 3 for a triple porosity formation fig 4 and fig 5d figs 20 22 show the type curves of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow the mixed inter porosity flow and the unsteady inter porosity flow respectively for a horizontal well in an infinite fractured vuggy formation compared with the type curves of an infinite single porosity formation fig 16 after the mid horizontal linear flow regime two additional inter porosity flow regimes can be discerned from figs 20 22 the first concave on the left is the response of vug to fracture subsystems and the second concave on the right is the response of matrix to fracture subsystems just like the triple porosity model of vertical well the type curves of the triple porosity model of horizontal well are still controlled by the model parameters of ω f ω v ω m λ vf λ mf and β in the same way 5 3 quantitative analysis of nonlinear influence dv and rdv can be employed to show the quantitative differences between type curves guo and nie 2013 lu et al 2015 30 dv value of linear model value of nonlinear model 31 rdv dv value of linear model 100 where dv is the differential value between linear model and nonlinear model and rdv is the relative differential value between linear model and nonlinear model 1 quantitative analysis for the single porosity model of a vertical well table 2 shows the quantitative differences of nonlinear influence on the type curves of a vertical well in a single porosity formation for β 0 01 the pressure values and the pressure derivative values in table 2 are corresponding to curves ① and ② in fig 9 the table shows that dimensionless pressure and its derivative differ between the linear and nonlinear models for example when t d c d 103 dv and rdv of pressure are 0 2504 and 3 43 respectively and dv and rdv of pressure derivative are 0 0351 and 6 91 respectively the rdv of the pressure derivative 6 91 is greater than that of pressure 3 43 at a fixed time t d c d 103 fig 23 a and 23b are rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively for a vertical well in a single porosity formation except for the pure wellbore storage regime regime i in fig 9 rdv of pressure increase over time fig 23a in the infinite acting radial flow regime regime iii in fig 9 rdv of pressure derivative increase over time fig 23b in the wellbore storage and skin effect regime regime ii in fig 9 rdv of pressure derivative increases first and then decreases owing to the wellbore storage effect braeuning et al 1998 chakrabarty et al 1993a it can be observed from fig 9 that rdvs of pressure and pressure derivative increase in parallel with β in general qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the nonlinearity dominated by qpg influences the transient flow behavior of geofluid in a confined formation positively the nonlinear qpg models are more accurate than the conventional linear models to portrait the transient flow behavior of geofluid in confined formations 2 quantitative analysis for the single porosity model of a horizontal well table 3 shows the quantitative differences of nonlinear influence on the type curves of a horizontal well in a single porosity formation for β 0 01 the pressure values and the pressure derivative values in table 3 are corresponding to curves ① and ② in fig 16 the table shows that dimensionless pressure and its derivative differ between the linear and nonlinear models when t d c d 105 rdvs of pressure and pressure derivative are 4 64 and 6 16 respectively fig 24 a and 24b are rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively for a horizontal well in a single porosity formation it can be seen from fig 24 that rdvs increase over time and in parallel with β 3 quantitative analysis with the effect of fractured formation parameters here we take the vertical well model with a consideration of the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern as an example to demonstrate the effect of fractured formation parameters λ mf ω f ω m on the calculated rdvs by setting s 0 c d 1 ω f 0 1 and ω m 0 9 we simulated the type curves dominated by λ mf 10 5 and λ mf 10 6 β 0 and β 0 05 respectively for a vertical well in a dual porosity formation as shown in fig 25 a we also calculated the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative as shown in fig 25b it can be seen from fig 25b that the rdv curves of pressure derivative take on an inclined concave in the inter porosity flow regime rdv curves for λ mf 10 5 and λ mf 10 6 differ only in the inter porosity flow regime fig 26 a and b show the type curves dominated by different ω f ω m and β and the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively rdv curves for ω f 0 2 and ω m 0 8 and ω f 0 1 and ω m 0 9 differ not only in the inter porosity flow regime but also in the skin effect and early fracture flow regimes a larger ω f means a larger amount of geofluid stored in the fracture subsystem accordingly the supply ability of geofluid from the fracture subsystem to the wellbore is relatively stronger for a larger ω f for the same rate production the flow speed of geofluid and the pressure gradient in the fracture subsystem with a larger ω f are lower than those with a smaller ω f a larger pressure gradient makes the nonlinearity of qpg more intense and results in larger rdvs therefore the rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative for ω f 0 2 are below those for ω f 0 1 in the skin effect and fracture flow regimes 4 quantitative analysis with the effect of fractured vuggy formation parameters the effect of λ mf and λ vf on the calculated rdvs for a triple porosity formation is similar to that of λ mf for a dual porosity formation here we only demonstrate the effect of ω f ω v and ω m on the calculated rdvs to better investigate the effect of ω v and eliminate the effect of ω f by setting ω f 0 01 we simulated the type curves dominated by ω v 0 15 ω m 0 84 and ω v 0 3 ω m 0 69 β 0 and β 0 05 respectively as shown in fig 27 a we also calculated the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative as shown in fig 27b it can be seen from fig 27b that the rdv curves of pressure derivative take on two inclined concaves in the inter porosity flow regimes of vug to fracture subsystems and matrix to fracture subsystems respectively rdv curves dominated by ω v and ω m differ only in the inter porosity flow regimes because vug permeability is far larger than matrix permeability rdv curves are more sensitive to ω v than ω m therefore it can be seen from fig 27b that the differences in rdv curves in the inter porosity flow regime of vug to fracture subsystems are more obvious than those in the inter porosity flow regime of matrix to fracture subsystems fig 28 a and b show the type curves dominated by different ω f ω v ω m and β and the corresponding rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative respectively rdv curves for ω f 0 1 ω v 0 2 and ω m 0 7 and ω f 0 01 ω v 0 15 and ω m 0 84 are different in all the flow regimes except the pure wellbore storage and infinite acting radial flow regimes the rdv curves of pressure and pressure derivative for ω f 0 1 are below those for ω f 0 01 in the skin effect and early fracture flow regimes because fracture permeability is assumed to be larger than vug permeability and far larger than matrix permeability rdv curves are more sensitive to ω f than ω v and ω v than ω m therefore it can be seen from fig 28b that the differences in rdv curves in the early fracture flow regime are more obvious than those in the inter porosity flow regimes 6 model validation via a real case application guo and nie 2013 did well test interpretations on the pressure buildup testing data of a vertical oil well in a sandstone reservoir with an edge water drive the formation thickness is 3 m the porosity is 0 21 the compressibility of formation rock is 0 0038 mpa 1 the oil compressibility is 0 0034 mpa 1 the oil viscosity is 20 08 mpa s the oil volume factor is 1 089 the well radius is 0 062 m and the production rate of the well before shutting in is 24 5 m3 d the dimensionless matching curves and the dimensional matching curves from well test interpretations are shown in fig 29 the nonlinear qpg model and the conventional linear model for a vertical well in an ordinary formation were used in the well test interpretations it can be seen from fig 29 that the curve matching effects by using the two models are satisfactory in all the flow regimes which are consistent with fig 10 the interpretation results are shown in table 4 the rdv of c s is zero because wellbore pressure is not affected by qpg in the pure wellbore storage regime the rdvs of s k m and r e are 29 63 18 53 and 10 38 respectively the coefficient β is 0 0287 the interpretation results by using the qpg model are more precise than those by using the linear model because the linear model is a simplification and approximation of the qpg model 7 probable β value and production prediction 7 1 probable β value according to β definition β q b gf μ gf c gf 2 π k hm h it is proportional to well production rate q geofluid viscosity μ gf and inversely proportional to formation permeability k m and formation thickness h a larger production rate in a lager pressure drop causes a larger β formations with low permeability heavy oil or thin thickness have a larger β causing the influence of nonlinearity to be more intense for these formations based on the parameter values of the above example well from guo and nie 2013 we calculated a group of probable β values by changing the parameter values of k m h μ gf and q as shown in table 5 in the table case ① is the example well data cases ⑥ and ⑦ can be deemed as water wells because μ gf and c gf are 1 mpa s and 0 00044 mpa 1 respectively in the same formation the β value of a horizontal well is surely larger than that of a vertical well simply because a horizontal well usually has a larger production rate than a vertical well cases ② and ⑥ can be deemed as a horizontal well production at a rate of 86 5 m3 d and 150 m3 d respectively 7 2 production prediction 1 production pressure drop prediction for a vertical oil well by assuming an infinite boundary we simulated a vertical oil well production for case ① in table 5 to predict production pressure drop δp with the elapse of time t the production pressure drop curves with units are shown in fig 30 the figure shows the same nonlinear trend as the theoretical model figures see figs 7 9 and 23 the rdvs of the predicted pressure drops increase with the elapse of time it can be seen from fig 30d that the rdv of δp is smaller than 5 within 100 h and can reach up to 10 beyond 106h usually too large pressure drop is not realistic for low pressure formations because the production pressure drop must below the formation pressure therefore for a well production at a small rate in a low pressure oil reservoir the prediction error produced by using the conventional linear model can be ignored in engineering applications however for a low pressure formation fluids can be injected through an injection well into the formation at a large rate in this situation the use of the conventional linear model undoubtedly will cause noteworthy errors in pressure drop predictions of fluid injection in addition for a high pressure formation a well production may easily cause a large pressure drop so the qpg term should be considered in large pressure drop predictions recent years many ultra high pressure formations were found for example in the central graben of the north sea that is a prolific hydrocarbon province the formation pressures in egret heron and skua fields stricker et al 2016 are 85 6 86 8 mpa 86 8 mpa and 63 7 66 8 mpa respectively definitely the use of the conventional linear models in such ultra high pressure formations will cause conspicuous errors 2 production pressure drop prediction for a horizontal oil well by assuming a 100 m horizontal length and a zero skin factor we also simulated a horizontal oil well production for case ② in table 5 as shown in fig 31 the rdv of δp exceeds 10 at t 0 3 h 30 at t 1000 h and 40 at t 106h compared with fig 30 fig 31 shows very large rdvs in production pressure drop predictions during the production period therefore in the same formation the application of the conventional linear model in horizontal wells will cause far greater errors than that in vertical wells 3 production pressure drop prediction for a vertical water well by assuming s 0 and c d 1 c s 0 02 m3 mpa we simulated a vertical water well production for case ⑦ in table 5 as shown in fig 32 the rdv of δp is smaller than 2 during the production period especially for a short production time within 100 h the rdv of δp is smaller than 0 4 the rdvs of the water well are smaller than those of the oil well of case ① mainly because the compressibility of water is smaller than that of oil therefore the prediction error produced by using the conventional linear model can be ignored in engineering applications 4 production pressure drop prediction for a horizontal water well by assuming a 100 m horizontal length and a zero skin factor we also simulated a horizontal water well production for case ⑥ in table 5 as shown in fig 33 the rdv of δp exceeds 2 at t 2 h 3 5 at t 1000 h and 6 at t 106h compared with fig 32 fig 33 shows relatively large rdvs in production pressure drop predictions a longer horizontal well may be put into production at a larger rate rdv may be larger for a longer horizontal well because it is proportional to well production rate therefore the prediction error caused by using the conventional linear model is advised not to be neglected for horizontal water wells at a large rate production especially for long horizontal wells 8 problems and future work based on the previous research work and the newly reported work in this article the following problems are still pending to be solved 1 the wellbore storage effect has not been considered in nonlinear qpg models of a horizontal well in confined formations the wellbore storage effect is defined immediately after a production start up or shut in when the pressure behavior at early times is dominated by the compressibility and volume of the wellbore fluid the wellbore storage effect is a phenomenon of objective existence for a well production from subsurface formations like qpg flow models with a consideration of the wellbore storage effect will predict the transient pressure behavior at the bottom of a well more precise in the conventional linear model of a horizontal well at a constant rate production by using duhamel s principle debnath 2012 nie et al 2012a ozkan and raghavan 1991a 1991b the wellbore storage factor can be considered by 32 p wd p sd 1 c d u 2 p sd where p wd is the response of a well with storage in laplace space p sd is the response of a well without storage in laplace space the wellbore storage effect of a horizontal well is more obvious than that of a vertical well because the wellbore volume of a horizontal well is larger than that of a vertical well the wellbore storage effect should be considered in horizontal well models however duhamel s principle is used to solve linear inhomogeneous differential equations debnath 2012 instead of nonlinear differential equations therefore at present it is a challenge of how to solve a nonlinear qpg model of a horizontal well with the consideration of wellbore storage factor 2 more complex model assumptions that were successfully considered in conventional linear models have not been considered in nonlinear qpg models for fractured and fractured vuggy formations at present only the single permeability flow situation that the fracture subsystem is assumed as the only pass way of geofluid into wellbore has been considered in nonlinear qpg models for fractured and fractured vuggy formations the dual permeability flow situation camacho velázquez et al 2005 guo et al 2012 that geofluid in both matrix and fracture subsystems simultaneously flows into wellbore has not been considered the solution of the conventional linear model with a dual permeability flow assumption is more complicated than that with a single permeability flow assumption and it has not the same expression form as a single porosity model and a different f u therefore solving a nonlinear qpg model with a dual permeability flow assumption will be a hard work in addition discrete fractures gläser et al 2017 kozuskanich et al 2012 weir 1999 have not been used in nonlinear qpg models dual permeability flow of geofluids and discrete fracture distribution in fractured formations are accord with the practical situation 3 more formation types have not been considered in nonlinear qpg models such as multi layered formation riva et al 2012 zhuang et al 2015 leaky confined formation aquifer feng and zhan 2015 meng et al 2015 unconfined formation aquifer hu and chen 2008 huang et al 2016 zhan 2002 and inclined formations pauritsch et al 2015 verhoest and troch 2000 the impact of qpg on transient flow behaviors of geofluids in these formation types may be more conspicuous than that in the single horizontal formation 4 more situations about well production systems have not been considered in nonlinear qpg models such as partially penetrating well meng et al 2015 mishra et al 2012 slanted well tsou et al 2010 zhan 2002 fractured well birdsell et al 2015 tokunaga 2020 and pumping well feng and zhan 2015 malama et al 2009 because the existed nonlinear qpg models for a constant rate production are suitable for artesian wells like the type of horizontal well the nonlinearity of qpg for these well types may be very strong when compared with the type of vertical well 5 more nonlinear factors have not been involved in nonlinear qpg models such as permeability stress sensitivity chen et al 2019 hupet et al 2005 and non darcian flows cherubini et al 2014 meng et al 2015 geofluid flow in subsurface formations is a nonlinear process dominated by multiple factors nonlinear models that include multiple nonlinear factors will depict transient flow behaviors more realistic 6 multiphase geofluid flow jackson et al 2018 sheng and thompson 2013 has not been involved in nonlinear qpg models in reality many wells produce the mixture of different kinds of geofluids such as the mixture of oil and water in this situation multiphase flow models with the qpg term will be more useful than the single qpg models 7 rate transient analysis is an interesting topic the impact of qpg on rate transients for different types of well in various formation conditions is suggested to be investigated in the future according to the above problems existed in the present work on the nonlinear qpg model there are lots of research works that are needed to be further performed in the future the qpg dominated transient flow behavior in more complicated conditions is expected to be modeled and reported 9 conclusions in this paper a comprehensive review of modeling the qpg dominated transient flow behavior for a well in a confined formation was reported a series of conceptual geofluid flow models for vertical and horizontal wells in ordinary fractured and fractured vuggy formations were comparatively and graphically depicted in detail the corresponding mathematical models with the nonlinear qpg term were established and the general solutions of these vertical and horizontal well models in different formations were obtained the qpg dominated transient flow behaviors in different conditions were comparatively simulated and analyzed by using a series of type curves particular focus on the qualitative and quantitative differences in type curves between the linear and nonlinear models was given model validations and production predictions were also conducted general conclusions of this review are summarized as follows 1 like the linear flow models when a fracture subsystem is assumed as the only pass way to a wellbore the qpg dominated nonlinear flow models for both vertical and horizontal wells in multiple porosity formations have the same expression form of solutions in the laplace space as in a single porosity formation but a different function of f u 2 in comparison with the conventional linear models the same flow regimes can be discerned from the type curves of the nonlinear qpg models 3 except for a pure wellbore storage regime the pressure and its derivative curves of a nonlinear qpg model are obviously lower than those of a conventional linear model with the same model parameter values therefore if we use a conventional linear model to predict the transient pressure we will gain a lager value of production pressure drop than that of using a nonlinear qpg model 4 a pressure derivative curve of a nonlinear model does not conform to the law of a horizontal line of zero slope in an iarf infinite acting radial flow regime and the law of an inclined line of unit slope in a pssf pseudo steady state flow regime controlled by a closed boundary 5 dv and rdv are good tools to quantitatively analyze the differences in type curves between linear and nonlinear models in an iarf regime dv and rdv of pressure and its derivative increase with the elapse of time and in parallel with the coefficient of the qpg term rdv of the pressure derivative is greater than that of pressure at a fixed time fractured vugyy formation parameters such as ω f ω v and λ mf have remarkable impact on rdvs 6 formation property parameters gained via real test interpretations by using the qpg model are more precise than those by using the conventional linear model in the example well interpretations for a 0 0287 value of β the interpretation rdvs of permeability and skin factor are 29 63 and 18 53 respectively 7 neglect of qpg may lead to remarkable errors in production pressure drop prediction the prediction errors may exceed 50 when β 0 01 and may be 2 when β 0 01 in the same formation conditions the prediction error for a horizontal well is far larger than that for a vertical well the prediction errors for oil wells are usually larger than those for water wells an obvious prediction error above 6 may be easily reached for horizontal water wells at a moderate rate production 8 qpg is suggested to be retained in the governing equation especially for a subsurface formation with a high pressure a low permeability a thin thickness a high viscosity of geofluid and a well production injection at a high rate even for low viscous water qpg is of much significance to obtain more precise results in transient pressure predictions 9 the nonlinearity dominated by qpg influences the transient flow behavior of geofluid in confined formations positively and many problems existing in the present work are still pending to be solved therefore the qpg dominated transient flow behavior should be further

model solutions for a vertical well in a single porosity formation the single porosity model of a vertical well was solved by guo and nie 2013 in detail in order to solve the model a variable modification should be firstly introduced to linearize the governing equation eq 1 c 1 p md 1 β ln χ 1 c 2 2 χ r d 2 1 r d χ r d e 2 s χ t d then the laplace transform based on t d is introduced c 3 l χ r d t d χ r d u 0 χ r d t d e u t d d t d the single porosity model of a vertical well in the laplace space is obtained the governing equation becomes c 4 2 χ r d 2 1 r d χ r d f u χ c 5 f u u e 2 s

obtained by using linear algebra such as a gauss jordan reduction in real space χ w can be obtained using a stehfest numerical inversion stehfest 1970 to convert χ w back to χ w and then the wellbore pressure p wd can be obtained by substituting χ w into eq c 1 c 2 model solutions for a horizontal well in a single porosity formation the single porosity model of a horizontal well was solved by lu

linear flow models the solution of a multiple porosity model of both vertical and horizontal wells in laplace space has been proven by many researches corbett et al 2012 nie et al 2012a b sarma and aziz 2006 wu et al 2004 to have the same expression form of solution as a single porosity model and the only difference is the different expression in the function of f u for the qpg dominated flow models for vertical wells in laplace space the solutions of a dual porosity model with the pseudo steady inter porosity flow and a triple porosity model with the unsteady inter porosity flow also have been proven by li et al 2015 nie et al 2009 respectively to have the same expression form as a single porosity model and a different f u by using the same methods as li et al 2015 nie et al 2009 it will be easy to prove that all the qpg dominated flow models for both vertical and horizontal wells presented in this article do have the same expression form and a different f u for a single porosity ordinary formation the function of f u is expressed as eq c 5 for a multiple porosity formation the expressions of f u are as follows 1 for a dual porosity formation fig 3 when the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern fig 3a is considered the function of f u nie et al 2012a is expressed by c 28 f u ω m λ mf u ω m λ mf ω f u e 2 s when the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern fig 3b is considered the function of f u nie et al 2012b is expressed by c 29 f u 1 5 λ mf e 2 s σ m cth σ m 1 ω f u e 2 s where cth σ m is a hyperbolic cotangent function and can be written by c 30 cth σ m e σ m e σ m e σ m e σ m c 31 σ m 15 ω m u λ mf 2 for a triple porosity formation fig 4 when the pseudo steady inter porosity flow pattern fig 4a is considered the function of f u nie et al 2012a wu et al 2004 2011 is expressed by c 32 f u ω m λ mf u ω m λ mf ω v λ vf u ω v λ vf ω f u e 2 s when the mixed inter porosity flow pattern fig 4b is considered the function of f u nie et al 2011 is expressed by c 33 f u 1 5 λ vf e 2 s σ v cth σ v 1 ω m λ mf u ω m λ mf ω f u e 2 s c 34 σ v 15 ω v u λ vf when the unsteady inter porosity flow pattern fig 4c is considered the function of f u nie et al 2009 2012b is expressed by c 35 f u 1 5 λ vf e 2 s σ v cth σ v 1 1 5 λ mf e 2 s σ m cth σ m 1 ω f u e 2 s where σ m and σ v are seen as eq c 31 and eq c 34 respectively in a word by substituting the function of f u in eqs c 28 c 35 into eqs c 11 c 15 or eqs c 23 c 27 we can obtain the model solutions of both vertical and horizontal wells in multiple porosity formations

712100 shaanxi province china this manuscript was handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of rao s govindaraju associate editor boltzmann transform method wetting front advancing method and instantaneous profile method are widely used in measuring hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils however all the three methods are based on relatively strong assumptions in this study a new boltzmann variable was proposed based on the experimental observation that the wetting front advancing distance is not always proportional to the square of time the improved boltzmann transform method incorporating the new boltzmann variable can significantly improve the accuracy of hydraulic conductivity determination for the wetting front advancing method a new formula for calculating the hydraulic gradient using central difference was proposed to reduce the fluctuation of determined hydraulic conductivity curve while using data recorded with small time intervals a series of numerical tests including the horizontal absorption test vertical ponding test and vertical capillary rise test were performed to verify the accuracy of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculated by wetting front advancing method results show that the calculated hydraulic gradients in low suction range are far from the real values except for the vertical ponding test and only the vertical ponding test can give reasonable hydraulic conductivity in both low and high suction ranges for the instantaneous profile method applied in infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation using the connected linear line with consideration of the location of wetting front to represent profiles of water content and suction can improve the accuracy significantly keywords unsaturated hydraulic conductivity boltzmann transform method wetting front advancing method instantaneous profile method 1 introduction the prediction of water movement in unsaturated soil upon wetting has long been a focus of agriculture and water research because of its fundamental role in agricultural irrigation skaggs et al 2004 milla and kish 2006 ma et al 2010 it is also an important issue in geotechnical engineering for example the stability of unsaturated soil slope is related to the depth of downward wetting front during rainfall muntohar and liao 2010 wu et al 2017 foundations on expansive soil or collapsible soil will be damaged by water infiltration day 1992 kropp 2011 hemmati et al 2012 olyansky et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc of unsaturated soil representing the relation between the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and suction and the soil water retention curve swrc representing the relation between the water content and suction are two essential elements in analyzing water movement in soils ng and shi 1998 rahardjo et al 2001 rahimi et al 2010 many methods for measuring the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil were developed klute 1972 benson and gribb 1997 li et al 2009 these methods can be divided into steady method and unsteady method the steady method is more time consuming moreover it cannot accurately measure the hydraulic conductivity of soil in low suction range due to the limit of saturated permeability of the ceramic disk li et al 2009 the unsteady method includes instantaneous profile method richards and weeks 1953 watson 1966 wind 1966 daniel 1983 cui et al 2008 ng and leung 2012 leung et al 2016 su et al 2018 boltzmann transform method bruce and klute 1956 clothier et al 1983 wetting front advancing method li et al 2009 one step outflow inverse method kool et al 1985 parker et al 1985 valiantzas et al 1988 van dam et al 1992 and multi step outflow inverse method van dam et al 1994 among these unsteady methods the outflow inverse method indirectly uses the hcc determined by swrc model however many laboratory tests indicate that the directly determined hcc may be different from the hcc indirectly deduced from swrc meerdink et al 1996 duong et al 2013 gallage et al 2013 the boltzmann transform method is usually applied in the horizontal absorption test in which one end of soil column at water supply is maintained at saturation the wetting front advancing distance x f is assumed to be proportional to the square of time kao and hunt 1996 investigated the relationship between xf and t at the pore scale and obtained that x f is proportional to t 0 5 in the horizontal absorption test however kirkham and feng 1949 found that the relation x f a t 0 5 b is more suitable for describing the movement of wetting front in a large number of horizontal absorption tests hence a new boltzmann variable seems to be required for well describing the water flow in that case in the wetting front advancing method the original formula of hydraulic gradient adopted the backward difference method whether the central difference method can be used to improve the accuracy of hydraulic gradient calculation is still an open question besides since the water content profile is assumed to move forward in a parallel manner the precision of determined hcc in low suction range is far from satisfactory when using the vertical capillary rise test as discussed by chen et al 2010 in view of the fact that gravity affects the wetting front advancing process in the vertical capillary rise test and thus induces errors in hcc determination li et al 2010 suggested a horizontal soil column test to minimize the gravity effect however this needs to be verified the instantaneous profile method is widely used in the drying test such as evaporation test wind 1966 schindler 1980 schindler and müller 2006 leung et al 2016 and internal drainage test watson 1966 hillel et al 1972 leung et al 2016 in which the water flow rate is slow and the water content profile changes gradually with time under wetting condition the water supply flow rate should be controlled at very small value daniel 1983 the infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation can reduce the test duration and the apparatus is simple but the error of the determined hcc is often large in high suction range in order to reduce the error zhang et al 2011 tried to use spline to fit the suction and water content profiles unfortunately the results showed that the accuracy was not improved by this fitting operation when using this time saving and simple test to determine the hcc how to improve the accuracy needs further investigation the first objective of this study is to propose an improved boltzmann transform method incorporating a new boltzmann variable an improved wetting front advancing method with a new formula of hydraulic gradient calculation and an improved instantaneous profile method considering the location of wetting front the effectiveness of these improved methods is verified using laboratory tests the second objective is to numerically assess the assumptions in boltzmann transform method and the accuracy of formula of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculation adopted in the wetting front advancing method the horizontal absorption test and other test such as vertical ponding test were investigated in depth to see whether these tests can reduce the error of hcc in low suction range determined by the wetting front advancing method the third objective is to analyze the detailed reason for the large error by the application of instantaneous profile method in infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation using numerical infiltration tests the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous profile considering the location of wetting front is compared with the traditional measures such as using spline to fit the measured suction and water content profiles and controlling the water flow at water supply 2 theory in this section the indirect method using two swrc models three direct methods and their improved methods for determining hcc are introduced among hccs determined by these methods hccs determined by the indirect method are selected as references when evaluating the effectiveness of the three improved methods in section 3 and section 4 2 1 indirect method for determining hcc the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 and brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 shown in eq 1a and eq 1b respectively can be used to fit the measured swrc then the hccs can be determined using the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 and brooks corey burden model brooks and corey 1964 respectively as shown in eq 2a and eq 2b when the saturated hydraulic conductivity is measured 1a θ θ r θ s θ r 1 ψ α n m where θ s is the saturated volumetric water content θ r is the residual

θ θ θ r θ s θ r 1 ψ α n m k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity 2b k k s ψ a ψ 2 3 l 2 2 three direct methods for determining hcc and their improvements 2 2 1 the original and improved boltzmann transform methods for the horizontal absorption test bruce and klute 1956 found that the one dimensional richards equation written in terms of soil water diffusivity can be solved by boltzmann transformation λ x t 0 5 when λ is a single valued function of θ eq 3a shows the theoretical formula of soil water diffusivity d and eq 3b is used when dealing with the experimental data 3a d θ w 1 2 d λ d θ θ w θ i θ w λ d θ 3b d θ w 1 2 δ λ δ θ θ w θ i θ w λ d θ where θi is the initial volumetric water content d θw is the diffusivity at volumetric water content θw the assumption that λ is a single valued function of θ means that the relationship between the wetting front advancing distance x f and t satisfies eq 4a kirkham and feng 1949 found that eq 4b is more suitable for describing the movement of the wetting front in most horizontal absorption tests hence a new boltzmann variable λ x b t 0 5 is proposed in this study which can also be used to solve the one dimensional richards equation eq 5a presents the expression for the left term of the one dimensional richards equation using the new boltzmann variable and eq 5b gives the right term of the one dimensional richards equation by setting eq 5a equal to eq 5b we can obain eq 5c followingly eq 5d can be obtained by integrating eq 5c then the soil water diffusivity can be determined by eq 6 which has a similar form of eq 3b finally the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be obtained through eq 7 in the following the method using eq 6 and eq 7 for determining hcc is called the improved boltzmann transform method

α n 1 in the van genuchten model 2 2 2 the original and improved wetting front advancing methods taking section a in the horizontal absorption test as an example fig 1 illustrates the calculation of the water flow rate and the hydraulic gradient adopted in the wetting front advancing method during a short period δt i e t 2 t 1 the wetting front advancing distance is δx f the relation between the location of wetting front x f and the time t can be fitted by eq 8a li et al 2009 then the velocity of the wetting front movement can be obtained by eq 8b the water volume passing through section a during a period δt equals the product of the shadow area as shown in fig 1a and the cross sectional area of the soil column the shadow area approximately equals the area of parallelogram fghi in which point i is the middle point of θ xa t 1 and θ xa t 2 hence the water flow rate can be calculated by eq 9 8a x f c t d 8b v f c d t d 1 9 v x a t 1 t 2 2 1 4 θ x a t 2 θ x a t 1 2 θ i v f t 1 v f t 2 where v f t 1 and v f t 2 are the velocities of wetting front movement at t 1 and t 2 respectively the hydraulic gradient during the period δt was calculated using the backward difference originally that is it was calculated by eq 10a using the suction difference between two locations x a and x a δ x f at t 2 which assumes that ψ x a δ x f t 2 equals ψ x a t 1 when considering the hydraulic gradient i t 3 between two locations x a and x a δ x f at t 2 δ x f is the wetting front advancing distance during t 2 to t 3 i t 2 between x a and x a δ x f at t 1 and i t 1 between x a and x a δ x f at t 1 δ x f is the wetting front advancing distance during t 0 to t 1 the improved hydraulic gradient can be calculated by eq 10b finally the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be calculated by eq 11 using darcy s law it should be noted that the hydraulic gradient in the vertical ponding test and the vertical capillary rise test should add 1 and minus 1 respectively based on eq 10b due to the effect of gravity in the following the method using eq 10b to determine the hydraulic gradient is called the improved wetting front advancing method 10a i t 2 ψ x a δ x f t 2 ψ x a t 2 γ w δ x f ψ

original and improved instantaneous profile methods taking section b in the horizontal absorption test as an example fig 2 illustrates the calculation of water flow rate and hydraulic gradient adopted in the original instantaneous profile method as shown in fig 2 the water content profile and suction profile are simplified as the linear lines connected by the values at the measuring points the water volume passing through section b from t 1 to t 2 can be calculated using eq 12a then the water flow rate can be calculated using eq 12b according to central difference method the hydraulic gradient can be calculated using eq 13 finally the hydraulic conductivity can be calculated using eq 14 12a δ v w 1 2 s n 2 4 x n 1 x n θ n t 2 θ n t 1 θ n 1 t 2 θ n 1 t 1 12b v x b t 1 t 2 2 δ v w t

c the error of hcc determined by the original instantaneous profile method is large in order to reduce the error the location of wetting front is considered and the formulas for calculating the water flow rate and hydraulic gradient are eq 15 and eq 16 respectively when the wetting front reaches section c and does not reach section d the water flow rate and hydraulic gradient at section b can be calculated by eq 17 and eq 13 respectively for other conditions these equations can be obtained similarly in the following this method considering the location of wetting front is called the improved instantaneous profile method 15 v x b t 1 t 2 2 x f t 2 x b θ b t 2 θ i x f t 1 x b θ b t 1 θ i 2 t 2 t 1 16 i x b t 1 t 2 2 1 4 ψ b t 1 ψ a t 1 x b x a ψ i ψ b t 1 x f t 1 x b ψ b t 2 ψ a t 2 x b x a

evaluation two evaluation stages were considered to examine the effectiveness of the improved method the first stage was through two laboratory tests the first laboratory test is a horizontal absorption test on remolded loess which is suitable for the three direct methods to determine the hcc using the same test the hccs determined by the three original methods and the corresponding improved methods were compared the second laboratory test is a vertical capillary rise test on stiff clay su et al 2018 and the test was further used to verify the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous method the second stage was to carry out numerical infiltration tests on remolded loess similar to the approach adopted by chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 and leung et al 2016 the assumptions in boltzmann transform method and the accuracy of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate formula adopted in the wetting front advancing method were checked the horizontal absorption test and other tests such as the vertical ponding test were investigated to verify whether they can reduce the error of the wetting front advancing method in low suction range the effectiveness of measures for improving the accuracy of hcc determined by the instantaneous profile method was also analyzed 3 1 the two laboratory tests used in the first evaluation stage 3 1 1 the horizontal absorption test on remolded loess fig 3 shows the test apparatus and the layout of measurement sections the tested soil was a typical loess soil which was collected at yangling district shannxi province china according to the classification of loess proposed by gibbs and holland 1960 based on the plasticity properties and the grain size distribution the soil studied belongs to the clayey loess according to the astm d2487 astm 2000 the soil is classified as lean clay cl the loess soil was firstly air dried crushed and the particles larger than 1 mm in diameter were removed by sieving then water was added to reach a water content of 16 5 and the soil was then kept in a plastic bag for one week for water homogenization afterward the soil was compacted in layers of 5 cm each according to the target void ratio 1 1 in a transparent acrylic column 14 cm inner diameter 100 cm height and the total soil column length was 90 cm the top 10 cm of the acrylic column was filled with gravel and connected to a mariotte bottle 9 cm inner diameter 100 cm height allowing a constant water head to be maintained during the test five soil moisture sensors ech2o were disposed at 15 cm equidistance to monitor the water content changes considering that the change of suction measured by tensiometer is always slower than that measured by soil moister sensor and the tensio meter rather measures low suctions lower than 80 kpa tensiometers were not used in this test the corresponding suction changes were deduced from the measured swrc for measuring the swrc the axis translation technique was adopted firstly the cylindrical loess samples 3 91 cm diameter 2 cm height were prepared at a mass water content of 16 5 then the samples were either wetted or dried to reach different water contents they were then kept in plastic film for two days for water content homogenization finally the axial translation method was used to measure the suctions pham et al 2005 reported that because of the entrapped air the water content after wetted to zero suction is lower than the fully saturated water content thus in this study this water content is measured on the sample in a ring saturator 6 18 cm diameter 4 cm height which was immersed in water for three days at the beginning of the horizontal absorption test the lifting platform was firstly raised to make the water quickly enter the gravel when water flowed out from the overflow hole the hole was closed using plasticine and the lifting platform was lowered to keep the water level constant at the top of the soil column this time was considered as the starting time and the test was finished when water flowed out of the bottom 3 1 2 the vertical capillary rise test on natural stiff clay the vertical capillary rise test on natural stiff clay was conducted by su et al 2018 an intact stiff clay column with 60 mm in diameter and 160 mm in height was locked between the rigid top cap and bottom pedestal for axial restrain to keep nil radial strain the column was wrapped with layers of cohesive tape the initial water content of the column was 7 corresponding to an initial suction of 20 mpa the water was infiltrated from the bottom of the soil column with a total water head that kept at the same level as the top of the column using a burette the air pressure at the top was kept at atmospheric pressure through two open outlets mounted at the top cap the instantaneous profiles of the volumetric water content and suction during wetting were measured by time domain reflectometry tdr and relative humidity sensors respectively 3 2 the numerical infiltration tests used in the second evaluation stage the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2009 was used to carry out numerical infiltration tests on remolded loess thanks to the detailed information obtained by numerical tests the hydraulic gradient at the measuring section can be calculated by the suctions at two neighbor sections using eq 13 and the water flow rate at the measuring section can be calculated using the water content profile it was found that when the element size is selected as small as 1 mm i e the distance of two neighbor sections of the measuring section equals 2 mm the hcc determined by these hydraulic gradients and water flow rates almost coincides the input hcc in that case the hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculated by the above method can be regarded as the real value which can be used to evaluate the values calculated by the wetting front method and the instantaneous profile method hence the element size was selected as 1 mm in numerical tests firstly a numerical horizontal absorption test was carried out according to the evolution of water content with time or the water content profiles at different times the original and new boltzmann transform variable can be obtained and the hccs can be calculated then the effectiveness of the improved boltzmann transform method and the assumption in boltzmann transform method were checked secondly numerical tests including the horizontal absorption test vertical capillary rise test and vertical ponding test were carried out the hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculated by the improved wetting front advancing method were compared with the real values the reason why the precision in low suction range is far from satisfactory when using the vertical capillary rise test or horizontal absorption test was investigated thirdly numerical tests including the horizontal infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation i e horizontal absorption test and the horizontal infiltration test with controlled water flow at water supply were carried out the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous profile considering the location of wetting front using spline to fit the measured suction and water content profile and controlling the water flow at water supply was checked through comparison of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate between the calculated values and the real values 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of the improved methods using the first laboratory test 4 1 1 results of the horizontal absorption test on remolded loess the evolution of volumetric water content with time at each measuring section is shown in fig 4 the water content increases from initial water content to nearly saturated water content the degree of saturation after the test is approximately 82 similar test results have been reported by others bodman and colman 1944 bruce and klute 1956 bodman and colman 1944 found that the saturation of soil at more than 5 cm far away from the top after a vertical ponding test was approximately 70 80 the results from horizontal absorption tests carried out by bruce and klute 1956 also showed that the saturation of soil at more than 5 cm far away from the water supply was approximately 70 90 after tests fig 5 shows the measured and fitted relationships between the wetting front advancing distance and time the relationship can be better fitted by eq 4b and eq 8a compared with that fitted by eq 4a fig 6 shows the measured data of the swrc the water content of the sample saturated by immersion in water was about 0 43 which was similar to the water content of the soil column after infiltration hence θ s adopted in the swrc model equals 0 43 as shown in fig 6 the measured data of the swrc can be well fitted by the van genuchten and brooks corey models and the fitted parameters in the swrc models are listed in the figure the hydraulic conductivity of the sample immersed in water is 2 2 10 5 cm s which is less than that of the sample saturated by vacuum 1 23 10 4 cm s because of entrapped air in the former sample for the hccs predicted by the indirect method the value of 2 2 10 5 cm s was selected as the saturated hydraulic conductivity because the saturation of soil column after infiltration was similar to that of the sample immersed in water 4 1 2 comparison of hccs determined by various methods for the original and improved boltzmann transform method the curves of λ θ and λ θ calculated from the data collected at different measuring sections are shown in fig 7 a θ starts to increase at almost the same value of λ fig 7b shows the hccs determined from the curves of λ θ and λ θ using eqs 3b 6 and 7 in which the hccs determined by the indirect method using the van genuchten mualem and brooks corey burden models are also shown the van genuchten mualem model eq 2a was used for fitting the scattered points in k ψ plane the parameters are listed in fig 7b due to the changes of α and n the swrc was fitted again the new fitted parameter θ r is 0 170 and 0 182 for the original and improved boltzmann transform method respectively although these fitted parameters changed compared with the initial values the swrc determined by the new soil water retention function is also close to the measured data when the suction is lower than the initial one fig 8 a presents the comparison of hccs determined by the original and improved wetting front advancing methods when using data collected at measuring section b with small time intervals the improved wetting front advancing methods can reduce the fluctuation of determined hcc fig 8b presents the hccs determined by the original and improved wetting front advancing methods when using data recorded with large time intervals both methods give similar results from fig 8b the unsaturated conductivities in low suction range determined by the original and improved wetting front advancing method are larger than the hydraulic conductivity at zero suction determined in the laboratory the reasons for the error will be analyzed in section 4 3 2 fig 9 shows the hccs determined by the original and improved instantaneous profile method the improved method can improve the accuracy greatly totally the hccs are far from the curves determined by the indirect method in high suction range and are close to those curves in low suction range similar results were reported by meerdink et al 1996 who found that the measured hcc using the instantaneous method in high suction range is above the indirectly determined hcc based on swrc model among the three methods only the original and improved boltzmann transform methods can give reasonable unsaturated conductivity in both low and high suction range the relationship between the wetting front advancing distance and time was predicted by hydrus 1 d by adopting the swrc and hcc determined by the original and improved boltzmann transform methods respectively the comparison of the measured and the predicted relationships is shown in fig 10 the prediction using the hydraulic function determined by the improved boltzmann transform method appears more accurate showing its effectiveness 4 2 evaluation of the improved instantaneous method using the second laboratory test according to the starting change time of tdr sensor reading and the distance of tdr sensor from the bottom of the soil column the relationship between the wetting front advancing distance z f and t can be obtained and it can be well fitted by eq 8a as z f 3 94 t 0 3354 in which the unit of zf is mm and the unit of time t is min using the second measuring section 54 mm far from the water supply end as the calculated section the hccs determined by the original and the improved instantaneous profile methods are shown in fig 11 with the original method the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity decreases with the decrease of suction firstly in high suction range and then increases with a further decrease of suction the change in high suction range is quite contradictory with the common results with the improved method the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity increases with the decrease of suction the reason why the determined hcc in high suction range by the original method has a large error can be explained from fig 2a when the wetting front does not reach the third measuring section the water volume passing through the second section calculated by the original method is larger than the real value this results in the calculated water flow rate at the second measuring section larger than the real value when water just passed through this section by contrast the improved method considers the location of wetting front allowing reasonable water flow rate and hydraulic conductivity 4 3 evaluation of the improved methods using the numerical tests 4 3 1 evaluation of the improved boltzmann transform method in the numerical horizontal absorption test the input swrc and hcc functions were those determined by the improved boltzmann transform method as shown in section 4 1 2 the relationships between the original new boltzmann variable and the volumetric water content obtained by the numerical test are presented in fig 12 the λ or λ is not the single valued function of θ as λ starting to increase with water content is not unique it can be concluded that the wetting front advancing distance is not strictly proportional to the square of time after a long time or when the measuring section is far from the water supply λ or λ becomes almost a single valued function of θ adopting the λ θ and λ θ relationship obtained at the measuring sections at 2 cm and 30 cm from the water supply the determined hccs are shown in fig 13 the hcc determined by the data collected at 2 cm deviates from the input hcc in high suction range as shown in fig 12 although the λ starting to increase with water content is almost unique the relationship of λ θ becomes more diverse after that point as shown in fig 13 the accuracy of hcc determined by the λ θ relationship is not improved compared with the λ θ relationship for the measuring section x 2 cm the accuracy is increased in high suction range but decreased in low suction range for the measuring section x 30 cm there are almost no differences between the two methods the numerical test results indicate that the assumption in boltzmann transform method can be ensured when the water content profile is measured at a fixed time long enough or in the case where the evolution of water content with time is measured at a fixed position far enough from the water supply however since the starting time of test cannot be strictly determined the soil column near the water supply is almost fully saturated which is different from other section after infiltration and the sample is often not uniform the improved boltzmann transform method is also an effective method for improving the accuracy of the determined hcc 4 3 2 evaluation of the improved wetting front advancing method using various infiltration numerical tests as stated in section 4 1 2 the improved wetting front advancing method did not improve the precision of hcc compared with the original method when using data recorded with large time intervals moreover hccs determined by both methods in low suction range are far from satisfactory when considering the horizontal absorption test to clarify the influence of gravity on the determined hcc especially in the low suction range a series of numerical tests including the vertical capillary rise test with zero water head at the bottom of soil column the horizontal absorption test and the vertical ponding test with zero water head at the top of soil column were carried out because the improved wetting front advancing method is stricter this method was adopted to determine hcc in the following analysis it is worth noting that the conclusion is the same when using the original wetting front advancing method fig 14 shows the comparison between the input hccs i e two hccs indirectly determined by van genuchten mualem and brooks corey burden models for remolded loess and those determined by the improved wetting front advancing method using different tests it can be seen that the vertical ponding test is the most suitable compared with the capillary rise test and the horizontal absorption test when the measuring section is far enough from the water supply x 30 cm the vertical ponding test gives reasonable hydraulic conductivity in both low and high suction ranges when the measuring section is near the water supply x 2 cm the determined hydraulic conductivity in the low suction range is also larger than the input value further the calculated hydraulic gradients and water flow rates at measuring sections were compared with the real values as an example the input hcc is the hcc indirectly determined by the van genuchten mualem model as shown in fig 15 the calculated hydraulic gradient is accurate in both low and high suction ranges only for the vertical ponding test when the measuring section is far from the water supply while the calculated water flow rate is quite accurate except for in the capillary rise test taking the horizontal absorption test as an example the process of calculating the hydraulic gradient at low suction is illustrated as shown in fig 16 the suction at the measuring section x 30 cm is 2 95 kpa when t 1 8786 min and is 2 27 kpa when t 2 12 557 min when using eq 10a for calculating the hydraulic gradient i t 2 the error is very large because the real value at 30 δ x f is 4 5 kpa while the adopted value is 2 95 kpa the conclusion is same for the vertical capillary rise test the calculated hydraulic gradient is close to the real value for the vertical ponding test hence the reason why the vertical ponding test allows a higher precision of hcc in low suction range can be explained as follow the hydraulic gradient induced by suction is around 1 when the suction at the measuring section is low the relative error of the calculated hydraulic gradient using the horizontal absorption test is large as the hydraulic gradient induced by gravity has the same sign as that induced by suction in the vertical ponding test the relative error of the hydraulic gradient is reduced therefore for the vertical ponding test the assumption that water content profile moves forwards in a parallel manner cannot induce a large error in low suction range for the hcc determination 4 3 3 evaluation of the improved instantaneous profile method in this section the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous profile method and the traditional measures such as controlling the water flow at water supply using spline line to represent the water content and suction profiles was verified and compared through numerical horizontal infiltration tests as an example the input hcc is indirectly determined by the van genuchten mualem model for remolded loess for the horizontal infiltration test with one end maintained at saturation i e the horizontal absorption test the first measuring section was put at 27 cm from the water supply end and the four measuring sections with 3 cm spacing were arranged after it for the horizontal infiltration test with controlled water flow at water supply the first measuring section was put at 3 cm from the water supply end to reduce the test duration and the four measuring sections with 3 cm spacing were arranged after it the water supply flow should be slow firstly and then fast the water supply flow rate at the first stage was 1 10 8 cm s which is approximately 5 times the unsaturated conductivity at initial suction this step lasted 57 5 h in the second third and fourth stages the water supply flow rate and test duration were 5 10 8 cm s and 16 7 h 1 10 7 cm s and 6 9 h and 2 10 7 cm s and 6 4 h respectively the numerical test adopting only one uniform water supply flow rate 1 10 8 cm s lasting 95 h was also carried out in all the tests the second measuring section was selected as the calculation section for the first test original and improved instantaneous profile methods were used to determine the hccs for the latter two tests only the original instantaneous profile method was used to determine the hcc fig 17 shows the determined hccs and the input hcc it can be seen that there is some gap between the determined hccs and the input hcc especially in high suction range for the horizontal absorption test the improved instantaneous profile method can reduce the error significantly compared with the original method and the accuracy is close to that by controlling the water flow at water supply for only one uniform flow rate at water supply the water content at the fifth measuring section started to increase when the suction at the second measuring section reached approximately 33 kpa thus this test only gave the hcc for suction from the initial value to 33 kpa which was limited compared with the multi step controlled water supply flow rate test to ascertain the error of calculated hydraulic gradient or water flow rate those calculated values were compared with real values as shown in fig 18 for the three tests the hydraulic gradient in high suction range calculated by the original method or improved method is smaller than the real value and the water flow rate is larger than the real value compared with the original method used in the horizontal absorption test both improved instantaneous profile method and controlling the water flow at water supply can improve the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient and water flow rate greatly through the numerical vertical capillary rise test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation zhang et al 2011 also found that the determined hcc is higher than the input hcc in high suction range they used the spline to fit the measured suction and water content profiles to increase the precision of the hcc determined by the instantaneous profile method and found that the effectiveness was limited to clarify why the fitting method could not increase the precision of hcc fig 19 shows the profiles of real water content and suction compared with represented profiles including the connected linear line the cubic spline and the connected linear line with consideration of the wetting front location it can be also found from fig 19a the trend of cubic spline is wrong compared with the measured suction profile table 1 shows the comparison of calculated hydraulic gradient and water flow rates at calculation section x 30 cm during the time between 2155 3 and 2161 6 min it appears that the accuracy could not be improved by using the cubic spline line to fit the measured water content and suction profiles by contrast using the connected linear line with consideration of the location of the wetting front can increase the precision significantly for the remolded loess the test using the instantaneous profile method with various measures is complex and the accuracy is lower compared with the two former direct methods i e the boltzmann transform method and wetting front advancing method as stated in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 these two direct methods require the first measuring section far enough from the water supply end this will be time consuming for soils with low permeability such as compacted bentonite sand mixture and stiff clay wang et al 2013 su et al 2018 when using these two direct methods since instantaneous profile method has been routinely applied to determine the hccs of these soils the improved instantaneous profile method considering the location of wetting front can be applied to improve the accuracy of hcc determination 5 conclusions three methods for determining hcc of unsaturated soil upon wetting were investigated and improved the effectiveness of the three improved methods was examined by laboratory tests and numerical tests for the boltzmann transformation method a new boltzmann variable was proposed based on the relationship between wetting front advancing distance and time giving rise to an improved hcc determination method applying the improved method to determine the hcc of remolded loess could increase the determination precision the numerical test also indicates that the wetting front advancing distance is not strictly proportional to the square of time however the hccs determined by the original and improved methods show the same precision in the laboratory test the starting time of test is difficult to be determined accurately moreover the soil column near the water supply is almost fully saturated which is different from other sections after wetted in some cases the sample may be not uniform thus the improved boltzmann transform method is also effective for the wetting front advancing method the proposed hydraulic gradient calculation method reduced the fluctuation of hcc when using data recorded with small time intervals the results of a series of numerical tests including the horizontal absorption test the vertical ponding test and the vertical capillary rise test indicated that the calculated hydraulic gradient and water flow rate at the measuring sections far from the water supply in the vertical ponding test are very close to the measured values hence the vertical ponding test is suggested to be adopted for hcc determination and the measuring sections should be placed far enough from the water supply in order to improve the precision of the hcc in low suction range it should be noted this conclusion is drawn through numerical tests and it is necessary to carry out the vertical ponding test to experimentally verify the wetting front advancing method for the instantaneous profile method the improved method using the connected linear line with consideration of the wetting front location to represent the water content and suction profiles was proposed two laboratory tests were analyzed and the results indicated that the improved method can improve the accuracy greatly compared with original method numerical tests indicated that the improved method could significantly improve the precision of hcc determination compared with using the spline to fit the measured suction profile and

712100 shaanxi province china this manuscript was handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of rao s govindaraju associate editor boltzmann transform method wetting front advancing method and instantaneous profile method are widely used in measuring hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils however all the three methods are based on relatively strong assumptions in this study a new boltzmann variable was proposed based on the experimental observation that the wetting front advancing distance is not always proportional to the square of time the improved boltzmann transform method incorporating the new boltzmann variable can significantly improve the accuracy of hydraulic conductivity determination for the wetting front advancing method a new formula for calculating the hydraulic gradient using central difference was proposed to reduce the fluctuation of determined hydraulic conductivity curve while using data recorded with small time intervals a series of numerical tests including the horizontal absorption test vertical ponding test and vertical capillary rise test were performed to verify the accuracy of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculated by wetting front advancing method results show that the calculated hydraulic gradients in low suction range are far from the real values except for the vertical ponding test and only the vertical ponding test can give reasonable hydraulic conductivity in both low and high suction ranges for the instantaneous profile method applied in infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation using the connected linear line with consideration of the location of wetting front to represent profiles of water content and suction can improve the accuracy significantly keywords unsaturated hydraulic conductivity boltzmann transform method wetting front advancing method instantaneous profile method 1 introduction the prediction of water movement in unsaturated soil upon wetting has long been a focus of agriculture and water research because of its fundamental role in agricultural irrigation skaggs et al 2004 milla and kish 2006 ma et al 2010 it is also an important issue in geotechnical engineering for example the stability of unsaturated soil slope is related to the depth of downward wetting front during rainfall muntohar and liao 2010 wu et al 2017 foundations on expansive soil or collapsible soil will be damaged by water infiltration day 1992 kropp 2011 hemmati et al 2012 olyansky et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the hydraulic conductivity curve hcc of unsaturated soil representing the relation between the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and suction and the soil water retention curve swrc representing the relation between the water content and suction are two essential elements in analyzing water movement in soils ng and shi 1998 rahardjo et al 2001 rahimi et al 2010 many methods for measuring the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil were developed klute 1972 benson and gribb 1997 li et al 2009 these methods can be divided into steady method and unsteady method the steady method is more time consuming moreover it cannot accurately measure the hydraulic conductivity of soil in low suction range due to the limit of saturated permeability of the ceramic disk li et al 2009 the unsteady method includes instantaneous profile method richards and weeks 1953 watson 1966 wind 1966 daniel 1983 cui et al 2008 ng and leung 2012 leung et al 2016 su et al 2018 boltzmann transform method bruce and klute 1956 clothier et al 1983 wetting front advancing method li et al 2009 one step outflow inverse method kool et al 1985 parker et al 1985 valiantzas et al 1988 van dam et al 1992 and multi step outflow inverse method van dam et al 1994 among these unsteady methods the outflow inverse method indirectly uses the hcc determined by swrc model however many laboratory tests indicate that the directly determined hcc may be different from the hcc indirectly deduced from swrc meerdink et al 1996 duong et al 2013 gallage et al 2013 the boltzmann transform method is usually applied in the horizontal absorption test in which one end of soil column at water supply is maintained at saturation the wetting front advancing distance x f is assumed to be proportional to the square of time kao and hunt 1996 investigated the relationship between xf and t at the pore scale and obtained that x f is proportional to t 0 5 in the horizontal absorption test however kirkham and feng 1949 found that the relation x f a t 0 5 b is more suitable for describing the movement of wetting front in a large number of horizontal absorption tests hence a new boltzmann variable seems to be required for well describing the water flow in that case in the wetting front advancing method the original formula of hydraulic gradient adopted the backward difference method whether the central difference method can be used to improve the accuracy of hydraulic gradient calculation is still an open question besides since the water content profile is assumed to move forward in a parallel manner the precision of determined hcc in low suction range is far from satisfactory when using the vertical capillary rise test as discussed by chen et al 2010 in view of the fact that gravity affects the wetting front advancing process in the vertical capillary rise test and thus induces errors in hcc determination li et al 2010 suggested a horizontal soil column test to minimize the gravity effect however this needs to be verified the instantaneous profile method is widely used in the drying test such as evaporation test wind 1966 schindler 1980 schindler and müller 2006 leung et al 2016 and internal drainage test watson 1966 hillel et al 1972 leung et al 2016 in which the water flow rate is slow and the water content profile changes gradually with time under wetting condition the water supply flow rate should be controlled at very small value daniel 1983 the infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation can reduce the test duration and the apparatus is simple but the error of the determined hcc is often large in high suction range in order to reduce the error zhang et al 2011 tried to use spline to fit the suction and water content profiles unfortunately the results showed that the accuracy was not improved by this fitting operation when using this time saving and simple test to determine the hcc how to improve the accuracy needs further investigation the first objective of this study is to propose an improved boltzmann transform method incorporating a new boltzmann variable an improved wetting front advancing method with a new formula of hydraulic gradient calculation and an improved instantaneous profile method considering the location of wetting front the effectiveness of these improved methods is verified using laboratory tests the second objective is to numerically assess the assumptions in boltzmann transform method and the accuracy of formula of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculation adopted in the wetting front advancing method the horizontal absorption test and other test such as vertical ponding test were investigated in depth to see whether these tests can reduce the error of hcc in low suction range determined by the wetting front advancing method the third objective is to analyze the detailed reason for the large error by the application of instantaneous profile method in infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation using numerical infiltration tests the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous profile considering the location of wetting front is compared with the traditional measures such as using spline to fit the measured suction and water content profiles and controlling the water flow at water supply 2 theory in this section the indirect method using two swrc models three direct methods and their improved methods for determining hcc are introduced among hccs determined by these methods hccs determined by the indirect method are selected as references when evaluating the effectiveness of the three improved methods in section 3 and section 4 2 1 indirect method for determining hcc the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 and brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 shown in eq 1a and eq 1b respectively can be used to fit the measured swrc then the hccs can be determined using the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 and brooks corey burden model brooks and corey 1964 respectively as shown in eq 2a and eq 2b when the saturated hydraulic conductivity is measured 1a θ θ r θ s θ r 1 ψ α n m where θ s is the saturated volumetric water content θ r is the residual

θ θ θ r θ s θ r 1 ψ α n m k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity 2b k k s ψ a ψ 2 3 l 2 2 three direct methods for determining hcc and their improvements 2 2 1 the original and improved boltzmann transform methods for the horizontal absorption test bruce and klute 1956 found that the one dimensional richards equation written in terms of soil water diffusivity can be solved by boltzmann transformation λ x t 0 5 when λ is a single valued function of θ eq 3a shows the theoretical formula of soil water diffusivity d and eq 3b is used when dealing with the experimental data 3a d θ w 1 2 d λ d θ θ w θ i θ w λ d θ 3b d θ w 1 2 δ λ δ θ θ w θ i θ w λ d θ where θi is the initial volumetric water content d θw is the diffusivity at volumetric water content θw the assumption that λ is a single valued function of θ means that the relationship between the wetting front advancing distance x f and t satisfies eq 4a kirkham and feng 1949 found that eq 4b is more suitable for describing the movement of the wetting front in most horizontal absorption tests hence a new boltzmann variable λ x b t 0 5 is proposed in this study which can also be used to solve the one dimensional richards equation eq 5a presents the expression for the left term of the one dimensional richards equation using the new boltzmann variable and eq 5b gives the right term of the one dimensional richards equation by setting eq 5a equal to eq 5b we can obain eq 5c followingly eq 5d can be obtained by integrating eq 5c then the soil water diffusivity can be determined by eq 6 which has a similar form of eq 3b finally the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be obtained through eq 7 in the following the method using eq 6 and eq 7 for determining hcc is called the improved boltzmann transform method 4a x f λ f t 0 5 where λf is the constant 4b x f a t 0 5 b where a and b are the constant 5a θ t θ λ λ t 1 2 x b t 3 2 θ λ 5b x d θ θ x λ d θ θ λ λ x λ x t 1 λ d θ θ λ 5c λ 2 d θ d λ d d λ d θ d θ d λ

α n 1 in the van genuchten model 2 2 2 the original and improved wetting front advancing methods taking section a in the horizontal absorption test as an example fig 1 illustrates the calculation of the water flow rate and the hydraulic gradient adopted in the wetting front advancing method during a short period δt i e t 2 t 1 the wetting front advancing distance is δx f the relation between the location of wetting front x f and the time t can be fitted by eq 8a li et al 2009 then the velocity of the wetting front movement can be obtained by eq 8b the water volume passing through section a during a period δt equals the product of the shadow area as shown in fig 1a and the cross sectional area of the soil column the shadow area approximately equals the area of parallelogram fghi in which point i is the middle point of θ xa t 1 and θ xa t 2 hence the water flow rate can be calculated by eq 9 8a x f c t d 8b v f c d t d 1 9 v x a t 1 t 2 2 1 4 θ x a t 2 θ x a t 1 2 θ i v f t 1 v f t 2 where v f t 1 and v f t 2 are the velocities of wetting front movement at t 1 and t 2 respectively the hydraulic gradient during the period δt was calculated using the backward difference originally that is it was calculated by eq 10a using the suction difference between two locations x a and x a δ x f at t 2 which assumes that ψ x a δ x f t 2 equals ψ x a t 1 when considering the hydraulic gradient i t 3 between two locations x a and x a δ x f at t 2 δ x f is the wetting front advancing distance during t 2 to t 3 i t 2 between x a and x a δ x f at t 1 and i t 1 between x a and x a δ x f at t 1 δ x f is the wetting front advancing distance during t 0 to t 1 the improved hydraulic gradient can be calculated by eq 10b finally the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be calculated by eq 11 using darcy s law it should be noted that the hydraulic gradient in the vertical ponding test and the vertical capillary rise test should add 1 and minus 1 respectively based on eq 10b due to the effect of gravity in the following the method using eq 10b to determine the hydraulic gradient is called the improved wetting front advancing method 10a i t 2 ψ x a δ x f t 2 ψ x a t 2 γ w δ x f ψ

original and improved instantaneous profile methods taking section b in the horizontal absorption test as an example fig 2 illustrates the calculation of water flow rate and hydraulic gradient adopted in the original instantaneous profile method as shown in fig 2 the water content profile and suction profile are simplified as the linear lines connected by the values at the measuring points the water volume passing through section b from t 1 to t 2 can be calculated using eq 12a then the water flow rate can be calculated using eq 12b according to central difference method the hydraulic gradient can be calculated using eq 13 finally the hydraulic conductivity can be calculated using eq 14 12a δ v w 1 2 s n 2 4 x n 1 x n θ n t 2 θ n t 1 θ n 1 t 2 θ n 1 t 1 12b v x b t 1 t 2 2 δ v w t

c the error of hcc determined by the original instantaneous profile method is large in order to reduce the error the location of wetting front is considered and the formulas for calculating the water flow rate and hydraulic gradient are eq 15 and eq 16 respectively when the wetting front reaches section c and does not reach section d the water flow rate and hydraulic gradient at section b can be calculated by eq 17 and eq 13 respectively for other conditions these equations can be obtained similarly in the following this method considering the location of wetting front is called the improved

evaluation two evaluation stages were considered to examine the effectiveness of the improved method the first stage was through two laboratory tests the first laboratory test is a horizontal absorption test on remolded loess which is suitable for the three direct methods to determine the hcc using the same test the hccs determined by the three original methods and the corresponding improved methods were compared the second laboratory test is a vertical capillary rise test on stiff clay su et al 2018 and the test was further used to verify the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous method the second stage was to carry out numerical infiltration tests on remolded loess similar to the approach adopted by chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 and leung et al 2016 the assumptions in boltzmann transform method and the accuracy of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate formula adopted in the wetting front advancing method were checked the horizontal absorption test and other tests such as the vertical ponding test were investigated to verify whether they can reduce the error of the wetting front advancing method in low suction range the effectiveness of measures for improving the accuracy of hcc determined by the instantaneous profile method was also analyzed 3 1 the two laboratory tests used in the first evaluation stage 3 1 1 the horizontal absorption test on remolded loess fig 3 shows the test apparatus and the layout of measurement sections the tested soil was a typical loess soil which was collected at yangling district shannxi province china according to the classification of loess proposed by gibbs and holland 1960 based on the plasticity properties and the grain size distribution the soil studied belongs to the clayey loess according to the astm d2487 astm 2000 the soil is classified as lean clay cl the loess soil was firstly air dried crushed and the particles larger than 1 mm in diameter were removed by sieving then water was added to reach a water content of 16 5 and the soil was then kept in a plastic bag for one week for water homogenization afterward the soil was compacted in layers of 5 cm each according to the target void ratio 1 1 in a transparent acrylic column 14 cm inner diameter 100 cm height and the total soil column length was 90 cm the top 10 cm of the acrylic column was filled with gravel and connected to a mariotte bottle 9 cm inner diameter 100 cm height allowing a constant water head to be maintained during the test five soil moisture sensors ech2o were disposed at 15 cm equidistance to monitor the water content changes considering that the change of suction measured by tensiometer is always slower than that measured by soil moister sensor and the tensio meter rather measures low suctions lower than 80 kpa tensiometers were not used in this test the corresponding suction changes were deduced from the measured swrc for measuring the swrc the axis translation technique was adopted firstly the cylindrical loess samples 3 91 cm diameter 2 cm height were prepared at a mass water content of 16 5 then the samples were either wetted or dried to reach different water contents they were then kept in plastic film for two days for water content homogenization finally the axial translation method was used to measure the suctions pham et al 2005 reported that because of the entrapped air the water content after wetted to zero suction is lower than the fully saturated water content thus in this study this water content is measured on the sample in a ring saturator 6 18 cm diameter 4 cm height which was immersed in water for three days at the beginning of the horizontal absorption test the lifting platform was firstly raised to make the water quickly enter the gravel when water flowed out from the overflow hole the hole was closed using plasticine and the lifting platform was lowered to keep the water level constant at the top of the soil column this time was considered as the starting time and the test was finished when water flowed out of the bottom 3 1 2 the vertical capillary rise test on natural stiff clay the vertical capillary rise test on natural stiff clay was conducted by su et al 2018 an intact stiff clay column with 60 mm in diameter and 160 mm in height was locked between the rigid top cap and bottom pedestal for axial restrain to keep nil radial strain the column was wrapped with layers of cohesive tape the initial water content of the column was 7 corresponding to an initial suction of 20 mpa the water was infiltrated from the bottom of the soil column with a total water head that kept at the same level as the top of the column using a burette the air pressure at the top was kept at atmospheric pressure through two open outlets mounted at the top cap the instantaneous profiles of the volumetric water content and suction during wetting were measured by time domain reflectometry tdr and relative humidity sensors respectively 3 2 the numerical infiltration tests used in the second evaluation stage the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2009 was used to carry out numerical infiltration tests on remolded loess thanks to the detailed information obtained by numerical tests the hydraulic gradient at the measuring section can be calculated by the suctions at two neighbor sections using eq 13 and the water flow rate at the measuring section can be calculated using the water content profile it was found that when the element size is selected as small as 1 mm i e the distance of two neighbor sections of the measuring section equals 2 mm the hcc determined by these hydraulic gradients and water flow rates almost coincides the input hcc in that case the hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculated by the above method can be regarded as the real value which can be used to evaluate the values calculated by the wetting front method and the instantaneous profile method hence the element size was selected as 1 mm in numerical tests firstly a numerical horizontal absorption test was carried out according to the evolution of water content with time or the water content profiles at different times the original and new boltzmann transform variable can be obtained and the hccs can be calculated then the effectiveness of the improved boltzmann transform method and the assumption in boltzmann transform method were checked secondly numerical tests including the horizontal absorption test vertical capillary rise test and vertical ponding test were carried out the hydraulic gradient and water flow rate calculated by the improved wetting front advancing method were compared with the real values the reason why the precision in low suction range is far from satisfactory when using the vertical capillary rise test or horizontal absorption test was investigated thirdly numerical tests including the horizontal infiltration test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation i e horizontal absorption test and the horizontal infiltration test with controlled water flow at water supply were carried out the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous profile considering the location of wetting front using spline to fit the measured suction and water content profile and controlling the water flow at water supply was checked through comparison of hydraulic gradient and water flow rate between the calculated values and the real values 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of the improved methods using the first laboratory test 4 1 1 results of the horizontal absorption test on remolded loess the evolution of volumetric water content with time at each measuring section is shown in fig 4 the water content increases from initial water content to nearly saturated water content the degree of saturation after the test is approximately 82 similar test results have been reported by others bodman and colman 1944 bruce and klute 1956 bodman and colman 1944 found that the saturation of soil at more than 5 cm far away from the top after a vertical ponding test was approximately 70 80 the results from horizontal absorption tests carried out by bruce and klute 1956 also showed that the saturation of soil at more than 5 cm far away from the water supply was approximately 70 90 after tests fig 5 shows the measured and fitted relationships between the wetting front advancing distance and time the relationship can be better fitted by eq 4b and eq 8a compared with that fitted by eq 4a fig 6 shows the measured data of the swrc the water content of the sample saturated by immersion in water was about 0 43 which was similar to the water content of the soil column after infiltration hence θ s adopted in the swrc model equals 0 43 as shown in fig 6 the measured data of the swrc can be well fitted by the van genuchten and brooks corey models and the fitted parameters in the swrc models are listed in the figure the hydraulic conductivity of the sample immersed in water is 2 2 10 5 cm s which is less than that of the sample saturated by vacuum 1 23 10 4 cm s because of entrapped air in the former sample for the hccs predicted by the indirect method the value of 2 2 10 5 cm s was selected as the saturated hydraulic conductivity because the saturation of soil column after infiltration was similar to that of the sample immersed in water 4 1 2 comparison of hccs determined by various methods for the original and improved boltzmann transform method the curves of λ θ and λ θ calculated from the data collected at different measuring sections are shown in fig 7 a θ starts to increase at almost the same value of λ fig 7b shows the hccs determined from the curves of λ θ and λ θ using eqs 3b 6 and 7 in which the hccs determined by the indirect method using the van genuchten mualem and brooks corey burden models are also shown the van genuchten mualem model eq 2a was used for fitting the scattered points in k ψ plane the parameters are listed in fig 7b due to the changes of α and n the swrc was fitted again the new fitted parameter θ r is 0 170 and 0 182 for the original and improved boltzmann transform method respectively although these fitted parameters changed compared with the initial values the swrc determined by the new soil water retention function is also close to the measured data when the suction is lower than the initial one fig 8 a presents the comparison of hccs determined by the original and improved wetting front advancing methods when using data collected at measuring section b with small time intervals the improved wetting front advancing methods can reduce the fluctuation of determined hcc fig 8b presents the hccs determined by the original and improved wetting front advancing methods when using data recorded with large time intervals both methods give similar results from fig 8b the unsaturated conductivities in low suction range determined by the original and improved wetting front advancing method are larger than the hydraulic conductivity at zero suction determined in the laboratory the reasons for the error will be analyzed in section 4 3 2 fig 9 shows the hccs determined by the original and improved instantaneous profile method the improved method can improve the accuracy greatly totally the hccs are far from the curves determined by the indirect method in high suction range and are close to those curves in low suction range similar results were reported by meerdink et al 1996 who found that the measured hcc using the instantaneous method in high suction range is above the indirectly determined hcc based on swrc model among the three methods only the original and improved boltzmann transform methods can give reasonable unsaturated conductivity in both low and high suction range the relationship between the wetting front advancing distance and time was predicted by hydrus 1 d by adopting the swrc and hcc determined by the original and improved boltzmann transform methods respectively the comparison of the measured and the predicted relationships is shown in fig 10 the prediction using the hydraulic function determined by the improved boltzmann transform method appears more accurate showing its effectiveness 4 2 evaluation of the improved instantaneous method using the second laboratory test according to the starting change time of tdr sensor reading and the distance of tdr sensor from the bottom of the soil column the relationship between the wetting front advancing distance z f and t can be obtained and it can be well fitted by eq 8a as z f 3 94 t 0 3354 in which the unit of zf is mm and the unit of time t is min using the second measuring section 54 mm far from the water supply end as the calculated section the hccs determined by the original and the improved instantaneous profile methods are shown in fig 11 with the original method the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity decreases with the decrease of suction firstly in high suction range and then increases with a further decrease of suction the change in high suction range is quite contradictory with the common results with the improved method the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity increases with the decrease of suction the reason why the determined hcc in high suction range by the original method has a large error can be explained from fig 2a when the wetting front does not reach the third measuring section the water volume passing through the second section calculated by the original method is larger than the real value this results in the calculated water flow rate at the second measuring section larger than the real value when water just passed through this section by contrast the improved method considers the location of wetting front allowing reasonable water flow rate and hydraulic conductivity 4 3 evaluation of the improved methods using the numerical tests 4 3 1 evaluation of the improved boltzmann transform method in the numerical horizontal absorption test the input swrc and hcc functions were those determined by the improved boltzmann transform method as shown in section 4 1 2 the relationships between the original new boltzmann variable and the volumetric water content obtained by the numerical test are presented in fig 12 the λ or λ is not the single valued function of θ as λ starting to increase with water content is not unique it can be concluded that the wetting front advancing distance is not strictly proportional to the square of time after a long time or when the measuring section is far from the water supply λ or λ becomes almost a single valued function of θ adopting the λ θ and λ θ relationship obtained at the measuring sections at 2 cm and 30 cm from the water supply the determined hccs are shown in fig 13 the hcc determined by the data collected at 2 cm deviates from the input hcc in high suction range as shown in fig 12 although the λ starting to increase with water content is almost unique the relationship of λ θ becomes more diverse after that point as shown in fig 13 the accuracy of hcc determined by the λ θ relationship is not improved compared with the λ θ relationship for the measuring section x 2 cm the accuracy is increased in high suction range but decreased in low suction range for the measuring section x 30 cm there are almost no differences between the two methods the numerical test results indicate that the assumption in boltzmann transform method can be ensured when the water content profile is measured at a fixed time long enough or in the case where the evolution of water content with time is measured at a fixed position far enough from the water supply however since the starting time of test cannot be strictly determined the soil column near the water supply is almost fully saturated which is different from other section after infiltration and the sample is often not uniform the improved boltzmann transform method is also an effective method for improving the accuracy of the determined hcc 4 3 2 evaluation of the improved wetting front advancing method using various infiltration numerical tests as stated in section 4 1 2 the improved wetting front advancing method did not improve the precision of hcc compared with the original method when using data recorded with large time intervals moreover hccs determined by both methods in low suction range are far from satisfactory when considering the horizontal absorption test to clarify the influence of gravity on the determined hcc especially in the low suction range a series of numerical tests including the vertical capillary rise test with zero water head at the bottom of soil column the horizontal absorption test and the vertical ponding test with zero water head at the top of soil column were carried out because the improved wetting front advancing method is stricter this method was adopted to determine hcc in the following analysis it is worth noting that the conclusion is the same when using the original wetting front advancing method fig 14 shows the comparison between the input hccs i e two hccs indirectly determined by van genuchten mualem and brooks corey burden models for remolded loess and those determined by the improved wetting front advancing method using different tests it can be seen that the vertical ponding test is the most suitable compared with the capillary rise test and the horizontal absorption test when the measuring section is far enough from the water supply x 30 cm the vertical ponding test gives reasonable hydraulic conductivity in both low and high suction ranges when the measuring section is near the water supply x 2 cm the determined hydraulic conductivity in the low suction range is also larger than the input value further the calculated hydraulic gradients and water flow rates at measuring sections were compared with the real values as an example the input hcc is the hcc indirectly determined by the van genuchten mualem model as shown in fig 15 the calculated hydraulic gradient is accurate in both low and high suction ranges only for the vertical ponding test when the measuring section is far from the water supply while the calculated water flow rate is quite accurate except for in the capillary rise test taking the horizontal absorption test as an example the process of calculating the hydraulic gradient at low suction is illustrated as shown in fig 16 the suction at the measuring section x 30 cm is 2 95 kpa when t 1 8786 min and is 2 27 kpa when t 2 12 557 min when using eq 10a for calculating the hydraulic gradient i t 2 the error is very large because the real value at 30 δ x f is 4 5 kpa while the adopted value is 2 95 kpa the conclusion is same for the vertical capillary rise test the calculated hydraulic gradient is close to the real value for the vertical ponding test hence the reason why the vertical ponding test allows a higher precision of hcc in low suction range can be explained as follow the hydraulic gradient induced by suction is around 1 when the suction at the measuring section is low the relative error of the calculated hydraulic gradient using the horizontal absorption test is large as the hydraulic gradient induced by gravity has the same sign as that induced by suction in the vertical ponding test the relative error of the hydraulic gradient is reduced therefore for the vertical ponding test the assumption that water content profile moves forwards in a parallel manner cannot induce a large error in low suction range for the hcc determination 4 3 3 evaluation of the improved instantaneous profile method in this section the effectiveness of the improved instantaneous profile method and the traditional measures such as controlling the water flow at water supply using spline line to represent the water content and suction profiles was verified and compared through numerical horizontal infiltration tests as an example the input hcc is indirectly determined by the van genuchten mualem model for remolded loess for the horizontal infiltration test with one end maintained at saturation i e the horizontal absorption test the first measuring section was put at 27 cm from the water supply end and the four measuring sections with 3 cm spacing were arranged after it for the horizontal infiltration test with controlled water flow at water supply the first measuring section was put at 3 cm from the water supply end to reduce the test duration and the four measuring sections with 3 cm spacing were arranged after it the water supply flow should be slow firstly and then fast the water supply flow rate at the first stage was 1 10 8 cm s which is approximately 5 times the unsaturated conductivity at initial suction this step lasted 57 5 h in the second third and fourth stages the water supply flow rate and test duration were 5 10 8 cm s and 16 7 h 1 10 7 cm s and 6 9 h and 2 10 7 cm s and 6 4 h respectively the numerical test adopting only one uniform water supply flow rate 1 10 8 cm s lasting 95 h was also carried out in all the tests the second measuring section was selected as the calculation section for the first test original and improved instantaneous profile methods were used to determine the hccs for the latter two tests only the original instantaneous profile method was used to determine the hcc fig 17 shows the determined hccs and the input hcc it can be seen that there is some gap between the determined hccs and the input hcc especially in high suction range for the horizontal absorption test the improved instantaneous profile method can reduce the error significantly compared with the original method and the accuracy is close to that by controlling the water flow at water supply for only one uniform flow rate at water supply the water content at the fifth measuring section started to increase when the suction at the second measuring section reached approximately 33 kpa thus this test only gave the hcc for suction from the initial value to 33 kpa which was limited compared with the multi step controlled water supply flow rate test to ascertain the error of calculated hydraulic gradient or water flow rate those calculated values were compared with real values as shown in fig 18 for the three tests the hydraulic gradient in high suction range calculated by the original method or improved method is smaller than the real value and the water flow rate is larger than the real value compared with the original method used in the horizontal absorption test both improved instantaneous profile method and controlling the water flow at water supply can improve the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient and water flow rate greatly through the numerical vertical capillary rise test with one end of soil column maintained at saturation zhang et al 2011 also found that the determined hcc is higher than the input hcc in high suction range they used the spline to fit the measured suction and water content profiles to increase the precision of the hcc determined by the instantaneous profile method and found that the effectiveness was limited to clarify why the fitting method could not increase the precision of hcc fig 19 shows the profiles of real water content and suction compared with represented profiles including the connected linear line the cubic spline and the connected linear line with consideration of the wetting front location it can be also found from fig 19a the trend of cubic spline is wrong compared with the measured suction profile table 1 shows the comparison of calculated hydraulic gradient and water flow rates at calculation section x 30 cm during the time between 2155 3 and 2161 6 min it appears that the accuracy could not be improved by using the cubic spline line to fit the measured water content and suction profiles by contrast using the connected linear line with consideration of the location of the wetting front can increase the precision significantly for the remolded loess the test using the instantaneous profile method with various measures is complex and the accuracy is lower compared with the two former direct methods i e the boltzmann transform method and wetting front advancing method as stated in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 these two direct methods require the first measuring section far enough from the water supply end this will be time consuming for soils with low permeability such as compacted bentonite sand mixture and stiff clay wang et al 2013 su et al 2018 when using these two direct methods since instantaneous profile method has been routinely applied to determine the hccs of these soils the improved instantaneous profile method considering the location of wetting front can be applied to improve the accuracy of hcc determination 5 conclusions three methods for determining hcc of unsaturated soil upon wetting were investigated and improved the effectiveness of the three improved methods was examined by laboratory tests and numerical tests for the boltzmann transformation method a new boltzmann variable was proposed based on the relationship between wetting front advancing distance and time giving rise to an improved hcc determination method applying the improved method to determine the hcc of remolded loess could increase the determination precision the numerical test also indicates that the wetting front advancing distance is not strictly proportional to the square of time however the hccs determined by the original and improved methods show the same precision in the laboratory test the starting time of test is difficult to be determined accurately moreover the soil column near the water supply is almost fully saturated which is different from other sections after wetted in some cases the sample may be not uniform thus the improved boltzmann transform method is also effective for the wetting front advancing method the proposed hydraulic gradient calculation method reduced the fluctuation of hcc when using data recorded with small time intervals the results of a series of numerical tests including the horizontal absorption test the vertical ponding test and the vertical capillary rise test indicated that the calculated hydraulic gradient and water flow rate at the measuring sections far from the water supply in the vertical ponding test are very close to the measured values hence the vertical ponding test is suggested to be adopted for hcc determination and the measuring sections should be placed far enough from the water supply in order to improve the precision of the hcc in low suction range it should be noted this conclusion is drawn through numerical tests and it is necessary to carry out the vertical ponding test to experimentally verify the wetting front advancing method for the instantaneous profile method the improved method using the connected linear line with consideration of the wetting front location to represent the water content and suction profiles was proposed two laboratory tests were analyzed and the results indicated that the improved method can improve the accuracy greatly compared with original method numerical tests indicated that the improved method could significantly improve the precision of hcc determination compared with using the spline to fit the measured suction profile and
