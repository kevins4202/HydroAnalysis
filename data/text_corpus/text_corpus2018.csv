the time taken for the wetting front to reach the column base by 23 9 and 32 2 p 0 05 respectively in comparison with ck whereas the 1 treatment decreased the time taken by only 3 6 in as the time taken for the wetting front to reach the base of the different soil columns corresponded to the treatment order of 5 3 1 ck given the same earthworm cast treatment the length of time for the wetting

of earthworm casts on soil infiltration and evaporation the infiltration capacity and evaporation intensity of soil are mainly affected by characteristics such as soil texture structure and initial water content gill and jalota 1996 an et al 2018 the application of earthworm casts as an exogenous material affects soil water movement in two ways i earthworm casts promote the formation of soil aggregates reduce bd and alter the water movement channels in soil manivannan et al 2009 li et al 2020 and ii the pore structures of earthworm casts influence the hydraulic properties of soil aggregates in unsaturated soil eynard et al 2006 the structure helps to concentrate water within the aggregates peth et al 2010 in our study the migration of the wetting front during the infiltration process slowed significantly after the application of earthworm casts on one hand the addition of earthworm casts facilitates water infiltration by altering the original distribution and arrangement of soil aggregates due to the irregular morphology of the casts new pores are created in the soil and soil porosity increases bottinelli et al 2010 on the other hand water movement channels become more complex and convoluted with the rearrangement of soil aggregates limiting water infiltration by decreasing the number of effective pores wang et al 2018 additionally earthworm casts swell and compress the surrounding pores after adsorbing water which lowers the water delivery capacity of pores and reduces the rate of water movement through the soil layers wu et al 2019 the decreased infiltration per unit time is therefore due to the stronger inhibition of infiltration than the promoting effect of the earthworm casts the application of earthworm casts reduces the cumulative evaporation in soil by influencing its structure and properties ouattara et al 2006 found that higher organic matter content can improve the water holding capacity of the soil thereby inhibiting soil evaporation we found that the application of earthworm casts increased the proportion of organic matter in the soil table 3 and subsequently reduced evaporation from the soil moreover the water holding capacity of soil is known to increase as total porosity and microporosity increase houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 the application of earthworm casts in our study increased the total porosity and capillary porosity of the soil table 3 which likely increased the soil s water holding capacity and lowered evaporation liu et al 2013 found that capillary pore absorption decreases the capillary rising water whereas non capillary pores cut off the capillary connection to the surface soil which in turn inhibits evaporation in comparison with the 1 treatment the 3 and 5 treatments had a more significant effect on soil pore characteristics and evaporation in agreement with the findings of the infiltration process wang et al 2018 also reported a close link between cumulative soil evaporation and soil texture with soils that contain more sand showing higher evaporation therefore differences in the sand content between cs and as may explain the observed differences in evaporation 4 2 effect of earthworm casts on soil salt distribution and movement higher soil porosities facilitate salt leaching and reduce the risk of soil salinization luedeling et al 2005 wang et al 2014 moreover salt leaching decreases the ec of soil at the beginning of evaporation the ec values of the bottom soil were significantly higher than those of the upper soil in agreement kahlown and azam 2003 also reported the downward movement of salt with water and its accumulation near the wetting front therefore at the end of infiltration salt is likely to decrease in the upper soil layer and accumulate in the lower soil layer the salt entering the soil through the infiltration process will increase with increasing cumulative infiltration and gradually accumulate in the deeper soil layers following its downward migration to the wetting front due to evaporation we observed an increase and decrease in the ec values of the upper and lower soil layers respectively the distribution of soil salt is closely related to the movement of soil water hou et al 2020 during evaporation soil salt moves upward with the movement of soil pore water this reduces the salinity of the underlying soil and some of the salt will be retained in the original soil layers during the migration process lopez et al 2007 the salinity of the surface soil in this study therefore increased due to the salt retained after evaporation but the ec value of soil treated with earthworm casts was significantly lower than that of ck soil meanwhile the change in salt content of the surface soil before and after evaporation showed that the earthworm cast treatment could reduce the phenomenon of salt return in the surface soil table s1 our findings concur with those reported by geng and boufadel 2015 who concluded that the application of earthworm casts significantly reduced soil salinity soil sar is an indicator of the development of saline alkali soils whereas soil esp can be used to classify saline alkali soils pistocchi et al 2017 in our study the sar and esp values at 0 20 cm decreased significantly with the application of earthworm casts the variability in esp and sar suggests that the application of earthworm casts can effectively delay soil salinization previous studies have shown that organic fertilizers can reduce soil bd and increase porosity which promotes salt ion leaching tejada et al 2008 wu et al 2018 chaganti and crohn 2015 reported a decrease in soil sar and esp at depths of 0 20 cm in ameliorating saline sodic soil that was amended with compost and leached with reclaimed water furthermore the application of earthworm casts increases the amount of ca2 and mg2 in clay loam and sandy loam soils respectively manivannan et al 2009 accumulated mg2 and ca2 ions can replace na at the cation exchange sites on the soil particles therefore replaced na can migrate downward with the transport of water qadir and oster 2004 this may explain the observed reduction in sar and esp at 0 20 cm in the cast treated soil relative to ck in both soil types the soil cec increased with more concentrated earthworm cast treatments which facilitated the replacement and leaching of na under the same treatment the differences in ec sar and esp between the two soils are due to differences in the composition of the parent soil material 5 conclusions the application of earthworm casts significantly influenced water and salt movement in soil and its effects were closely related to soil type and cast treatment concentrations earthworm casts reduced both evaporation and the rate of water infiltration in both anthrosols and cambisols in most cases the reduction was enhanced with more concentrated cast treatments earthworm casts also significantly altered the soil structure which facilitated the leaching of salt ions reducing the salt content sar and esp of the topsoil our results suggest that the application of earthworm casts under brackish water irrigation can prevent soil salinization by promoting the leaching of salt ions in the soil surface declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

diameter of 1 cm were drilled through the column wall at 10 cm intervals from top to bottom the cs and as soil samples were air dried and then sieved through a 5 mm mesh and divided into four portions each soil portion was uniformly mixed with the corresponding quantity of earthworm casts according to the treatment design the mixed soil and earthworm casts were then packed into the plexiglass

which is conducive to plant growth and microbial activity water loss was measured by weighing the columns once every 3 d additional water was added at the top of the column at the end of the culture three of the six columns from each treatment were analyzed for soil physico chemical properties first soil samples were collected through a hole in each column the water content of these samples was determined using the oven drying method and averaged to obtain the water content of each column on this basis the mean water contents for the ck 1 3 and 5 treatments were 14 2 14 7 15 4 and 16 1 for cs and 12 6 13 1 13 4 and 13 7 for as respectively the surface samples from 0 to 20 cm depths were analyzed for sar and esp samples from each layer were then mixed to determine the physico chemical properties of the soil table 3 the sar and esp were calculated using the following equations 1 s a r n a c a 2 m a 2 2 2 esp exchangeablena cec 100 where na ca2 and mg2 are expressed in mmol l 1

movement experiments which included infiltration and then evaporation tests for the infiltration test mariotte bottles with a height of 50 cm and sectional area 42 cm2 were used to supply the solution to the top of the column with a water head of 3 cm both plexiglass columns and mariotte bottles were marked with calibration lines to observe and calculate the movement process of the soil wetting front in the sample area the groundwater depth is 25 60 m and the salinity of the groundwater is 2 3 g l 1 the solution used in the experiment was artificially prepared according to the salinity 2 g l

was added to the solution for effective observation the depth of the wetting front was continuously recorded until the solution reached the bottom of the soil column all the columns were then placed outdoors for the evaporation test the columns were put under an awning to prevent contamination from precipitation to measure evaporation the columns were weighed at 08 00 am every day for 30 consecutive days using an electronic scale with a measurement range of 0 100 kg and precision of 1 g soil samples were collected from each hole on day 0 10 20 and 30 and their moisture contents were immediately determined the samples were then air dried ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve to determine their salt content the ph and ec were measured using an ion meter lei ci pxsj 216f shanghai

characteristics of the soil wetting front over time are shown in fig 1 the soil type earthworm cast treatment and their interactions significantly influenced the movement of the wetting front p 0 05 table 4 the application of earthworm casts reduced the migration velocity of the wetting front in all treatments except for the 1 treatment in cs in cs the 3 and 5 treatments significantly increased the time taken for the wetting front to reach the column base by 23 9 and 32 2 p 0 05 respectively in comparison with ck whereas the 1 treatment decreased the time taken by only 3 6 in as the time taken for the wetting front to reach the base of the different soil columns corresponded to the treatment order of 5 3 1 ck given the same earthworm cast treatment the length of time for the wetting front to reach the soil column base was significantly shorter in as than in cs p 0 05 compared to cs columns the columns containing as soil with ck 1 3 and 5 treatments showed a reduction in soil infiltration time by 77 3 34 8 53 4 and 51 2 respectively fig 2 shows the effects of earthworm cast application on cumulative soil evaporation the soil type earthworm cast treatment and their interaction significantly affected cumulative soil evaporation p 0 05 table 4 for cs the 3 and 5 treatments significantly decreased cumulative soil evaporation by 5 1 and 9 8 respectively compared to ck p 0 05 whereas the 1 treatment increased cumulative soil evaporation by 1 1 for as the 1 3 and 5 treatments significantly decreased the cumulative soil evaporation by 8 6 12 7 and 20 7 respectively p 0 05 compared to that in ck cumulative soil evaporation was higher in cast treated cs than in cast treated as fig 3 shows the distribution profile of soil water content in each treatment over 30 days the soil water content decreased with soil depth in both as and cs after 20 days we observed a significant difference p 0 05 in the soil water content between the different soil layers for both the 3 and 5 treatments in as and cs the soil type earthworm cast treatment and their interaction significantly affected the soil water content p 0 05 table 4 for cs the initial water contents of the 10 50 cm layers of each column corresponded to the treatment order of 5 3 ck 1 after 20 days of evaporation the 40 60 cm layers in the treated columns contained less water than the same layers in the ck column whereas the 0 40 cm layer contained more water than in the ck column the water content of the 0 40 cm layer increased with increasing cast treatment concentration for as the water content of all the soil layers corresponded to the treatment order 5 3 1 ck 3 2 effect of earthworm casts on ec distribution the distribution profile of ec in each treatment is shown in fig 4 the soil type treatment and the interaction between them significantly affected the distribution of soil ec p 0 05 table 4 in cs the ec of the ck treatment at 0 50 cm 50 60 cm was higher lower than that of the earthworm cast treatments ec values at 0 20 cm increased gradually with time after 20 days of evaporation the ec of all soil layers except for the 10 20 cm layer corresponded to the treatment order of 5 3 1 ck at the end of evaporation the ec at 0 30 cm and 40 60 cm in cast treated soils was lower than at the corresponding depths in the ck soils at 0 30 cm and 40 60 cm ec decreased and increased respectively with increasing treatment concentration for as a higher concentration of earthworm casts decreased ec at all depths except at 30 50 cm after day 10 the ec of cast treated soil at 0 50 cm was higher than that of the ck treatment and maximum ec was observed in the 1 treatment at 0 40 cm however we observed the lowest ec values at 50 60 cm in ck and the highest values in the 5 treatment on day 20 and 30 the ec of the ck treatment was higher than that of all the earthworm cast treatments in all soil layers in comparison with the ck treatment at the end of evaporation ec decreased significantly at 0 10 cm by 37 5 44 6 and 48 2 in the 1 3 and 5 earthworm cast treatments respectively p 0 05 3 3 effect of earthworm casts on the sar and esp of topsoil the application of earthworm casts significantly reduced the soil sar fig 5 in cs the 1 3 and 5 treatments led to decreases in sar values relative to the ck treatment of 2 5 5 7 and 7 6 at the end of the column culture corresponding reductions in as of 3 6 6 6 and 10 9 were also observed compared to the ck treatment in cs the 1 3 and 5 treatments decreased sar values after evaporation by 15 6 26 7 and 31 1 the as columns showed corresponding reductions of 12 2 22 4 and 28 6 respectively soil esp also decreased significantly with the application of earthworm casts fig 6 p 0 05 and in proportion to the treatment concentration at the end of the soil column culture in cs esp values of soil mixed with the 1 3 and 5 treatments were significantly lower by 2 6 5 4 and 7 6 respectively than those in the untreated soil ck the as soil columns showed corresponding reductions of 3 3 4 9 and 6 5 respectively after evaporation esp of cs soil in the 1 3 and 5 treatment columns decreased relative to the ck treatment by 16 5 22 4 and 25 9 respectively the as columns exhibited corresponding reductions of 13 5 17 9 and 22 5 respectively 3 4 correlations between soil evaporation infiltration ec and physico chemical properties table 5 shows the correlations among cumulative soil evaporation wetting front depth ec at 0 20 cm and typical physico chemical properties in both soil types the cumulative evaporation was significantly negatively correlated with soc mwd and capillary porosity p 0 05 but significantly positively correlated with bd p 0 01 the wetting front depth was significantly positively correlated with total porosity in both soils it was also positively correlated with non capillary porosity in as p 0 01 but negatively correlated with non capillary porosity in cs p 0 05 moreover the wetting front depth was significantly negatively correlated with soc mwd bd and capillary porosity p 0 01 highlighting the dominant influence of physico chemical properties on soil infiltration ec was positively correlated with ph bd non capillary porosity and cumulative evaporation p 0 05 but significantly negatively correlated with soc mwd capillary porosity and cec p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effect of earthworm casts on soil infiltration and evaporation the infiltration capacity and evaporation intensity of soil are mainly affected by characteristics such as soil texture structure and initial water content gill and jalota 1996 an et al 2018 the application of earthworm casts as an exogenous material affects soil water movement in two ways i earthworm casts promote the formation of soil aggregates reduce bd and alter the water movement channels in soil manivannan et al 2009 li et al 2020 and ii the pore structures of earthworm casts influence the hydraulic properties of soil aggregates in unsaturated soil eynard et al 2006 the structure helps to concentrate water within the aggregates peth et al 2010 in our study the migration of the wetting front during the infiltration process slowed significantly after the application of earthworm casts on one hand the addition of earthworm casts facilitates water infiltration by altering the original distribution and arrangement of soil aggregates due to the irregular morphology of the casts new pores are created in the soil and soil porosity increases bottinelli et al 2010 on the other hand water movement channels become more complex and convoluted with the rearrangement of soil aggregates limiting water infiltration by decreasing the number of effective pores wang et al 2018 additionally earthworm casts swell and compress the surrounding pores after adsorbing water which lowers the water delivery capacity of pores and reduces the rate of water movement through the soil layers wu et al 2019 the decreased infiltration per unit time is therefore due to the stronger inhibition of infiltration than the promoting effect of the earthworm casts the application of earthworm casts reduces the cumulative evaporation in soil by influencing its structure and properties ouattara et al 2006 found that higher organic matter content can improve the water holding capacity of the soil thereby inhibiting soil evaporation we found that the application of earthworm casts increased the proportion of organic matter in the soil table 3 and subsequently reduced evaporation from the soil moreover the water holding capacity of soil is known to increase as total porosity and microporosity increase houlbrooke and laurenson 2013 the application of earthworm casts in our study increased the total porosity and capillary porosity of the soil table 3 which likely increased the soil s water holding capacity and lowered evaporation liu et al 2013 found that capillary pore absorption decreases the capillary rising water whereas non capillary pores cut off the capillary connection to the surface soil which in turn inhibits evaporation in comparison with the 1 treatment the 3 and 5 treatments had a more significant effect on soil pore characteristics and evaporation in agreement with the findings of the infiltration process wang et al 2018 also reported a close link between cumulative soil evaporation and soil texture with soils that contain more sand showing higher evaporation therefore differences in the sand content between cs and as may explain the observed differences in evaporation 4 2 effect of earthworm casts on soil salt distribution and movement higher soil porosities facilitate salt leaching and reduce the risk of soil salinization luedeling et al 2005 wang et al 2014 moreover salt leaching decreases the ec of soil at the beginning of evaporation the ec values of the bottom soil were significantly higher than those of the upper soil in agreement kahlown and azam 2003 also reported the downward movement of salt with water and its accumulation near the wetting front therefore at the end of infiltration salt is likely to decrease in the upper soil layer and accumulate in the lower soil layer the salt entering the soil through the infiltration process will increase with increasing cumulative infiltration and gradually accumulate in the deeper soil layers following its downward migration to the wetting front due to evaporation we observed an increase and decrease in the ec values of the upper and lower soil layers respectively the distribution of soil salt is closely related to the movement of soil water hou et al 2020 during evaporation soil salt moves upward with the movement of soil pore water this reduces the salinity of the underlying soil and some of the salt will be retained in the original soil layers during the migration process lopez et al 2007 the salinity of the surface soil in this study therefore increased due to the salt retained after evaporation but the ec value of soil treated with earthworm casts was significantly lower than that of ck soil meanwhile the change in salt content of the surface soil before and after evaporation showed that the earthworm cast treatment could reduce the phenomenon of salt return in the surface soil table s1 our findings concur with those reported by geng and boufadel 2015 who concluded that the application of earthworm casts significantly reduced soil salinity soil sar is an indicator of the development of saline alkali soils whereas soil esp can be used to classify saline alkali soils pistocchi et al 2017 in our study the sar and esp values at 0 20 cm decreased significantly with the application of earthworm casts the variability in esp and sar suggests that the application of earthworm casts can effectively delay soil salinization previous studies have shown that organic fertilizers can reduce soil bd and increase porosity which promotes salt ion leaching tejada et al 2008 wu et al 2018 chaganti and crohn 2015 reported a decrease in soil sar and esp at depths of 0 20 cm in ameliorating saline sodic soil that was amended with compost and leached with reclaimed water furthermore the application of earthworm casts increases the amount of ca2 and mg2 in clay loam and sandy loam soils respectively manivannan et al 2009 accumulated mg2 and ca2 ions can replace na at the cation exchange sites on the soil particles therefore replaced na can migrate downward with the transport of water qadir and oster 2004 this may explain the observed reduction in sar and esp at 0 20 cm in the cast treated soil relative to ck in both soil types the soil cec increased with more concentrated earthworm cast treatments which facilitated the replacement and leaching of na under the same treatment the differences in ec sar and esp between the two soils are due to differences in the composition of the parent soil material 5 conclusions the application of earthworm casts significantly influenced water and salt movement in soil and its effects were closely related to soil type and cast treatment concentrations earthworm casts reduced both evaporation and the rate of water infiltration in both anthrosols and cambisols in most cases the reduction was enhanced with more concentrated cast treatments earthworm casts also significantly altered the soil structure which facilitated the leaching of salt ions reducing the salt content sar and esp of the topsoil our results suggest that the application of earthworm casts under brackish water irrigation can prevent soil salinization by promoting the leaching of salt ions in the soil surface declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10091,due to climate change food security and water use associated with paddy rice cultivation in korea are facing great challenges and practical measures are needed to compensate for the negative impacts of climate change transplanting date shift tds has been considered as an adaptation strategy to climate change however its impact on water use water quality and rice production is still unclear this study was designed to assess not only tds but also drainage outlet raising dor as a practical adaptation strategy to climate change we analyzed the impacts of climate change on water use water quality and water productivity in 12 combination scenarios of tds and dor using a well proven apex paddy model according to 10 general circulation models gcms we found that the future runoff and total nitrogen t n load appeared differently in each decade and the future runoff and t n load increased more than the irrigation water and rice yield over the observed period of time due to the effects of the rainfall amount and rainfall intensity rather than the effects of the increased temperature the future rice yield declined continuously as the temperature increased due to the rising co2 however a significantly amount of irrigation water was saved due to the tds according to the dor implementation the future runoff t n load and irrigation water requirement were significantly reduced while the rice yield increased slightly the rm5 scenario which includes both the dor and 40 day delayed tds was ranked as the most effective best management practices bmps with the highest water productivity in all of the scenarios the results of this study indicated that an adequate combination of tds and dor taking into account the weather conditions would mitigate the negative impacts of climate change keywords climate change adaptation apex bmp transplanting date 1 introduction korea has been suffering from water disputes over the limited water supply and deteriorated water quality due to climate change population growth and urbanization in addition sustainable rice production is facing many challenges including labor and water shortages lan et al 2021 in recent years a drought that occurred beginning in june 2015 really affected korea with the amount of rain that year at levels 35 50 below normal bae et al 2019 in particular it caused a lot of damage to large rice paddy fields in midwestern korea and although the drought is localized it is currently ongoing in korea the competition between agricultural water use and non agricultural water resources is at the heart of the issue recent abnormal climate conditions caused by climate change have had a variety of effects on the irrigation supply water quality and crop growth of paddy ecosystems piao et al 2010 ding et al 2020 therefore well prepared adaptation strategies for the threat of climate change are required to respond to climate change for sustainable paddy ecosystems there are useful strategies such as moving cropland shifting planting dates developing new varieties and smart management of water and fertilizer rurinda et al 2015 ding et al 2020 yoon and choi 2020 however the current situation in korea may not be structurally easy for farmers or policy makers to accommodate the aforementioned adaptation strategies this is due to the fact that korean farmers have already used their lands to maximize productivity with intensive input of resources machine farming and free irrigation water in addition many rice cultivators tend to prefer rice farming due to their aging population and rice farming requires relatively less investment and labor than other crops on the other hand most common adaptation strategies may have limitations since yields cannot easily increase due to the water shortages following recent droughts moreover agricultural systems in korea including irrigation supplies and agro machine systems are saturated however rurinda et al 2015 proposed shifting planting dates as a low cost and easy to implement strategy and ding et al 2020 and yoon and choi 2020 also found that a planting date shift can play an important role as a major adaptation strategy under suitable climate conditions while increasing temperatures accelerate crop growth and thereby reduce the time to accumulate biomass hawkins et al 2013 these increases are known to affect the increase in irrigation requirements due to increased evapotranspiration ding et al 2020 yoon and choi 2020 shifting plant dates will affect irrigation water requirements under the aforementioned contradictory phenomenon which will require future evaluation of optimized planting dates in order to utilize water use and crop growth as a possible adaptation plan for climate change yoon and choi 2020 reported that irrigation requirements drastically decreased under future climate conditions while rice yield decreased by approximately 8 20 of that during the optimal growing season ding et al 2020 found that earlier sowing dates in northeast china may have a positive effect on rice production while the amount of irrigation water needed can sharply increase due missing the rainy season in the heading period jalota et al 2012 reported that the altered crop growth stages due to the increased temperature under the future climate are the most feasible and environmentally friendly measures to preserve crop yields various best management practices bmps can be used as possible adaptation strategies for climate change to respond to drought the main mechanism of bmps for paddy rice fields is to reduce drainage runoff and nutrient content by minimizing surface discharge from paddy fields one of the most effective bmps for rice paddy environments is to increase the height of the paddy levee in order to increase the storage capacity and effective rainfall use which is called drainage outlet raising dor yoon et al 2006 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b kamruzzaman et al 2020b found that dor reduced runoff by 25 and total nitrogen t n loads by 13 in the future climate scenarios and song et al 2017 reported that it was a good performing bmp that reduced the total phosphorus loads by 20 under the dor for 46 years of long term simulation with historical weather data therefore proper application of the planting date shift and bmp has significant implications for both water security and food security for the future climate in this regard evaluating the aforementioned adaptation plans for climate change was the primary motivation for our study the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model has been widely used to assess the effects of climate change and the implementation of conservation practices on a small landscape in upland conditions wang et al 2009 cavero et al 2012 bhandari et al 2017 ramirez avila et al 2017 luo and wang 2019 however the apex model has limitations for simulating hydrology and the nutrient cycle in flooded paddy conditions the apex paddy model was recently modified from the original apex model to address these limitations the apex paddy model was used because it allows long term continuous simulations and has powerful and diverse management practices reflecting various agricultural activities williams et al 2015 choi et al 2017 used the apex paddy model to simulate rice yields and evapotranspiration in the future climate scenarios kamruzzaman et al 2020a 2020b recently evaluated the water balance component of the apex paddy model and also used the model to predict the impacts of various bmps on runoff and t n load from paddy environments under future climate change however the apex paddy model has not been used to evaluate the effects on not only irrigation water supply and rice yield but also non structural bmp such as the transplanting date shift tds from paddy fields under the climate change adaptation strategy mentioned earlier this is the primary motivation and novelty for this study the objective of this study was to assess the adaptation strategies of paddy rice ecosystems for climate change first we selected the 10 representative gcms of the approved statistical criteria and adopted dor as the representative bmp for adaptation strategies for climate change second we analyzed the best growing stages of paddy rice and extracted the tds scenarios according to future climate scenarios third we used the apex paddy model to estimate the adaptation impacts of climate change on the runoff water use t n load rice yield and water productivity in future climate scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the experimental paddy fields were located in jeonju in the southwestern region of korea fig 1 and the hydrology water quality and rice yield were monitored for 4 crop years from may 2015 to october 2018 fig 1 shows the location of the experimental field and the installed monitoring equipment i e groundwater well water gauge flume infiltrometer automatic weather station the samples of irrigation and ponded water were collected on a weekly or biweekly basis and they were analyzed for t n concentration using the standard methods of ministry of environment moe 2008 and national institute of environmental research nier 2009 the soil in the experimental field was in the eungog series coarse loamy mixed mesic family of anthraquic eutrudepts national institute of agricultural science and technology niast 2000 one month old rice seedlings oryza sativa cv shindongjin were transplanted in june and harvested in october during the study period the weather and agricultural activities data were collected for the study area including tillage fertilization transplanting and harvest historical data for rice phenology i e transplanting maturity harvest dates rice yields and agricultural activities were collected from the local government and agricultural research extension service korean statistical information service kosis and rural development administration rda 2 2 future climate scenarios we selected the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project 5 gcms and estimated a historical reproducibility procedure in the terms of the spatiotemporal rainfall patterns in 29 cmip5 gcms in korea kim et al 2020a 2020b a non parametric quantile mapping method was used to calibrate the gcm data into meteorological data at the jeonju weather station sun et al 2011 ngai et al 2017 the gcm performances were ranked and selected using approved statistical criteria hwang et al 2018 kim et al 2020a the 10 gcms were selected for high reproducibility and were applied in this study we applied the rcp 8 5 scenario and evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quality and water productivity modeling in the future climate scenarios because of the characteristics leading to high greenhouse gas concentrations over time table 1 shows the comparison of rainfall and temperature characteristics for the 10 selected gcms the future climate scenarios of the 10 gcms that generally appeared were increased rainfall and temperature over the future period and they were analyzed and used to calculate the best rice growing stages in the near future the trends in rainfall characteristics in the 2020 2040s showed a relatively diverse pattern at each decade and the temperature trends gradually increased over the entire period this result was due to the fact that each gcm had its own inherent characteristics with different future climate outcomes hwang et al 2018 2 3 the best growing stage crop growing stages including transplanting heading and harvesting were determined using daily minimum maximum and average temperatures yoon and choi 2020 the starting date for rice cultivation was when average daily temperature exceeded 15 c fig 2 and the ideal rice growth temperature ranged from 25 to 32 c on the other hand rice growth was poor and yield decreased when the temperature exceeded 35 c due to high temperature damage as shown in fig 2 an accumulated temperature above the reference temperature during the growing period was one of the most important criteria for the growth effect of rice yoon and choi 2020 in this study the accumulated temperature was used to calculate the appropriate transplanting date and the best growing season changes were extracted by using the future climate scenarios to simulate rice phenology the changes in the best growing season according to the future climate scenarios were analyzed for the mid late maturing variety of rice shindongjin fig 3 shows the theoretically estimated values from the transplanting date to the harvest date with the entire growing period according to the 10 gcms the transplanting date and total growth period were compared to the observed values in the experimental field and the investigated local values for the region near jeonju the estimated best transplanting dates appeared very diverse in the 10 year cycle and the gcm fig 3 2 4 best management practice in previous studies four representative bmps were evaluated to reduce nonpoint source nps pollution in the paddy rice environment jang et al 2016 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b i e drainage outlet raising dor slow release fertilization soil test based fertilization and a combination of dor and soil test based fertilization yoon et al 2006 also proposed the representative measure of dor to reduce nutrient discharge in paddy fields we selected this bmp as one of the best strategies for adapting to climate change and managing nps pollution in this study the average ponding depths of dor remained at 12 cm during the growing season except for during the early growing season and mid dry season 2 5 adaptation strategies to climate change in the future climate scenarios the transplanting delay was important for evaluating the impact on crop growth and yield table 2 shows the estimated growing stages and agricultural activities resulting from 10 gcms which was considered the baseline scenario for the rice crop simulation the transplanting and harvest dates were conservative in the 10 gcms with a 5 day delay from the last date in the 2040s the transplanting dates in the baseline scenario ranged from may 2nd to may 7th according to each gcm yoon and choi 2020 reported that the optimal transplanting date in the southern regions of korea was delayed by about 45 days between the baseline and the 2050s under the rcp 8 5 scenario therefore we adopted 50 days in 5 steps of 10 days as the transplanting date shift tds scenario at the same time the heading dates and harvest dates were recalculated sequentially each year under each gcm for the future period table 3 presents the scenario combinations considering the effects of different gcms tds and dor application to simulate the apex paddy model 2 6 apex paddy model 2 6 1 model setup apex is a flexible and dynamic agro hydrological model which was designed to evaluate runoff nutrients and crop yield on a field scale williams et al 2015 and can also simulate detailed management practices mbonimpa et al 2015 the apex model uses a generic crop growth model that is capable of simulating growth phenological development and competition between plants for light water and nutrients based on daily heat unit accumulation williams et al 2015 the apex paddy model is a modified version of the apex model that more accurately simulates the water balance and nutrient transport components in paddy fields in flooded conditions choi et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020a the apex paddy model calculated the daily water budget using the following equations apex paddy provides a set of subroutines to simulate water ponding discharge control and paddy management choi et al 2017 if water levels were lower than the irrigation trigger depth it the model responded by irrigating to the irrigation target depth td if the water level was higher than the outlet height h then surface discharge o drainage was incorporated into the model kamruzzaman et al 2020b the apex paddy model calculated the daily water budget using the following equations 1 pd t pd t 1 rf t 2 i r t t d t p d t

et al 2020a 2020b the apex model has convenient interfaces for assembling inputs and interpreting outputs williams et al 2015 choi et al 2017 soil layer properties for the soil types were primarily taken from the niast soil database niast 2000 and field investigations were also conducted field experiment data including weather water quantity and water quality were investigated from 2015 to 2018 and we monitored the inputs of paddy rice growth crop height and plant population as well as crop management inputs such as fertilizer irrigation pest control and harvesting 2 6 2 model calibration and evaluation criteria the calibration methods used for the apex paddy model were the trial and error method and automatic calibration method using apex cute automatic calibration program in apex kamruzzaman et al 2020a model accuracy was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d wang et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 r2 is a statistical indicator of correlation between observed and simulated data and nse is a regularization of the relative magnitude of residual variances the standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error is d the satisfactory performance criteria including r2 nse and d were proposed and described by wang et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2015 for the apex model for example if the daily or monthly r2 0 75 nse 0 70 and d 75 for runoff the monthly r2 0 60 and nse 0 50 for t n and the annual r2 0 85 for crop yield then the model performance would be considered as better than good wang et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 3 results 3 1 model performance for the calibration and validation period as shown in table 4 the model performance for runoff was assessed as very good by moriasi et al 2015 because r2 nse and d for the entire study period were 0 93 0 90 and 97 respectively and the simulation accuracy for the t n load was evaluated as good because r2 nse and d for the total study period were 0 80 0 67 and 0 92 respectively according to statistical model evaluation wang et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 r2 nse and d were 0 90 0 99 and 0 75 respectively and the model performance for rice yield was evaluated as good which occurred during only 4 crop years to overcome this limitation the simulated rice yield was compared with averaged local yield trends from 1989 to 2018 and the simulated results consistently matched with the local values 3 2 effects of climate change adaptation scenarios 3 2 1 runoff for the future period the average runoff for all of the scenarios was approximately 200 260 higher than the observed mean of 210 mm fig 4a because the observed period was in a continuous drought period since 2015 it was higher in the 2020s than in the other two future periods the highest average runoff values of all of the scenarios were 6 6 and 13 0 respectively in the cm4 and rm4 scenarios compared to the cm1 and rm1 scenarios because they were affected by the difference in the total rainfall amounts due to the tds the lowest average runoff values of all of the scenarios appeared in the cm6 and rm6 scenarios the runoff deviation was relatively larger in the 2030s and the outliers were more pronounced in the 2040s which was influenced by the rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity in the future time period table 1 3 2 2 total nitrogen for the future time period the average t n load for all of the scenarios was about 90 160 higher than the observed mean of 46 3 kg ha fig 4b the t n load was higher in the 2020s than during the other two future time periods the t n load in the 6 cm scenarios was relatively higher than that in the 6 rm scenarios showing the highest t n loads in the cm4 and rm4 scenarios the lowest t n loads appeared in the cm1 and rm1 scenarios these t n load trends followed the simulated runoff trends and the deviation and outlier trends for the t n loads also appeared like those of the simulated runoff 3 2 3 total water supply the average total water supply which was rainfall plus irrigation for all of the scenarios over the future period was about 113 140 higher than the observed mean of 1082 mm fig 4c the variations in the total water supply were not large at 2 in each period and they were higher in the 2020 s than during the other two future time periods the average total water supply presented the highest values in the cm1 and rm1 scenarios and then decreased sequentially the outliers were more pronounced in the 2040s with the runoff and t n load being influenced by the rainfall characteristics the total water supply from cm1 to rm6 gradually decreased due to the effects of tds and dor table 5 shows the change in monthly irrigation consumption for each future scenario and can be used to identify the effects of water saving according to the tds the cm1 cm2 rm1 and rm2 scenarios began transplanting in april with the highest amount of irrigation water out of all of the scenarios the differences between the cm1 and cm6 in the total water supply and irrigation water were 12 and 37 respectively and the differences between the rm1 and rm6 were 11 and 40 respectively this is because the rainfall amounts in the transplanting season and total growth periods were different according to tds application 3 2 4 rice yield the average rice yield for all of the scenarios over the future period was 80 106 lower than the observed mean of 6 5 ton ha fig 4d rice yields were higher in the 2020s than during the other two time periods decreasing sequentially from the 2020s to the 2040s due to the increase in days that could cause high temperature damage the rice yields from the cm3 to the cm6 and from the rm3 to the rm6 exceeded the observed average rice yield in the 2020s the lowest of all of the scenarios was shown in the cm1 and rm1 scenarios outliers appeared more in the 2020s and the deviation and outliers were relatively small in the 2040s this trend was different from that of runoff and t n load because it was influenced by temperatures such as high temperature damage over 35 c 3 3 comparison of adaptation strategies to climate change only the cm6 showed a reduction rate of 1 0 in the other cm scenarios which indicated that the tds according to conventional drainage management did not contribute to runoff reduction whereas the runoff in all rm scenarios was up to 23 5 in the rm6 compared to that in the cm1 fig 5a the average annual reduction rate in the t n load presented a similar trend to that of the runoff pattern fig 5b the t n load in all rm scenarios compared to the cm1 decreased to an average of 25 9 showing the effects of dor the irrigation reduction rates increased sequentially in the cm and rm scenarios with the lowest reduction rates being 29 5 and 46 6 in the cm5 and rm5 respectively fig 5c the results shown in fig 5c and table 5 implied that the irrigation supply was reduced due to the effects of tds and bmp application the reduction rate in the rice yield was the highest at 24 2 in the rm4 and the lowest at 1 9 in rm1 and it indicated that the rice yields increased for all of the scenarios that were compared the cm1 baseline without tds and dor application fig 5d the trend for all of the scenarios to be compared was similar to that of the t n load however the variation in the rice yield was relatively smaller than that in the t n load the outliers were more pronounced in the cm 4 and rm4 than in the other scenarios and components overall the rm5 was rated as one of the most effective scenarios for the future time period due to the highest rate of decline in runoff t n load and irrigation and the highest rate of increase in rice yield this result was also confirmed by the water productivity indicator mentioned later in this study the rm4 had the highest reduction rate in t n load and rice yield however the irrigation savings and runoff were relatively lower than those of the rm5 of course effective and practical scenarios can be evaluated differently depending on the climate conditions of each time period according to fig 6 the runoff t n load and total water supply in the rm were 21 4 34 5 and 7 9 lower than those in the cm respectively however the rice yield in the rm was 2 0 higher than that in the cm these results showed that the increased storage capacity by the dor was one of the most effective bmps for reducing nps pollution in paddy fields yoon et al 2006 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b bouman and tuong 2001 also found that a 23 water savings by drainage management contributed to yield reduction of only 6 3 4 water productivity comparison of adaptation strategies to climate change in this study the water productivity index defined as the rice yield kg ha over irrigation water requirement mm was used to consider the effects of both rice yield and irrigation water according to the suggested bmps the water productivity declined sequentially in the 2020 2040s which followed a similar trend to the rice yield pattern fig 7a the average water productivity exceeded the observed mean except for three scenarios in the 2020s five scenarios in the 2030s and six scenarios in the 2040s for example the water productivity in the rm5 compared to that in the cm1 was higher by 49 6 in the 2020s 24 0 in the 2030s and 24 9 in the 2040s the highest of the all scenarios appeared in the rm5 for the entire time period and the cm6 and rm6 which were the 50 day delay scenarios of the rice transplanting date were not adequate adaptation scenarios for climate change in both conventional and dor management as shown in fig 7b the peaks in the reduction rate of water productivity were in the cm5 and rm5 and the trends in all scenarios were similar to those of the rice yields the water productivity in the rm was 33 2 higher than that in the cm fig 7c and the total water supply between the two scenarios was 34 5 with a similar percentage difference however the reduction rate in rice yield was only 2 0 between the two cases 4 discussions 4 1 the characteristics of weather conditions climate change and adaptation involve uncertainty and the characteristics of precipitation patterns resulting from 10 gcms were relatively different as is shown in table 1 the characteristics of weather conditions according to different gcms can also be projected into various patterns in the runoff t n load and crop growth simulation fig 8 shows the comparison results of annual rainfall intensity temperature over 35 temperature from 20 to 32 and accumulated water nitrogen and temperature stress over the next three decades the runoff shown in fig 4a had a strong positive correlation with the rainfall intensity shown in fig 8a during the crop study period and previous studies have also demonstrated that the surface discharge depends on rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount rainfall intensity and outlet height kamruzzaman et al 2020b kim et al 2020a the rice yield shown in fig 4d which was decreasing sequentially had a negative relationship with a temperature over 35 as is shown in fig 8b and temperature ranging from 20 to 32 as is shown in fig 8c in the 2020 2040s the rice yield declined as the days of temperature over 35 c increased toward the future which was 2 05 times higher in the 2040s compared to the 2020s in each scenario the difference in temperature over 35 was not significant however the changes in the ideal rice growth temperature that ranged from 25 to 32 c showed a high negative correlation with rice yield fig 4d the accumulated water nitrogen and temperature stress simulated by the aex paddy model depended on the reduced growing duration and weather characteristics according to the tds the average water stress was the lowest in the cm5 and rm5 fig 8d and the average nitrogen stress showed the lowest values in the cm4 and rm4 fig 8e the average temperature stress was the lowest in the cm4 cm5 and rm4 and rm5 fig 8f the accumulated water and temperature stresses over each of the decades did not differ significantly however the accumulated nitrogen stress differed every decade due to the shortened crop duration according to the warming from climate change 4 2 the characteristics of flooded paddy conditions the rice growing duration theoretically decreased by 28 days until 2049 as shown in fig 3 and ding et al 2020 anticipated a decrease of 30 days by the end of this century wang et al 2014 and yoon and choi 2020 also reported that the rice growing duration was similarly shortened due to the increasing temperatures rice yields decreased by 20 in the cm1 and rm1 without tds and with dor application 5 in the cm4 with a 30 day transplanting date delay and 3 in the rm4 with a 30 day delayed tds and dor application in the 2040s fig 4d and ding et al 2020 found that the rice yield declined by up to 19 the reason for the yield reduction was that the shortened rice life cycle dramatically reduced the available radiation duration as well as nutrients and co2 for biomass accumulation springate and kover 2014 ding et al 2020 most climate change studies around world have reported that the trends in crop yield decline in the future will be generally due to shortened growth durations ding et al 2020 however proper tds 30 and 40 day delay scenarios shown in fig 4d and dor application can reduce the loss of rice yield by up to 5 due to the highly efficient use of effective rainfall and nutrients in ponding conditions as a result of the increased storage of rainwater by the raised drainage outlet height yoon et al 2006 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b which was evaluated as an alternative measure for climate change adaptation 4 3 assessment of adaptation strategies the prolonged crop growth windows under increasing temperatures were identified to help with the selection of a tds to save water and improve water quality the total water supply in the future periods differed significantly across the different scenarios of tds and dor application fig 4c and table 5 the increased solar radiation and temperature could boost evapotranspiration however the efficient rainwater use during the rainy season and dor and shortened growth duration such as in the rm5 significantly reduced irrigation water by up to 17 figs 4c and 5c in addition ding et al 2020 also presented that the notably shortened growth duration could reduce the net irrigation requirement for rice our simulation also presented that advised adaptation strategies improve the water productivity most of the estimated water productivity values were above the observed one but the water productivity gradually declined under the future climate among other scenarios the rm5 showed the highest water productivity fig 7 which means that this scenario used irrigation water most efficiently during the rainy season table 5 this indicate that avoiding traditional transplanting seasons can be one of the most important bmps for reducing irrigation water demand this result was due to the fact that the transplanting season from april to may required a lot of irrigation water while the climate in korea has a temperate monsoon and about 70 of the total annual precipitation falls from june to september kim et al 2020a for example during the last 5 years since 2013 it has been very difficult to maintain effective storage levels of agricultural reservoirs and a number of farmers have used supplementary water sources such as groundwater during this time period agricultural reservoir stages decreased below 75 of normal agricultural reservoir stages bae et al 2019 however the bmps effectiveness and their water savings at the field scale in most cases can lead to other patterns of water consumption at the watershed scale due to uncertainties such as applied area placement and operation of bmps her et al 2016 reported that plausible effect achievement of bmps at a watershed scale would require appropriate placement and wide application of bmps as well as significant field scale bmp efficiency 5 conclusions well prepared adaptation strategies for the threat of climate change are required because recent abnormal climate conditions have had a variety of effects on the water quality and water productivity of paddy ecosystems in this study we employed the apex paddy model to explore the adaptation strategies for future climate change on water quality and water productivity in paddy rice fields the transplanting date shift i e tds and implementing drainage outlet raising i e dor were evaluated as pragmatic and robust strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on paddy rice cultivation we found an increase in runoff and t n load under the future climate change which was influenced by rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity rather than increased temperature on the other hand the future rice yield continued to decrease due to the effects of rising co2 however irrigation water saving significantly increased due to the tds the future runoff t n load and irrigation requirements were significantly reduced with the dor application while rice yields were slightly higher in the rm scenarios as compared to those of the scenario without the adaptation strategy the water productivity was the highest with the 40 day delay in the dor scenario and this result implied that the combination of tds and dor application compensated for the negative effects of climate change these results can play a valuable role in food security and sustainable water resources management under anticipated climate crisis due to the heterogeneous agro environments such as different agricultural activities and other environmental variables in depth further researches should be conducted to evaluate various adaptation measures for future climate change with respect to water quality and water productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10091,due to climate change food security and water use associated with paddy rice cultivation in korea are facing great challenges and practical measures are needed to compensate for the negative impacts of climate change transplanting date shift tds has been considered as an adaptation strategy to climate change however its impact on water use water quality and rice production is still unclear this study was designed to assess not only tds but also drainage outlet raising dor as a practical adaptation strategy to climate change we analyzed the impacts of climate change on water use water quality and water productivity in 12 combination scenarios of tds and dor using a well proven apex paddy model according to 10 general circulation models gcms we found that the future runoff and total nitrogen t n load appeared differently in each decade and the future runoff and t n load increased more than the irrigation water and rice yield over the observed period of time due to the effects of the rainfall amount and rainfall intensity rather than the effects of the increased temperature the future rice yield declined continuously as the temperature increased due to the rising co2 however a significantly amount of irrigation water was saved due to the tds according to the dor implementation the future runoff t n load and irrigation water requirement were significantly reduced while the rice yield increased slightly the rm5 scenario which includes both the dor and 40 day delayed tds was ranked as the most effective best management practices bmps with the highest water productivity in all of the scenarios the results of this study indicated that an adequate combination of tds and dor taking into account the weather conditions would mitigate the negative impacts of climate change keywords climate change adaptation apex bmp transplanting date 1 introduction korea has been suffering from water disputes over the limited water supply and deteriorated water quality due to climate change population growth and urbanization in addition sustainable rice production is facing many challenges including labor and water shortages lan et al 2021 in recent years a drought that occurred beginning in june 2015 really affected korea with the amount of rain that year at levels 35 50 below normal bae et al 2019 in particular it caused a lot of damage to large rice paddy fields in midwestern korea and although the drought is localized it is currently ongoing in korea the competition between agricultural water use and non agricultural water resources is at the heart of the issue recent abnormal climate conditions caused by climate change have had a variety of effects on the irrigation supply water quality and crop growth of paddy ecosystems piao et al 2010 ding et al 2020 therefore well prepared adaptation strategies for the threat of climate change are required to respond to climate change for sustainable paddy ecosystems there are useful strategies such as moving cropland shifting planting dates developing new varieties and smart management of water and fertilizer rurinda et al 2015 ding et al 2020 yoon and choi 2020 however the current situation in korea may not be structurally easy for farmers or policy makers to accommodate the aforementioned adaptation strategies this is due to the fact that korean farmers have already used their lands to maximize productivity with intensive input of resources machine farming and free irrigation water in addition many rice cultivators tend to prefer rice farming due to their aging population and rice farming requires relatively less investment and labor than other crops on the other hand most common adaptation strategies may have limitations since yields cannot easily increase due to the water shortages following recent droughts moreover agricultural systems in korea including irrigation supplies and agro machine systems are saturated however rurinda et al 2015 proposed shifting planting dates as a low cost and easy to implement strategy and ding et al 2020 and yoon and choi 2020 also found that a planting date shift can play an important role as a major adaptation strategy under suitable climate conditions while increasing temperatures accelerate crop growth and thereby reduce the time to accumulate biomass hawkins et al 2013 these increases are known to affect the increase in irrigation requirements due to increased evapotranspiration ding et al 2020 yoon and choi 2020 shifting plant dates will affect irrigation water requirements under the aforementioned contradictory phenomenon which will require future evaluation of optimized planting dates in order to utilize water use and crop growth as a possible adaptation plan for climate change yoon and choi 2020 reported that irrigation requirements drastically decreased under future climate conditions while rice yield decreased by approximately 8 20 of that during the optimal growing season ding et al 2020 found that earlier sowing dates in northeast china may have a positive effect on rice production while the amount of irrigation water needed can sharply increase due missing the rainy season in the heading period jalota et al 2012 reported that the altered crop growth stages due to the increased temperature under the future climate are the most feasible and environmentally friendly measures to preserve crop yields various best management practices bmps can be used as possible adaptation strategies for climate change to respond to drought the main mechanism of bmps for paddy rice fields is to reduce drainage runoff and nutrient content by minimizing surface discharge from paddy fields one of the most effective bmps for rice paddy environments is to increase the height of the paddy levee in order to increase the storage capacity and effective rainfall use which is called drainage outlet raising dor yoon et al 2006 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b kamruzzaman et al 2020b found that dor reduced runoff by 25 and total nitrogen t n loads by 13 in the future climate scenarios and song et al 2017 reported that it was a good performing bmp that reduced the total phosphorus loads by 20 under the dor for 46 years of long term simulation with historical weather data therefore proper application of the planting date shift and bmp has significant implications for both water security and food security for the future climate in this regard evaluating the aforementioned adaptation plans for climate change was the primary motivation for our study the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model has been widely used to assess the effects of climate change and the implementation of conservation practices on a small landscape in upland conditions wang et al 2009 cavero et al 2012 bhandari et al 2017 ramirez avila et al 2017 luo and wang 2019 however the apex model has limitations for simulating hydrology and the nutrient cycle in flooded paddy conditions the apex paddy model was recently modified from the original apex model to address these limitations the apex paddy model was used because it allows long term continuous simulations and has powerful and diverse management practices reflecting various agricultural activities williams et al 2015 choi et al 2017 used the apex paddy model to simulate rice yields and evapotranspiration in the future climate scenarios kamruzzaman et al 2020a 2020b recently evaluated the water balance component of the apex paddy model and also used the model to predict the impacts of various bmps on runoff and t n load from paddy environments under future climate change however the apex paddy model has not been used to evaluate the effects on not only irrigation water supply and rice yield but also non structural bmp such as the transplanting date shift tds from paddy fields under the climate change adaptation strategy mentioned earlier this is the primary motivation and novelty for this study the objective of this study was to assess the adaptation strategies of paddy rice ecosystems for climate change first we selected the 10 representative gcms of the approved statistical criteria and adopted dor as the representative bmp for adaptation strategies for climate change second we analyzed the best growing stages of paddy rice and extracted the tds scenarios according to future climate scenarios third we used the apex paddy model to estimate the adaptation impacts of climate change on the runoff water use t n load rice yield and water productivity in future climate scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the experimental paddy fields were located in jeonju in the southwestern region of korea fig 1 and the hydrology water quality and rice yield were monitored for 4 crop years from may 2015 to october 2018 fig 1 shows the location of the experimental field and the installed monitoring equipment i e groundwater well water gauge flume infiltrometer automatic weather station the samples of irrigation and ponded water were collected on a weekly or biweekly basis and they were analyzed for t n concentration using the standard methods of ministry of environment moe 2008 and national institute of environmental research nier 2009 the soil in the experimental field was in the eungog series coarse loamy mixed mesic family of anthraquic eutrudepts national institute of agricultural science and technology niast 2000 one month old rice seedlings oryza sativa cv shindongjin were transplanted in june and harvested in october during the study period the weather and agricultural activities data were collected for the study area including tillage fertilization transplanting and harvest historical data for rice phenology i e transplanting maturity harvest dates rice yields and agricultural activities were collected from the local government and agricultural research extension service korean statistical information service kosis and rural development administration rda 2 2 future climate scenarios we selected the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project 5 gcms and estimated a historical reproducibility procedure in the terms of the spatiotemporal rainfall patterns in 29 cmip5 gcms in korea kim et al 2020a 2020b a non parametric quantile mapping method was used to calibrate the gcm data into meteorological data at the jeonju weather station sun et al 2011 ngai et al 2017 the gcm performances were ranked and selected using approved statistical criteria hwang et al 2018 kim et al 2020a the 10 gcms were selected for high reproducibility and were applied in this study we applied the rcp 8 5 scenario and evaluated the impacts of climate change on the water quality and water productivity modeling in the future climate scenarios because of the characteristics leading to high greenhouse gas concentrations over time table 1 shows the comparison of rainfall and temperature characteristics for the 10 selected gcms the future climate scenarios of the 10 gcms that generally appeared were increased rainfall and temperature over the future period and they were analyzed and used to calculate the best rice growing stages in the near future the trends in rainfall characteristics in the 2020 2040s showed a relatively diverse pattern at each decade and the temperature trends gradually increased over the entire period this result was due to the fact that each gcm had its own inherent characteristics with different future climate outcomes hwang et al 2018 2 3 the best growing stage crop growing stages including transplanting heading and harvesting were determined using daily minimum maximum and average temperatures yoon and choi 2020 the starting date for rice cultivation was when average daily temperature exceeded 15 c fig 2 and the ideal rice growth temperature ranged from 25 to 32 c on the other hand rice growth was poor and yield decreased when the temperature exceeded 35 c due to high temperature damage as shown in fig 2 an accumulated temperature above the reference temperature during the growing period was one of the most important criteria for the growth effect of rice yoon and choi 2020 in this study the accumulated temperature was used to calculate the appropriate transplanting date and the best growing season changes were extracted by using the future climate scenarios to simulate rice phenology the changes in the best growing season according to the future climate scenarios were analyzed for the mid late maturing variety of rice shindongjin fig 3 shows the theoretically estimated values from the transplanting date to the harvest date with the entire growing period according to the 10 gcms the transplanting date and total growth period were compared to the observed values in the experimental field and the investigated local values for the region near jeonju the estimated best transplanting dates appeared very diverse in the 10 year cycle and the gcm fig 3 2 4 best management practice in previous studies four representative bmps were evaluated to reduce nonpoint source nps pollution in the paddy rice environment jang et al 2016 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b i e drainage outlet raising dor slow release fertilization soil test based fertilization and a combination of dor and soil test based fertilization yoon et al 2006 also proposed the representative measure of dor to reduce nutrient discharge in paddy fields we selected this bmp as one of the best strategies for adapting to climate change and managing nps pollution in this study the average ponding depths of dor remained at 12 cm during the growing season except for during the early growing season and mid dry season 2 5 adaptation strategies to climate change in the future climate scenarios the transplanting delay was important for evaluating the impact on crop growth and yield table 2 shows the estimated growing stages and agricultural activities resulting from 10 gcms which was considered the baseline scenario for the rice crop simulation the transplanting and harvest dates were conservative in the 10 gcms with a 5 day delay from the last date in the 2040s the transplanting dates in the baseline scenario ranged from may 2nd to may 7th according to each gcm yoon and choi 2020 reported that the optimal transplanting date in the southern regions of korea was delayed by about 45 days between the baseline and the 2050s under the rcp 8 5 scenario therefore we adopted 50 days in 5 steps of 10 days as the transplanting date shift tds scenario at the same time the heading dates and harvest dates were recalculated sequentially each year under each gcm for the future period table 3 presents the scenario combinations considering the effects of different gcms tds and dor application to simulate the apex paddy model 2 6 apex paddy model 2 6 1 model setup apex is a flexible and dynamic agro hydrological model which was designed to evaluate runoff nutrients and crop yield on a field scale williams et al 2015 and can also simulate detailed management practices mbonimpa et al 2015 the apex model uses a generic crop growth model that is capable of simulating growth phenological development and competition between plants for light water and nutrients based on daily heat unit accumulation williams et al 2015 the apex paddy model is a modified version of the apex model that more accurately simulates the water balance and nutrient transport components in paddy fields in flooded conditions choi et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020a the apex paddy model calculated the daily water budget using the following equations apex paddy provides a set of subroutines to simulate water ponding discharge control and paddy management choi et al 2017 if water levels were lower than the irrigation trigger depth it the model responded by irrigating to the irrigation target depth td if the water level was higher than the outlet height h then surface

et al 2020a 2020b the apex model has convenient interfaces for assembling inputs and interpreting outputs williams et al 2015 choi et al 2017 soil layer properties for the soil types were primarily taken from the niast soil database niast 2000 and field investigations were also conducted field experiment data including weather water quantity and water quality were investigated from 2015 to 2018 and we monitored the inputs of paddy rice growth crop height and plant population as well as crop management inputs such as fertilizer irrigation pest control and harvesting 2 6 2 model calibration and evaluation criteria the calibration methods used for the apex paddy model were the trial and error method and automatic calibration method using apex cute automatic calibration program in apex kamruzzaman et al 2020a model accuracy was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d wang et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 r2 is a statistical indicator of correlation between observed and simulated data and nse is a regularization of the relative magnitude of residual variances the standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error is d the satisfactory performance criteria including r2 nse and d were proposed and described by wang et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2015 for the apex model for example if the daily or monthly r2 0 75 nse 0 70 and d 75 for runoff the monthly r2 0 60 and nse 0 50 for t n and the annual r2 0 85 for crop yield then the model performance would be considered as better than good wang et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 3 results 3 1 model performance for the calibration and validation period as shown in table 4 the model performance for runoff was assessed as very good by moriasi et al 2015 because r2 nse and d for the entire study period were 0 93 0 90 and 97 respectively and the simulation accuracy for the t n load was evaluated as good because r2 nse and d for the total study period were 0 80 0 67 and 0 92 respectively according to statistical model evaluation wang et al 2012 moriasi et al 2015 r2 nse and d were 0 90 0 99 and 0 75 respectively and the model performance for rice yield was evaluated as good which occurred during only 4 crop years to overcome this limitation the simulated rice yield was compared with averaged local yield trends from 1989 to 2018 and the simulated results consistently matched with the local values 3 2 effects of climate change adaptation scenarios 3 2 1 runoff for the future period the average runoff for all of the scenarios was approximately 200 260 higher than the observed mean of 210 mm fig 4a because the observed period was in a continuous drought period since 2015 it was higher in the 2020s than in the other two future periods the highest average runoff values of all of the scenarios were 6 6 and 13 0 respectively in the cm4 and rm4 scenarios compared to the cm1 and rm1 scenarios because they were affected by the difference in the total rainfall amounts due to the tds the lowest average runoff values of all of the scenarios appeared in the cm6 and rm6 scenarios the runoff deviation was relatively larger in the 2030s and the outliers were more pronounced in the 2040s which was influenced by the rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity in the future time period table 1 3 2 2 total nitrogen for the future time period the average t n load for all of the scenarios was about 90 160 higher than the observed mean of 46 3 kg ha fig 4b the t n load was higher in the 2020s than during the other two future time periods the t n load in the 6 cm scenarios was relatively higher than that in the 6 rm scenarios showing the highest t n loads in the cm4 and rm4 scenarios the lowest t n loads appeared in the cm1 and rm1 scenarios these t n load trends followed the simulated runoff trends and the deviation and outlier trends for the t n loads also appeared like those of the simulated runoff 3 2 3 total water supply the average total water supply which was rainfall plus irrigation for all of the scenarios over the future period was about 113 140 higher than the observed mean of 1082 mm fig 4c the variations in the total water supply were not large at 2 in each period and they were higher in the 2020 s than during the other two future time periods the average total water supply presented the highest values in the cm1 and rm1 scenarios and then decreased sequentially the outliers were more pronounced in the 2040s with the runoff and t n load being influenced by the rainfall characteristics the total water supply from cm1 to rm6 gradually decreased due to the effects of tds and dor table 5 shows the change in monthly irrigation consumption for each future scenario and can be used to identify the effects of water saving according to the tds the cm1 cm2 rm1 and rm2 scenarios began transplanting in april with the highest amount of irrigation water out of all of the scenarios the differences between the cm1 and cm6 in the total water supply and irrigation water were 12 and 37 respectively and the differences between the rm1 and rm6 were 11 and 40 respectively this is because the rainfall amounts in the transplanting season and total growth periods were different according to tds application 3 2 4 rice yield the average rice yield for all of the scenarios over the future period was 80 106 lower than the observed mean of 6 5 ton ha fig 4d rice yields were higher in the 2020s than during the other two time periods decreasing sequentially from the 2020s to the 2040s due to the increase in days that could cause high temperature damage the rice yields from the cm3 to the cm6 and from the rm3 to the rm6 exceeded the observed average rice yield in the 2020s the lowest of all of the scenarios was shown in the cm1 and rm1 scenarios outliers appeared more in the 2020s and the deviation and outliers were relatively small in the 2040s this trend was different from that of runoff and t n load because it was influenced by temperatures such as high temperature damage over 35 c 3 3 comparison of adaptation strategies to climate change only the cm6 showed a reduction rate of 1 0 in the other cm scenarios which indicated that the tds according to conventional drainage management did not contribute to runoff reduction whereas the runoff in all rm scenarios was up to 23 5 in the rm6 compared to that in the cm1 fig 5a the average annual reduction rate in the t n load presented a similar trend to that of the runoff pattern fig 5b the t n load in all rm scenarios compared to the cm1 decreased to an average of 25 9 showing the effects of dor the irrigation reduction rates increased sequentially in the cm and rm scenarios with the lowest reduction rates being 29 5 and 46 6 in the cm5 and rm5 respectively fig 5c the results shown in fig 5c and table 5 implied that the irrigation supply was reduced due to the effects of tds and bmp application the reduction rate in the rice yield was the highest at 24 2 in the rm4 and the lowest at 1 9 in rm1 and it indicated that the rice yields increased for all of the scenarios that were compared the cm1 baseline without tds and dor application fig 5d the trend for all of the scenarios to be compared was similar to that of the t n load however the variation in the rice yield was relatively smaller than that in the t n load the outliers were more pronounced in the cm 4 and rm4 than in the other scenarios and components overall the rm5 was rated as one of the most effective scenarios for the future time period due to the highest rate of decline in runoff t n load and irrigation and the highest rate of increase in rice yield this result was also confirmed by the water productivity indicator mentioned later in this study the rm4 had the highest reduction rate in t n load and rice yield however the irrigation savings and runoff were relatively lower than those of the rm5 of course effective and practical scenarios can be evaluated differently depending on the climate conditions of each time period according to fig 6 the runoff t n load and total water supply in the rm were 21 4 34 5 and 7 9 lower than those in the cm respectively however the rice yield in the rm was 2 0 higher than that in the cm these results showed that the increased storage capacity by the dor was one of the most effective bmps for reducing nps pollution in paddy fields yoon et al 2006 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b bouman and tuong 2001 also found that a 23 water savings by drainage management contributed to yield reduction of only 6 3 4 water productivity comparison of adaptation strategies to climate change in this study the water productivity index defined as the rice yield kg ha over irrigation water requirement mm was used to consider the effects of both rice yield and irrigation water according to the suggested bmps the water productivity declined sequentially in the 2020 2040s which followed a similar trend to the rice yield pattern fig 7a the average water productivity exceeded the observed mean except for three scenarios in the 2020s five scenarios in the 2030s and six scenarios in the 2040s for example the water productivity in the rm5 compared to that in the cm1 was higher by 49 6 in the 2020s 24 0 in the 2030s and 24 9 in the 2040s the highest of the all scenarios appeared in the rm5 for the entire time period and the cm6 and rm6 which were the 50 day delay scenarios of the rice transplanting date were not adequate adaptation scenarios for climate change in both conventional and dor management as shown in fig 7b the peaks in the reduction rate of water productivity were in the cm5 and rm5 and the trends in all scenarios were similar to those of the rice yields the water productivity in the rm was 33 2 higher than that in the cm fig 7c and the total water supply between the two scenarios was 34 5 with a similar percentage difference however the reduction rate in rice yield was only 2 0 between the two cases 4 discussions 4 1 the characteristics of weather conditions climate change and adaptation involve uncertainty and the characteristics of precipitation patterns resulting from 10 gcms were relatively different as is shown in table 1 the characteristics of weather conditions according to different gcms can also be projected into various patterns in the runoff t n load and crop growth simulation fig 8 shows the comparison results of annual rainfall intensity temperature over 35 temperature from 20 to 32 and accumulated water nitrogen and temperature stress over the next three decades the runoff shown in fig 4a had a strong positive correlation with the rainfall intensity shown in fig 8a during the crop study period and previous studies have also demonstrated that the surface discharge depends on rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount rainfall intensity and outlet height kamruzzaman et al 2020b kim et al 2020a the rice yield shown in fig 4d which was decreasing sequentially had a negative relationship with a temperature over 35 as is shown in fig 8b and temperature ranging from 20 to 32 as is shown in fig 8c in the 2020 2040s the rice yield declined as the days of temperature over 35 c increased toward the future which was 2 05 times higher in the 2040s compared to the 2020s in each scenario the difference in temperature over 35 was not significant however the changes in the ideal rice growth temperature that ranged from 25 to 32 c showed a high negative correlation with rice yield fig 4d the accumulated water nitrogen and temperature stress simulated by the aex paddy model depended on the reduced growing duration and weather characteristics according to the tds the average water stress was the lowest in the cm5 and rm5 fig 8d and the average nitrogen stress showed the lowest values in the cm4 and rm4 fig 8e the average temperature stress was the lowest in the cm4 cm5 and rm4 and rm5 fig 8f the accumulated water and temperature stresses over each of the decades did not differ significantly however the accumulated nitrogen stress differed every decade due to the shortened crop duration according to the warming from climate change 4 2 the characteristics of flooded paddy conditions the rice growing duration theoretically decreased by 28 days until 2049 as shown in fig 3 and ding et al 2020 anticipated a decrease of 30 days by the end of this century wang et al 2014 and yoon and choi 2020 also reported that the rice growing duration was similarly shortened due to the increasing temperatures rice yields decreased by 20 in the cm1 and rm1 without tds and with dor application 5 in the cm4 with a 30 day transplanting date delay and 3 in the rm4 with a 30 day delayed tds and dor application in the 2040s fig 4d and ding et al 2020 found that the rice yield declined by up to 19 the reason for the yield reduction was that the shortened rice life cycle dramatically reduced the available radiation duration as well as nutrients and co2 for biomass accumulation springate and kover 2014 ding et al 2020 most climate change studies around world have reported that the trends in crop yield decline in the future will be generally due to shortened growth durations ding et al 2020 however proper tds 30 and 40 day delay scenarios shown in fig 4d and dor application can reduce the loss of rice yield by up to 5 due to the highly efficient use of effective rainfall and nutrients in ponding conditions as a result of the increased storage of rainwater by the raised drainage outlet height yoon et al 2006 song et al 2017 kamruzzaman et al 2020b which was evaluated as an alternative measure for climate change adaptation 4 3 assessment of adaptation strategies the prolonged crop growth windows under increasing temperatures were identified to help with the selection of a tds to save water and improve water quality the total water supply in the future periods differed significantly across the different scenarios of tds and dor application fig 4c and table 5 the increased solar radiation and temperature could boost evapotranspiration however the efficient rainwater use during the rainy season and dor and shortened growth duration such as in the rm5 significantly reduced irrigation water by up to 17 figs 4c and 5c in addition ding et al 2020 also presented that the notably shortened growth duration could reduce the net irrigation requirement for rice our simulation also presented that advised adaptation strategies improve the water productivity most of the estimated water productivity values were above the observed one but the water productivity gradually declined under the future climate among other scenarios the rm5 showed the highest water productivity fig 7 which means that this scenario used irrigation water most efficiently during the rainy season table 5 this indicate that avoiding traditional transplanting seasons can be one of the most important bmps for reducing irrigation water demand this result was due to the fact that the transplanting season from april to may required a lot of irrigation water while the climate in korea has a temperate monsoon and about 70 of the total annual precipitation falls from june to september kim et al 2020a for example during the last 5 years since 2013 it has been very difficult to maintain effective storage levels of agricultural reservoirs and a number of farmers have used supplementary water sources such as groundwater during this time period agricultural reservoir stages decreased below 75 of normal agricultural reservoir stages bae et al 2019 however the bmps effectiveness and their water savings at the field scale in most cases can lead to other patterns of water consumption at the watershed scale due to uncertainties such as applied area placement and operation of bmps her et al 2016 reported that plausible effect achievement of bmps at a watershed scale would require appropriate placement and wide application of bmps as well as significant field scale bmp efficiency 5 conclusions well prepared adaptation strategies for the threat of climate change are required because recent abnormal climate conditions have had a variety of effects on the water quality and water productivity of paddy ecosystems in this study we employed the apex paddy model to explore the adaptation strategies for future climate change on water quality and water productivity in paddy rice fields the transplanting date shift i e tds and implementing drainage outlet raising i e dor were evaluated as pragmatic and robust strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on paddy rice cultivation we found an increase in runoff and t n load under the future climate change which was influenced by rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity rather than increased temperature on the other hand the future rice yield continued to decrease due to the effects of rising co2 however irrigation water saving significantly increased due to the tds the future runoff t n load and irrigation requirements were significantly reduced with the dor application while rice yields were slightly higher in the rm scenarios as compared to those of the scenario without the adaptation strategy the water productivity was the highest with the 40 day delay in the dor scenario and this result implied that the combination of tds and dor application compensated for the negative effects of climate change these results can play a valuable role in food security and sustainable water resources management under anticipated climate crisis due to the heterogeneous agro environments such as different agricultural activities and other environmental variables in depth further researches should be conducted to evaluate various adaptation measures for future climate change with respect to water quality and water productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10092,the production and consumption of avocado has increased significantly over the past years experiencing a steady expansion into new markets around the world this review paper focuses on avocado cultivation in its new markets with hot summer mediterranean climate a significant literature gap exists on the viability of this crop in such data environments which experience limited availability of water in the summer exacerbated by climate change and potential salinity issues in irrigation water typical in coastal regions strategies for handling salinity usually aim at preventing the build up of salts in the root zone while studies on the response of avocado trees to saline water have shown that it is highly influenced by rootstock selection in this review paper priority is given to the appropriate irrigation water characteristics both in terms of quantity and quality for different tree sizes soil characteristics and irrigation methods including the use of reclaimed wastewater also the effects of irrigation frequency amount on fruit productivity are studied this review also highlights the role of fertigation as well as the importance of a soil moisture and salinity monitoring it is strongly suggested to use soil moisture sensor networks precision agriculture in avocado cultivations to optimize irrigation management and promote water sustainability given the increasing dynamic in the expansion of this crop especially in european countries with this climate type such as southern italy spain greece turkey and cyprus among others this review paper is expected to provide guidance on avocado cultivation in these regions with focus on its viability under water scarcity and salinity conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation avocado production extreme climatic conditions salinity fertigation 1 introduction avocado is becoming one of the most financially significant tropical fruits on the global market production and consumption of avocado have expanded drastically in the past 150 years this is attributed to two main factors increased consumption among populaces acquainted with the fruit in the past for example mexico and california and the steady expansion into new markets around the world in countries where avocado was not traditionally consumed before for example europe japan and china schaffer et al 2013 as more countries particular in the mediterranean region produce avocados for trade or become acquainted with the product it is highly likely that the overall production and consumption of avocados will keep increasing globally avocado is primarily consumed fresh but the addition of other value added avocado products for example guacamole and avocado oil used by cosmetics and culinary industries indicate the potential for further market growth duarte et al 2016 as indicated by the transparency market research tmr the worldwide avocado market was valued at us 13 64 bn in 2018 and is anticipated to reach a value of us 21 56 bn by 2026 highlighting the financial importance of the crop according to fao global production of avocado fruits exceeded 6 4 million metric tons mt in 2018 marking an increase of 6 7 from the previous year while the total increase of production from 2000 to 2018 is about 136 fao report 2018 tzatzani et al 2020 avocado is currently produced in about 70 countries with mexico being the largest producer with production exceeding 2 1 mt in 2018 the second largest producer is saint dominic with about 644 000 metric tons t followed by peru indonesia colombia brazil kenya venezuela chile the united states new zealand and others south africa produces about 127 000 t with rising production trends and a very organized export trade in the mediterranean israel is leading with production of about 131 000 t followed by spain 90 000 t morocco 51 000 t turkey 3100 t france 2500 t greece 1700 t cyprus 714 t palestine 677 t and tunisia 333 t faostat 2018 these countries all experience upward trends due to high demand mainly by the european union eu specifically in israel avocado orchards cover an area of about 7000 ha most of the orchards are situated along the coastal plain extending from rosh hanikra in the north to the gaza belt area spain is the european union country with the biggest production of avocado with cultivated areas exceeding 11 000 ha in 2018 the majority of the avocados are grown in andalusia in the subtropical coastal regions of malaga and granada in the south of spain accounting about 86 of the spanish production the main production about 80 of the avocados grown in andalusia are exported to other european union countries with united kingdom germany and france as the most important markets rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2018 nonetheless the andalusian region is presently encountering water shortages and heat extremes which could affect avocado production a situation that is expected to exacerbate in the future due to climate change based on current climate studies conducted for the region moreno ortega et al 2019 in greece the main production of avocado occurs on the island of crete with an estimated cultivated area of 1100 ha the early fuerte the late haas and the earliest zutano are typically cultivated varieties of avocado in the region it is important to mention here that avocado production in crete is growing very rapidly as highlighted by the fact that the cultivated area increased by about 300 between 2019 and 2014 however the island of crete is another mediterranean region expected to be affected by extreme hydrological events droughts and floods based on global climate change model predictions kourgialas 2021 ministry of agriculture of greece 2019 avocado cultivation is also expanding in portugal and italy in portugal there are about 1000 ha of avocado cultivations mostly within the algarve portugal s southernmost region also in the southern italian regions of calabria basilicata and sicily avocado production is steadily increasing domestic consumption is strongly promoted which is much lower than in france and scandinavia in italy there is increased production in sicily mainly of the hass and fuerte varieties however due to high demand that cannot be met locally italy imports large quantities of avocado from the americas and south africa center for the promotion of imports from developing countries cbi 2019 the advancement of irrigation systems was the key factor encouraging the expansion of avocado cultivation in the mediterranean area given that farmers in this region rely heavily on irrigation due to the semi arid and arid climate lahav and whiley 2002 carr 2013 avocado tree growth is rigorous with potential to bear fruit containing 17 oil in excess of 30 t ha wolstenholme and whiley 1995 nevertheless the overall typical avocado yield is commonly low campisi pinto et al 2017 because of high rate of bloom and or fruit abscission garner and lovatt 2008 as well as alternating yearly patterns of high and low yields lovatt 2011 the common factor inducing the above phenomena is the amount frequency and quality of irrigation water holzapfel et al 2017 in spite of avocado s significance in the global market there are a few studies that have focused on the quantification of avocado tree s water needs during all stages of growth and evaluate how the applied quantity of water affects yields silber et al 2019 other researchers studied the effects of climatic and soil conditions on avocado production while others focused on water quality with emphasis on salinity given that farmers are increasingly relying on saline water for irrigation but the information is not summarized in the literature in a comprehensive way recognizing this fact this review focuses on the collection of the available scientific information and research on the following topics a the efficient use of water for avocado cultivation b the sensitivity and resistivity of cultivars and rootstocks under extreme climatic conditions salinity levels and soil characteristics c the optimal climatic and soil conditions for cultivation and optimal cultivation techniques d the proper irrigation water characteristics in terms of quantity and quality under various irrigation methods tree sizes soil characteristics and prevailing climatic condition since avocado is a crop that adapts very well to tropical or subtropical climates that experience significant amounts of relative humidity and rainfall lahav et al 2013 this review paper focuses on typical hot summer mediterranean climate regions for multiple reasons explained below given the significant commercial value and high demand of the product it is desirable to expand its cultivation to other areas that may be less favorable in terms of growth conditions such as the hot summer mediterranean climate limited availability of water in the summer months as well as potential issues with salinity in irrigation water typical in coastal regions make the study of its expansion in such environments a unique research challenge a significant literature gap exists on the viability of this crop in such environments and the effects of climate change a particular challenge for research as there is no review paper in hot summer mediterranean climate to date this review also highlights the crucial role of fertigation as well as the importance of a soil moisture and salinity sensor network in the design of a proper avocado water management plan finally given the increasing dynamic in the expansion of this crop especially in european countries with this climate type such as southern italy spain greece turkey and cyprus among others this review paper is expected to provide guidance on avocado cultivation in these regions with focus on its viability under water scarcity and salinity conditions 2 ηot summer mediterranean climate zone production recognizing the crucial role of water in avocado cultivation research efforts focus on furthering our understanding for improving and expanding their production especially in water scarce areas specifically regarding the mediterranean climate zone production there are three sub types a the hot summer mediterranean climate or typical mediterranean climate csa b the warm summer mediterranean climate csb and c the cold summer mediterranean climate csc peel et al 2007 csa is the most common type of the mediterranean climate with average monthly temperatures in excess of 22 c 71 6 f during the warmest month and between 3 and 18 c 26 6 and 64 4 f during the coldest month while the temperature of at least four months must average above 10 c 50 f areas with csa typically experience hot or very hot and dry summers and mild wet winters and are found in the mediterranean sea southwestern south africa southwestern australia sections of central asia the interior of northern california west of the sierra nevada northern sections of iran and iraq and inland areas of southern oregon west of the cascade mountains beck et al 2018 in fig 1 the most common areas with hot summer mediterranean climate around the globe are depicted 3 cultivars and rootstocks for hot summer mediterranean climate conditions there are three ecological races of avocado with varietal status within the species persea americana var drymifolia mexican race var guatemalensis guatemalan race and var americana antillean west indian or lowland race the mexican and guatemalan races are both indigenous to tropical highlands where rainfall occurs during the summer and autumn followed by dry winters and springs which is when flowering occurs the adaptation of these races to warm and cool subtropical areas varies with the mexican race being the most cold tolerant race and the antillean the least the most popular varieties are hybrids a result of extensive interracial crossing for example cv fuerte a mexican guatemalan hybrid which used to dominate global production and cv hass developed in california which has now displaced fuerte in most regions with mediterranean climate schaffer et al 2013 the best known varieties that thrive in hot summer mediterranean climates are fuerte bacon edranol hass lamb hass ettinger gwen pinkerton reed and zutano bacon and edranol varieties are seldom planted today due to their susceptibility to various diseases and unsuitability in humid regions bacon or sensitivity to climatic extremes edranol fuerte formerly the world s leading commercial cultivar retains its importance in low humidity environments where disease and insect problems are low schaffer et al 2013 due to its high sensitivity to low temperatures it lost its popularity and was replaced by hass in california at present hass is the most important avocado cultivar in the world and especially in hot summer mediterranean climate areas it accounts for about 90 of the export trade flowering and fruit set of hass are not very sensitive to cold but its leaves are hass leaves are also susceptible to the pest persea mite oligonychus perseae while the medium to thick fruit peel of hass provides moderate protection from pests and diseases lamb hass another cultivar favored in california is increasing in popularity as small plantings are being made in several countries it is very precocious and less susceptible to the persea mite and has a similar or lower resistance to cold than hass the tree is relatively resistant to frost but the fruit is sensitive to chilling injury during storage gwen is very precocious and higher yielding than hass and as a result is more dwarfed under california conditions the tree is very susceptible to damage by persea mite which may cause extensive leaf drop it is not being extensively planted in california due to overbearing which often leads to sun burning of the fruit and poor vegetative growth ettinger cultivated primarily in israel has moderate to heavy production and is an outstanding pollinizer pinkerton and reed have similar cold tolerance to hass tolerating temperatures down to 2 c reed is very precocious consistently producing heavy crops even when trees are older pinkerton is relatively resistant to anthracnose but fruit can have a high percentage of internal fruit disorders including uneven ripening zutano is a cultivar that produces consistent and heavy crops and is predominantly grown in colder regions due to its frost tolerance whiley 1992 schaffer et al 2013 their key features are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary materials section many new avocado rootstocks have now been adapted to various conditions such as cold resistance disease salinity etc the selection of rootstocks must be carefully made according to the needs of each producer and the conditions of their parcel avocado rootstocks were thoroughly reviewed by ben ya acov and michelson 1995 the major attributes sought are resistance to phytophthora cinnamomi plant disease salinity tolerance adaptability to calcareous soils smaller trees and high sustainable yields of quality fruit whiley 1992 willingham et al 2001 2006 and coates et al 2011 reported that rootstocks can significantly influence the incidence of anthracnose on fruit while others have observed their effect on the incidence of internal fruit disorders smith 1993 whiley 2001 poor water quality leading to salinity and calcareous soils plague avocado production in drier regions of the world oppenheimer 1947 identified salinity tolerance in west indian race trees grown in israel later kadman and ben ya acov 1976 selected high producing trees growing under saline conditions and recovered the rootstocks approximately 50 west indian clones were developed as salinity tolerant rootstocks for use by the israeli industry west indian race rootstocks were also found to be highly resistant to lime induced iron chlorosis when trees were grown in calcareous soils while those of the guatemalan race were determined to be highly sensitive ben ya acov and michelson 1995 iron chlorosis and other problems due to alkaline soil conditions have been observed in spain israel greece cyprus and to a lesser degree in california their impact can be reduced through the selection of tolerant rootstocks some israeli rootstocks and south african and californian clones have been evaluated in trials with saline water applications and based on survival and yield data superior selections for california conditions are being identified bender et al 2010 oster and arpaia 1992 mickelbart and arpaia 2002 bernstein et al 2004 and mickelbart et al 2007 have described physiological differences between clonally propagated rootstocks with respect to salinity tolerance table s2 supplementary material summarizes the main characteristics of the most popular rootstocks for hot summer mediterranean climate and their compatibility with other varieties 4 agricultural management strategies in avocado cultivation 4 1 soil and crop management choosing the right site for the establishment of a new avocado plantation should be carefully considered to reduce the likelihood of future problems that are difficult to manage and lead to a non economically viable crop regarding soil conditions important parameters for a successful crop are proper soil ph low carbon content caco3 low salinity good drainage and no historical background of occurrence of soil borne diseases schaffer et al 2013 barikou et al 2018 soil characteristics such as ph percentage of carbonates soil drainage ability and salinity can be determined by soil analysis with salinity levels highly dependent on the quality of the irrigation water in general it is advisable to avoid planting avocado trees when the total calcium content in the soil exceeds 20 or when it is greater than 10 in combination with strongly alkaline ph in particular when soil ph values are above 7 in combination with elevated caco3 values in the soil avocado cultivation is not recommended du plessis and koen 1987 the choice of planting distance is typically the decision of the producer but it has been shown that denser plantings produce higher quantities of fruit also to maximize production there should be a combination of varieties in the same field i e pollinizer in an ideal ratio of 8 1 as well as the presence of bees as young trees are very susceptible to sunburn shade or dyeing of the trunk and arms is recommended to protect them they also require limited fertilization and minimal pruning in the first 2 3 years atucha et al 2013 careful pruning is required to ensure that the tree is not endangered by sunburn while it is recommended to apply a special paste to the incisions to prevent the development of diseases pruning is one of the biggest costs of cultivation but it is absolutely necessary to maintain strong trees and increase fruit size garner and lovatt 2008 groundcover management is also an important parameter worthwhile of attention according to long term studies short term competition of trees for groundcover affects tree growth and fruit productivity less than the deterioration of biological activity and soil conditions in orchard soils in the absence of weeds on the other hand when weeds are present the competition for nutrients and water between weeds and fruit trees can affect tree growth and lead to significant yield losses when compared to weed free groundcover management systems atucha et al 2013 particular attention should be given to the time of fruit harvest because it affects certain characteristics related to oil content if the fruits are harvested before they have the necessary fat they do not acquire the desired organoleptic characteristics and the fruit is qualitatively degraded for the regions of europe in the mediterranean basin in order to ensure the minimum acceptable quality of fruit eu regulation 387 2005 needs to be followed which states a minimum dry matter content of 19 21 depending on the variety is needed to ensure proper ripening commission regulation ec 2005 4 2 adaptability to salinity and excess water 4 2 1 salinity effects avocado trees are considerably sensitive to salinity musyimi et al 2007 deinlein et al 2014 acosta rangel et al 2019 visual symptoms caused by chloride toxicity include leaf tip burn and sometimes along leaf margins while visual sodium toxicity symptoms include necrotic spots near the margin or interior surface of the leaf whiley and schaffer 1994 bender et al 2010 effects of salinity on the physiology of the plant are comparable with other forms of stress stress is mainly the effect of reduced water uptake as well as altered mineral uptake these effects include reduced stomatal conductance transpiration photosynthesis leaf chlorophyll content leaf water potential while increased sub stomatal co2 concentrations were evident salazar garcνa and larque saavedra 1988 musyimi et al 2007 negative effects of salinity on tree growth included decreased root growth delayed appearance of new flushes smaller leaves and reduced yields bernstein et al 2004 musyimi et al 2007 toxicity symptoms of salinity injury to avocado vary depending on the stage of tree development leaf age and nutrition schaffer et al 2013 differences in the severity of damage between production areas suggest that microclimatic factors may also be important in the expression of toxicity symptoms the most commonly observed symptoms are tip and marginal leaf burn eventually resulting in leaf abscission chirachint and turner 1988 the sensitivity of plants to salinity is typically measured as a function of electrical conductivity ec in experimental studies it has been observed that avocado trees are completely unable to extract water from the soil when ec of the soil reaches 4 ds m crowley 2008 in agriculture water with ec values lower than 0 5 ds m is considered of high quality however it is common to use water with ec values within a range of 0 3 ds m avocado fruit yield starts to decline when irrigation water of above 0 75 ds m and chloride concentrations greater than 100 ppm is used the general recommendation is to maintain a 10 20 leaching fraction to keep ec values lower than 2 0 ds m mickelbart et al 2007 crowley 2008 and chloride concentrations below 100 ppm these thresholds vary based on the subject with permissible chloride concentrations for mexican cultivars at 120 150 ppm for guatemalan subjects at 200 250 ppm and for western indian cultivars at 350 500 ppm the salt concentration in the soil is also affected by the amount of water and the method of irrigation strategies for handling salinity usually aim at preventing the build up of salts in the root zone to levels that limit the root water uptake and minimizing the damaging effects of salinity on avocado trees for optimal crop growth light soils have good drainage and are easier to flush than heavy soils the application of microsprinkler irrigation results in a uniform salt concentration at the same depth with a gradual increase in salt concentration as depth increases in the case of drip irrigation lower salt concentration at the water application point and an increase in the radiant salt concentration moving away from it is typically observed fao report 2018 downton 1978 observed that high nacl concentrations 20 mm or 0 02 mol l of soil saturated paste extract reduced the numbers of flowers per bud floral buds flowers per inflorescence and inflorescences per bud of fuerte scions grafted on to mexican and guatemalan rootstocks mickelbart et al 2007 studied the effect of different rootstocks on the distribution of na cl and k in young hass trees they found that measurements of cl and the na k ratio in old leaves could be an appropriate index for screening salinity tolerance because tolerance involves minimizing the flow of cl and na to the leaves salinity affects leaf mineral content in different ways for example salinity increases the concentration of k na cl zn and cu decreases the concentration of n p mg and mn while it does not significantly affect the concentration of ca fe and b celis et al 2018 a number of studies demonstrated that increased n applications to avocado trees reduce the leaf cl concentration and leaves damage haas and brusca 1955 crowley 2008 celis et al 2018 in potted mexican and west indian race seedlings bar et al 1991 reported that when trees were supplied with cl at 2 4 8 or 16 mm they developed toxicity symptoms that were severe at 16 mm of cl however when nitrate at 16 mm was added to the potting medium no cl damage was observed as the plants preferentially took up nitrate they proposed that where cl is a problem the use of potassium nitrate as a fertilizer may be a practical and simple way to reduce salinity damage to trees crowley 2008 draws attention to the need to balance increased water use efficiency with the management of salinity strategies are the selection of rootstocks that tolerate saline soils the quality of irrigation water timing of irrigation and monitoring of the electrical conductivity ec of irrigation water and soil and the amount of water needed to leach salts below the root zone salinity remains a critical challenge in avocado cultivation threatening the long term sustainability of the avocado industry especially in semi arid production areas with low rainfall and poor water quality resulting in higher salt accumulation in soil whiley and schaffer 1994 taking into consideration that in many coastal avocado producing areas with hot summer mediterranean climate saltwater intrusion phenomena occur and rainfall is general limited salt accumulation in the soil is a common phenomenon studies have shown that salt sensitivity of avocado is influenced by rootstock selection thus it is crucial to identify and use rootstocks that are tolerant to saline water irrigation 4 2 2 rootstocks and salt tolerance as mentioned above it is crucial to evaluate avocado rootstocks in terms of salt tolerance and assess the relationship between leaf ion concentrations trunk diameter leaf burn and fruit yield to this end celis et al 2018 conducted an experiment using 156 avocado trees arranged in a random complete block design which were treated with saline 1 5 ds m and non saline 0 65 ds m irrigation water based on their results dusa rootstock was the most salt tolerant achieving the largest yields survival percentages and trunk diameters under the saline treatment on the contrary topa topa rootstock was the most sensitive to salinity the researchers found that parameters related to fruit yield and tree growth correlated well with leaf cl concentration indicating chloride toxicity as a main parameter affecting avocado trees irrigated with saline water in another study oster and arpaia 1992 investigated how rootstock affects fruit weight and health with an emphasis on hass avocado trees treated with saline irrigation water they found that rootstock affects leaf area and biomass accumulation in leaves and stems of avocado trees suggesting that leaf biomass production per branch could be used as an indicator of salinity tolerance bernstein et al 2004 mickelbart et al 2007 also focused on hass avocado trees treated with saline water and examined the tissue ion concentration in trees grafted onto a variety of rootstocks they found that the ion exclusion ability of avocado rootstocks and salinity tolerance can be identified using cl concentration and na k ratios in old leaves as markers castro et al 2009 examined plant material from the cv hass to find possible salt tolerance rootstocks among the following seedlings clonal nabal duke 7 degania 117 zutano and mexicola in all cases plant growth and nutrient content were compared with control plants 30 ppm of cl and plants treated with 200 ppm cl for 130 days using nacl in the nutrient solution 5 64 mm their results indicated no interaction between nacl and the rootstocks for the plant growth parameters the nabal rootstock was found to retain the highest levels of chloride concentration in the roots and lowest in the leaves of the plant compared to the other rootstocks tested in this study making it a promising candidate in terms of salt tolerance 4 2 3 reclaimed wastewater for irrigation another crucial issue for hot mediterranean climates closely related to salinity is the irrigation of avocado trees with reclaimed water reclaimed wastewater could be a major water supply source for agriculture in many water scarce areas where freshwater is unavailable or costly kourgialas 2021 recent reports have shown that long term irrigation 7 years with treated wastewater in avocado orchards causes detrimental effects on soil leading to disturbance in tree performance and yield reduction specifically in clay soils long term irrigation with reused wastewater leads to soil salinity poor aeration and destruction of soil aggregates and structure assouline et al 2016 nemera et al 2020 a ten year study of avocado orchards in israel indicated a 20 40 yield reduction when the source of irrigation water was reclaimed wastewater compared to freshwater assouline and narkis 2013 the reason for this observed yield reduction is attributed to the fact that salt introduced with treated wastewater in combination with high evapotranspiration and salt exclusion by roots can lead to an osmotic effect that directly affects avocado s ability to absorb water and nutrients paudel et al 2018 assouline et al 2015 also the destruction of soil aggregates as well as the poor soil aeration as consequences of the applied treated wastewater reduce leaching efficiency in the soil profile and activity of microbial organisms assouline and narkis 2013 seferou et al 2013 based on the above and taking into consideration that avocado trees are generally sensitive to salinity irrigation with reclaimed wastewater could become problematic when adequate drainage is not maintained pedrero et al 2010 a common irrigation practice to remove the accumulated soil salt below the root zone is leaching with excess water under low frequency time intervals however this practice especially in water scarce areas is under debate due to the high cost of water and its impact on the environment assouline et al 2015 kourgialas et al 2016 alternatives of good mitigation techniques for avocado orchards in water scarce areas under hot mediterranean climate conditions recommended by nemera et al 2020 include mixing freshwater and treated wastewater in a 1 1 ratio as well as tuff trench installation tuff has high porosity and high saturated hydraulic conductivity making it an excellent medium to enhance the drainage of soluble salts leading to improvement in soil physico chemical characteristics and tree performance nevertheless continued research is required to improve our knowledge on the optimal methods for irrigation with reclaimed wastewater in avocado cultivation to ensure high yields and good fruit quality 4 2 4 effects of excess water on avocado trees various studies have been found that avocado trees are considerably sensitive to flooding whiley and schaffer 1994 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 with short term flooding often resulting in leaf abscission inhibition of leaf shoot and root growth and root rot schaffer et al 2013 in avocado trees with a high shoot to root ratio even a short period of flooding can increase tree mortality phytophthora root rot caused by the fungal pathogen phytophthora cinnamomi rands is one of the main issues affecting avocado tree growth and production zentmyer 1980 to further exacerbate the issue a negative combined effect of flooding and phytophthora root rot has been observed on stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration schaffer et al 2013 found that flooded avocado trees with increased levels of root necrosis caused by phytophthora root rot showed a 65 decrease in stomatal conductance and net co2 assimilation in addition based on the same study even as little as 20 root necrosis resulted in almost complete inhibition of photosynthesis under flooding conditions one common way to counteract the effects of flooding on avocado tree grown is by using fungicides to prevent the growth of phytophthora root rot prior to flooding schaffer et al 2006 however this does not represent a long term solution since the effects of flooding on avocado tree growth are not combated thus it is evident that the development of flood tolerant rootstocks is the only viable long term solution for growing avocado trees in flood prone areas fassio et al 2011 found that hass avocado grafted onto mexicola rootstock has higher resistant to six days soil flooding than trees grafted onto nabal or zutano rootstocks the identification of genes important to the response to flooding by avocado is significant in order to develop rootstocks that indicate tolerance to flooding up to now molecular studies in this field are limited reeksting et al 2016 to this end tzatzani et al 2020 studied the effect of high soil moisture on two key commercial avocado cultivars fuerte and hass their results indicated that exposure to high soil water content conditions under long periods of time negatively affected the total nutrient content in scion s tissues for both cultivars fuerte leaves were more sensitive than hass leaves exhibiting a lower nutrient content a finding that corroborates earlier findings from two previous studies doupis et al 2017 fassio et al 2011 5 crop water requirements and productivity 5 1 water deficit and critical irrigation periods during the growing season avocado as tropical subtropical species has very specific climatic requirements favoring a warm climate and relative humidity of 60 65 avocado tree vegetative growth is very sensitive to water availability so plant water relations play an important role in avocado tree cultivation cantuarias et al 1995 ferreyra and selles 2012 while in many areas where avocado trees are grown irrigation is supplementary this is not the case in regions with hot summer mediterranean climate it has been observed that when water deficits occur in critical stages of fruit ontogeny can cause fruit disorders and reductions in the internal fruit quality whiley 2001 during flowering the canopy surface area available for water loss is considerably increased thus water management during flowering can be critical to fruit production as there is increased water demand during this period the rapid growth phase of the fruit is the second critical period for irrigation during this period effective irrigation management decreases fruit drop and increases the final size of the fruit schaffer et al 2013 kourgialas 2018 it is important to keep in mind that the exact amount of water required must be applied as the application of larger amounts of water can lead to increased infiltration rates loss of water and nutrients which cannot be absorbed by the plant or cause problems at the roots for example development of fungal diseases especially in soils with poor drainage it is also important to note that different phenological stages differ in their water requirements although little research was carried out on the determination of water requirements during different phenological stages there has been considerable work carried out on the effects of stress during different phenological stages chartzoulakis et al 2002 gardiazabal et al 2003 silber et al 2013 holzapfel et al 2017 5 2 irrigation systems in hot summer mediterranean climate during the dry months of the year may september irrigation is required otherwise the quality of the fruit produced is reduced and the tree is stressed in these areas two main irrigation systems used in avocado cultivation sprinkler irrigation which gives good results mainly on sandy soils and drip irrigation one of the best techniques from a technical point of view due to water economy a well established drip irrigation system for hot mediterranean climate when the trees are young concerns a line with 3 4 drippers per tree to be spread along the row of trees and near their trunks or around them circularly in the following years during tree growth a second line could be placed as well as more stalactites large trees need 6 7 stalactites per line the distance between stalactites ranges from 80 to 120 cm depending on soil type holzapfel et al 2017 kourgialas 2018 advantages of drip irrigation include water savings system automation capabilities and adaptability gustafson et al 1979 in sprinkler irrigation water is sprayed under the crown using micro sprinklers the irrigation system needs to be well designed in terms of operating pressure sprinklers and operating time for each tree in a typical system two microsprinklers are used per avocado tree the discharge of the sprinkler is in the range of 70 160 l h fig 2 represents a typical irrigation system design drip and microsprinkler for avocado orchards 5 3 depth and distribution of roots in relation to irrigation in general most of the active rootstock in mature avocado trees is 0 6 0 9 m deep and laterally up to 3 m sometimes reaching 6 m avocado roots have few or no root hairs schaffer et al 2013 there may be changes in both quantity and spatial distribution of roots in relation to the age of the trees and the type of soil the type of irrigation system has also been found to affect the density of the root system salgado and cautín 2008 as drip irrigation trees produce more roots than similar trees irrigated via micro sprinkler with the same amount of water based on experiments performed by salgado and cautín 2008 on trench walls the density of roots was twice as high in the autumn compared to the density measured during the rest of the year under drip irrigation and three times as high under irrigation with microsprinklers in all cases the roots were mostly concentrated in the surface layers 0 0 25 m another important finding of the same study was that 25 more roots developed in the clay loam soil compared to sandy loam soil and 30 more roots developed under drip irrigation compared to the use of microsprinklers a strong correlation r 0 96 between the number of roots and water intake was also confirmed kalmar and lahav 1977 michelakis et al 1993 silber et al 2012 5 4 irrigation scheduling the water needs of avocado trees depend on various factors such as location size and age of the tree type of soil and climatic conditions novel irrigation methods that are based on methodology such as crop evapotranspiration et estimation or the use of soil water sensors have the potential to minimize excessive irrigation and subsequently reduce nutrient leaching while maintaining yields at high levels kourgialas et al 2019 minhas et al 2020 the et estimation method involves estimating reference evapotranspiration eto using climatic data the two most commonly used methods for eto estimation are the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao penman monteith and the american society of civil engineers environmental and water resources institute allen et al 1998 crop coefficients kc are then used to relate evapotranspiration of the reference crop eto to evapotranspiration rates etc of the actual crop allen et al 1998 accurate estimation of kc values requires extensive experiments conducted on site for various stages of plant growth limiting the application of et based irrigation scheduling celedon et al 2012 in hot summer mediterranean climates peak rates of etc which occur in the summer typically range from 3 to 6 mm d while kc values for mature avocado trees are between 0 4 and 0 7 typical crop factors based on class a pan evaporation for irrigation of mature trees of avocado in the mediterranean climates of california israel spain and crete greece are summarized in table 1 for young trees grown in hot summer mediterranean climates the recommended mid summer water application rates per avocado tree are as follows year 1 4 8 l day year 2 8 15 l day year 3 30 50 l day and year 4 80 150 l day lahav and whiley 2002 despite the fact that it is commonly stated that water requirements may vary between different cultivars for instance between cv hass and cv fuerte during specific growing stage there is no published evidence available to directly support this statement moreno ortega et al 2019 5 5 effects of water amount and irrigation frequency on yield and oil fruit concentration the relationship between the amount of water applied and the fruiting in a mixed orchard by fuerte hass and ettinger was studied in israel by steinhardt 1991 the results of this study have incorporated new corresponding data in the last 10 years from other hot summer mediterranean areas such as greece and california ministry of agriculture of greece 2019 usda nass 2020 combining all these data it was found that for irrigation amounts between 300 and 500 mm yr an increase in the amount of irrigation water by 100 mm yr led to a corresponding increase in yield by 1 6 t ha while between 500 and 650 mm yr the increase in yield was only 0 25 t ha fig 3 it is worth noting that after 530 mm yr of irrigation water the production approaches 100 while any water applied in excess to 650 mm yr is essentially lost since it does not increase production while it may adversely affect production by increasing the risk of diseases this evidence becomes particularly important in areas with limited water availability such as in hot summer mediterranean climate regions the application of excess water for irrigation in hot summer mediterranean climates increases the possibility of reduced aeration and soil cooling which could affect tree growth and yields also holzapfel et al 2017 found that water stress apart from yield reduction exacerbated the effect of alternate bearing of avocado trees proper management of irrigation water is highly dependent on irrigation frequency the usual irrigation frequencies for avocados in hot climates are every 2 7 days for micro sprinklers and 1 3 days for drip irrigation the sensitivity of avocados to the frequency of irrigation is demonstrated by the results of an experimental study in israel holzapfel et al 2017 where the response of hass avocado trees to three different irrigation frequencies with the same amount of water was studied in that study the following methods were investigated a pulse drip irrigation with water applied for 10 20 min every 30 min throughout the day b drip irrigation applied daily from night to morning and c drip irrigation every other day the results showed that the growth of the trunk and the yield in fruits increased significantly under pulsating drip irrigation followed by irrigation during the night and irrigation every other day as part of the same study four water treatments 25 50 75 and 100 of eto were applied in mature hass avocado trees to evaluate the effect of irrigation on fruit production and size it was found that fruit size and production increased pointedly as applied water increased to the level equivalent to 75 eto in addition production was consistently lower during off crop years due to alternate bearing for all treatments this effect was more pronounced in the treatments with smaller irrigation amounts highlighting the importance of applying adequate irrigation water in avocado crops even during off crop years holzapfel et al 2017 for the cultivation of avocados the size of the fruit is of particular economic importance in most cases short intervals between irrigation treatments increase fruit size for instance the average weight difference between fruits harvested from trees irrigated with the same amount of water at short vs longer intervals was 9 g for fuerte 18 g for hass and 35 g for ettinger schaffer et al 2013 moreno ortega et al 2019 the concentration of oils in the fruit increases with time and is related to the yield and size of the fruit the larger the fruit the higher the oil concentration in uniform fruits shorter irrigation intervals and increased amounts of water increase the concentration of oils as the concentration of oil in the fruit is an important indicator for determining the date of harvest it is possible to help early maturity by applying additional water at more frequent intervals schaffer et al 2013 5 6 the role of irrigation on frost and dry wind protection avocados are vulnerable to temperatures below zero degrees celsius irrigation is considered one of the most economical methods of frost protection due to the fact that water absorbs cold high water heat capacity generally in winter the trees are less sensitive to frost than in spring or autumn also reducing water during the fall can enhance frost resistance early flowering which is extremely sensitive to frost in addition wet soil has a greater ability to store and transfer heat than dry soil schaffer et al 2013 on the other hand if hot and dry winds occur during flowering and or fruit development common conditions in hot summer mediterranean climate the tree may lose its fruiting to reduce crop damage it is recommended to apply an additional 50 of the planned daily amount of water per day before the expected heat rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2018 iron chlorosis of avocado trees caused by lime it occurs in alkaline soils with a high caco3 content reduced fe 2 availability in trees and can be aggravated by irrigation when it restricts soil aeration fe 2 deficiency often improves by reducing the amount of water applied or increasing irrigation intervals change of irrigation technique from micro sprinklers to drip irrigation in heavy calcareous soils reduce iron chlorosis so in alkaline soils with a high caco3 content the reduction of iron chlorosis in avocado orchards is closely related to irrigation practices applied schaffer et al 2013 kourgialas 2018 5 7 precision agriculture techniques 5 7 1 monitoring sensors hot summer mediterranean regions are experiencing increasing shortages of water for irrigation a fact that makes the optimization of irrigation strategies even more important than other regions this can be accomplished by deploying sensors that monitor soil moisture and plant water status in avocado orchards in a review of the literature on irrigation scheduling du plessis 1991 and karam et al 2019 strongly recommended the use of soil moisture sensors in commercial avocado orchards in order to optimize irrigation management and provide guidelines to farmers on sustainable irrigation new technological approaches in precision agriculture for avocado orchards include monitoring soil water content in root zone automatically using digital tensiometers and determine crop water requirements in online settings moreover multiple sensors for measuring soil moisture temperature and salinity are recommended for accurate monitoring of the whole soil profile the installation of access tubes tensiometers following the irrigation line in the middle point between two emitters 0 35 m from the emitter 1 m from the trunk is recommended for mature avocado orchards carr 2013 in the case of a uniform parcel topographic and the mechanical composition characteristics the placement of four tensiometers in four different trees is considered quite satisfactory for the complete capture of soil moisture in 0 1 ha parcel despite the extensive root system of avocado trees continuous and or periodic observations measurements of water potential in the soil in stable positions can be used to regulate the irrigation regime maintaining water content in the soil at a constant level indicates that irrigation is applied at the rate of water intake from the crop experiments have found that a representative depth to monitor soil moisture is at 0 3 m fig 4 at that depth there is a minimum threshold of critical matric potential that needs to be maintained depending on the soil type typical thresholds for sandy soils are 30 kpa and for clayey soils 50 kpa carr 2013 kourgialas 2018 when soil matric potential reaches these thresholds irrigation should be applied in california the use of a pair of tensiometers at depths of 0 30 m and 0 60 m is recommended by carr 2013 and karam et al 2019 to guide decisions on the onset of irrigation application and to avoid overwatering or underwatering the avocado trees when deciding on the location and number of soil moisture sensors to be deployed it is important to consider the heterogeneity of soils and how it affects the water distribution in the soil profile van leeuwen et al 2001 spatial soil variability plays a very important role in drip and microsprinkler irrigation systems as the number of sensors needed to obtain an accurate representation of the soil moisture profile increases with increased variability van leeuwen et al 2001 the installation of telemetric systems for monitoring soil moisture levels at one or more soil depths when dealing with high spatial heterogeneity is especially important to effectively optimize the time and amount of irrigation in addition given the high final price of the product the advantages of using telemetric systems for the automatic and continuous recording and monitoring of critical parameters in avocado irrigation meteorological and soil parameters tends to be increasingly adopted in commercial cultivations figs 5 and 6 plant water status methods are also important for ensuring proper irrigation of avocado orchards one such technique is to measure stomatal conductance but due to its complexity it is generally not recommended for wide commercial use researchers have investigated other alternative methods such as stem water potential swp and maximum daily trunk shrinkage mdts winer and zachs 2007 which can measure plant water status directly and are less prone to errors due to soil variability one potential downside of using swp is that it might not be sensitive enough to provide early detection of water stress in avocado to avoid loss of yield the mdts technique on the other hand is quite sensitive and could detect water stress early enough to avoid losses but due to its higher variability its performance as stress indicator might be inferior celedon et al 2012 overall when deciding on the use of a particular stress indicator both its sensitivity and its variability should be considered 5 7 2 fertigation in hot summer mediterranean climates given the frequent irrigation of the avocado crop the utilization of fertigation application of fertilizer solution with irrigation is an important technique for increasing the efficiency of fertilization mainly for macronutrients such as nitrogen and potassium in general despite the impressive size of the crown and the high productivity of the trees the need for nutrients is not very high indicatively they do not exceed 100 150 units of nitrogen and 180 200 units of potassium per ha phosphorus needs are significantly lower 40 50 units per ha although in practice due to the excessive use of compound fertilizers it is common to detect excess of this element both in the soil and in the leaves silber et al 2018 barikou et al 2018 this causes secondary feeding problems which are usually found in low zinc concentrations in the leaves of the other nutrients in areas with hot summer mediterranean climate low concentrations of boron are often observed in leaf analyzes while the onset of iron deficiency symptoms is mainly due to the installation of the avocado in calcareous soils with the exception of cases of nutritional imbalance zinc and unsuitable soil iron the remaining deficiencies are easily corrected by applying fertigation provided that they are diagnosed in time by leaf analysis silber et al 2018 kiggundu et al 2012 the importance of nutritional balance in avocado trees is demonstrated by rootstock scion interactions correlations between a number of nutrients and fruit quality interpretation of leaf analyses and the effects of salinity on nutrient concentrations table 2 the following table presents a summary of the effects of n p k applications and salinity on the changes on concentrations of other nutrients in avocado leaves based on the table below fertigation can be adjusted in case of salinity problems in order not to aggravate the problem nutrient management practices combined with irrigation using based on etc estimation and or soil water content measurements have been evaluated in terms of nutrient leaching and water savings in an experiment conducted by kiggundu et al 2012 the researchers found that applying granular fertilizers through the irrigation system eight times per year lead to reduced nutrient leaching compared to application twice per year the authors also assessed nutrient leaching by irrigating at 80 100 or 120 of etc and found no significant differences among the different levels so based on their results nutrient leaching being more influenced by the applied fertigation rate rather than irrigation management type 6 summary and conclusions given the recent expansion of avocado cultivation in new regions it is important to understand the challenges and limitations and discuss best management practices of its cultivation this need is more pronounced in regions that present less favorable growth conditions such as areas with typical hot summer mediterranean climate this review paper provides guidance on avocado cultivation in these regions with focus on its viability under water scarcity and salinity conditions at present hass is the most important avocado cultivar in the world and it is proving to be compatible to hot summer mediterranean climate areas appropriate rootstock selection is very important with the most desirable attributes being resistance to diseases such as phytophthora cinnamomi salinity tolerance adaptability to calcareous soils and sustainable high yields of quality fruit in terms of soil conditions the most important parameters affecting avocado tree growth and yields are a proper soil ph b low carbon content caco3 c low salinity d good drainage and e absence of historical background of occurrence of soil borne diseases avocado trees are considerably sensitive to salinity which is a common issue especially in hot summer mediterranean climate coastal regions it has been found that avocado yields begin to decline at irrigation water ec above 0 75 ds m and chloride concentrations greater than 100 ppm strategies for handling salinity usually aim at preventing the build up of salts in the root zone and minimizing the damaging effects of salinity on avocado trees specific studies on salinity responses of avocado have shown that it is highly influenced by rootstock selection thus it is crucial to identify and use rootstocks that are tolerant to irrigation with saline water based on a study by celis et al 2018 it has been found that dusa rootstock is the most salt tolerant rootstock while topa topa is the rootstock most sensitive to salinity the nabal rootstock was found to retain the highest levels of chloride concentration in the roots and lowest in the leaves of the plant compared to the other rootstocks tested in this study making it a promising candidate in terms of salt tolerance avocado trees are also sensitive to excess watering and flooding making the development of flood tolerant rootstocks a priority for cultivation in flood prone areas fassio et al 2011 found that hass avocado grafted onto mexicola rootstock has higher resistant to flooding than trees grafted onto nabal or zutano rootstocks the identification of genes important to the response to flooding by avocado is significant in order to develop rootstocks that indicate tolerance to flooding up to now molecular studies in this field have been limited water management during flowering can be critical to fruit production as there is increased water demand during this period with the rapid growth phase of the fruit being the second critical period in terms of irrigation needs during this period effective irrigation management reduces fruit drop and increases the final fruit size schaffer et al 2013 kourgialas 2018 it is important to note though that the application of larger amounts of water can lead to increased infiltration rates loss of water and nutrients which cannot be absorbed by the plant or cause root diseases more pronounced in soils with poor drainage in general two main irrigation systems are recommended for avocado cultivation a sprinkler irrigation which performs well on sandy soils and b drip irrigation one of the best techniques from a technical point of view due to water savings in addition to a proper irrigation system it is strongly recommended to use soil moisture sensor networks in avocado cultivations to optimize irrigation management and enhance the sustainable use of water new technological approaches in precision agriculture for avocado orchards include automated monitoring of soil water content in the root zone using digital tensiometers and direct estimation of crop water requirements to guide irrigation in addition sensors that monitor temperature nutrient levels and salinity are recommended for precise monitoring of the soil profile finally in hot summer mediterranean climates given the need for frequent irrigation of avocado trees the use of fertigation is recommended to increase the efficiency of fertilization focusing on macronutrients such as nitrogen and potassium studies have shown that nutrient leaching is more directly affected by the applied fertilizer rate rather than irrigation management type making fertigation an important way to promote tree growth and increase crop yields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10092,the production and consumption of avocado has increased significantly over the past years experiencing a steady expansion into new markets around the world this review paper focuses on avocado cultivation in its new markets with hot summer mediterranean climate a significant literature gap exists on the viability of this crop in such data environments which experience limited availability of water in the summer exacerbated by climate change and potential salinity issues in irrigation water typical in coastal regions strategies for handling salinity usually aim at preventing the build up of salts in the root zone while studies on the response of avocado trees to saline water have shown that it is highly influenced by rootstock selection in this review paper priority is given to the appropriate irrigation water characteristics both in terms of quantity and quality for different tree sizes soil characteristics and irrigation methods including the use of reclaimed wastewater also the effects of irrigation frequency amount on fruit productivity are studied this review also highlights the role of fertigation as well as the importance of a soil moisture and salinity monitoring it is strongly suggested to use soil moisture sensor networks precision agriculture in avocado cultivations to optimize irrigation management and promote water sustainability given the increasing dynamic in the expansion of this crop especially in european countries with this climate type such as southern italy spain greece turkey and cyprus among others this review paper is expected to provide guidance on avocado cultivation in these regions with focus on its viability under water scarcity and salinity conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation avocado production extreme climatic conditions salinity fertigation 1 introduction avocado is becoming one of the most financially significant tropical fruits on the global market production and consumption of avocado have expanded drastically in the past 150 years this is attributed to two main factors increased consumption among populaces acquainted with the fruit in the past for example mexico and california and the steady expansion into new markets around the world in countries where avocado was not traditionally consumed before for example europe japan and china schaffer et al 2013 as more countries particular in the mediterranean region produce avocados for trade or become acquainted with the product it is highly likely that the overall production and consumption of avocados will keep increasing globally avocado is primarily consumed fresh but the addition of other value added avocado products for example guacamole and avocado oil used by cosmetics and culinary industries indicate the potential for further market growth duarte et al 2016 as indicated by the transparency market research tmr the worldwide avocado market was valued at us 13 64 bn in 2018 and is anticipated to reach a value of us 21 56 bn by 2026 highlighting the financial importance of the crop according to fao global production of avocado fruits exceeded 6 4 million metric tons mt in 2018 marking an increase of 6 7 from the previous year while the total increase of production from 2000 to 2018 is about 136 fao report 2018 tzatzani et al 2020 avocado is currently produced in about 70 countries with mexico being the largest producer with production exceeding 2 1 mt in 2018 the second largest producer is saint dominic with about 644 000 metric tons t followed by peru indonesia colombia brazil kenya venezuela chile the united states new zealand and others south africa produces about 127 000 t with rising production trends and a very organized export trade in the mediterranean israel is leading with production of about 131 000 t followed by spain 90 000 t morocco 51 000 t turkey 3100 t france 2500 t greece 1700 t cyprus 714 t palestine 677 t and tunisia 333 t faostat 2018 these countries all experience upward trends due to high demand mainly by the european union eu specifically in israel avocado orchards cover an area of about 7000 ha most of the orchards are situated along the coastal plain extending from rosh hanikra in the north to the gaza belt area spain is the european union country with the biggest production of avocado with cultivated areas exceeding 11 000 ha in 2018 the majority of the avocados are grown in andalusia in the subtropical coastal regions of malaga and granada in the south of spain accounting about 86 of the spanish production the main production about 80 of the avocados grown in andalusia are exported to other european union countries with united kingdom germany and france as the most important markets rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2018 nonetheless the andalusian region is presently encountering water shortages and heat extremes which could affect avocado production a situation that is expected to exacerbate in the future due to climate change based on current climate studies conducted for the region moreno ortega et al 2019 in greece the main production of avocado occurs on the island of crete with an estimated cultivated area of 1100 ha the early fuerte the late haas and the earliest zutano are typically cultivated varieties of avocado in the region it is important to mention here that avocado production in crete is growing very rapidly as highlighted by the fact that the cultivated area increased by about 300 between 2019 and 2014 however the island of crete is another mediterranean region expected to be affected by extreme hydrological events droughts and floods based on global climate change model predictions kourgialas 2021 ministry of agriculture of greece 2019 avocado cultivation is also expanding in portugal and italy in portugal there are about 1000 ha of avocado cultivations mostly within the algarve portugal s southernmost region also in the southern italian regions of calabria basilicata and sicily avocado production is steadily increasing domestic consumption is strongly promoted which is much lower than in france and scandinavia in italy there is increased production in sicily mainly of the hass and fuerte varieties however due to high demand that cannot be met locally italy imports large quantities of avocado from the americas and south africa center for the promotion of imports from developing countries cbi 2019 the advancement of irrigation systems was the key factor encouraging the expansion of avocado cultivation in the mediterranean area given that farmers in this region rely heavily on irrigation due to the semi arid and arid climate lahav and whiley 2002 carr 2013 avocado tree growth is rigorous with potential to bear fruit containing 17 oil in excess of 30 t ha wolstenholme and whiley 1995 nevertheless the overall typical avocado yield is commonly low campisi pinto et al 2017 because of high rate of bloom and or fruit abscission garner and lovatt 2008 as well as alternating yearly patterns of high and low yields lovatt 2011 the common factor inducing the above phenomena is the amount frequency and quality of irrigation water holzapfel et al 2017 in spite of avocado s significance in the global market there are a few studies that have focused on the quantification of avocado tree s water needs during all stages of growth and evaluate how the applied quantity of water affects yields silber et al 2019 other researchers studied the effects of climatic and soil conditions on avocado production while others focused on water quality with emphasis on salinity given that farmers are increasingly relying on saline water for irrigation but the information is not summarized in the literature in a comprehensive way recognizing this fact this review focuses on the collection of the available scientific information and research on the following topics a the efficient use of water for avocado cultivation b the sensitivity and resistivity of cultivars and rootstocks under extreme climatic conditions salinity levels and soil characteristics c the optimal climatic and soil conditions for cultivation and optimal cultivation techniques d the proper irrigation water characteristics in terms of quantity and quality under various irrigation methods tree sizes soil characteristics and prevailing climatic condition since avocado is a crop that adapts very well to tropical or subtropical climates that experience significant amounts of relative humidity and rainfall lahav et al 2013 this review paper focuses on typical hot summer mediterranean climate regions for multiple reasons explained below given the significant commercial value and high demand of the product it is desirable to expand its cultivation to other areas that may be less favorable in terms of growth conditions such as the hot summer mediterranean climate limited availability of water in the summer months as well as potential issues with salinity in irrigation water typical in coastal regions make the study of its expansion in such environments a unique research challenge a significant literature gap exists on the viability of this crop in such environments and the effects of climate change a particular challenge for research as there is no review paper in hot summer mediterranean climate to date this review also highlights the crucial role of fertigation as well as the importance of a soil moisture and salinity sensor network in the design of a proper avocado water management plan finally given the increasing dynamic in the expansion of this crop especially in european countries with this climate type such as southern italy spain greece turkey and cyprus among others this review paper is expected to provide guidance on avocado cultivation in these regions with focus on its viability under water scarcity and salinity conditions 2 ηot summer mediterranean climate zone production recognizing the crucial role of water in avocado cultivation research efforts focus on furthering our understanding for improving and expanding their production especially in water scarce areas specifically regarding the mediterranean climate zone production there are three sub types a the hot summer mediterranean climate or typical mediterranean climate csa b the warm summer mediterranean climate csb and c the cold summer mediterranean climate csc peel et al 2007 csa is the most common type of the mediterranean climate with average monthly temperatures in excess of 22 c 71 6 f during the warmest month and between 3 and 18 c 26 6 and 64 4 f during the coldest month while the temperature of at least four months must average above 10 c 50 f areas with csa typically experience hot or very hot and dry summers and mild wet winters and are found in the mediterranean sea southwestern south africa southwestern australia sections of central asia the interior of northern california west of the sierra nevada northern sections of iran and iraq and inland areas of southern oregon west of the cascade mountains beck et al 2018 in fig 1 the most common areas with hot summer mediterranean climate around the globe are depicted 3 cultivars and rootstocks for hot summer mediterranean climate conditions there are three ecological races of avocado with varietal status within the species persea americana var drymifolia mexican race var guatemalensis guatemalan race and var americana antillean west indian or lowland race the mexican and guatemalan races are both indigenous to tropical highlands where rainfall occurs during the summer and autumn followed by dry winters and springs which is when flowering occurs the adaptation of these races to warm and cool subtropical areas varies with the mexican race being the most cold tolerant race and the antillean the least the most popular varieties are hybrids a result of extensive interracial crossing for example cv fuerte a mexican guatemalan hybrid which used to dominate global production and cv hass developed in california which has now displaced fuerte in most regions with mediterranean climate schaffer et al 2013 the best known varieties that thrive in hot summer mediterranean climates are fuerte bacon edranol hass lamb hass ettinger gwen pinkerton reed and zutano bacon and edranol varieties are seldom planted today due to their susceptibility to various diseases and unsuitability in humid regions bacon or sensitivity to climatic extremes edranol fuerte formerly the world s leading commercial cultivar retains its importance in low humidity environments where disease and insect problems are low schaffer et al 2013 due to its high sensitivity to low temperatures it lost its popularity and was replaced by hass in california at present hass is the most important avocado cultivar in the world and especially in hot summer mediterranean climate areas it accounts for about 90 of the export trade flowering and fruit set of hass are not very sensitive to cold but its leaves are hass leaves are also susceptible to the pest persea mite oligonychus perseae while the medium to thick fruit peel of hass provides moderate protection from pests and diseases lamb hass another cultivar favored in california is increasing in popularity as small plantings are being made in several countries it is very precocious and less susceptible to the persea mite and has a similar or lower resistance to cold than hass the tree is relatively resistant to frost but the fruit is sensitive to chilling injury during storage gwen is very precocious and higher yielding than hass and as a result is more dwarfed under california conditions the tree is very susceptible to damage by persea mite which may cause extensive leaf drop it is not being extensively planted in california due to overbearing which often leads to sun burning of the fruit and poor vegetative growth ettinger cultivated primarily in israel has moderate to heavy production and is an outstanding pollinizer pinkerton and reed have similar cold tolerance to hass tolerating temperatures down to 2 c reed is very precocious consistently producing heavy crops even when trees are older pinkerton is relatively resistant to anthracnose but fruit can have a high percentage of internal fruit disorders including uneven ripening zutano is a cultivar that produces consistent and heavy crops and is predominantly grown in colder regions due to its frost tolerance whiley 1992 schaffer et al 2013 their key features are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary materials section many new avocado rootstocks have now been adapted to various conditions such as cold resistance disease salinity etc the selection of rootstocks must be carefully made according to the needs of each producer and the conditions of their parcel avocado rootstocks were thoroughly reviewed by ben ya acov and michelson 1995 the major attributes sought are resistance to phytophthora cinnamomi plant disease salinity tolerance adaptability to calcareous soils smaller trees and high sustainable yields of quality fruit whiley 1992 willingham et al 2001 2006 and coates et al 2011 reported that rootstocks can significantly influence the incidence of anthracnose on fruit while others have observed their effect on the incidence of internal fruit disorders smith 1993 whiley 2001 poor water quality leading to salinity and calcareous soils plague avocado production in drier regions of the world oppenheimer 1947 identified salinity tolerance in west indian race trees grown in israel later kadman and ben ya acov 1976 selected high producing trees growing under saline conditions and recovered the rootstocks approximately 50 west indian clones were developed as salinity tolerant rootstocks for use by the israeli industry west indian race rootstocks were also found to be highly resistant to lime induced iron chlorosis when trees were grown in calcareous soils while those of the guatemalan race were determined to be highly sensitive ben ya acov and michelson 1995 iron chlorosis and other problems due to alkaline soil conditions have been observed in spain israel greece cyprus and to a lesser degree in california their impact can be reduced through the selection of tolerant rootstocks some israeli rootstocks and south african and californian clones have been evaluated in trials with saline water applications and based on survival and yield data superior selections for california conditions are being identified bender et al 2010 oster and arpaia 1992 mickelbart and arpaia 2002 bernstein et al 2004 and mickelbart et al 2007 have described physiological differences between clonally propagated rootstocks with respect to salinity tolerance table s2 supplementary material summarizes the main characteristics of the most popular rootstocks for hot summer mediterranean climate and their compatibility with other varieties 4 agricultural management strategies in avocado cultivation 4 1 soil and crop management choosing the right site for the establishment of a new avocado plantation should be carefully considered to reduce the likelihood of future problems that are difficult to manage and lead to a non economically viable crop regarding soil conditions important parameters for a successful crop are proper soil ph low carbon content caco3 low salinity good drainage and no historical background of occurrence of soil borne diseases schaffer et al 2013 barikou et al 2018 soil characteristics such as ph percentage of carbonates soil drainage ability and salinity can be determined by soil analysis with salinity levels highly dependent on the quality of the irrigation water in general it is advisable to avoid planting avocado trees when the total calcium content in the soil exceeds 20 or when it is greater than 10 in combination with strongly alkaline ph in particular when soil ph values are above 7 in combination with elevated caco3 values in the soil avocado cultivation is not recommended du plessis and koen 1987 the choice of planting distance is typically the decision of the producer but it has been shown that denser plantings produce higher quantities of fruit also to maximize production there should be a combination of varieties in the same field i e pollinizer in an ideal ratio of 8 1 as well as the presence of bees as young trees are very susceptible to sunburn shade or dyeing of the trunk and arms is recommended to protect them they also require limited fertilization and minimal pruning in the first 2 3 years atucha et al 2013 careful pruning is required to ensure that the tree is not endangered by sunburn while it is recommended to apply a special paste to the incisions to prevent the development of diseases pruning is one of the biggest costs of cultivation but it is absolutely necessary to maintain strong trees and increase fruit size garner and lovatt 2008 groundcover management is also an important parameter worthwhile of attention according to long term studies short term competition of trees for groundcover affects tree growth and fruit productivity less than the deterioration of biological activity and soil conditions in orchard soils in the absence of weeds on the other hand when weeds are present the competition for nutrients and water between weeds and fruit trees can affect tree growth and lead to significant yield losses when compared to weed free groundcover management systems atucha et al 2013 particular attention should be given to the time of fruit harvest because it affects certain characteristics related to oil content if the fruits are harvested before they have the necessary fat they do not acquire the desired organoleptic characteristics and the fruit is qualitatively degraded for the regions of europe in the mediterranean basin in order to ensure the minimum acceptable quality of fruit eu regulation 387 2005 needs to be followed which states a minimum dry matter content of 19 21 depending on the variety is needed to ensure proper ripening commission regulation ec 2005 4 2 adaptability to salinity and excess water 4 2 1 salinity effects avocado trees are considerably sensitive to salinity musyimi et al 2007 deinlein et al 2014 acosta rangel et al 2019 visual symptoms caused by chloride toxicity include leaf tip burn and sometimes along leaf margins while visual sodium toxicity symptoms include necrotic spots near the margin or interior surface of the leaf whiley and schaffer 1994 bender et al 2010 effects of salinity on the physiology of the plant are comparable with other forms of stress stress is mainly the effect of reduced water uptake as well as altered mineral uptake these effects include reduced stomatal conductance transpiration photosynthesis leaf chlorophyll content leaf water potential while increased sub stomatal co2 concentrations were evident salazar garcνa and larque saavedra 1988 musyimi et al 2007 negative effects of salinity on tree growth included decreased root growth delayed appearance of new flushes smaller leaves and reduced yields bernstein et al 2004 musyimi et al 2007 toxicity symptoms of salinity injury to avocado vary depending on the stage of tree development leaf age and nutrition schaffer et al 2013 differences in the severity of damage between production areas suggest that microclimatic factors may also be important in the expression of toxicity symptoms the most commonly observed symptoms are tip and marginal leaf burn eventually resulting in leaf abscission chirachint and turner 1988 the sensitivity of plants to salinity is typically measured as a function of electrical conductivity ec in experimental studies it has been observed that avocado trees are completely unable to extract water from the soil when ec of the soil reaches 4 ds m crowley 2008 in agriculture water with ec values lower than 0 5 ds m is considered of high quality however it is common to use water with ec values within a range of 0 3 ds m avocado fruit yield starts to decline when irrigation water of above 0 75 ds m and chloride concentrations greater than 100 ppm is used the general recommendation is to maintain a 10 20 leaching fraction to keep ec values lower than 2 0 ds m mickelbart et al 2007 crowley 2008 and chloride concentrations below 100 ppm these thresholds vary based on the subject with permissible chloride concentrations for mexican cultivars at 120 150 ppm for guatemalan subjects at 200 250 ppm and for western indian cultivars at 350 500 ppm the salt concentration in the soil is also affected by the amount of water and the method of irrigation strategies for handling salinity usually aim at preventing the build up of salts in the root zone to levels that limit the root water uptake and minimizing the damaging effects of salinity on avocado trees for optimal crop growth light soils have good drainage and are easier to flush than heavy soils the application of microsprinkler irrigation results in a uniform salt concentration at the same depth with a gradual increase in salt concentration as depth increases in the case of drip irrigation lower salt concentration at the water application point and an increase in the radiant salt concentration moving away from it is typically observed fao report 2018 downton 1978 observed that high nacl concentrations 20 mm or 0 02 mol l of soil saturated paste extract reduced the numbers of flowers per bud floral buds flowers per inflorescence and inflorescences per bud of fuerte scions grafted on to mexican and guatemalan rootstocks mickelbart et al 2007 studied the effect of different rootstocks on the distribution of na cl and k in young hass trees they found that measurements of cl and the na k ratio in old leaves could be an appropriate index for screening salinity tolerance because tolerance involves minimizing the flow of cl and na to the leaves salinity affects leaf mineral content in different ways for example salinity increases the concentration of k na cl zn and cu decreases the concentration of n p mg and mn while it does not significantly affect the concentration of ca fe and b celis et al 2018 a number of studies demonstrated that increased n applications to avocado trees reduce the leaf cl concentration and leaves damage haas and brusca 1955 crowley 2008 celis et al 2018 in potted mexican and west indian race seedlings bar et al 1991 reported that when trees were supplied with cl at 2 4 8 or 16 mm they developed toxicity symptoms that were severe at 16 mm of cl however when nitrate at 16 mm was added to the potting medium no cl damage was observed as the plants preferentially took up nitrate they proposed that where cl is a problem the use of potassium nitrate as a fertilizer may be a practical and simple way to reduce salinity damage to trees crowley 2008 draws attention to the need to balance increased water use efficiency with the management of salinity strategies are the selection of rootstocks that tolerate saline soils the quality of irrigation water timing of irrigation and monitoring of the electrical conductivity ec of irrigation water and soil and the amount of water needed to leach salts below the root zone salinity remains a critical challenge in avocado cultivation threatening the long term sustainability of the avocado industry especially in semi arid production areas with low rainfall and poor water quality resulting in higher salt accumulation in soil whiley and schaffer 1994 taking into consideration that in many coastal avocado producing areas with hot summer mediterranean climate saltwater intrusion phenomena occur and rainfall is general limited salt accumulation in the soil is a common phenomenon studies have shown that salt sensitivity of avocado is influenced by rootstock selection thus it is crucial to identify and use rootstocks that are tolerant to saline water irrigation 4 2 2 rootstocks and salt tolerance as mentioned above it is crucial to evaluate avocado rootstocks in terms of salt tolerance and assess the relationship between leaf ion concentrations trunk diameter leaf burn and fruit yield to this end celis et al 2018 conducted an experiment using 156 avocado trees arranged in a random complete block design which were treated with saline 1 5 ds m and non saline 0 65 ds m irrigation water based on their results dusa rootstock was the most salt tolerant achieving the largest yields survival percentages and trunk diameters under the saline treatment on the contrary topa topa rootstock was the most sensitive to salinity the researchers found that parameters related to fruit yield and tree growth correlated well with leaf cl concentration indicating chloride toxicity as a main parameter affecting avocado trees irrigated with saline water in another study oster and arpaia 1992 investigated how rootstock affects fruit weight and health with an emphasis on hass avocado trees treated with saline irrigation water they found that rootstock affects leaf area and biomass accumulation in leaves and stems of avocado trees suggesting that leaf biomass production per branch could be used as an indicator of salinity tolerance bernstein et al 2004 mickelbart et al 2007 also focused on hass avocado trees treated with saline water and examined the tissue ion concentration in trees grafted onto a variety of rootstocks they found that the ion exclusion ability of avocado rootstocks and salinity tolerance can be identified using cl concentration and na k ratios in old leaves as markers castro et al 2009 examined plant material from the cv hass to find possible salt tolerance rootstocks among the following seedlings clonal nabal duke 7 degania 117 zutano and mexicola in all cases plant growth and nutrient content were compared with control plants 30 ppm of cl and plants treated with 200 ppm cl for 130 days using nacl in the nutrient solution 5 64 mm their results indicated no interaction between nacl and the rootstocks for the plant growth parameters the nabal rootstock was found to retain the highest levels of chloride concentration in the roots and lowest in the leaves of the plant compared to the other rootstocks tested in this study making it a promising candidate in terms of salt tolerance 4 2 3 reclaimed wastewater for irrigation another crucial issue for hot mediterranean climates closely related to salinity is the irrigation of avocado trees with reclaimed water reclaimed wastewater could be a major water supply source for agriculture in many water scarce areas where freshwater is unavailable or costly kourgialas 2021 recent reports have shown that long term irrigation 7 years with treated wastewater in avocado orchards causes detrimental effects on soil leading to disturbance in tree performance and yield reduction specifically in clay soils long term irrigation with reused wastewater leads to soil salinity poor aeration and destruction of soil aggregates and structure assouline et al 2016 nemera et al 2020 a ten year study of avocado orchards in israel indicated a 20 40 yield reduction when the source of irrigation water was reclaimed wastewater compared to freshwater assouline and narkis 2013 the reason for this observed yield reduction is attributed to the fact that salt introduced with treated wastewater in combination with high evapotranspiration and salt exclusion by roots can lead to an osmotic effect that directly affects avocado s ability to absorb water and nutrients paudel et al 2018 assouline et al 2015 also the destruction of soil aggregates as well as the poor soil aeration as consequences of the applied treated wastewater reduce leaching efficiency in the soil profile and activity of microbial organisms assouline and narkis 2013 seferou et al 2013 based on the above and taking into consideration that avocado trees are generally sensitive to salinity irrigation with reclaimed wastewater could become problematic when adequate drainage is not maintained pedrero et al 2010 a common irrigation practice to remove the accumulated soil salt below the root zone is leaching with excess water under low frequency time intervals however this practice especially in water scarce areas is under debate due to the high cost of water and its impact on the environment assouline et al 2015 kourgialas et al 2016 alternatives of good mitigation techniques for avocado orchards in water scarce areas under hot mediterranean climate conditions recommended by nemera et al 2020 include mixing freshwater and treated wastewater in a 1 1 ratio as well as tuff trench installation tuff has high porosity and high saturated hydraulic conductivity making it an excellent medium to enhance the drainage of soluble salts leading to improvement in soil physico chemical characteristics and tree performance nevertheless continued research is required to improve our knowledge on the optimal methods for irrigation with reclaimed wastewater in avocado cultivation to ensure high yields and good fruit quality 4 2 4 effects of excess water on avocado trees various studies have been found that avocado trees are considerably sensitive to flooding whiley and schaffer 1994 kourgialas and karatzas 2016 with short term flooding often resulting in leaf abscission inhibition of leaf shoot and root growth and root rot schaffer et al 2013 in avocado trees with a high shoot to root ratio even a short period of flooding can increase tree mortality phytophthora root rot caused by the fungal pathogen phytophthora cinnamomi rands is one of the main issues affecting avocado tree growth and production zentmyer 1980 to further exacerbate the issue a negative combined effect of flooding and phytophthora root rot has been observed on stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration schaffer et al 2013 found that flooded avocado trees with increased levels of root necrosis caused by phytophthora root rot showed a 65 decrease in stomatal conductance and net co2 assimilation in addition based on the same study even as little as 20 root necrosis resulted in almost complete inhibition of photosynthesis under flooding conditions one common way to counteract the effects of flooding on avocado tree grown is by using fungicides to prevent the growth of phytophthora root rot prior to flooding schaffer et al 2006 however this does not represent a long term solution since the effects of flooding on avocado tree growth are not combated thus it is evident that the development of flood tolerant rootstocks is the only viable long term solution for growing avocado trees in flood prone areas fassio et al 2011 found that hass avocado grafted onto mexicola rootstock has higher resistant to six days soil flooding than trees grafted onto nabal or zutano rootstocks the identification of genes important to the response to flooding by avocado is significant in order to develop rootstocks that indicate tolerance to flooding up to now molecular studies in this field are limited reeksting et al 2016 to this end tzatzani et al 2020 studied the effect of high soil moisture on two key commercial avocado cultivars fuerte and hass their results indicated that exposure to high soil water content conditions under long periods of time negatively affected the total nutrient content in scion s tissues for both cultivars fuerte leaves were more sensitive than hass leaves exhibiting a lower nutrient content a finding that corroborates earlier findings from two previous studies doupis et al 2017 fassio et al 2011 5 crop water requirements and productivity 5 1 water deficit and critical irrigation periods during the growing season avocado as tropical subtropical species has very specific climatic requirements favoring a warm climate and relative humidity of 60 65 avocado tree vegetative growth is very sensitive to water availability so plant water relations play an important role in avocado tree cultivation cantuarias et al 1995 ferreyra and selles 2012 while in many areas where avocado trees are grown irrigation is supplementary this is not the case in regions with hot summer mediterranean climate it has been observed that when water deficits occur in critical stages of fruit ontogeny can cause fruit disorders and reductions in the internal fruit quality whiley 2001 during flowering the canopy surface area available for water loss is considerably increased thus water management during flowering can be critical to fruit production as there is increased water demand during this period the rapid growth phase of the fruit is the second critical period for irrigation during this period effective irrigation management decreases fruit drop and increases the final size of the fruit schaffer et al 2013 kourgialas 2018 it is important to keep in mind that the exact amount of water required must be applied as the application of larger amounts of water can lead to increased infiltration rates loss of water and nutrients which cannot be absorbed by the plant or cause problems at the roots for example development of fungal diseases especially in soils with poor drainage it is also important to note that different phenological stages differ in their water requirements although little research was carried out on the determination of water requirements during different phenological stages there has been considerable work carried out on the effects of stress during different phenological stages chartzoulakis et al 2002 gardiazabal et al 2003 silber et al 2013 holzapfel et al 2017 5 2 irrigation systems in hot summer mediterranean climate during the dry months of the year may september irrigation is required otherwise the quality of the fruit produced is reduced and the tree is stressed in these areas two main irrigation systems used in avocado cultivation sprinkler irrigation which gives good results mainly on sandy soils and drip irrigation one of the best techniques from a technical point of view due to water economy a well established drip irrigation system for hot mediterranean climate when the trees are young concerns a line with 3 4 drippers per tree to be spread along the row of trees and near their trunks or around them circularly in the following years during tree growth a second line could be placed as well as more stalactites large trees need 6 7 stalactites per line the distance between stalactites ranges from 80 to 120 cm depending on soil type holzapfel et al 2017 kourgialas 2018 advantages of drip irrigation include water savings system automation capabilities and adaptability gustafson et al 1979 in sprinkler irrigation water is sprayed under the crown using micro sprinklers the irrigation system needs to be well designed in terms of operating pressure sprinklers and operating time for each tree in a typical system two microsprinklers are used per avocado tree the discharge of the sprinkler is in the range of 70 160 l h fig 2 represents a typical irrigation system design drip and microsprinkler for avocado orchards 5 3 depth and distribution of roots in relation to irrigation in general most of the active rootstock in mature avocado trees is 0 6 0 9 m deep and laterally up to 3 m sometimes reaching 6 m avocado roots have few or no root hairs schaffer et al 2013 there may be changes in both quantity and spatial distribution of roots in relation to the age of the trees and the type of soil the type of irrigation system has also been found to affect the density of the root system salgado and cautín 2008 as drip irrigation trees produce more roots than similar trees irrigated via micro sprinkler with the same amount of water based on experiments performed by salgado and cautín 2008 on trench walls the density of roots was twice as high in the autumn compared to the density measured during the rest of the year under drip irrigation and three times as high under irrigation with microsprinklers in all cases the roots were mostly concentrated in the surface layers 0 0 25 m another important finding of the same study was that 25 more roots developed in the clay loam soil compared to sandy loam soil and 30 more roots developed under drip irrigation compared to the use of microsprinklers a strong correlation r 0 96 between the number of roots and water intake was also confirmed kalmar and lahav 1977 michelakis et al 1993 silber et al 2012 5 4 irrigation scheduling the water needs of avocado trees depend on various factors such as location size and age of the tree type of soil and climatic conditions novel irrigation methods that are based on methodology such as crop evapotranspiration et estimation or the use of soil water sensors have the potential to minimize excessive irrigation and subsequently reduce nutrient leaching while maintaining yields at high levels kourgialas et al 2019 minhas et al 2020 the et estimation method involves estimating reference evapotranspiration eto using climatic data the two most commonly used methods for eto estimation are the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao penman monteith and the american society of civil engineers environmental and water resources institute allen et al 1998 crop coefficients kc are then used to relate evapotranspiration of the reference crop eto to evapotranspiration rates etc of the actual crop allen et al 1998 accurate estimation of kc values requires extensive experiments conducted on site for various stages of plant growth limiting the application of et based irrigation scheduling celedon et al 2012 in hot summer mediterranean climates peak rates of etc which occur in the summer typically range from 3 to 6 mm d while kc values for mature avocado trees are between 0 4 and 0 7 typical crop factors based on class a pan evaporation for irrigation of mature trees of avocado in the mediterranean climates of california israel spain and crete greece are summarized in table 1 for young trees grown in hot summer mediterranean climates the recommended mid summer water application rates per avocado tree are as follows year 1 4 8 l day year 2 8 15 l day year 3 30 50 l day and year 4 80 150 l day lahav and whiley 2002 despite the fact that it is commonly stated that water requirements may vary between different cultivars for instance between cv hass and cv fuerte during specific growing stage there is no published evidence available to directly support this statement moreno ortega et al 2019 5 5 effects of water amount and irrigation frequency on yield and oil fruit concentration the relationship between the amount of water applied and the fruiting in a mixed orchard by fuerte hass and ettinger was studied in israel by steinhardt 1991 the results of this study have incorporated new corresponding data in the last 10 years from other hot summer mediterranean areas such as greece and california ministry of agriculture of greece 2019 usda nass 2020 combining all these data it was found that for irrigation amounts between 300 and 500 mm yr an increase in the amount of irrigation water by 100 mm yr led to a corresponding increase in yield by 1 6 t ha while between 500 and 650 mm yr the increase in yield was only 0 25 t ha fig 3 it is worth noting that after 530 mm yr of irrigation water the production approaches 100 while any water applied in excess to 650 mm yr is essentially lost since it does not increase production while it may adversely affect production by increasing the risk of diseases this evidence becomes particularly important in areas with limited water availability such as in hot summer mediterranean climate regions the application of excess water for irrigation in hot summer mediterranean climates increases the possibility of reduced aeration and soil cooling which could affect tree growth and yields also holzapfel et al 2017 found that water stress apart from yield reduction exacerbated the effect of alternate bearing of avocado trees proper management of irrigation water is highly dependent on irrigation frequency the usual irrigation frequencies for avocados in hot climates are every 2 7 days for micro sprinklers and 1 3 days for drip irrigation the sensitivity of avocados to the frequency of irrigation is demonstrated by the results of an experimental study in israel holzapfel et al 2017 where the response of hass avocado trees to three different irrigation frequencies with the same amount of water was studied in that study the following methods were investigated a pulse drip irrigation with water applied for 10 20 min every 30 min throughout the day b drip irrigation applied daily from night to morning and c drip irrigation every other day the results showed that the growth of the trunk and the yield in fruits increased significantly under pulsating drip irrigation followed by irrigation during the night and irrigation every other day as part of the same study four water treatments 25 50 75 and 100 of eto were applied in mature hass avocado trees to evaluate the effect of irrigation on fruit production and size it was found that fruit size and production increased pointedly as applied water increased to the level equivalent to 75 eto in addition production was consistently lower during off crop years due to alternate bearing for all treatments this effect was more pronounced in the treatments with smaller irrigation amounts highlighting the importance of applying adequate irrigation water in avocado crops even during off crop years holzapfel et al 2017 for the cultivation of avocados the size of the fruit is of particular economic importance in most cases short intervals between irrigation treatments increase fruit size for instance the average weight difference between fruits harvested from trees irrigated with the same amount of water at short vs longer intervals was 9 g for fuerte 18 g for hass and 35 g for ettinger schaffer et al 2013 moreno ortega et al 2019 the concentration of oils in the fruit increases with time and is related to the yield and size of the fruit the larger the fruit the higher the oil concentration in uniform fruits shorter irrigation intervals and increased amounts of water increase the concentration of oils as the concentration of oil in the fruit is an important indicator for determining the date of harvest it is possible to help early maturity by applying additional water at more frequent intervals schaffer et al 2013 5 6 the role of irrigation on frost and dry wind protection avocados are vulnerable to temperatures below zero degrees celsius irrigation is considered one of the most economical methods of frost protection due to the fact that water absorbs cold high water heat capacity generally in winter the trees are less sensitive to frost than in spring or autumn also reducing water during the fall can enhance frost resistance early flowering which is extremely sensitive to frost in addition wet soil has a greater ability to store and transfer heat than dry soil schaffer et al 2013 on the other hand if hot and dry winds occur during flowering and or fruit development common conditions in hot summer mediterranean climate the tree may lose its fruiting to reduce crop damage it is recommended to apply an additional 50 of the planned daily amount of water per day before the expected heat rodríguez pleguezuelo et al 2018 iron chlorosis of avocado trees caused by lime it occurs in alkaline soils with a high caco3 content reduced fe 2 availability in trees and can be aggravated by irrigation when it restricts soil aeration fe 2 deficiency often improves by reducing the amount of water applied or increasing irrigation intervals change of irrigation technique from micro sprinklers to drip irrigation in heavy calcareous soils reduce iron chlorosis so in alkaline soils with a high caco3 content the reduction of iron chlorosis in avocado orchards is closely related to irrigation practices applied schaffer et al 2013 kourgialas 2018 5 7 precision agriculture techniques 5 7 1 monitoring sensors hot summer mediterranean regions are experiencing increasing shortages of water for irrigation a fact that makes the optimization of irrigation strategies even more important than other regions this can be accomplished by deploying sensors that monitor soil moisture and plant water status in avocado orchards in a review of the literature on irrigation scheduling du plessis 1991 and karam et al 2019 strongly recommended the use of soil moisture sensors in commercial avocado orchards in order to optimize irrigation management and provide guidelines to farmers on sustainable irrigation new technological approaches in precision agriculture for avocado orchards include monitoring soil water content in root zone automatically using digital tensiometers and determine crop water requirements in online settings moreover multiple sensors for measuring soil moisture temperature and salinity are recommended for accurate monitoring of the whole soil profile the installation of access tubes tensiometers following the irrigation line in the middle point between two emitters 0 35 m from the emitter 1 m from the trunk is recommended for mature avocado orchards carr 2013 in the case of a uniform parcel topographic and the mechanical composition characteristics the placement of four tensiometers in four different trees is considered quite satisfactory for the complete capture of soil moisture in 0 1 ha parcel despite the extensive root system of avocado trees continuous and or periodic observations measurements of water potential in the soil in stable positions can be used to regulate the irrigation regime maintaining water content in the soil at a constant level indicates that irrigation is applied at the rate of water intake from the crop experiments have found that a representative depth to monitor soil moisture is at 0 3 m fig 4 at that depth there is a minimum threshold of critical matric potential that needs to be maintained depending on the soil type typical thresholds for sandy soils are 30 kpa and for clayey soils 50 kpa carr 2013 kourgialas 2018 when soil matric potential reaches these thresholds irrigation should be applied in california the use of a pair of tensiometers at depths of 0 30 m and 0 60 m is recommended by carr 2013 and karam et al 2019 to guide decisions on the onset of irrigation application and to avoid overwatering or underwatering the avocado trees when deciding on the location and number of soil moisture sensors to be deployed it is important to consider the heterogeneity of soils and how it affects the water distribution in the soil profile van leeuwen et al 2001 spatial soil variability plays a very important role in drip and microsprinkler irrigation systems as the number of sensors needed to obtain an accurate representation of the soil moisture profile increases with increased variability van leeuwen et al 2001 the installation of telemetric systems for monitoring soil moisture levels at one or more soil depths when dealing with high spatial heterogeneity is especially important to effectively optimize the time and amount of irrigation in addition given the high final price of the product the advantages of using telemetric systems for the automatic and continuous recording and monitoring of critical parameters in avocado irrigation meteorological and soil parameters tends to be increasingly adopted in commercial cultivations figs 5 and 6 plant water status methods are also important for ensuring proper irrigation of avocado orchards one such technique is to measure stomatal conductance but due to its complexity it is generally not recommended for wide commercial use researchers have investigated other alternative methods such as stem water potential swp and maximum daily trunk shrinkage mdts winer and zachs 2007 which can measure plant water status directly and are less prone to errors due to soil variability one potential downside of using swp is that it might not be sensitive enough to provide early detection of water stress in avocado to avoid loss of yield the mdts technique on the other hand is quite sensitive and could detect water stress early enough to avoid losses but due to its higher variability its performance as stress indicator might be inferior celedon et al 2012 overall when deciding on the use of a particular stress indicator both its sensitivity and its variability should be considered 5 7 2 fertigation in hot summer mediterranean climates given the frequent irrigation of the avocado crop the utilization of fertigation application of fertilizer solution with irrigation is an important technique for increasing the efficiency of fertilization mainly for macronutrients such as nitrogen and potassium in general despite the impressive size of the crown and the high productivity of the trees the need for nutrients is not very high indicatively they do not exceed 100 150 units of nitrogen and 180 200 units of potassium per ha phosphorus needs are significantly lower 40 50 units per ha although in practice due to the excessive use of compound fertilizers it is common to detect excess of this element both in the soil and in the leaves silber et al 2018 barikou et al 2018 this causes secondary feeding problems which are usually found in low zinc concentrations in the leaves of the other nutrients in areas with hot summer mediterranean climate low concentrations of boron are often observed in leaf analyzes while the onset of iron deficiency symptoms is mainly due to the installation of the avocado in calcareous soils with the exception of cases of nutritional imbalance zinc and unsuitable soil iron the remaining deficiencies are easily corrected by applying fertigation provided that they are diagnosed in time by leaf analysis silber et al 2018 kiggundu et al 2012 the importance of nutritional balance in avocado trees is demonstrated by rootstock scion interactions correlations between a number of nutrients and fruit quality interpretation of leaf analyses and the effects of salinity on nutrient concentrations table 2 the following table presents a summary of the effects of n p k applications and salinity on the changes on concentrations of other nutrients in avocado leaves based on the table below fertigation can be adjusted in case of salinity problems in order not to aggravate the problem nutrient management practices combined with irrigation using based on etc estimation and or soil water content measurements have been evaluated in terms of nutrient leaching and water savings in an experiment conducted by kiggundu et al 2012 the researchers found that applying granular fertilizers through the irrigation system eight times per year lead to reduced nutrient leaching compared to application twice per year the authors also assessed nutrient leaching by irrigating at 80 100 or 120 of etc and found no significant differences among the different levels so based on their results nutrient leaching being more influenced by the applied fertigation rate rather than irrigation management type 6 summary and conclusions given the recent expansion of avocado cultivation in new regions it is important to understand the challenges and limitations and discuss best management practices of its cultivation this need is more pronounced in regions that present less favorable growth conditions such as areas with typical hot summer mediterranean climate this review paper provides guidance on avocado cultivation in these regions with focus on its viability under water scarcity and salinity conditions at present hass is the most important avocado cultivar in the world and it is proving to be compatible to hot summer mediterranean climate areas appropriate rootstock selection is very important with the most desirable attributes being resistance to diseases such as phytophthora cinnamomi salinity tolerance adaptability to calcareous soils and sustainable high yields of quality fruit in terms of soil conditions the most important parameters affecting avocado tree growth and yields are a proper soil ph b low carbon content caco3 c low salinity d good drainage and e absence of historical background of occurrence of soil borne diseases avocado trees are considerably sensitive to salinity which is a common issue especially in hot summer mediterranean climate coastal regions it has been found that avocado yields begin to decline at irrigation water ec above 0 75 ds m and chloride concentrations greater than 100 ppm strategies for handling salinity usually aim at preventing the build up of salts in the root zone and minimizing the damaging effects of salinity on avocado trees specific studies on salinity responses of avocado have shown that it is highly influenced by rootstock selection thus it is crucial to identify and use rootstocks that are tolerant to irrigation with saline water based on a study by celis et al 2018 it has been found that dusa rootstock is the most salt tolerant rootstock while topa topa is the rootstock most sensitive to salinity the nabal rootstock was found to retain the highest levels of chloride concentration in the roots and lowest in the leaves of the plant compared to the other rootstocks tested in this study making it a promising candidate in terms of salt tolerance avocado trees are also sensitive to excess watering and flooding making the development of flood tolerant rootstocks a priority for cultivation in flood prone areas fassio et al 2011 found that hass avocado grafted onto mexicola rootstock has higher resistant to flooding than trees grafted onto nabal or zutano rootstocks the identification of genes important to the response to flooding by avocado is significant in order to develop rootstocks that indicate tolerance to flooding up to now molecular studies in this field have been limited water management during flowering can be critical to fruit production as there is increased water demand during this period with the rapid growth phase of the fruit being the second critical period in terms of irrigation needs during this period effective irrigation management reduces fruit drop and increases the final fruit size schaffer et al 2013 kourgialas 2018 it is important to note though that the application of larger amounts of water can lead to increased infiltration rates loss of water and nutrients which cannot be absorbed by the plant or cause root diseases more pronounced in soils with poor drainage in general two main irrigation systems are recommended for avocado cultivation a sprinkler irrigation which performs well on sandy soils and b drip irrigation one of the best techniques from a technical point of view due to water savings in addition to a proper irrigation system it is strongly recommended to use soil moisture sensor networks in avocado cultivations to optimize irrigation management and enhance the sustainable use of water new technological approaches in precision agriculture for avocado orchards include automated monitoring of soil water content in the root zone using digital tensiometers and direct estimation of crop water requirements to guide irrigation in addition sensors that monitor temperature nutrient levels and salinity are recommended for precise monitoring of the soil profile finally in hot summer mediterranean climates given the need for frequent irrigation of avocado trees the use of fertigation is recommended to increase the efficiency of fertilization focusing on macronutrients such as nitrogen and potassium studies have shown that nutrient leaching is more directly affected by the applied fertilizer rate rather than irrigation management type making fertigation an important way to promote tree growth and increase crop yields declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10093,the agricultural production faces the inevitable challenges under the climate change conditions which threaten the food security under these circumstances the increase of productivity can be regarded to ensure the food security the interaction of genetic management determines the performance of given crop and environmental factors and these elements should be simultaneously considered to have a sustainable production to enhance the productivity and eco efficiency of chickpea agro ecosystems in the west and northwest of iran we optimized the genotype g environment e management m interactions to access optimum grain yield and water use efficiency using ssm legume model three genotypes eight locations and 3 irrigation regimes were considered g e and m factors respectively the projections of future climate were conducted due to a 5 multi model ensemble under two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 2040 2070 using a methodology introduced by agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip the results indicated that across two rcps the climate change increased chickpea grain yield 11 due to the positive effects of rising co2 concentration which slightly increased wue 0 03 based on an increase in the evapotranspiration 10 9 and mean temperature 3 4 and a decrease during the chickpea growing period 21 9 however these decreases and increases can be mitigated and boosted using an optimal g e m combination ilc482 mid maturity genotype cold northwest environment si pod 60 supplementary irrigation of 60 mm at pod filling was the best g e m interaction due to optimum wue 6 98 kg ha 1 mm 1 and grain yield 1808 4 kg ha 1 for chickpea agro ecosystems in upcoming period 2040 2070 in general climate change and rising co2 concentration open up the opportunities to produce more grain yield in chickpea agro ecosystems moreover this production can be sustainably generated regarding wue by adopting a suitable g e m interaction keywords agmip methodology grain yield irrigation regime ssm legume model wue 1 introduction the deficit irrigation approach is considered a management strategy to decrease the amount of irrigation water as well as to conserve water resources wang and nair 2013 attia et al 2016 in this approach applying the irrigation water is lower than full crop water requirements evapotranspiration supplementary irrigation is recognized as one type of deficit irrigation management practices used in arid and semi arid environments to stabilize crop production and avoid crop production fluctuations fereres and soriano 2007 irrigating just at given phases of plant growth is common in the regions where water resources are restricted li et al 2005 xue et al 2006 farmers can use supplementary irrigation to reduce the adverse impacts of drought stress on the crop for example in a simulation study amiri et al 2016 evaluated the effect of supplementary irrigation regimes on chickpea grain yield in the northeastern iran they reported that supplementary irrigation at flowering and pod filling stages increased chickpea grain yield from 41 to 139 and from 13 to 66 respectively in another simulation study rashid et al 2019 analyzed the effect of deficit irrigation practice on wheat in the north china plain under climate change and predicted an increase 3 15 in water use efficiency wue under the deficit irrigation than full irrigation however given crop performance is not only determined by the management practices such as deficit irrigation but also is affected by other factors including environmental and genetic elements which should be considered to have a sustainable production rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 in fact under various environmental situations genotypes differently respond due to diverse genetic makeup which is called genotype environment interaction mansour et al 2017 eyni nargeseh et al 2020a for example rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 averagely predicted 5 72 decrease in the grain yield for maize agro ecosystems in the southwestern iran under the climate change conditions but they also indicated that this reduction could be mitigated and sustained using a suitable genotype environment management late maturity genotype summer season 10 time irrigation per crop in an experimental study in australia kaloki et al 2019 indicated that g e m interactions could impact chickpea yield stability so that 12 6 66 and 12 of the total variation in chickpea yield were related to g and m main effects and g e interactions respectively multi environment trial data are imperative to understand g e m interactions annicchiarico 2002 deihimfard et al 2019 kaloki et al 2019 however there is a limitation to capture such information by field experiments which especially occurred during the years of experimentation moreover assessing the effects of long term seasonal climatic variability in different environments are limited by the field experiments and a time consuming and costly method chenu 2014 deihimfard et al 2019 however designing a multi environment experiment is quite possible over many years by the mechanistic crop simulation models in the modeling approach the researchers can set the huge number of long term simulation experiments to examine the different treatments of g e m interactions e g 9000 50 000 and 3420 simulation experiments in casadebaig et al 2016 rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 2021 respectively moreover the crop models are suitable tools to predict and assess g e m interactions under climate change conditions for example in a crop modeling approach liu et al 2013 found a strong effect of g m interaction on maize productivity in china their results showed that each of the adaptation strategies including early sowing window and long maturity genotype boosted the yields by 4 and 38 respectively based on the food and agriculture organization fao report iran is one of the most important chickpea producing countries in the world fao 2018 in this country the chickpea is the major and dominant legume due to yield and area under cultivation this pulse is cultivated in approximately 500 000 ha of which over 95 are produced under rainfed conditions sabaghpour et al 2006 the average chickpea grain yield is as low as 400 600 kg ha 1 in iran which is less than the world average of 900 kg ha 1 anonymous 2018 fao 2018 this study aimed i to assess climate change effect on different chickpea agro ecosystems in the west and northwest of iran ii to evaluate three chickpea genotypes as genetic factors under the different locations as environment factors and various irrigation regimes as management factors responding to climate change iii to achieve an optimal g e m combination as an optimal strategy to boost chickpea grain yield and water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study locations and weather data this study was conducted in eight chickpea producing locations of iran including ardabil tabriz hamedan kermanshah khorramabad sanandaj urmia and zanjan fig 1 and table 1 these locations were classified into three climate types including arid and cold semi arid and cold and semi arid and temperate due to köppen climate methodology table 1 kottek et al 2006 karki et al 2016 the details of köppen climatic classifications can be found in kottek et al 2006 karki et al 2016 kermanshah and tabriz were chosen because the major chickpea growing locations in iran are placed in the west and northwest of country which approximately accounts for 50 of total production anonymous 2018 two major centers of dryland agricultural research institute dari of iran are located in tabriz as the major center for cold regions and kermanshah as the major center for temperate regions other locations were singled out for their high area under the cultivation and wide distribution over the west and northwest of iranian chickpea agro ecosystems table 1 daily long term weather data of each location precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperatures c and sunshine hours were obtained from iran meteorological organization from 1980 to 2010 as the crop model requires the radiation refer to next sections sunshine hours were first converted to daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 for this purpose solar radiation was calculated using sunshine hours extraterrestrial radiation and the angstrom equation prescott 1940 2 2 future climate scenario generations daily long term climate data of baseline including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation were employed to generate future climate conditions for this objective future climate scenarios generated due to the delta method introduced by agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip methodology agmip 2013a 2013b under two optimistic rcp4 5 and pessimistic rcp8 5 climate scenarios moss et al 2010 for mid century 2040 2070 in the methodology the future climate is predicted based on the absolute change in minimum and maximum air temperatures and relative change in precipitation in climate general circulation models gcms hudson and ruane 2013 araya et al 2015 rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 eyni nargeseh et al 2020b a co2 concentration of 360 ppm was used for the baseline simulations of 1980 2010 whereas 499 and 571 ppm were considered for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively under future 2040 2070 to capture the effect of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration of future climates on crop growth and grain yield we used two modifications which made by soltani et al 2007 soltani and sinclair 2011 in the model in these modifications increasing co2 concentration directly affects the radiation use efficiency rue and transpiration efficiency coefficient tec so that rue and tec are increased by raising co2 concentration the details of top mentioned modifications can be found by soltani et al 2007 soltani and sinclair 2011 five general circulation models gcms from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 including hadgem2 es jones et al 2011 miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 mpi esm mr giorgetta et al 2013 gfdl cm3 griffies et al 2011 and giss e2 r miller et al 2014 were used to capture changes in future climate each gcm has its own features for example hadgem2 es mpi esm mr and gfdl cm3 were categorized as dry time series models while miroc5 and giss e2 r are grouped as wet time series models ruane and mcdermid 2017 asseng et al 2019 e eyshi rezaei pers comm in dry time series models the future climate of locations is projected to be drier by decreasing rainfall amount compared to the baseline conversely in wet time series models the future climate of locations is predicted to be wetter by increasing rainfall amount compared to the baseline gcms characteristics are presented in table 2 2 3 crop model ssm legume model ssm legume model was employed to simulate phenological development leaf development and senescence biomass production and partitioning plant nitrogen balance yield formation and soil water balance the responses of crop processes to environmental factors of solar radiation photoperiod temperature nitrogen and water availability and genotype differences were considered in the model the model readily captures the available weather and soil information in a daily time step the model was extensively evaluated using the independent data from a wide range of growth and environmental conditions across iran soltani and sinclair 2011 amiri deh ahmadi et al 2014 amiri et al 2016 amiri et al 2020 and india e g vadez et al 2013 2 4 calibration and validation of the ssm legume model the model was calibrated using measured data from a two year field experiment conducted in growing seasons of 2011 and 2012 the experiment was a factorial arrangement based on a randomized complete block design with four replications conducted in the research field of khorramabad 33 29n 48 22e iran three genotypes with the different maturity bivanij ilc482 and hashem as early mid and late maturity respectively along with three sowing dates 21 december 20 march and 4 april were included in the study chickpea crops received 261 and 283 mm rainfall in 2011 and 2012 respectively and they experienced 17 5 and 16 c mean temperature in 2011 and 2012 respectively each experimental plot involved 5 m long and 5 rows with an inter row space of 50 cm as well as a plant density of 33 plants m 2 the soil texture was silty loam based on soil analysis and recommendations applied fertilizer was just 40 kg ha 1 urea as starter at sowing time the chickpea was irrigated based on 60 mm cumulative evaporation from a class a evaporation pan during its growing season the sampling size was 0 5 m2 the chickpea crops were harvested on 25 june and 2 july 2011 and 2012 respectively to measure the grain yield the final harvest was conducted by harvesting the two middle rows 10 m2 at physiological maturity at 12 humidity the field data were applied to estimate required genotype specific parameters for model under potential conditions without water and nutrient stresses table 3 for model calibration using a trial and error procedure the difference between observed and simulated values was minimized relevant parameters which strongly influenced dry matter and lai were adjusted the procedure was iterated until the closest match between the model simulated and observed values were obtained for all treatments bhatia et al 2008 for water content calibration and model validation independent observed data from different field experiments carried out in a wide range of treatments and environments were used table 4 with high variability in rainfall and temperature in these experiments standard agronomic practices for weed disease and insect control and optimum fertilization were applied to avoid biotic and abiotic stresses the day for flowering dry matter and grain yield traits obtained from the field experiments were considered to validate the crop model the following indices were calculated to measure the differences between observed and simulated data huang et al 2009 for model evaluation the determination coefficient r2 1 1 line the normalized root mean square error nrmse wallach and goffinet 1987 index of agreement d index willmott 1982 and mean bias error mbe willmott and matsuura 2005 were computed to compare observed and simulated values of grain yield and soil moisture content as follows 1 d index 1 0 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 2 nrmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 100 o 3 mbe i 1 n s i o i n where ō o s and n are the mean observed data observed data simulated data and number of observations respectively model accuracy increases as the nrmse and mbe values approach zero and the d index approaches one matching two regression and 1 1 lines confirms the high accuracy of model higher r2 closing to unity illustrates that the model accurately simulates the reality the nrmse and d index range from 0 to and 0 1 respectively mbe ranges from to to depict the direction and magnitude of bias shows the underestimation and overestimation of model 2 5 model application long term simulation experiments the simulations were arranged due to the results of a previous study amiri et al 2020 their results showed that dsm2 dormant seeding around late february and dsm1 dormant seeding around 20 december are the best sowing dates for the baseline and future conditions respectively hence 25 february and 20 december were set as the baseline and future sowing dates respectively for all simulations in the current study under dormant seeding management the seeds remained ungerminated and dormant in the soil until some criteria were met in other words the germination is done when the soil moisture and air temperature are optimized for chickpea after frost and low temperatures period in winter in this management system it is assumed that germination occurs once the initial soil moisture in the top soil layer 200 mm filled to the volumetric transpirable soil water 0 13 200 while the temperature of top soil layer is above the base of 4 5 c we focused on the effect of various genotypes as genetic factors different locations with multiple climate types as environment factors and irrigation regimes as management factors on crop yield and wue early beavanij as common genotype in study locations mid ilc482 and late maturity hashem kabuli genotypes were considered to assess the effect of genetic elements under present conditions in iranian chickpea agro ecosystems the farmers normally cultivate chickpea crop in rainfed situations in addition to the rainfed conditions supplementary irrigating at flowering and pod filling stages were chosen as the irrigation scenarios to present the effect of management practices it was assumed that chickpea crops could be irrigated at flowering si flow 60 or pod filling si pod 60 stage with supplementary irrigation of 60 mm soltani et al 2016 amiri et al 2020 the irrigation efficiency of 100 was assumed in all simulations the irrigation efficiency is the ratio of water amount utilized by the crop to water amount supplied via the irrigation hence for an irrigation efficiency of 50 120 mm of irrigation water is required plant density was 33 plants m 2 20 kg ha 1 n fertilizer was used as a starter fertilizer at sowing date a soil with a volumetric water content of 0 13 cm3 cm 3 the albedo of 0 12 curve number of 79 and depth of 100 cm was considered in all simulations the model uses the volumetric extractable water content which is fairly constant at 0 13 cm3 cm 3 unless soil sand percentage is higher than 80 ritchie et al 1999 due to dewan and famouri 1964 the chosen soil depth is an output of a joint project between iran s ministry of agriculture and fao based on the report most of the iranian dryland soils have 50 150 cm depth selecting the soil depth of 100 cm is as well as a reflection of chickpea effective water extraction depth which is mainly 100 cm due to the reports from regions in iran and other parts of wana western asia and north africa region soltani and sinclair 2011 however by a soil depth of 100 cm an effective extraction depth remains100 cm if there is no rainfall at that time in studying locations the farmers normally use light irrigation at sowing to establish the seedlings evenly amiri et al 2020 moreover the initial soil water was considered to be 70 of the volumetric extractable soil water at sowing in all simulations ssm legume model only predicts the effects of abiotic stresses which does not consider the impact of biotic stresses pests and diseases in facts the current version of model has not parameterized to capture the impact of biotic stresses in total 22 320 simulations were generated 8 locations 3 genotypes 3 irrigation levels 5 general circulation models 2 future emission scenarios and an average of 31 yr of historical weather data 2 6 crop model output and statistical analyses this study presented grain yield wue chickpea water consumption mean temperature and cumulative rainfall during the chickpea growing period wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the grain yield kg ha 1 per unit of water consumed by actual evapotranspiration et mm wang et al 2017 the median of multi model ensemble median of 5 gcms was subjected to analyze in r and graph in originpro 9 1 using the analysis of variance anova all multi year simulation output data of crop grain yields and wue were analyzed the study used a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement in all analyses the simulation years were considered as replications the analysis was done using sas v 9 1 2 sas 2003 software 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation in the calibration the comparison between observed and simulated maximum lai and dry matter in maximum lai for bivanij ilc482 and hashem genotypes table 5 showed that the genotype specific parameters within the model were reasonably adjusted the model predicted maximum lai and dry matter in maximum lai with nrmse of 14 35 and 10 96 mbe of 0 03 and 341 9 kg ha 1 d index of 0 97 and 0 98 and r2 of 0 94 and 0 96 respectively which indicated a close agreement between field measured and simulated values table 5 the nrmse values for soil water content ranged from 3 73 2011 to 5 34 2012 fig 2 the d index varied from 0 99 2011 to 0 98 2012 fig 2 this shows that the ssm legume model captured the soil water balance with high accuracy during the growing period of chickpea under different years however the ssm legume model underestimated the soil water content in both experiments with an mbe of 0 001 cm3 cm 3 in 2011 to 0 009 cm3 cm 3 in 2012 fig 2 fig 3 indicates model validation results for three genotypes of bivanij ilc482 and hashem using much experimental data collected in a wide range of environments and management practices table 4 validation results indicated that the model predicted phonological development i e days to flowering reasonably well fig 3 for instance the nrmse mbe and d index for days to flowering were 7 5 1 6 and 0 96 respectively besides the coefficient of determination r2 value for regression between observed and simulated days to flowering was 0 88 for all genotypes model validation results indicated that the model could also predict chickpea dry matter and grain yield at different locations and seasons reasonably well based on fig 3 the values of nrmse mbe d index and r2 for grain yield were 15 5 2 kg 98 and 0 92 respectively while these values for dry matter were 11 21 9 kg 0 98 and 0 95 respectively indicate that ssm legume model could simulate the growth and grain yield of chickpea reasonably well for across all sites years and genotypes moreover the coefficient of determination values of grain yield 0 95 and dry matter 0 92 represented that the crop model accurately captured the effects of different environmental conditions and the differences among various genotypes 3 2 changes in future mean temperature and cumulative rainfall in present conditions iranian chickpea agro ecosystems were classified into the three climate types due to the köppen climate classification a variability is observed in seasonal mean temperature and rainfall among the locations and climate types chickpea crops experience the highest mean temperature 26 c in the semi arid and temperate locations and complete their growth under cooler weather at the arid and cold regions 19 c table 6 on average iranian chickpea agro ecosystems receive 133 31 mm rainfall which ranged from 113 14 mm in semi arid and cold locations to 163 14 mm in semi arid and temperate locations table 6 for the future five general circulation models gcms simulated an increase in seasonal mean temperature and high variability in rainfall table 6 during the chickpea growing period the ensemble of gcms projected that median mean temperature rose by 4 4 and average rainfall 35 16 increased averaged across all locations the seasonal mean temperature is predicted to be between 23 9 c gfdlcm3 gcm rcp4 5 scenario and 25 1 c hadgem2es gcm rcp8 5 scenario in 2040 2070 table 6 results from the gcms were highly variable across locations for rainfall for example when averaged across rcps the highest variability was recorded in khorramabad from 218 16 mm for mpiesmmr to 357 08 mm for miroc5 table 6 in contrast the lowest variability belonged to hamedan from 138 69 mm for miroc5 to 161 23 mm for gisse2r in general the results indicated noteworthy variation in climate parameters over gcms and locations which the variations became more at two optimistic rcp4 5 and pessimistic rcp8 5 scenarios 3 3 grain yield long term simulations for the baseline showed that the effect of genetic g genotypes environmental e locations and management m irrigation regimes factors on grain yield was significant p 0 01 fig 4 and table 7 however the response of grain yield to e factor was more than g and m factors so that this response varied from 812 semi arid and temperate regions in the northwest to 1894 kg ha 1 arid and cold regions in the west fig 4 and table 1 the variability in grain yield became more by considering m and e together and averaged across irrigation regimes grain yield ranged from 365 hashem genotype semi arid and temperate location or climate type to 2092 kg ha 1 ilc482 genotype arid and cold location or climate type regarding the g e and m factors simultaneously grain yield ranged from 2311 hashem arid and cold si pod 60 to 208 kg ha 1 hashem semi arid and temperate rainfed fig 4 in general at present condition the optimal combination of g e m was a late maturity hashem arid and cold locations climate type si pod 60 2311 kg ha 1 climate change increased the future chickpea grain yield compared to the baseline the increase was 8 and 14 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 5 however the increase was different amongst various locations genotypes and irrigation management practices for example a mid maturity genotype ilc482 increased grain yield 17 more than early 16 and late maturity 3 genotypes furthermore allocating irrigation at the pod filling stage was more effective than applying irrigation at the flowering stage so that across all genotypes and locations the greatest increase in grain yield was achieved in si pod 60 39 moreover cold regions in the northwest 1748 kg ha 1 boosted more chickpea grain yield than western locations 1041 kg ha 1 figs 1 and 4 in the mid future 2050 applying irrigation at both pod filling si pod 60 47 and flowering si flow 60 5 stages increased grain yield compared with farmers current irrigation practice rainfed fig 5 across all irrigation regimes locations and rcps using a mid maturity genotype ilc482 1700 kg ha 1 showed better performance than a common genotype beavanij as an early maturity genotype 1460 kg ha 1 in the future in general for the entire chickpea agro ecosystems the highest future grain yield 1786 and 1915 kg ha 1 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively was predicted for ilc482 genotype g si pod 60 irrigation management regime m fig 5 also the above mentioned g m interaction in semi arid and temperate environments e was the best yielding combination of g e m ilc482 genotype northwestern regions si pod 60 in the upcoming period 2233 kg ha 1 fig 5 and table 1 3 4 wue the first impression of fig 4 is that wue is significantly p 0 01 table 7 affected by locations as the environment e factor in general northwestern chickpea agro ecosystems had higher wue than western areas for example the greatest and lowest wue was obtained in tabriz in the northwest 8 13 kg ha 1 mm 1 and sanandaj in the west 2 60 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively fig 4 and table 1 genetic g was the second effective factor on wue so that choosing a mid maturity genotype ilc482 increased wue up to 6 13 kg ha 1 mm 1 followed by early beavanij 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 and late maturity hashem 3 46 kg ha 1 mm 1 genotypes furthermore for a given genotype and location supplementary irrigation at pod filling 16 made more positive changes in wue than irrigation at the flowering stage 0 compared with current farmers management practice rainfed however by considering three factors of g e and m the best interaction of g e m was achieved at ilc482 genotype arid and cold climate si pod 60 9 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the baseline period fig 4 for the mid future 2050 the changes in wue was significant p 0 01 table 7 based on various rcps locations genotypes and irrigation regimes compared to the baseline figs 4 and 6 for example averaged across different locations genotypes and irrigation practices wue decreased and increased compared to baseline at 2 and 2 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively figs 4 and 6 however in some areas averaged across two rcps wue declined by 8 in ardabil as an arid and cold region and increased by 37 in khorramabad as a semi arid and temperate region in the future conditions compared to the baseline situations in the future on average across all irrigation regimes and genotypes choosing the best e factor location increased wue to 3 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the northwest diﬀerence between 3 77 and 7 02 kg ha 1 mm 1 for northwestern and western regions respectively fig 6 and table 1 it is more enhanced when the role of other factors such as genotypes was included wue boosted as much as 3 19 kg ha 1 mm 1 in ilc482 genotype northwest compared to beavanij genotype as farmers common genotype west using an optimal irrigation practice further boosted this value to 7 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 for ilc482 genotype northwest si pod 60 irrigation regime fig 6 and table 1 4 discussion 4 1 the ssm legume model accurately captured the effects various management practices soils and climates the general agreement between simulated and observed values of days to flowering lai dry matter soil water content and grain yield under a range of growth conditions including various locations with various annual cumulative rainfalls 101 234 mm annual mean temperatures 13 18 c and soils from silty clay loam to clay under different years and management practices figs 2 3 tables 4 and 5 shows that ssm legume model has a good predictive ability in fact the accurate prediction of phenology makes a good prediction of lai providing a good estimate of biomass production furthermore accurate prediction of phenology provides a precise prediction of biomass partitioning among the different parts of chickpea at multiple phenological stages consequently grain yield rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 many studies show that the ssm model can capture the effects of various management practices soils and climates on different crops e g vadez et al 2013 sinclair et al 2014 vadez et al 2017 ghanem et al 2015a 2015b vadez et al 2012 amiri and deihimfard 2018 for example in a simulation study in the middle east lebanon and syria ghanem et al 2015a 2015b ssm model was precisely able to simulate grain yield of lentil lens culinaris over different sowing dates as spring to autumn cultivars from long cycle cultivar to short cycle cultivar soils from inceptisol to vertisol and climates from dry to the mediterranean with rmse of 14 in another simulation study in the southwest france marrou et al 2014 the ssm model accurately captured lingot bean grain yield phaseolus vulgaris over five years and various irrigation scenarios with an rmse of 21 furthermore in a simulation study in two locations varying in latitude high latitude hisar haryana india low latitude icrisat andhra pradesh india vadez et al 2013 ssm model was precisely able to simulate grain yield of chickpea over different sowing dates 1 november and 28 october two irrigation levels rainfed and irrigated different genotypes from an early maturity genotype to late maturity genotype and soils from vertisols to entisols with rmse of 12 in general since the model could simulate grain yield of chickpea genotypes in various locations with different soils and climates and under different years and management practices the model can be used to assess the effect of genotype environment management in the present study and other studies 4 2 a right balance of grain yield wue and water consumption can be achieved by suitable genotype environment management at baseline at the baseline the simulation results showed that the common genotype beavanij as an early maturity genotype is not optimal due to the grain yield and wue for chickpea agro ecosystems in fact a mid maturity genotype ilc482 genotype had better grain yield and wue than beavanij genotype due to higher days to maturity and reproductive growth duration 122 and 28 d for ilc482 genotype and 119 and 26 d for beavanij genotype table 8 however a longer growth period does not always increase the grain yield and wue especially under water limited conditions for example hashem genotype had the highest days to maturity and reproductive growth duration table 8 but it produced the lowest wue fig 4 in fact under water limited conditions a very long growth period on the one hand causes plants to face the water deficit stress at the end of growing period leading to grain yield reduction e g faraji et al 2009 on the other hand it increases evapotranspiration resulting in wue reduction e g amiri and deihimfard 2018 regression analysis of wue and evapotranspiration fig 7 confirms this also the results approved that hashem genotype had the highest evapotranspiration 306 mm due to the highest growing period fig 8 and table 8 in general there is a need for a right balance among grain yield wue and water consumption evapotranspiration which can be achieved by a mid maturity genotype ilc482 the results showed that supplementary irrigation at the pod filling stage si pod 60 was superior to supplementary irrigation at the flowering stage si flow 60 and rainfed due to grain yield for all locations on the other hand si flow 60 and si pod 60 compared to rainfed as common farmers irrigation management practice increased grain yield by 5 and 47 respectively fig 4 the reason for the superiority of supplementary irrigation at the pod filling stage was the longer days to maturity compared to supplementary irrigation at flowering stage and rainfed respectively table 8 moreover irrigating at the pod filling stage increases fertile pod numbers per plant which consequently results in higher grain yield e g mohammed et al 2017 due to above statements ilc482 genotype si pod 60 performed better in terms of grain yield and wue than common interaction of g m beavanij rainfed fig 4 in fact ilc482 si pod 60 124 d expanded its growth period more than beavanij rainfed 118 d and produced higher grain yield in turn had higher wue also ilc482 si pod 60 as g m s optimal interaction yielded better in cold and arid regions in general the optimal grain yield and wue were obtained in an arid and cold climate because there was the optimum reproductive growth duration 30 d higher than semi arid and temperate 20 d in the northwest with cold climate conditions fig 1 chickpea crops experienced lower mean temperature during their growing period 24 c than in temperate regions in the west 26 c table 6 so ilc482 si pod 60 had the chance to extend more its growing period under cold climate conditions in the northwest and recorded higher grain yield and wue simultaneously fig 4 many studies support that there is a direct and positive relationship between growth period and grain yield soltani et al 2016 rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 amiri et al 2020 in general at baseline the best combination of g e m to improve grain yield and wue would be ilc482 cold regions si pod 60 and this interaction can be recommended to produce sustainable chickpea production mohammed et al 2017 in northeastern ethiopia reported that mid maturity genotype supplementary irrigation is important in areas where high temperature is a major crop production constraint in the present climate conditions 4 3 positive effects of co2 and optimal genotype environment management interaction on wue and grain yield in the future in agricultural systems sustainable production depends on the choice of suitable g e m in these systems sustainability is optimally achieved using limited resources such as water and exploiting free natural resources like rainfall radiation and temperature rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 it was predicted that moving from northwestern chickpea agro ecosystems with cold climate to western chickpea agro ecosystems with temperature climate fig 1 caused a considerable change in wue through the changes in grain yield evapotranspiration and temperature figs 5 6 7 and table 6 under rcps scenarios and across all locations genotypes and irrigation regimes grain yield increased compared to the baseline figs 4 and 5 this could be highly associated to the rising co2 concentration to 535 ppm on average across rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios which neutralized the negative impact of high temperature 6 during the chickpea growing period and consequently boosted grain yield fig 5 and table 6 however across two rcps increasing grain yield did not compensate for the increase in evapotranspiration 13 and consequently slightly increased wue 0 03 figs 6 and 7 it can be seen by the negative coefficient of regression between wue and evapotranspiration for future in fig 7 there are many reports regarding neutralizing the negative effect of global warming on grain yield by increasing co2 deihimfard et al 2018 amiri et al 2020 and reducing wue by rising evapotranspiration in the future rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 in 2040 2070 period the amount and increase or decrease in grain yield and wue varied across different locations as e factor figs 5 and 6 grain yield and wue were higher in northwestern agro ecosystems with cold climate than western chickpea agro ecosystems with temperature climate due to lower mean temperature 24 25 vs 25 02 c and evapotranspiration 285 5 vs 365 9 mm and higher the duration of the growth period 159 5 vs 138 5 d figs 1 7 and 8 table 6 cold areas in the northwest provided better conditions for genotypes to show their genetic potential different genotypes more extended their growth period in the northwestern locations 7 than the other locations and produced higher grain yield and wue figs 5 and 6 mid maturity ilc482 genotype better performed based on wue and grain yield than early maturity genotype beavanij as common genotype due to higher days to maturity and reproductive growth duration 149 and 29 d for ilc482 genotype and 145 and 27 d for beavanij genotype fig 8 in fact high temperatures will shorten chickpea reproductive growth period in the future and mid maturing genotype will be needed to counterbalance the effect of accelerated phenology although late maturity genotype hashem had the highest days to maturity 157 d compared to beavanij 145 d and ilc482 149 d genotypes the higher evapotranspiration 352 mm resulted in minimal grain yield and wue in hashem genotype figs 5 6 7 and 8 other researchers reported almost similar results by investigating grain yield and wue under climate change for example xiao et al 2018 investigated the effect of climate change on spring and winter wheat production in china and concluded that grain yield and wue were directly affected by evapotranspiration their results showed that wue and grain yield was decreased when cumulative transpiration was higher for spring and winter wheat genotypes in the future and across all irrigation management practices the interaction of ilc482 genotype northwestern locations was the superior interaction of g e due to grain yield and wue figs 5 and 6 because of the optimum growth period evapotranspiration and low mean temperature figs 7 8 and table 6 moreover when the ilc482 northwestern interaction was applied along with si pod 60 regime there were more improvements in grain yield and wue in fact irrigating at the pod filling stage improves grain yield by increasing fertile pod numbers per plant e g mohammed et al 2017 attia et al 2016 to evaluate winter wheat response to irrigation management in the texas high plains showed that single irrigation of 100 mm at jointing or booting had 35 higher grain yield than rainfed vadez et al 2012 in the northern india showed that while 30 mm of irrigation at the first seed stage would increase chickpea yield by 29 the best genetic trait to improve soil water capture would hardly increase yield by 10 in total ilc482 northwestern si pod 60 was the best g e m combination for the upcoming period 2040 2070 studies have approved the different effects of g e m interaction on yield anderson 2010 hatfield and walthall 2015 teixeira et al 2017 which can be generalized to wue due to the important effect of grain yield on wue finally it is recommended that farmers simultaneously pay attention to all g e m factors for sustainable due to wue and higher due to grain yield production finally we obtained these results based on the absence of biotic stresses pests plant diseases weeds and it is recommended that this issue can be addressed in other studies as one of the major challenges for agriculture during the coming decades lehmann et al 2013 hirschi et al 2012 trnka et al 2007 bergez et al 2010 5 conclusion at the baseline our results revealed that the common genotype beavanij as an early maturity genotype and common irrigation management practice rainfed are not optimal in terms of grain yield and wue for chickpea agro ecosystems across all locations the optimal g m of ilc482 si pod 60 regime boosted grain yield and wue 31 1 and 24 8 respectively compared with the common g m beavanij rainfed moreover ilc482 si pod 60 as g m s optimal interaction yielded better in the cold northwest environment e at the baseline ilc482 cold northwest environment si pod 60 was generally the best g e m interaction in terms of wue 9 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 and grain yield 1645 9 kg ha 1 in the future across two rcps climate change increased chickpea grain yield 11 due to positive effects of rising co2 concentration and slightly increased wue 0 03 due to an increase in evapotranspiration and mean temperature and a decrease in duration of chickpea growing period however these decreases and increases can be mitigated and boosted by applying an optimal g e m combination ilc482 cold northwest environment si pod 60 was the best g e m interaction regarding optimum wue and grain yield for chickpea agro ecosystems in the upcoming period 2040 2070 in general climate change and rising co2 concentration will open up opportunities to produce more grain yield in chickpea agro ecosystems furthermore this production can sustainably be generated regarding wue by adopting a suitable g e m interaction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10093,the agricultural production faces the inevitable challenges under the climate change conditions which threaten the food security under these circumstances the increase of productivity can be regarded to ensure the food security the interaction of genetic management determines the performance of given crop and environmental factors and these elements should be simultaneously considered to have a sustainable production to enhance the productivity and eco efficiency of chickpea agro ecosystems in the west and northwest of iran we optimized the genotype g environment e management m interactions to access optimum grain yield and water use efficiency using ssm legume model three genotypes eight locations and 3 irrigation regimes were considered g e and m factors respectively the projections of future climate were conducted due to a 5 multi model ensemble under two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 2040 2070 using a methodology introduced by agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip the results indicated that across two rcps the climate change increased chickpea grain yield 11 due to the positive effects of rising co2 concentration which slightly increased wue 0 03 based on an increase in the evapotranspiration 10 9 and mean temperature 3 4 and a decrease during the chickpea growing period 21 9 however these decreases and increases can be mitigated and boosted using an optimal g e m combination ilc482 mid maturity genotype cold northwest environment si pod 60 supplementary irrigation of 60 mm at pod filling was the best g e m interaction due to optimum wue 6 98 kg ha 1 mm 1 and grain yield 1808 4 kg ha 1 for chickpea agro ecosystems in upcoming period 2040 2070 in general climate change and rising co2 concentration open up the opportunities to produce more grain yield in chickpea agro ecosystems moreover this production can be sustainably generated regarding wue by adopting a suitable g e m interaction keywords agmip methodology grain yield irrigation regime ssm legume model wue 1 introduction the deficit irrigation approach is considered a management strategy to decrease the amount of irrigation water as well as to conserve water resources wang and nair 2013 attia et al 2016 in this approach applying the irrigation water is lower than full crop water requirements evapotranspiration supplementary irrigation is recognized as one type of deficit irrigation management practices used in arid and semi arid environments to stabilize crop production and avoid crop production fluctuations fereres and soriano 2007 irrigating just at given phases of plant growth is common in the regions where water resources are restricted li et al 2005 xue et al 2006 farmers can use supplementary irrigation to reduce the adverse impacts of drought stress on the crop for example in a simulation study amiri et al 2016 evaluated the effect of supplementary irrigation regimes on chickpea grain yield in the northeastern iran they reported that supplementary irrigation at flowering and pod filling stages increased chickpea grain yield from 41 to 139 and from 13 to 66 respectively in another simulation study rashid et al 2019 analyzed the effect of deficit irrigation practice on wheat in the north china plain under climate change and predicted an increase 3 15 in water use efficiency wue under the deficit irrigation than full irrigation however given crop performance is not only determined by the management practices such as deficit irrigation but also is affected by other factors including environmental and genetic elements which should be considered to have a sustainable production rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 in fact under various environmental situations genotypes differently respond due to diverse genetic makeup which is called genotype environment interaction mansour et al 2017 eyni nargeseh et al 2020a for example rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 averagely predicted 5 72 decrease in the grain yield for maize agro ecosystems in the southwestern iran under the climate change conditions but they also indicated that this reduction could be mitigated and sustained using a suitable genotype environment management late maturity genotype summer season 10 time irrigation per crop in an experimental study in australia kaloki et al 2019 indicated that g e m interactions could impact chickpea yield stability so that 12 6 66 and 12 of the total variation in chickpea yield were related to g and m main effects and g e interactions respectively multi environment trial data are imperative to understand g e m interactions annicchiarico 2002 deihimfard et al 2019 kaloki et al 2019 however there is a limitation to capture such information by field experiments which especially occurred during the years of experimentation moreover assessing the effects of long term seasonal climatic variability in different environments are limited by the field experiments and a time consuming and costly method chenu 2014 deihimfard et al 2019 however designing a multi environment experiment is quite possible over many years by the mechanistic crop simulation models in the modeling approach the researchers can set the huge number of long term simulation experiments to examine the different treatments of g e m interactions e g 9000 50 000 and 3420 simulation experiments in casadebaig et al 2016 rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 2021 respectively moreover the crop models are suitable tools to predict and assess g e m interactions under climate change conditions for example in a crop modeling approach liu et al 2013 found a strong effect of g m interaction on maize productivity in china their results showed that each of the adaptation strategies including early sowing window and long maturity genotype boosted the yields by 4 and 38 respectively based on the food and agriculture organization fao report iran is one of the most important chickpea producing countries in the world fao 2018 in this country the chickpea is the major and dominant legume due to yield and area under cultivation this pulse is cultivated in approximately 500 000 ha of which over 95 are produced under rainfed conditions sabaghpour et al 2006 the average chickpea grain yield is as low as 400 600 kg ha 1 in iran which is less than the world average of 900 kg ha 1 anonymous 2018 fao 2018 this study aimed i to assess climate change effect on different chickpea agro ecosystems in the west and northwest of iran ii to evaluate three chickpea genotypes as genetic factors under the different locations as environment factors and various irrigation regimes as management factors responding to climate change iii to achieve an optimal g e m combination as an optimal strategy to boost chickpea grain yield and water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study locations and weather data this study was conducted in eight chickpea producing locations of iran including ardabil tabriz hamedan kermanshah khorramabad sanandaj urmia and zanjan fig 1 and table 1 these locations were classified into three climate types including arid and cold semi arid and cold and semi arid and temperate due to köppen climate methodology table 1 kottek et al 2006 karki et al 2016 the details of köppen climatic classifications can be found in kottek et al 2006 karki et al 2016 kermanshah and tabriz were chosen because the major chickpea growing locations in iran are placed in the west and northwest of country which approximately accounts for 50 of total production anonymous 2018 two major centers of dryland agricultural research institute dari of iran are located in tabriz as the major center for cold regions and kermanshah as the major center for temperate regions other locations were singled out for their high area under the cultivation and wide distribution over the west and northwest of iranian chickpea agro ecosystems table 1 daily long term weather data of each location precipitation mm maximum and minimum temperatures c and sunshine hours were obtained from iran meteorological organization from 1980 to 2010 as the crop model requires the radiation refer to next sections sunshine hours were first converted to daily solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 for this purpose solar radiation was calculated using sunshine hours extraterrestrial radiation and the angstrom equation prescott 1940 2 2 future climate scenario generations daily long term climate data of baseline including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation were employed to generate future climate conditions for this objective future climate scenarios generated due to the delta method introduced by agricultural model intercomparison and improvement project agmip methodology agmip 2013a 2013b under two optimistic rcp4 5 and pessimistic rcp8 5 climate scenarios moss et al 2010 for mid century 2040 2070 in the methodology the future climate is predicted based on the absolute change in minimum and maximum air temperatures and relative change in precipitation in climate general circulation models gcms hudson and ruane 2013 araya et al 2015 rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 eyni nargeseh et al 2020b a co2 concentration of 360 ppm was used for the baseline simulations of 1980 2010 whereas 499 and 571 ppm were considered for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively under future 2040 2070 to capture the effect of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration of future climates on crop growth and grain yield we used two modifications which made by soltani et al 2007 soltani and sinclair 2011 in the model in these modifications increasing co2 concentration directly affects the radiation use efficiency rue and transpiration efficiency coefficient tec so that rue and tec are increased by raising co2 concentration the details of top mentioned modifications can be found by soltani et al 2007 soltani and sinclair 2011 five general circulation models gcms from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 including hadgem2 es jones et al 2011 miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 mpi esm mr giorgetta et al 2013 gfdl cm3 griffies et al 2011 and giss e2 r miller et al 2014 were used to capture changes in future climate each gcm has its own features for example hadgem2 es mpi esm mr and gfdl cm3 were categorized as dry time series models while miroc5 and giss e2 r are grouped as wet time series models ruane and mcdermid 2017 asseng et al 2019 e eyshi rezaei pers comm in dry time series models the future climate of locations is projected to be drier by decreasing rainfall amount compared to the baseline conversely in wet time series models the future climate of locations is predicted to be wetter by increasing rainfall amount compared to the baseline gcms characteristics are presented in table 2 2 3 crop model ssm legume model ssm legume model was employed to simulate phenological development leaf development and senescence biomass production and partitioning plant nitrogen balance yield formation and soil water balance the responses of crop processes to environmental factors of solar radiation photoperiod temperature nitrogen and water availability and genotype differences were considered in the model the model readily captures the available weather and soil information in a daily time step the model was extensively evaluated using the independent data from a wide range of growth and environmental conditions across iran soltani and sinclair 2011 amiri deh ahmadi et al 2014 amiri et al 2016 amiri et al 2020 and india e g vadez et al 2013 2 4 calibration and validation of the ssm legume model the model was calibrated using measured data from a two year field experiment conducted in growing seasons of 2011 and 2012 the experiment was a factorial arrangement based on a randomized complete block design with four replications conducted in the research field of khorramabad 33 29n 48 22e iran three genotypes with the different maturity bivanij ilc482 and hashem as early mid and late maturity respectively along with three sowing dates 21 december 20 march and 4 april were included in the study chickpea crops received 261 and 283 mm rainfall in 2011 and 2012 respectively and they experienced 17 5 and 16 c mean temperature in 2011 and 2012 respectively each experimental plot involved 5 m long and 5 rows with an inter row space of 50 cm as well as a plant density of 33 plants m 2 the soil texture was silty loam based on soil analysis and recommendations applied fertilizer was just 40 kg ha 1 urea as starter at sowing time the chickpea was irrigated based on 60 mm cumulative evaporation from a class a evaporation pan during its growing season the sampling size was 0 5 m2 the chickpea crops were harvested on 25 june and 2 july 2011 and 2012 respectively to measure the grain yield the final harvest was conducted by harvesting the two middle rows 10 m2 at physiological maturity at 12 humidity the field data were applied to estimate required genotype specific parameters for model under potential conditions without water and nutrient stresses table 3 for model calibration using a trial and error procedure the difference between observed and simulated values was minimized relevant parameters which strongly influenced dry matter and lai were adjusted the procedure was iterated until the closest match between the model simulated and observed values were obtained for all treatments bhatia et al 2008 for water content calibration and model validation independent observed data from different field experiments carried out in a wide range of treatments and environments were used table 4 with high variability in rainfall and temperature in these experiments standard agronomic practices for weed disease and insect control and optimum fertilization were applied to avoid biotic and abiotic stresses the day for flowering dry matter and grain yield traits obtained from the field experiments were considered to validate the crop model the following indices were calculated to measure the differences between observed and simulated data huang et al 2009 for model evaluation the determination coefficient r2 1 1 line the normalized root mean square error nrmse wallach and goffinet 1987 index of agreement d index willmott 1982 and mean bias error mbe willmott and matsuura 2005 were computed to compare observed and simulated values of grain yield and soil moisture content as follows 1 d index 1 0 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 2 nrmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 100 o 3 mbe i 1 n s i o i n where ō o s and n are the mean observed data observed data simulated data and number of observations respectively model accuracy increases as the nrmse and mbe values approach zero and the d index approaches one matching two regression and 1 1 lines confirms the high accuracy of model higher r2 closing to unity illustrates that the model accurately simulates the reality the nrmse and d index range from 0 to and 0 1 respectively mbe ranges from to to depict the direction and magnitude of bias shows the underestimation and overestimation of model 2 5 model application long term simulation experiments the simulations were arranged due to the results of a previous study amiri et al 2020 their results showed that dsm2 dormant seeding around late february and dsm1 dormant seeding around 20 december are the best sowing dates for the baseline and future conditions respectively hence 25 february and 20 december were set as the baseline and future sowing dates respectively for all simulations in the current study under dormant seeding management the seeds remained ungerminated and dormant in the soil until some criteria were met in other words the germination is done when the soil moisture and air temperature are optimized for chickpea after frost and low temperatures period in winter in this management system it is assumed that germination occurs once the initial soil moisture in the top soil layer 200 mm filled to the volumetric transpirable soil water 0 13 200 while the temperature of top soil layer is above the base of 4 5 c we focused on the effect of various genotypes as genetic factors different locations with multiple climate types as environment factors and irrigation regimes as management factors on crop yield and wue early beavanij as common genotype in study locations mid ilc482 and late maturity hashem kabuli genotypes were considered to assess the effect of genetic elements under present conditions in iranian chickpea agro ecosystems the farmers normally cultivate chickpea crop in rainfed situations in addition to the rainfed conditions supplementary irrigating at flowering and pod filling stages were chosen as the irrigation scenarios to present the effect of management practices it was assumed that chickpea crops could be irrigated at flowering si flow 60 or pod filling si pod 60 stage with supplementary irrigation of 60 mm soltani et al 2016 amiri et al 2020 the irrigation efficiency of 100 was assumed in all simulations the irrigation efficiency is the ratio of water amount utilized by the crop to water amount supplied via the irrigation hence for an irrigation efficiency of 50 120 mm of irrigation water is required plant density was 33 plants m 2 20 kg ha 1 n fertilizer was used as a starter fertilizer at sowing date a soil with a volumetric water content of 0 13 cm3 cm 3 the albedo of 0 12 curve number of 79 and depth of 100 cm was considered in all simulations the model uses the volumetric extractable water content which is fairly constant at 0 13 cm3 cm 3 unless soil sand percentage is higher than 80 ritchie et al 1999 due to dewan and famouri 1964 the chosen soil depth is an output of a joint project between iran s ministry of agriculture and fao based on the report most of the iranian dryland soils have 50 150 cm depth selecting the soil depth of 100 cm is as well as a reflection of chickpea effective water extraction depth which is mainly 100 cm due to the reports from regions in iran and other parts of wana western asia and north africa region soltani and sinclair 2011 however by a soil depth of 100 cm an effective extraction depth remains100 cm if there is no rainfall at that time in studying locations the farmers normally use light irrigation at sowing to establish the seedlings evenly amiri et al 2020 moreover the initial soil water was considered to be 70 of the volumetric extractable soil water at sowing in all simulations ssm legume model only predicts the effects of abiotic stresses which does not consider the impact of biotic stresses pests and diseases in facts the current version of model has not parameterized to capture the impact of biotic stresses in total 22 320 simulations were generated 8 locations 3 genotypes 3 irrigation levels 5 general circulation models 2 future emission scenarios and an average of 31 yr of historical weather data 2 6 crop model output and statistical analyses this study presented grain yield wue chickpea water consumption mean temperature and cumulative rainfall during the chickpea growing period wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the grain yield kg ha 1 per unit of water consumed by actual evapotranspiration et mm wang et al 2017 the median of multi model ensemble median of 5 gcms was subjected to analyze in r and graph in originpro 9 1 using the analysis of variance anova all multi year simulation output data of crop grain yields and wue were analyzed the study used a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement in all analyses the simulation years were considered as replications the analysis was done using sas v 9 1 2 sas 2003 software 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation in the calibration the comparison between observed and simulated maximum lai and dry matter in maximum lai for bivanij ilc482 and hashem genotypes table 5 showed that the genotype specific parameters within the model were reasonably adjusted the model predicted maximum lai and dry matter in maximum lai with nrmse of 14 35 and 10 96 mbe of 0 03 and 341 9 kg ha 1 d index of 0 97 and 0 98 and r2 of 0 94 and 0 96 respectively which indicated a close agreement between field measured and simulated values table 5 the nrmse values for soil water content ranged from 3 73 2011 to 5 34 2012 fig 2 the d index varied from 0 99 2011 to 0 98 2012 fig 2 this shows that the ssm legume model captured the soil water balance with high accuracy during the growing period of chickpea under different years however the ssm legume model underestimated the soil water content in both experiments with an mbe of 0 001 cm3 cm 3 in 2011 to 0 009 cm3 cm 3 in 2012 fig 2 fig 3 indicates model validation results for three genotypes of bivanij ilc482 and hashem using much experimental data collected in a wide range of environments and management practices table 4 validation results indicated that the model predicted phonological development i e days to flowering reasonably well fig 3 for instance the nrmse mbe and d index for days to flowering were 7 5 1 6 and 0 96 respectively besides the coefficient of determination r2 value for regression between observed and simulated days to flowering was 0 88 for all genotypes model validation results indicated that the model could also predict chickpea dry matter and grain yield at different locations and seasons reasonably well based on fig 3 the values of nrmse mbe d index and r2 for grain yield were 15 5 2 kg 98 and 0 92 respectively while these values for dry matter were 11 21 9 kg 0 98 and 0 95 respectively indicate that ssm legume model could simulate the growth and grain yield of chickpea reasonably well for across all sites years and genotypes moreover the coefficient of determination values of grain yield 0 95 and dry matter 0 92 represented that the crop model accurately captured the effects of different environmental conditions and the differences among various genotypes 3 2 changes in future mean temperature and cumulative rainfall in present conditions iranian chickpea agro ecosystems were classified into the three climate types due to the köppen climate classification a variability is observed in seasonal mean temperature and rainfall among the locations and climate types chickpea crops experience the highest mean temperature 26 c in the semi arid and temperate locations and complete their growth under cooler weather at the arid and cold regions 19 c table 6 on average iranian chickpea agro ecosystems receive 133 31 mm rainfall which ranged from 113 14 mm in semi arid and cold locations to 163 14 mm in semi arid and temperate locations table 6 for the future five general circulation models gcms simulated an increase in seasonal mean temperature and high variability in rainfall table 6 during the chickpea growing period the ensemble of gcms projected that median mean temperature rose by 4 4 and average rainfall 35 16 increased averaged across all locations the seasonal mean temperature is predicted to be between 23 9 c gfdlcm3 gcm rcp4 5 scenario and 25 1 c hadgem2es gcm rcp8 5 scenario in 2040 2070 table 6 results from the gcms were highly variable across locations for rainfall for example when averaged across rcps the highest variability was recorded in khorramabad from 218 16 mm for mpiesmmr to 357 08 mm for miroc5 table 6 in contrast the lowest variability belonged to hamedan from 138 69 mm for miroc5 to 161 23 mm for gisse2r in general the results indicated noteworthy variation in climate parameters over gcms and locations which the variations became more at two optimistic rcp4 5 and pessimistic rcp8 5 scenarios 3 3 grain yield long term simulations for the baseline showed that the effect of genetic g genotypes environmental e locations and management m irrigation regimes factors on grain yield was significant p 0 01 fig 4 and table 7 however the response of grain yield to e factor was more than g and m factors so that this response varied from 812 semi arid and temperate regions in the northwest to 1894 kg ha 1 arid and cold regions in the west fig 4 and table 1 the variability in grain yield became more by considering m and e together and averaged across irrigation regimes grain yield ranged from 365 hashem genotype semi arid and temperate location or climate type to 2092 kg ha 1 ilc482 genotype arid and cold location or climate type regarding the g e and m factors simultaneously grain yield ranged from 2311 hashem arid and cold si pod 60 to 208 kg ha 1 hashem semi arid and temperate rainfed fig 4 in general at present condition the optimal combination of g e m was a late maturity hashem arid and cold locations climate type si pod 60 2311 kg ha 1 climate change increased the future chickpea grain yield compared to the baseline the increase was 8 and 14 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 5 however the increase was different amongst various locations genotypes and irrigation management practices for example a mid maturity genotype ilc482 increased grain yield 17 more than early 16 and late maturity 3 genotypes furthermore allocating irrigation at the pod filling stage was more effective than applying irrigation at the flowering stage so that across all genotypes and locations the greatest increase in grain yield was achieved in si pod 60 39 moreover cold regions in the northwest 1748 kg ha 1 boosted more chickpea grain yield than western locations 1041 kg ha 1 figs 1 and 4 in the mid future 2050 applying irrigation at both pod filling si pod 60 47 and flowering si flow 60 5 stages increased grain yield compared with farmers current irrigation practice rainfed fig 5 across all irrigation regimes locations and rcps using a mid maturity genotype ilc482 1700 kg ha 1 showed better performance than a common genotype beavanij as an early maturity genotype 1460 kg ha 1 in the future in general for the entire chickpea agro ecosystems the highest future grain yield 1786 and 1915 kg ha 1 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively was predicted for ilc482 genotype g si pod 60 irrigation management regime m fig 5 also the above mentioned g m interaction in semi arid and temperate environments e was the best yielding combination of g e m ilc482 genotype northwestern regions si pod 60 in the upcoming period 2233 kg ha 1 fig 5 and table 1 3 4 wue the first impression of fig 4 is that wue is significantly p 0 01 table 7 affected by locations as the environment e factor in general northwestern chickpea agro ecosystems had higher wue than western areas for example the greatest and lowest wue was obtained in tabriz in the northwest 8 13 kg ha 1 mm 1 and sanandaj in the west 2 60 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively fig 4 and table 1 genetic g was the second effective factor on wue so that choosing a mid maturity genotype ilc482 increased wue up to 6 13 kg ha 1 mm 1 followed by early beavanij 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 and late maturity hashem 3 46 kg ha 1 mm 1 genotypes furthermore for a given genotype and location supplementary irrigation at pod filling 16 made more positive changes in wue than irrigation at the flowering stage 0 compared with current farmers management practice rainfed however by considering three factors of g e and m the best interaction of g e m was achieved at ilc482 genotype arid and cold climate si pod 60 9 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the baseline period fig 4 for the mid future 2050 the changes in wue was significant p 0 01 table 7 based on various rcps locations genotypes and irrigation regimes compared to the baseline figs 4 and 6 for example averaged across different locations genotypes and irrigation practices wue decreased and increased compared to baseline at 2 and 2 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively figs 4 and 6 however in some areas averaged across two rcps wue declined by 8 in ardabil as an arid and cold region and increased by 37 in khorramabad as a semi arid and temperate region in the future conditions compared to the baseline situations in the future on average across all irrigation regimes and genotypes choosing the best e factor location increased wue to 3 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the northwest diﬀerence between 3 77 and 7 02 kg ha 1 mm 1 for northwestern and western regions respectively fig 6 and table 1 it is more enhanced when the role of other factors such as genotypes was included wue boosted as much as 3 19 kg ha 1 mm 1 in ilc482 genotype northwest compared to beavanij genotype as farmers common genotype west using an optimal irrigation practice further boosted this value to 7 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 for ilc482 genotype northwest si pod 60 irrigation regime fig 6 and table 1 4 discussion 4 1 the ssm legume model accurately captured the effects various management practices soils and climates the general agreement between simulated and observed values of days to flowering lai dry matter soil water content and grain yield under a range of growth conditions including various locations with various annual cumulative rainfalls 101 234 mm annual mean temperatures 13 18 c and soils from silty clay loam to clay under different years and management practices figs 2 3 tables 4 and 5 shows that ssm legume model has a good predictive ability in fact the accurate prediction of phenology makes a good prediction of lai providing a good estimate of biomass production furthermore accurate prediction of phenology provides a precise prediction of biomass partitioning among the different parts of chickpea at multiple phenological stages consequently grain yield rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 many studies show that the ssm model can capture the effects of various management practices soils and climates on different crops e g vadez et al 2013 sinclair et al 2014 vadez et al 2017 ghanem et al 2015a 2015b vadez et al 2012 amiri and deihimfard 2018 for example in a simulation study in the middle east lebanon and syria ghanem et al 2015a 2015b ssm model was precisely able to simulate grain yield of lentil lens culinaris over different sowing dates as spring to autumn cultivars from long cycle cultivar to short cycle cultivar soils from inceptisol to vertisol and climates from dry to the mediterranean with rmse of 14 in another simulation study in the southwest france marrou et al 2014 the ssm model accurately captured lingot bean grain yield phaseolus vulgaris over five years and various irrigation scenarios with an rmse of 21 furthermore in a simulation study in two locations varying in latitude high latitude hisar haryana india low latitude icrisat andhra pradesh india vadez et al 2013 ssm model was precisely able to simulate grain yield of chickpea over different sowing dates 1 november and 28 october two irrigation levels rainfed and irrigated different genotypes from an early maturity genotype to late maturity genotype and soils from vertisols to entisols with rmse of 12 in general since the model could simulate grain yield of chickpea genotypes in various locations with different soils and climates and under different years and management practices the model can be used to assess the effect of genotype environment management in the present study and other studies 4 2 a right balance of grain yield wue and water consumption can be achieved by suitable genotype environment management at baseline at the baseline the simulation results showed that the common genotype beavanij as an early maturity genotype is not optimal due to the grain yield and wue for chickpea agro ecosystems in fact a mid maturity genotype ilc482 genotype had better grain yield and wue than beavanij genotype due to higher days to maturity and reproductive growth duration 122 and 28 d for ilc482 genotype and 119 and 26 d for beavanij genotype table 8 however a longer growth period does not always increase the grain yield and wue especially under water limited conditions for example hashem genotype had the highest days to maturity and reproductive growth duration table 8 but it produced the lowest wue fig 4 in fact under water limited conditions a very long growth period on the one hand causes plants to face the water deficit stress at the end of growing period leading to grain yield reduction e g faraji et al 2009 on the other hand it increases evapotranspiration resulting in wue reduction e g amiri and deihimfard 2018 regression analysis of wue and evapotranspiration fig 7 confirms this also the results approved that hashem genotype had the highest evapotranspiration 306 mm due to the highest growing period fig 8 and table 8 in general there is a need for a right balance among grain yield wue and water consumption evapotranspiration which can be achieved by a mid maturity genotype ilc482 the results showed that supplementary irrigation at the pod filling stage si pod 60 was superior to supplementary irrigation at the flowering stage si flow 60 and rainfed due to grain yield for all locations on the other hand si flow 60 and si pod 60 compared to rainfed as common farmers irrigation management practice increased grain yield by 5 and 47 respectively fig 4 the reason for the superiority of supplementary irrigation at the pod filling stage was the longer days to maturity compared to supplementary irrigation at flowering stage and rainfed respectively table 8 moreover irrigating at the pod filling stage increases fertile pod numbers per plant which consequently results in higher grain yield e g mohammed et al 2017 due to above statements ilc482 genotype si pod 60 performed better in terms of grain yield and wue than common interaction of g m beavanij rainfed fig 4 in fact ilc482 si pod 60 124 d expanded its growth period more than beavanij rainfed 118 d and produced higher grain yield in turn had higher wue also ilc482 si pod 60 as g m s optimal interaction yielded better in cold and arid regions in general the optimal grain yield and wue were obtained in an arid and cold climate because there was the optimum reproductive growth duration 30 d higher than semi arid and temperate 20 d in the northwest with cold climate conditions fig 1 chickpea crops experienced lower mean temperature during their growing period 24 c than in temperate regions in the west 26 c table 6 so ilc482 si pod 60 had the chance to extend more its growing period under cold climate conditions in the northwest and recorded higher grain yield and wue simultaneously fig 4 many studies support that there is a direct and positive relationship between growth period and grain yield soltani et al 2016 rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 amiri et al 2020 in general at baseline the best combination of g e m to improve grain yield and wue would be ilc482 cold regions si pod 60 and this interaction can be recommended to produce sustainable chickpea production mohammed et al 2017 in northeastern ethiopia reported that mid maturity genotype supplementary irrigation is important in areas where high temperature is a major crop production constraint in the present climate conditions 4 3 positive effects of co2 and optimal genotype environment management interaction on wue and grain yield in the future in agricultural systems sustainable production depends on the choice of suitable g e m in these systems sustainability is optimally achieved using limited resources such as water and exploiting free natural resources like rainfall radiation and temperature rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 it was predicted that moving from northwestern chickpea agro ecosystems with cold climate to western chickpea agro ecosystems with temperature climate fig 1 caused a considerable change in wue through the changes in grain yield evapotranspiration and temperature figs 5 6 7 and table 6 under rcps scenarios and across all locations genotypes and irrigation regimes grain yield increased compared to the baseline figs 4 and 5 this could be highly associated to the rising co2 concentration to 535 ppm on average across rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios which neutralized the negative impact of high temperature 6 during the chickpea growing period and consequently boosted grain yield fig 5 and table 6 however across two rcps increasing grain yield did not compensate for the increase in evapotranspiration 13 and consequently slightly increased wue 0 03 figs 6 and 7 it can be seen by the negative coefficient of regression between wue and evapotranspiration for future in fig 7 there are many reports regarding neutralizing the negative effect of global warming on grain yield by increasing co2 deihimfard et al 2018 amiri et al 2020 and reducing wue by rising evapotranspiration in the future rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 in 2040 2070 period the amount and increase or decrease in grain yield and wue varied across different locations as e factor figs 5 and 6 grain yield and wue were higher in northwestern agro ecosystems with cold climate than western chickpea agro ecosystems with temperature climate due to lower mean temperature 24 25 vs 25 02 c and evapotranspiration 285 5 vs 365 9 mm and higher the duration of the growth period 159 5 vs 138 5 d figs 1 7 and 8 table 6 cold areas in the northwest provided better conditions for genotypes to show their genetic potential different genotypes more extended their growth period in the northwestern locations 7 than the other locations and produced higher grain yield and wue figs 5 and 6 mid maturity ilc482 genotype better performed based on wue and grain yield than early maturity genotype beavanij as common genotype due to higher days to maturity and reproductive growth duration 149 and 29 d for ilc482 genotype and 145 and 27 d for beavanij genotype fig 8 in fact high temperatures will shorten chickpea reproductive growth period in the future and mid maturing genotype will be needed to counterbalance the effect of accelerated phenology although late maturity genotype hashem had the highest days to maturity 157 d compared to beavanij 145 d and ilc482 149 d genotypes the higher evapotranspiration 352 mm resulted in minimal grain yield and wue in hashem genotype figs 5 6 7 and 8 other researchers reported almost similar results by investigating grain yield and wue under climate change for example xiao et al 2018 investigated the effect of climate change on spring and winter wheat production in china and concluded that grain yield and wue were directly affected by evapotranspiration their results showed that wue and grain yield was decreased when cumulative transpiration was higher for spring and winter wheat genotypes in the future and across all irrigation management practices the interaction of ilc482 genotype northwestern locations was the superior interaction of g e due to grain yield and wue figs 5 and 6 because of the optimum growth period evapotranspiration and low mean temperature figs 7 8 and table 6 moreover when the ilc482 northwestern interaction was applied along with si pod 60 regime there were more improvements in grain yield and wue in fact irrigating at the pod filling stage improves grain yield by increasing fertile pod numbers per plant e g mohammed et al 2017 attia et al 2016 to evaluate winter wheat response to irrigation management in the texas high plains showed that single irrigation of 100 mm at jointing or booting had 35 higher grain yield than rainfed vadez et al 2012 in the northern india showed that while 30 mm of irrigation at the first seed stage would increase chickpea yield by 29 the best genetic trait to improve soil water capture would hardly increase yield by 10 in total ilc482 northwestern si pod 60 was the best g e m combination for the upcoming period 2040 2070 studies have approved the different effects of g e m interaction on yield anderson 2010 hatfield and walthall 2015 teixeira et al 2017 which can be generalized to wue due to the important effect of grain yield on wue finally it is recommended that farmers simultaneously pay attention to all g e m factors for sustainable due to wue and higher due to grain yield production finally we obtained these results based on the absence of biotic stresses pests plant diseases weeds and it is recommended that this issue can be addressed in other studies as one of the major challenges for agriculture during the coming decades lehmann et al 2013 hirschi et al 2012 trnka et al 2007 bergez et al 2010 5 conclusion at the baseline our results revealed that the common genotype beavanij as an early maturity genotype and common irrigation management practice rainfed are not optimal in terms of grain yield and wue for chickpea agro ecosystems across all locations the optimal g m of ilc482 si pod 60 regime boosted grain yield and wue 31 1 and 24 8 respectively compared with the common g m beavanij rainfed moreover ilc482 si pod 60 as g m s optimal interaction yielded better in the cold northwest environment e at the baseline ilc482 cold northwest environment si pod 60 was generally the best g e m interaction in terms of wue 9 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 and grain yield 1645 9 kg ha 1 in the future across two rcps climate change increased chickpea grain yield 11 due to positive effects of rising co2 concentration and slightly increased wue 0 03 due to an increase in evapotranspiration and mean temperature and a decrease in duration of chickpea growing period however these decreases and increases can be mitigated and boosted by applying an optimal g e m combination ilc482 cold northwest environment si pod 60 was the best g e m interaction regarding optimum wue and grain yield for chickpea agro ecosystems in the upcoming period 2040 2070 in general climate change and rising co2 concentration will open up opportunities to produce more grain yield in chickpea agro ecosystems furthermore this production can sustainably be generated regarding wue by adopting a suitable g e m interaction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10094,the yield of lowland rice is prone to climatic factors and farming practices among which water management and weed control are crucial crop simulation models can help evaluating the impacts of these factors and practices on yield growth this study assessed the impacts of climate irrigation practices and weed control measures on the yield of lowland rice by using fao aquacrop model necessary data were generated by well planned field experiments during two consecutive rice growing seasons off dry season january april and main wet season july october in 2017 ensemble climate data was downscaled from eighteen general circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 both for baseline 1976 2005 and future 2010 2099 periods aquacrop model was calibrated and validated with observed data with regard to normalized root mean square error nrmse prediction error pe mean absolute error mae and index of agreement d the model simulated biomass yield and productivity of rice satisfactorily it predicted 13 6 14 1 and 15 3 increase in yield under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenario respectively for the off season in the future compared to the baseline period the corresponding increase in yield is 13 9 14 5 and 15 2 for the main season the model simulated reduced yield under water stress and poor weed control with yield reduction mounting to 65 under worse weed control however proper weed control and water management practices will likely augment yield under changing climate the stress exerted by rising temperature on yield will likely be compensated by the ensuing increase in co2 fertilization the predicted susceptibility of rice yield to weed infestation and water stress under changing climate will help devising proper management practices for sustainable rice productivity in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords cultivation practices climate change crop modeling yield assessment 1 introduction growth in agriculture depends on many factors such as soil quality cultivation practices employed technologies and indeed weather conditions elliott et al 2015 the impacts of climate

that will maintain a temperature rise within 1 5 c above the pre industrial level perceptively certain increasing trend in global atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and temperature and related changes in rainfall over the next few decades will exert direct or indirect impacts on crop production piao et al 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 ipcc 2014 apart from water requirements climate change will also exert impacts on several other aspects of rice farming systems including irrigation due to change of rainfall patterns length of growing season yield and productivity yoo et al 2014 2012 understanding of the impacts of climate change on yield and productivity of rice at local scale is essential to develop appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies rosenzweig et al 2014 liu et al 2017 gcms being a popular tool have been used in many recent studies to examine the impacts of climate change globally and make necessary predictions however direct use of gcms is limited due to their coarse spatial resolutions the resulting climate variables from gcms need to be downscaled to local surface variables wilby et al 2002 different methods and models such as delta

essential climate variables e g temperature rainfall wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation to be used as key inputs to crop simulation models climate change directly affects agriculture since most physiological processes of plants are intimately related to climate variables the magnitude and patterns of temperature and rainfall influence water requirements and stress conditions of plants by changing their growth period and photosynthesis and respiration rates tao et al 2003 experimental observations have revealed that a temperature increase of 2 c can significantly reduce crop yield during dry season lobell et al 2008 nader and naser 2019 variation of temperature and precipitation due to global climate change seriously impacts hydrological processes water quality and water demand for irrigation with eventual hindrance on crop production and productivity kang et al 2009 so understanding the impacts of climate change on water availability and water use patterns for crop production is crucial to devise future adaptation plans rice is the primary irrigated crop grown in 322 000 ha of land area in malaysia twice a year mostly in 8 large scale irrigation schemes the country is 80 self sufficient in rice production that approximated 1 820 000 metric tonnes in 2018 dong et al 2017 nahrim 2014 projected 2 5 2 9 c increase in temperature and 30 to 30 variation in

peninsular malaysia and 2 4 3 7 c for the east malaysia these changes in climate variables would likely affect the regions water resources and ultimately food security of the country the adverse impacts of climate change have already reduced rice production by 15 26 in thailand 2 15 in vietnam 12 23 in the philippines and 6 18 in indonesia zhai and zhuang 2009 the adverse impacts will also likely reduce yields of all staple crops in the south and southeast asian countries gerald et al 2009 contrasting results were also reported xiong et al 2014 and zhang and tao 2013 obtained increasing rice yield under the observed increasing trends in temperature in northeast china nevertheless it is not yet fully certain whether the predicted climate changes will be suppressive or supportive on rice productivity perhaps it will be both depending on specific situations over the past decades climate change has induced transformations in weeds of arable ecosystems in some parts of the world andreasen and streibig 2011 kolářová et al 2013 salonen et al 2013 for instance thermophile weeds late emerging weeds and some opportunistic weeds have become more abundant in some cropping systems the composition of weed species is mostly regulated by climate variables like temperature and precipitation climate change also influences weeds indirectly by enforcing adaptations of agronomic practices growth of weeds in rice fields is one of the major causes that reduces rice yields paul et al 2014 unless the fields are kept weed free unchecked weed growth reduced yield by up to 57 in puddled transplanted rice and 82 in direct seeded rice mahajan et al 2009 the average yield losses in rice due to weed competition were estimated to vary between 40 and 60 that may increase up to 94 96 with uncontrolled weed growth chauhan and johnson 2011 it is therefore essential to accurately estimate the potential damaging effects of weeds for developing effective weed control strategies

adopted widely can simulate crop biomass production on day to day basis and yield under diverse soil water and dynamic climate conditions it has been evaluated and found reliable in simulating growth and production of the world s major common crops under different management soil and climate conditions araya et al 2017 accordingly the model has been used extensively because of its versatilities in addition to its simplicity robustness and accuracy heng et al 2009 it was tested in perlis of malaysia for scheduling deficit and net irrigations and found effective in improving rice yield by optimal use of water noor et al 2018 it was also effective in evaluating the effect of water table depth on rice yield and uncertainty in rice production resulting from variations of clay content over the field amiri ebrahim et al 2015 based on available literatures the global warming appears to be an inevitable reality with expected rise in average temperature by 2 4 c at the end of this century however no information on future rice yields under climate change condition has been generated yet in malaysia with aquacrop model this study applied aquacrop 6 1 model with ensemble downscaling of climate variables from 18 gcms under the commonly adopted rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios and assessed the impacts of climate change and thereunder weed management practices on rice production in tanjung karang rice irrigation system the objectives were a to project future climate change based on coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gcms b to simulate climate change impacts on rice yields in two rice growing seasons of the year and c to simulate impacts of climate change and weed control measures on future rice yields and evaluate plausible key adaptation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tanjung karang rice irrigation system known as northwest selangor rice irrigation scheme is located on the coastal plain of kuala selangor district in the state of selangor malaysia at 3 45 e longitude and 101 18 n latitude fig 1 the irrigation scheme comprises 8 irrigation compartments with a total area of 18 000 ha one of the compartments named sawah sempadan compartment comprising 2300 ha is divided into 24 blocks and named alphabetically as a to x the block c of this compartment covering 142 ha comprises 118 parcels each with an area of 1 2 ha was selected for this study climate of the region is humid tropical and characterized with bi modal rainfall patterns predominantly influenced by monsoons in the southwest and northeast suhaila et al 2010 average annual rainfall ranging between 1500 mm and 2000 mm is highly seasonal with 70 occurring during the northeast monsoon october and december and making the southwest monsoon periods february to march and june to august dry temperatures are high during the dry periods with mean temperature varying between 28 c and 35 c table 1 presents the average historical climate variables of the study area 2 2 field experiment and data measurements a purposively planned experiment with paddy rice was done in a 0 5 ha plot in block c fig 1 in the sawah sempadan compartment of the tanjung karang rice irrigation system during two consecutive rice growing seasons in 2017 necessary devices such as parshall rbc ﬂume drainage sensor lysimeters rain gauge and water level recorder were installed in the field fig 2 for monitoring different components of field water balance a datalogging rain gauge measured rainfall and the parshall rbc flume measured both flow rate and amount of irrigation water during irrigation events water level in the paddy field was measured at 10 min interval with an e water level sensor coupled with datalogger a concrete sump 70 cm 50 cm 70 cm with mjk7060 level sensor nb cr200x 7060 was used to record the amount of drainage water at 1 min interval whenever runoff events occurred actual daily evapotranspiration was measured with a micro paddy lysimeter equipped with marriott tube and etgauge percolation rate was determined using closed ended and open ended cylindrical lysimeters several staff gauges were also installed in the experimental paddy plot to verify the records obtained from the sensors the field experiment and data monitoring were done in the same plot during the two consecutive rice growing seasons january to april and july to october in 2017 adequate number and appropriate quantity of soil samples were collected from 20 cm depth intervals from 0 to 100 cm soil profile in the experimental plot before planting rice seedlings the samples were analyzed in laboratory following standard procedures and their physical and chemical properties were determined as listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively 2 3 inputs for aquacrop model the main inputs to aquacrop model include climate soil and crop data the daily maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation of the study area for 2000 2016 period were obtained from malaysian meteorological department and drainage and irrigation department did of malaysia crop phenological parameters table 4 were recorded from the field experiments for the best possible conditions raes et al 2018 the maximum canopy cover ccx and length build ups hi and hio were provided to the model the effect of groundwater was not simulated by capillary rise since water table was far below 1 5 m the effective root zone of rice in the experimental plot the input file for soil profile included basic hydraulic properties mo allim et al 2018 such as volumetric water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity for different soil layers within 0 100 cm profile tables 2 and 3 planting date growth stage depth of planting plant population fertilization irrigation and harvesting date were established as crop management factors set by integrated agriculture development authority iada of malaysia for the tanjung karang rice irrigation system we calibrated aquacrop model with the input variables and validated it by using the calibrated standardized parameters based on predicted and observed yield data of 8 historical years 2009 2016 the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed yields was evaluated by using various prediction error statistics 2 4 hydro meteorological downscaling 2 4 1 climate data extraction and processing precipitation and evapotranspiration being the two key hydro meteorological parameters primarily control irrigation requirement of crops diaz et al 2007 knox et al 2010 the hydro meteorological data sets and coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were collected from 18 gcms for rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios table 5 the data was prepared in 30 year time span of three future periods 2010 2039 2020s 2040 2069 2050s and 2070 2099 2080s due to lack of reliable data before 1976 for the study area 1976 2005 was adopted as the baseline period for this study 2 4 2 hydro meteorological downscaling the systematic processes implemented in a hydro meteorological interface to model climatic sequences are illustrated in flowchart of fig 3 the interface was developed by combining the procedure of evaluating climate change with the selection of gcms climate scenarios and downscaling process the future climate change scenarios obtained from gcms do not provide details on small spatial scales of interest necessary for most practical applications due to scientific limitations and incomplete observational data ipcc 2007 to address such gaps between the gcms scale and desired resolution for practical applications downscaling of gcms data is needed to obtain climate change information at suitable local scales hewitson and crane 1996 in addition to the common procedures of assessing climate change impacts the hydro meteorological graphical user interface also integrates gcms emission scenarios and downscaling procedures of climate variables and their future projections the interface is based on methodology of delta change factor as a statistical downscaling algorithm to create high resolution future climate variables at the station scale the delta change is a commonly adopted statistical downscaling technique used as an ordinary bias correction method to reduce bias between the observed station data and gcms outputs chen et al 2011 ouyang et al 2015 the technique of delta change factor has been widely applied in crop water demand calculation and hydrological studies around the globe nkomozepi 2012 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 allen et al 1998 the algorithm modifies the observed daily time series of climate variables by adding and or multiplying monthly mean changes of gcm outputs using adjusting formulas given by 1 rf delta rf future rf control monthly 2 rf future daily rf observed daily rf delta 3 t delta t future t control monthly 4 t future daily t observed daily t delta in the above equations rf is rainfall and t temperature the subscript delta denotes downscaled daily variable using the delta change method observed daily denotes daily observations future denotes average monthly gcm output for future period and control denotes average monthly gcm output for the control or baseline period 2 4 3 reference evapotranspiration simulation module modeling irrigation water demand for assessing the impacts of climate change requires estimating reference evapotranspiration eto both for baseline and future periods the fao penman monteith model is widely used worldwide for this estimate and provides fairly consistent values of eto allen et al 1998 the model is expressed by 5 et o t s 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 in eq 5 etot

kpa c 1 the downscaled air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were inputs to eto model eq 5 for estimating anticipated changes note that solar radiation could not be downscaled directly owing to its unavailability from the gcms archives a simple temperature based model proposed hargreaves and samani 1983 was applied to estimate solar radiation rs as 6 r s k rs t max t min 1 2 r a where krs is an adjustment factor equal to 0 16 for interior locations and 0 19 for coastal locations tmax and tmin the mean monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures c respectively and ra the extraterrestrial radiation w m 2 that was computed following allen et al 1998 we designed a stand alone graphical user interface with several scripted codes and functions for the eto module using matlab programming 2 4 4 climate smart dss user interface for downscaling climate variables the climate smart decision support system csdss comprises a hydro meteorological simulation module and a reference evapotranspiration simulation module rowshon et al 2019 the interface is designed in matlab with its graphical user interface environment guide development of the software package involves building gcm calendars to accommodate gcms of 365 days one year for determining change factors gcm data is included in matlab database and can be updated quickly as new climate scenarios and gcms become available the main dialog window fig 4 appears when the csdss model is activated in matlb environment a simulation dialog window fig 5 appears when clicking on a command button to generate daily hydro meteorological variables selection of a station variables of interest combination of gcm rcp scenario and simulation time can be done with drop down buttons fig 5a to simulate rainfall then simulation of future time series button appears green signaling completion of the simulation and a confirmation window appears a dialog window fig 5b appears after clicking on reference et simulation button in the main dialog window to run the reference evapotranspiration simulation the hydro meteorological parameters maximum temperature minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation obtained from gcms outputs are key inputs for eto calculation upon pressing the eto time series simulation button the time series for selected time period is produced and the button appears green indicating completion of the simulation fig 5 the future hydro climate parameters of a station are produced by perturbing the station the parameters are derived by using change factors from the mean projected changes which are simulated from gcms for the same variables simulated outputs can be obtained from each of the 18 gcms or through multi models projections based on selected rcp emission scenario the outputs can be generated as daily time series and long term monthly time scale and viewed from the analysis and statistics button as tables and graphs 2 5 aquacrop model aquacrop is a dynamic crop growth model and simulates attainable crop yield in response to applied water raes et al 2009 because of simplicity robustness and accuracy the model has been applied worldwide by many practitioners e g irrigation and water experts extension workers government ngos and researchers for various on farm managements irrigation planning climate change adaptation strategies and soil water balance this study used fao aquacrop model 6 1 to assess crop s response to climate change and weed control measures the input parameters are climate data temperature rainfall evaporative demand and carbon dioxide concentration crop data growth stages and development and yield processes soil data soil water balance and crop management data prime agronomic practices like planting date fertilizer application and irrigation accordingly there are five input data files for model simulations the mean annual co2 input for the model was taken from the mauna loa observatory records in hawaii for the baseline climate 1976 2005 and ipcc s projections for rcps for the future periods aquacrop model utilizes conservative parameters of initial t 0 canopy cover cco per seedling canopy growth coefficient cgc per day and maximum canopy cover ccx to estimate canopy development with time after emergence hsiao et al 2014 it converts crop yield to harvest index hi defined as yield to biomass ratio from biomass under non stressed conditions the canopy expansion from development to full canopy follows an exponential increasing growth during first half of the growth period and time for the canopy cover cc is estimated from a fraction of the green canopy covering the ground willmott 1984 as 7 cc cc o e cgc t 8 cc cc o cc x cc o e cgc t in eqs 7 and 8 t is time in days and cc cco cgc and ccx bear the same meanings as mentioned above aquacrop model developed from fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 retains the original concept of a direct link between crop water use and crop yield the link is maintained by separating non productive soil evaporation e from productive crop transpiration and estimating biomass directly from actual transpiration of a crop by using a water productivity parameter the adjustments lead to a new equation which is core of the aquacrop growth engine the daily biomass is estimated in accordance with standardized water productivity for daily transpiration and co2 intake as 9 b wp tri et oi where b is cumulative biomass produced kg m 2 wp water productivity kg of biomass per mm of water transpired tri daily crop transpiration mm and etoi daily reference evapotranspiration mm only a part of biomass of the harvested organs is split to yield y for most crops the yield to biomass ratio harvest index hi is expressed by 10 y hi b the underlying mechanisms terminating into b and hi are different so splitting y into b and hi allows separating the effects of environmental conditions and stress on b and hi fig 6 illustrates the entire scheme of calculation in aquacrop model schematically in this figure cc ccpot eto wp and hi is simulated canopy cover potential canopy cover reference evapotranspiration normalized crop water productivity and harvest index respectively 2 6 calibration and validation of aquacrop model we parameterized and tested aquacrop model for rice crop it was calibrated by using experimental data of 2017 and validated with observed historical yield data of 2009 2016 period the calibration process included development of a crop file in the model through the entry of initial canopy cover maximum canopy cover days to maturity maximum rooting depth as well as base and top temperatures for crop growth the model determined planting rate canopy growth coefficient and coefficient of decline in the canopy standardized water productivity was chosen depending on crop species c3 or c4 crop the expansion of canopy stomatal closure and aeration stress were optimized and balanced for water stress until simulated data matched with the observations performance of the model in simulating rice crop was assessed by validating it based on observed data

emission scenarios with the validated aquacrop model simulation was done based on propositions that climate data and co2 concentration are variables and would change over the selected future periods the other inputs related to crop soil and management practices would remain invariant at their values of the baseline period the impacts of climate change were evaluated by contrasting the simulated yields of the baseline period to that of the three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2080 2099 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate change the projected climate table 6 reveals that both the minimum and maximum temperatures will increase in the future at the bernam river basin within which the study area is sited compared to maximum temperature the minimum temperature will likely to increase at higher rates the annual rainfall is expected to increase by up to 5 78 from its baseline magnitude under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios the maximum temperature is expected to rise by 0 62 0 7 c during 2020s 1 19 1 7 c during 2050s and 1 50 3 01 c during 2080s under the three rcp scenarios compared to the baseline period table 6 the expected increase in minimum temperature during the corresponding future period is 0 72 0 79 c 1 3 1 85 c and 1 69 3 21 c the predicted monthly trends of the minimum and maximum temperatures under the three rcp scenarios are illustrated in fig 7 for 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2080 2099 periods inconsistent distribution and highly variable amount of rainfall at various places within region on any same day make the study of rainfall very difficult in malaysia nevertheless our analysis predicted an overall increase in the annual rainfall in the future while seasonal projection shows a 2 5 7 6 decrease in the off season and 9 34 increase in the main season compared to the regular rainfall record in the tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme fig 8 depicts trends of monthly rainfall under the three rcp scenarios for the three future periods the temperature and rainfall projections thus reveal a warmer climate during april to july but a wetter climate during october to december and march to may these results are also in alignment with similar studies for other areas in malaysia tan et al 2014 the projected temperatures table 6 can help anticipating future water demand for irrigation during the two rice growing seasons of the study area although the impact of climate change varies on crop types local variation in the growing season and cultivation management of crops increased temperature and changing rainfall patterns will have crucial impacts on rice production the projected minimum temperature will be beneficial to rice production but that of maximum temperature will be detrimental shakoor et al 2015 changes in monthly total rainfall will differ considerably with the gcms and rcp scenarios with no general trend as illustrated in fig 9 however with increasing evapotranspiration at rising temperatures crop water usage will increase in the off season due to decreasing rainfall but decrease in the main season due to increasing rainfall the changes in rainfall are largely controlled by the physical parameters of the gcms but not by the characteristics of a particular model nkomozepi and chung 2012 so projection of rainfall is a large source of ambiguity in climatic impact assessments in spite of their variations some gcms have predicted a rise in rainfall for all three rcp scenarios 3 2 performance of aquacrop model this study calibrated aquacrop model with observed rice yields of the off season and main season of 2017 the model estimated higher rice yields compared to the observed yields both in the off season and main season with a corresponding variation of 1 0 and 3 1 during calibration the model also showed reasonable performance during validation period 2009 2016 indeed access to high quality experimental data in a variety of environments will further improve calibration and validation of the crop parameters nevertheless the model simulated rice yields fairly agreed well with the observed yields in both crop seasons during the validation period fig 10 the coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean error nrmse index of agreement d and mean absolute error mae is 0 74 2 93 0 75 and 127 respectively for the off season the corresponding performance index for the main season is 0 81 2 92 0 78 and 157 since no information on the performance of crop growth models in simulating rice yield at the study site is available from any previous study the prediction errors could not be compared however based on magnitudes of the performance indices we presume that the error rates of the validated aquacrop model are acceptable and the model could adequately capture the impacts of climate change on rice yields as evidenced in several studies around the globe e g araya et al 2017 heng et al 2009 noor et al 2018 in the two rice growing seasons during 2009 2016 the minimum prediction error pe varied from 5 65 to 0 31 and the maximum pe from 2 34 to 5 4 between the off season and main season the four performance indicators r2 nrmse d mae of the model showing yield difference of 0 74 2 9 demonstrate that the model is potential for predicting rice yields the coefficient of residual mass crm indicates that the model slightly overestimates rice yield in the main season and underestimates in the off season the determination coefficients 0 74 and 0 81 and agreement indices 0 75 and 0 78 for both crop seasons during 2009 2016 demonstrate good confidence in simulating potential rice yields the model under predicted rice yield in the off season except in 2009 and in the main season in 2013 2014 and 2016 compared to the observed yields fig 11 the model simulated rice yield thus increases over time due to the effects of some input climate variables on crop development and growth phases for example a continuous increase in co2 concentrations contributed positively in yield production by off setting the negative effects of rising temperatures as reported by several investigators e g anderson and hazell 1990 isik and devadoss 2006 kim and arwin 2009 in spite of the rising trend in temperature rainfall will exert positive impacts on rice yield the performance indicators of aquacrop model demonstrate small deviations of the simulated rice yields from the historical observed yields nonetheless the model could predict rice growth and yield with fair accuracy under various water management practices and hence can promote the local irrigation program yield prediction and adaptation scenarios 3 3 yield projection for future the predicted rice yields both for the off season and main season show increasing trends under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 12 the increase being stronger during 2020 s than 2080 s the predicted average change in yield varies from 9 8 to 18 8 over the two seasons under the three rcp scenarios during the current century the predicted change in rice yield in 2020s 2050s and 2080s are presented in table 7 so the rice yield in the study area under the three rcp scenarios is projected to be 5 3 5 8 t ha 1 during 2020s 5 7 6 0 t ha 1 during 2050s and 5 6 6 1 t ha 1 during 2080s in the off season the projected rice yield for the corresponding future period in the main season is 5 8 6 4 t ha 1 6 2 6 5 t ha 1 and 6 2 6 5 t ha 1 fig 13 illustrates projected rice yields during 2010 2039 2040 2079 and 2070 2099 periods under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios aquacrop model predicted increase in aggregated rice yield for both the high and low emission scenarios fig 14 the increase in yield generally being slightly higher under rcp8 5 compared to the other two scenarios it is therefore stipulated that rice farming sector in malaysia will be benefited from its future climate however assessment of climate change impacts on crop yields is difficult and complex since crop yields result from multifaceted interactions between rainfall effects co2 controlled physiological effects and adaptability and productivity of the crops parry et al 2004 some studies e g rosenzweig 2015 reported decline in yields of the south and south east asian rainfed crops while others e g parry et al 2007 reported a likely increase in crop yields of up to 20 for the eastern and south west asia also both increase and decrease in crop yields were reported in thailand in line with co2 regimes parry et al 2004 3 3 1 temperature and co2 effects on rice yield atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is predicted to increase in the future in association with the projected increase in temperature based on previous results of crops responses in face environments and knowledge on sink capacity indicative values for fsink for different crop species currently listed in the database of aquacrop model have been specified cereal crops like rice maize and wheat are low responsive to elevated co2 and consequently their fsink values are small 0 00 0 20 vanuytrecht et al 2011 so we adjusted performance of rice crop under elevated co2 concentration by altering its sink strength to the lowest value zero to reduce uncertainty in modeling future rice production aquacrop model simulated a systematic increase in rice yield in our analysis with increasing co2 concentration during 2010 2099 period as illustrated in fig 15 compared to yield increase under reference co2 concentration of 369 41 ppm measured at mauna loa hawaii in 2000 the expected increase in rice yield is 12 6 16 7 21 7 and 25 1 at 450 550 650 and 750 ppm co2 levels respectively in contrast aquacrop model predicts some sorts of reductions in these percentages of yield increase at the co2 levels with increasing temperature it predicts 10 8 reduction in rice yield at a base co2 concentration of 369 55 ppm in association with a temperature increase of 4 c the rising temperature in future will likely reduce plants respiration causing spikelet sterilizations and poor grain filling with eventual reduction in grain yield wassmann and dobermann 2007 thus the increased temperature will reduce the beneficial effects of increased co2 on rice yields at least to some extent the predicted increase in co2 concentration irrespective of whether or not temperatures have increased shows positive impacts on rice yield and counter impacts high temperature on yield these results are consistent with the findings of other studies gumel et al 2017 ariff and ramsden 2016 reporting that a 2 c and 5 c rise in maximum temperature can reduce rice yield by 4 0 and 14 respectively and a 1 c rise in minimum temperature can reduce yield by 6 5 specifically during flowering and grain filling stages we also estimated that an increase in co2 levels from 340 ppm to 680 ppm will compensate for the adverse effects of increasing temperature by 4 c on rice production in addition rise in co2 levels will reduce irrigation requirement by reducing crop water consumption wang et al 2015 3 3 2 effect of weeds on yield we evaluated the effects of weeds on yield development of rice by selecting four main scenarios of relative weed cover such as 5 perfect weed control 15 good weed control 45 poor weed control and 75 worst weed control and seven secondary scenarios of weed infestation in the rice growing season the selected weed control scenarios are detailed in table 8 fig 16 depicts how the good g poor p and worst w weed control measures are anticipated to reduce rice yields the competitions between weed varieties as well as between the weeds and rice plants appear to be a major cause of yield loss in lowland rice with yield reduction varying with weed types and duration weed infestation weed control scenario w2 good weed control with 15 relative weed cover remaining until maturity phase of rice reduces both the biomass and dry yield of rice by 5 scenario w6 poor weed control with 45 relative weed cover and scenario w9 worst weed control with 75 relative weed cover remaining until maturity phase reduce the biomass and dry yield by 37 and 65 respectively compared to the perfect weed control scenario w1 with 5 relative weed cover in the weed control scenarios where relative weed cover changes at the end of season from that at canopy closure the effect of weed competition becomes variable for example the biomass and dry yield of rice reduce by 19 8 with 15 relative weed cover during canopy closure and 45 during end of the season in scenario w4 but by 26 with 45 relative weed cover during canopy closure and 15 during end of the season in scenario w8 similarly the biomass and dry yield reduce by 47 with 45 weed cover during canopy closure and 75 during end of the season in scenario w7 but by 54 with 75 weed cover during canopy closure and 45 during end of the season in scenario w10 the simulated results reveal 0 45 days after plantation dap of lowland rice as critical of weed competition the harmful effects of early weed competition are demonstrated in fig 16 therefore it is essential to keep 0 45 dap weed free to avoid large yield loss of lowland rice sridevi et al 2013 gopinath et al 2012 3 3 3 effect of water shortage on yield the average water requirement of rice was 848 mm in the off season and 880 mm in the main season in our experiment these results are typical for tropical regions where seasonal water requirement of rice varies from 400 mm to 700 mm steduto et al 2012 with an additional 100 200 mm for wet broadcasting and land preparation rice is highly sensitive to water stress tuong and bouman 2009 which greatly hinders grain filling jahan 2018 and hence reduces yield we evaluated the effect of water scarcity on rice yield by aquacrop model under seven irrigation regimes table 9 each for rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios over two future periods 2030s 2020 2049 and 2060s 2050 2079 the decline in rice yield due to water shortage is illustrated in fig 17 for 2030s and in fig 18 for 2060s the water level above the field surface does not exert any adverse effects on rice production tuong and bouman 2009 khairi et al 2015 aquacrop model predicts major effect of water stress on rice yield when readily available soil water raw exceeds 20 mm below the field capacity threshold it is projected that the average yield will reduce by 4 23 4 45 in the 2030s and 4 01 4 46 in the 2060 s under the rcp scenarios due to water deficit below raw in case of fc 25 fc 10 and fc irrigation regimes table 9 rice yield will likely increase by 0 25 0 50 in the 2030 s and 0 60 0 78 in the 2060s as opposed to the actual yield obtained by iada under conventional flood irrigation which cannot augment yield as does the irrigation regime with low water application khairi et al 2017 our results suggest that soil water content in the rice field be maintained between fc and fc 25 mm to improve water productivity of rice in the study area different climate change projections would generate associated different yields of rice our approach with the multi climate model would help establishing the range of uncertainty in climate projection in terms of reliability the multi model ensembles are generally better than single model zhang and yang 2018 currently the estimates of yield response for future climate depend on both the climate and crop models thus revealing the importance of refining model structure optimizing parameters and selecting suitable crop model our study could not reflect large variability in climate across the tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme adequately due to selection of only one specific location in the scheme for data measurement due to different soil types and variations in water and nutrients assimilated by different rice cultivars there are large variations in yield over the scheme area therefore future study should include a more detailed high resolution regional analysis that will provide better understanding of yield response of rice to future climate change in malaysia while the effects of climate change and response of rice to diverse farming practices have been well simulated the proposed model does not adequately consider yield reduction due to insects and pests harmful diseases weeds and extreme weather events 4 conclusions aquacrop model has been evaluated to assess rice yield under climate change weed control measures and water management practices in tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme in malaysia the model calibrated with field measured data and evaluated with eight years historical yields simulated potential impacts of climate change on rice yield for 2020s 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios and downscaled ensemble gcms ensemble of multi gcms under the rcp scenarios predicted wetter condition for main season august october and drier condition for off season january april in the future aquacrop model simulated 20 increase in rice yield under rcp8 5 scenario by the end of this century it predicted 0 67 3 1 c increase in temperature with higher increase in the off season dry season and the highest increase under extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 the rising temperatures will suppress rice yield while the ensuing increase in co2 concentration will mitigate the effects of high temperature by enhancing co2 fertilization both water scarcity and weed competition will suppress rice yield in the main season with the later factor reducing yield up to 65 under worst weed control the current yield of rice may be maintained and plausibly increased in both crop seasons by adopting deficit irrigation strategies at field capacity fc fc 25 mm and fc 10 mm irrigation regimes it is concluded that in spite of the negative impact of increasing temperature in the future rice yield may be increased by adopting proper weed control and water management measures the duration and impact of extreme climatic events or the probability of reaching a particular threshold signal due to climate change are crucial to understand and quantify the risk and support improved adaptation strategies particularly in cases where heat stress is a possible threat these issues not evaluated in this study must be addressed in

10094,the yield of lowland rice is prone to climatic factors and farming practices among which water management and weed control are crucial crop simulation models can help evaluating the impacts of these factors and practices on yield growth this study assessed the impacts of climate irrigation practices and weed control measures on the yield of lowland rice by using fao aquacrop model necessary data were generated by well planned field experiments during two consecutive rice growing seasons off dry season january april and main wet season july october in 2017 ensemble climate data was downscaled from eighteen general circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 both for baseline 1976 2005 and future 2010 2099 periods aquacrop model was calibrated and validated with observed data with regard to normalized root mean square error nrmse prediction error pe mean absolute error mae and index of agreement d the model simulated biomass yield and productivity of rice satisfactorily it predicted 13 6 14 1 and 15 3 increase in yield under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenario respectively for the off season in the future compared to the baseline period the corresponding increase in yield is 13 9 14 5 and 15 2 for the main season the model simulated reduced yield under water stress and poor weed control with yield reduction mounting to 65 under worse weed control however proper weed control and water management practices will likely augment yield under changing climate the stress exerted by rising temperature on yield will likely be compensated by the ensuing increase in co2 fertilization the predicted susceptibility of rice yield to weed infestation and water stress under changing climate will help devising proper management practices for sustainable rice productivity in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords cultivation practices climate change crop modeling yield assessment 1 introduction growth in agriculture depends on many factors such as soil quality cultivation practices employed technologies and indeed weather conditions elliott et al 2015 the impacts of climate change on water resources and crop production are sensitive issues that most agricultural countries are facing currently and will have to address globally piao et al 2010 asseng 2013 the international panel on climate change ipcc in its fifth assessment report stressed that green house gas ghg emissions will continue increasing in the future with the predicted global temperature rise from 0 3 c to 4 8 c stocker et al 2015 however projections of climate variables based on representative concentration pathways rcps indicate likely increase or decrease in temperature and precipitation trends depending on geographical locations shrestha et al 2014 babel et al 2014 the ipcc targets to improve global responses to the threat of climate change by adopting provisions of minimizing ghg emissions that will maintain a temperature rise within 1 5 c above the pre industrial level perceptively certain increasing trend in global atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and temperature and related changes in rainfall over the next few decades will exert direct or indirect impacts on crop production piao et al 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 ipcc 2014 apart from water requirements climate change will also exert impacts on several other aspects of rice farming systems including irrigation due to change of rainfall patterns length of growing season yield and productivity yoo et al 2014 2012 understanding of the impacts of climate change on yield and productivity of rice at local scale is essential to develop appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies rosenzweig et al 2014 liu et al 2017 gcms being a popular tool have been used in many recent studies to examine the impacts of climate change globally and make necessary predictions however direct use of gcms is limited due to their coarse spatial resolutions the resulting climate variables from gcms need to be downscaled to local surface variables wilby et al 2002 different methods and models such as delta change factor approach wxgen model williams 1990 sdsm wilby and dawson 2013 lars wg model semenov and barrow 2002 climgen mckague et al 2003 earwig model kilsby et al 2007 and climate smart decision support system rowshon et al 2019 have been developed and used in recent years for downscaling gcms outputs these models methods are specifically useful for scientists and researchers to generate essential climate variables e g temperature rainfall wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation to be used as key inputs to crop simulation models climate change directly affects agriculture since most physiological processes of plants are intimately related to climate variables the magnitude and patterns of temperature and rainfall influence water requirements and stress conditions of plants by changing their growth period and photosynthesis and respiration rates tao et al 2003 experimental observations have revealed that a temperature increase of 2 c can significantly reduce crop yield during dry season lobell et al 2008 nader and naser 2019 variation of temperature and precipitation due to global climate change seriously impacts hydrological processes water quality and water demand for irrigation with eventual hindrance on crop production and productivity kang et al 2009 so understanding the impacts of climate change on water availability and water use patterns for crop production is crucial to devise future adaptation plans rice is the primary irrigated crop grown in 322 000 ha of land area in malaysia twice a year mostly in 8 large scale irrigation schemes the country is 80 self sufficient in rice production that approximated 1 820 000 metric tonnes in 2018 dong et al 2017 nahrim 2014 projected 2 5 2 9 c increase in temperature and 30 to 30 variation in rainfall during 2010 2100 compared to the historical period of 1970 2000 in malaysia the malaysian metrological department mmd 2009 projected the highest increase in temperature of 2 3 3 6 c for the peninsular malaysia and 2 4 3 7 c for the east malaysia these changes in climate variables would likely affect the regions water resources and ultimately food security of the country the adverse impacts of climate change have already reduced rice production by 15 26 in thailand 2 15 in vietnam 12 23 in the philippines and 6 18 in indonesia zhai and zhuang 2009 the adverse impacts will also likely reduce yields of all staple crops in the south and southeast asian countries gerald et al 2009 contrasting results were also reported xiong et al 2014 and zhang and tao 2013 obtained increasing rice yield under the observed increasing trends in temperature in northeast china nevertheless it is not yet fully certain whether the predicted climate changes will be suppressive or supportive on rice productivity perhaps it will be both depending on specific situations over the past decades climate change has induced transformations in weeds of arable ecosystems in some parts of the world andreasen and streibig 2011 kolářová et al 2013 salonen et al 2013 for instance thermophile weeds late emerging weeds and some opportunistic weeds have become more abundant in some cropping systems the composition of weed species is mostly regulated by climate variables like temperature and precipitation climate change also influences weeds indirectly by enforcing adaptations of agronomic practices growth of weeds in rice fields is one of the major causes that reduces rice yields paul et al 2014 unless the fields are kept weed free unchecked weed growth reduced yield by up to 57 in puddled transplanted rice and 82 in direct seeded rice mahajan et al 2009 the average yield losses in rice due to weed competition were estimated to vary between 40 and 60 that may increase up to 94 96 with uncontrolled weed growth chauhan and johnson 2011 it is therefore essential to accurately estimate the potential damaging effects of weeds for developing effective weed control strategies while maintaining rice yield multiple crop growth models have been used to assess crop productivity under climate change impacts e g bennett et al 2012 maniruzzaman et al 2015 fao aquacrop model adopted widely can simulate crop biomass production on day to day basis and yield under diverse soil water and dynamic climate conditions it has been evaluated and found reliable in simulating growth and production of the world s major common crops under different management soil and climate conditions araya et al 2017 accordingly the model has been used extensively because of its versatilities in addition to its simplicity robustness and accuracy heng et al 2009 it was tested in perlis of malaysia for scheduling deficit and net irrigations and found effective in improving rice yield by optimal use of water noor et al 2018 it was also effective in evaluating the effect of water table depth on rice yield and uncertainty in rice production resulting from variations of clay content over the field amiri ebrahim et al 2015 based on available literatures the global warming appears to be an inevitable reality with expected rise in average temperature by 2 4 c at the end of this century however no information on future rice yields under climate change condition has been generated yet in malaysia with aquacrop model this study applied aquacrop 6 1 model with ensemble downscaling of climate variables from 18 gcms under the commonly adopted rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios and assessed the impacts of climate change and thereunder weed management practices on rice production in tanjung karang rice irrigation system the objectives were a to project future climate change based on coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gcms b to simulate climate change impacts on rice yields in two rice growing seasons of the year and c to simulate impacts of climate change and weed control measures on future rice yields and evaluate plausible key adaptation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tanjung karang rice irrigation system known as northwest selangor rice irrigation scheme is located on the coastal plain of kuala selangor district in the state of selangor malaysia at 3 45 e longitude and 101 18 n latitude fig 1 the irrigation scheme comprises 8 irrigation compartments with a total area of 18 000 ha one of the compartments named sawah sempadan compartment comprising 2300 ha is divided into 24 blocks and named alphabetically as a to x the block c of this compartment covering 142 ha comprises 118 parcels each with an area of 1 2 ha was selected for this study climate of the region is humid tropical and characterized with bi modal rainfall patterns predominantly influenced by monsoons in the southwest and northeast suhaila et al 2010 average annual rainfall ranging between 1500 mm and 2000 mm is highly seasonal with 70 occurring during the northeast monsoon october and december and making the southwest monsoon periods february to march and june to august dry temperatures are high during the dry periods with mean temperature varying between 28 c and 35 c table 1 presents the average historical climate variables of the study area 2 2 field experiment and data measurements a purposively planned experiment with paddy rice was done in a 0 5 ha plot in block c fig 1 in the sawah sempadan compartment of the tanjung karang rice irrigation system during two consecutive rice growing seasons in 2017 necessary devices such as parshall rbc ﬂume drainage sensor lysimeters rain gauge and water level recorder were installed in the field fig 2 for monitoring different components of field water balance a datalogging rain gauge measured rainfall and the parshall rbc flume measured both flow rate and amount of irrigation water during irrigation events water level in the paddy field was measured at 10 min interval with an e water level sensor coupled with datalogger a concrete sump 70 cm 50 cm 70 cm with mjk7060 level sensor nb cr200x 7060 was used to record the amount of drainage water at 1 min interval whenever runoff events occurred actual daily evapotranspiration was measured with a micro paddy lysimeter equipped with marriott tube and etgauge percolation rate was determined using closed ended and open ended cylindrical lysimeters several staff gauges were also installed in the experimental paddy plot to verify the records obtained from the sensors the field experiment and data monitoring were done in the same plot during the two consecutive rice growing seasons january to april and july to october in 2017 adequate number and appropriate quantity of soil samples were collected from 20 cm depth intervals from 0 to 100 cm soil profile in the experimental plot before planting rice seedlings the samples were analyzed in laboratory following standard procedures and their physical and chemical properties were determined as listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively 2 3 inputs for aquacrop model the main inputs to aquacrop model include climate soil and crop data the daily maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation of the study area for 2000 2016 period were obtained from malaysian meteorological department and drainage and irrigation department did of malaysia crop phenological parameters table 4 were recorded from the field experiments for the best possible conditions raes et al 2018 the maximum canopy cover ccx and length build ups hi and hio were provided to the model the effect of groundwater was not simulated by capillary rise since water table was far below 1 5 m the effective root zone of rice in the experimental plot the input file for soil profile included basic hydraulic properties mo allim et al 2018 such as volumetric water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity for different soil layers within 0 100 cm profile tables 2 and 3 planting date growth stage depth of planting plant population fertilization irrigation and harvesting date were established as crop management factors set by integrated agriculture development authority iada of malaysia for the tanjung karang rice irrigation system we calibrated aquacrop model with the input variables and validated it by using the calibrated standardized parameters based on predicted and observed yield data of 8 historical years 2009 2016 the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed yields was evaluated by using various prediction error statistics 2 4 hydro meteorological downscaling 2 4 1 climate data extraction and processing precipitation and evapotranspiration being the two key hydro meteorological parameters primarily control irrigation requirement of crops diaz et al 2007 knox et al 2010 the hydro meteorological data sets and coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were collected from 18 gcms for rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios table 5 the data was prepared in 30 year time span of three future periods 2010 2039 2020s 2040 2069 2050s and 2070 2099 2080s due to lack of reliable data before 1976 for the study area 1976 2005 was adopted as the baseline period for this study 2 4 2 hydro meteorological downscaling the systematic processes implemented in a hydro meteorological interface to model climatic sequences are illustrated in flowchart of fig 3 the interface was developed by combining the procedure of evaluating climate change with the selection of gcms climate scenarios and downscaling process the future climate change scenarios obtained from gcms do not provide details on small spatial scales of interest necessary for most practical applications due to scientific limitations and incomplete observational data ipcc 2007 to address such gaps between the gcms scale and desired resolution for practical applications downscaling of gcms data is needed to obtain climate change information at suitable local scales hewitson and crane 1996 in addition to the common procedures of assessing climate change impacts the hydro meteorological graphical user interface also integrates gcms emission scenarios and downscaling procedures of climate variables and their future projections the interface is based on methodology of delta change factor as a statistical downscaling algorithm to create high resolution future climate variables at the station scale the delta change is a commonly adopted statistical downscaling technique used as an ordinary bias correction method to reduce bias between the observed station data and gcms outputs chen et al 2011 ouyang et al 2015 the technique of delta change factor has been widely applied in crop water demand calculation and hydrological studies around the globe nkomozepi 2012 diaz nieto and wilby 2005 allen et al 1998 the algorithm modifies the observed daily time series of climate variables by adding and or multiplying monthly mean changes of gcm outputs using adjusting formulas given by 1 rf delta rf future rf control monthly 2 rf future daily rf observed daily rf delta 3 t delta t future t control monthly 4 t future daily t observed daily t delta in the above equations rf is rainfall and t temperature the subscript delta denotes downscaled daily variable using the delta change method observed daily denotes daily observations future denotes average monthly gcm output for future period and control denotes average monthly gcm output for the control or baseline period 2 4 3 reference evapotranspiration simulation module modeling irrigation water demand for assessing the impacts of climate change requires estimating reference evapotranspiration eto both for baseline and future periods the fao penman monteith model is widely used worldwide for this estimate and provides fairly consistent values of eto allen et al 1998 the model is expressed by 5 et o t s 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 in eq 5 etot

kpa c 1 the downscaled air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were inputs to eto model eq 5 for estimating anticipated changes note that solar radiation could not be downscaled directly owing to its unavailability from the gcms archives a simple temperature based model proposed hargreaves and samani 1983 was applied to estimate solar radiation rs as 6 r s k rs t max t min 1 2 r a where krs is an adjustment factor equal to 0 16 for interior locations and 0 19 for coastal locations tmax and tmin the mean monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures c respectively and ra the extraterrestrial radiation w m 2 that was computed following allen et al 1998 we designed a stand alone graphical user interface with several scripted codes and functions for the eto module using matlab programming 2 4 4 climate smart dss user interface for downscaling climate variables the climate smart decision support system csdss comprises a hydro meteorological simulation module and a reference evapotranspiration simulation module rowshon et al 2019 the interface is designed in matlab with its graphical user interface environment guide development of the software package involves building gcm calendars to accommodate gcms of 365 days one year for determining change factors gcm data is included in matlab database and can be updated quickly as new climate scenarios and gcms become available the main dialog window fig 4 appears when the csdss model is activated in matlb environment a simulation dialog window fig 5 appears when clicking on a command button to generate daily hydro meteorological variables selection of a station variables of interest combination of gcm rcp scenario and simulation time can be done with drop down buttons fig 5a to simulate rainfall then simulation of future time series button appears green signaling completion of the simulation and a confirmation window appears a dialog window fig 5b appears after clicking on reference et simulation button in the main dialog window to run the reference evapotranspiration simulation the hydro meteorological parameters maximum temperature minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation obtained from gcms outputs are key inputs for eto calculation upon pressing the eto time series simulation button the time series for selected time period is produced and the button appears green indicating completion of the simulation fig 5 the future hydro climate parameters of a station are produced by perturbing the station the parameters are derived by using change factors from the mean projected changes which are simulated from gcms for the same variables simulated outputs can be obtained from each of the 18 gcms or through multi models projections based on selected rcp emission scenario the outputs can be generated as daily time series and long term monthly time scale and viewed from the analysis and statistics button as tables and graphs 2 5 aquacrop model aquacrop is a dynamic crop growth model and simulates attainable crop yield in response to applied water raes et al 2009 because of simplicity robustness and accuracy the model has been applied worldwide by many practitioners e g irrigation and water experts extension workers government ngos and researchers for various on farm managements irrigation planning climate change adaptation strategies and soil water balance this study used fao aquacrop model 6 1 to assess crop s response to climate change and weed control measures the input parameters are climate data temperature rainfall evaporative demand and carbon dioxide concentration crop data growth stages and development and yield processes soil data soil water balance and crop management data prime agronomic practices like planting date fertilizer application and irrigation accordingly there are five input data files for model simulations the mean annual co2 input for the model was taken from the mauna loa observatory records in hawaii for the baseline climate 1976 2005 and ipcc s projections for rcps for the future periods aquacrop model utilizes conservative parameters of initial t 0 canopy cover cco per seedling canopy growth coefficient cgc per day and maximum canopy cover ccx to estimate canopy development with time after emergence hsiao et al 2014 it converts crop yield to harvest index hi defined as yield to biomass ratio from biomass under non stressed conditions the canopy expansion from development to full canopy follows an exponential increasing growth during first half of the growth period and time for the canopy cover cc is estimated from a fraction of the green canopy covering the ground willmott 1984 as 7 cc cc o e cgc t 8 cc cc o cc x cc o e cgc t in eqs 7 and 8 t is time in days and cc cco cgc and ccx bear the same meanings as mentioned above aquacrop model developed from fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 retains the original concept of a direct link between crop water use and crop yield the link is maintained by separating non productive soil evaporation e from productive crop transpiration and estimating biomass directly from actual transpiration of a crop by using a water productivity parameter the adjustments lead to a new equation which is core of the aquacrop growth engine the daily biomass is estimated in accordance with standardized water productivity for daily transpiration and co2 intake as 9 b wp tri et oi where b is cumulative biomass produced kg m 2 wp water productivity kg of biomass per mm of water transpired tri daily crop transpiration mm and etoi daily reference evapotranspiration mm only a part of biomass of the harvested organs is split to yield y for most crops the yield to biomass ratio harvest index hi is expressed by 10 y hi b the underlying mechanisms terminating into b and hi are different so splitting y into b and hi allows separating the effects of environmental conditions and stress on b and hi fig 6 illustrates the entire scheme of calculation in aquacrop model schematically in this figure cc ccpot eto wp and hi is simulated canopy cover potential canopy cover reference evapotranspiration normalized crop water productivity and harvest index respectively 2 6 calibration and validation of aquacrop model we parameterized and tested aquacrop model for rice crop it was calibrated by using experimental data of 2017 and validated with observed historical yield data of 2009 2016 period the calibration process included development of a crop file in the model through the entry of initial canopy cover maximum canopy cover days to maturity maximum rooting depth as well as base and top temperatures for crop growth the model determined planting rate canopy growth coefficient and coefficient of decline in the canopy standardized water productivity was chosen depending on crop species c3 or c4 crop the expansion of canopy stomatal closure and aeration stress were optimized and balanced for water stress until simulated data matched with the observations performance of the model in simulating rice crop was assessed by validating it based on observed data and parameters the model was applied to simulate rice yield for 2017 year of field experimental the performance of the model was evaluated using normalized root mean square error nrmse prediction

emission scenarios with the validated aquacrop model simulation was done based on propositions that climate data and co2 concentration are variables and would change over the selected future periods the other inputs related to crop soil and management practices would remain invariant at their values of the baseline period the impacts of climate change were evaluated by contrasting the simulated yields of the baseline period to that of the three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2080 2099 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate change the projected climate table 6 reveals that both the minimum and maximum temperatures will increase in the future at the bernam river basin within which the study area is sited compared to maximum temperature the minimum temperature will likely to increase at higher rates the annual rainfall is expected to increase by up to 5 78 from its baseline magnitude under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios the maximum temperature is expected to rise by 0 62 0 7 c during 2020s 1 19 1 7 c during 2050s and 1 50 3 01 c during 2080s under the three rcp scenarios compared to the baseline period table 6 the expected increase in minimum temperature during the corresponding future period is 0 72 0 79 c 1 3 1 85 c and 1 69 3 21 c the predicted monthly trends of the minimum and maximum temperatures under the three rcp scenarios are illustrated in fig 7 for 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2080 2099 periods inconsistent distribution and highly variable amount of rainfall at various places within region on any same day make the study of rainfall very difficult in malaysia nevertheless our analysis predicted an overall increase in the annual rainfall in the future while seasonal projection shows a 2 5 7 6 decrease in the off season and 9 34 increase in the main season compared to the regular rainfall record in the tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme fig 8 depicts trends of monthly rainfall under the three rcp scenarios for the three future periods the temperature and rainfall projections thus reveal a warmer climate during april to july but a wetter climate during october to december and march to may these results are also in alignment with similar studies for other areas in malaysia tan et al 2014 the projected temperatures table 6 can help anticipating future water demand for irrigation during the two rice growing seasons of the study area although the impact of climate change varies on crop types local variation in the growing season and cultivation management of crops increased temperature and changing rainfall patterns will have crucial impacts on rice production the projected minimum temperature will be beneficial to rice production but that of maximum temperature will be detrimental shakoor et al 2015 changes in monthly total rainfall will differ considerably with the gcms and rcp scenarios with no general trend as illustrated in fig 9 however with increasing evapotranspiration at rising temperatures crop water usage will increase in the off season due to decreasing rainfall but decrease in the main season due to increasing rainfall the changes in rainfall are largely controlled by the physical parameters of the gcms but not by the characteristics of a particular model nkomozepi and chung 2012 so projection of rainfall is a large source of ambiguity in climatic impact assessments in spite of their variations some gcms have predicted a rise in rainfall for all three rcp scenarios 3 2 performance of aquacrop model this study calibrated aquacrop model with observed rice yields of the off season and main season of 2017 the model estimated higher rice yields compared to the observed yields both in the off season and main season with a corresponding variation of 1 0 and 3 1 during calibration the model also showed reasonable performance during validation period 2009 2016 indeed access to high quality experimental data in a variety of environments will further improve calibration and validation of the crop parameters nevertheless the model simulated rice yields fairly agreed well with the observed yields in both crop seasons during the validation period fig 10 the coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean error nrmse index of agreement d and mean absolute error mae is 0 74 2 93 0 75 and 127 respectively for the off season the corresponding performance index for the main season is 0 81 2 92 0 78 and 157 since no information on the performance of crop growth models in simulating rice yield at the study site is available from any previous study the prediction errors could not be compared however based on magnitudes of the performance indices we presume that the error rates of the validated aquacrop model are acceptable and the model could adequately capture the impacts of climate change on rice yields as evidenced in several studies around the globe e g araya et al 2017 heng et al 2009 noor et al 2018 in the two rice growing seasons during 2009 2016 the minimum prediction error pe varied from 5 65 to 0 31 and the maximum pe from 2 34 to 5 4 between the off season and main season the four performance indicators r2 nrmse d mae of the model showing yield difference of 0 74 2 9 demonstrate that the model is potential for predicting rice yields the coefficient of residual mass crm indicates that the model slightly overestimates rice yield in the main season and underestimates in the off season the determination coefficients 0 74 and 0 81 and agreement indices 0 75 and 0 78 for both crop seasons during 2009 2016 demonstrate good confidence in simulating potential rice yields the model under predicted rice yield in the off season except in 2009 and in the main season in 2013 2014 and 2016 compared to the observed yields fig 11 the model simulated rice yield thus increases over time due to the effects of some input climate variables on crop development and growth phases for example a continuous increase in co2 concentrations contributed positively in yield production by off setting the negative effects of rising temperatures as reported by several investigators e g anderson and hazell 1990 isik and devadoss 2006 kim and arwin 2009 in spite of the rising trend in temperature rainfall will exert positive impacts on rice yield the performance indicators of aquacrop model demonstrate small deviations of the simulated rice yields from the historical observed yields nonetheless the model could predict rice growth and yield with fair accuracy under various water management practices and hence can promote the local irrigation program yield prediction and adaptation scenarios 3 3 yield projection for future the predicted rice yields both for the off season and main season show increasing trends under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 12 the increase being stronger during 2020 s than 2080 s the predicted average change in yield varies from 9 8 to 18 8 over the two seasons under the three rcp scenarios during the current century the predicted change in rice yield in 2020s 2050s and 2080s are presented in table 7 so the rice yield in the study area under the three rcp scenarios is projected to be 5 3 5 8 t ha 1 during 2020s 5 7 6 0 t ha 1 during 2050s and 5 6 6 1 t ha 1 during 2080s in the off season the projected rice yield for the corresponding future period in the main season is 5 8 6 4 t ha 1 6 2 6 5 t ha 1 and 6 2 6 5 t ha 1 fig 13 illustrates projected rice yields during 2010 2039 2040 2079 and 2070 2099 periods under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios aquacrop model predicted increase in aggregated rice yield for both the high and low emission scenarios fig 14 the increase in yield generally being slightly higher under rcp8 5 compared to the other two scenarios it is therefore stipulated that rice farming sector in malaysia will be benefited from its future climate however assessment of climate change impacts on crop yields is difficult and complex since crop yields result from multifaceted interactions between rainfall effects co2 controlled physiological effects and adaptability and productivity of the crops parry et al 2004 some studies e g rosenzweig 2015 reported decline in yields of the south and south east asian rainfed crops while others e g parry et al 2007 reported a likely increase in crop yields of up to 20 for the eastern and south west asia also both increase and decrease in crop yields were reported in thailand in line with co2 regimes parry et al 2004 3 3 1 temperature and co2 effects on rice yield atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is predicted to increase in the future in association with the projected increase in temperature based on previous results of crops responses in face environments and knowledge on sink capacity indicative values for fsink for different crop species currently listed in the database of aquacrop model have been specified cereal crops like rice maize and wheat are low responsive to elevated co2 and consequently their fsink values are small 0 00 0 20 vanuytrecht et al 2011 so we adjusted performance of rice crop under elevated co2 concentration by altering its sink strength to the lowest value zero to reduce uncertainty in modeling future rice production aquacrop model simulated a systematic increase in rice yield in our analysis with increasing co2 concentration during 2010 2099 period as illustrated in fig 15 compared to yield increase under reference co2 concentration of 369 41 ppm measured at mauna loa hawaii in 2000 the expected increase in rice yield is 12 6 16 7 21 7 and 25 1 at 450 550 650 and 750 ppm co2 levels respectively in contrast aquacrop model predicts some sorts of reductions in these percentages of yield increase at the co2 levels with increasing temperature it predicts 10 8 reduction in rice yield at a base co2 concentration of 369 55 ppm in association with a temperature increase of 4 c the rising temperature in future will likely reduce plants respiration causing spikelet sterilizations and poor grain filling with eventual reduction in grain yield wassmann and dobermann 2007 thus the increased temperature will reduce the beneficial effects of increased co2 on rice yields at least to some extent the predicted increase in co2 concentration irrespective of whether or not temperatures have increased shows positive impacts on rice yield and counter impacts high temperature on yield these results are consistent with the findings of other studies gumel et al 2017 ariff and ramsden 2016 reporting that a 2 c and 5 c rise in maximum temperature can reduce rice yield by 4 0 and 14 respectively and a 1 c rise in minimum temperature can reduce yield by 6 5 specifically during flowering and grain filling stages we also estimated that an increase in co2 levels from 340 ppm to 680 ppm will compensate for the adverse effects of increasing temperature by 4 c on rice production in addition rise in co2 levels will reduce irrigation requirement by reducing crop water consumption wang et al 2015 3 3 2 effect of weeds on yield we evaluated the effects of weeds on yield development of rice by selecting four main scenarios of relative weed cover such as 5 perfect weed control 15 good weed control 45 poor weed control and 75 worst weed control and seven secondary scenarios of weed infestation in the rice growing season the selected weed control scenarios are detailed in table 8 fig 16 depicts how the good g poor p and worst w weed control measures are anticipated to reduce rice yields the competitions between weed varieties as well as between the weeds and rice plants appear to be a major cause of yield loss in lowland rice with yield reduction varying with weed types and duration weed infestation weed control scenario w2 good weed control with 15 relative weed cover remaining until maturity phase of rice reduces both the biomass and dry yield of rice by 5 scenario w6 poor weed control with 45 relative weed cover and scenario w9 worst weed control with 75 relative weed cover remaining until maturity phase reduce the biomass and dry yield by 37 and 65 respectively compared to the perfect weed control scenario w1 with 5 relative weed cover in the weed control scenarios where relative weed cover changes at the end of season from that at canopy closure the effect of weed competition becomes variable for example the biomass and dry yield of rice reduce by 19 8 with 15 relative weed cover during canopy closure and 45 during end of the season in scenario w4 but by 26 with 45 relative weed cover during canopy closure and 15 during end of the season in scenario w8 similarly the biomass and dry yield reduce by 47 with 45 weed cover during canopy closure and 75 during end of the season in scenario w7 but by 54 with 75 weed cover during canopy closure and 45 during end of the season in scenario w10 the simulated results reveal 0 45 days after plantation dap of lowland rice as critical of weed competition the harmful effects of early weed competition are demonstrated in fig 16 therefore it is essential to keep 0 45 dap weed free to avoid large yield loss of lowland rice sridevi et al 2013 gopinath et al 2012 3 3 3 effect of water shortage on yield the average water requirement of rice was 848 mm in the off season and 880 mm in the main season in our experiment these results are typical for tropical regions where seasonal water requirement of rice varies from 400 mm to 700 mm steduto et al 2012 with an additional 100 200 mm for wet broadcasting and land preparation rice is highly sensitive to water stress tuong and bouman 2009 which greatly hinders grain filling jahan 2018 and hence reduces yield we evaluated the effect of water scarcity on rice yield by aquacrop model under seven irrigation regimes table 9 each for rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios over two future periods 2030s 2020 2049 and 2060s 2050 2079 the decline in rice yield due to water shortage is illustrated in fig 17 for 2030s and in fig 18 for 2060s the water level above the field surface does not exert any adverse effects on rice production tuong and bouman 2009 khairi et al 2015 aquacrop model predicts major effect of water stress on rice yield when readily available soil water raw exceeds 20 mm below the field capacity threshold it is projected that the average yield will reduce by 4 23 4 45 in the 2030s and 4 01 4 46 in the 2060 s under the rcp scenarios due to water deficit below raw in case of fc 25 fc 10 and fc irrigation regimes table 9 rice yield will likely increase by 0 25 0 50 in the 2030 s and 0 60 0 78 in the 2060s as opposed to the actual yield obtained by iada under conventional flood irrigation which cannot augment yield as does the irrigation regime with low water application khairi et al 2017 our results suggest that soil water content in the rice field be maintained between fc and fc 25 mm to improve water productivity of rice in the study area different climate change projections would generate associated different yields of rice our approach with the multi climate model would help establishing the range of uncertainty in climate projection in terms of reliability the multi model ensembles are generally better than single model zhang and yang 2018 currently the estimates of yield response for future climate depend on both the climate and crop models thus revealing the importance of refining model structure optimizing parameters and selecting suitable crop model our study could not reflect large variability in climate across the tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme adequately due to selection of only one specific location in the scheme for data measurement due to different soil types and variations in water and nutrients assimilated by different rice cultivars there are large variations in yield over the scheme area therefore future study should include a more detailed high resolution regional analysis that will provide better understanding of yield response of rice to future climate change in malaysia while the effects of climate change and response of rice to diverse farming practices have been well simulated the proposed model does not adequately consider yield reduction due to insects and pests harmful diseases weeds and extreme weather events 4 conclusions aquacrop model has been evaluated to assess rice yield under climate change weed control measures and water management practices in tanjung karang rice irrigation scheme in malaysia the model calibrated with field measured data and evaluated with eight years historical yields simulated potential impacts of climate change on rice yield for 2020s 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios and downscaled ensemble gcms ensemble of multi gcms under the rcp scenarios predicted wetter condition for main season august october and drier condition for off season january april in the future aquacrop model simulated 20 increase in rice yield under rcp8 5 scenario by the end of this century it predicted 0 67 3 1 c increase in temperature with higher increase in the off season dry season and the highest increase under extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 the rising temperatures will suppress rice yield while the ensuing increase in co2 concentration will mitigate the effects of high temperature by enhancing co2 fertilization both water scarcity and weed competition will suppress rice yield in the main season with the later factor reducing yield up to 65 under worst weed control the current yield of rice may be maintained and plausibly increased in both crop seasons by adopting deficit irrigation strategies at field capacity fc fc 25 mm and fc 10 mm irrigation regimes it is concluded that in spite of the negative impact of increasing temperature in the future rice yield may be increased by adopting proper weed control and water management measures the duration and impact of extreme climatic events or the probability of reaching a particular threshold signal due to climate change are crucial to understand and quantify the risk and support improved adaptation strategies particularly in cases where heat stress is a possible threat these issues not evaluated in this study must be addressed in future studies in spite of these shortcomings our results will help policy makers and farmers adopting necessary strategies for on farm water management and weed control under the backdrop of rising temperature and increasing co2 fertilization for sustainable rice production author contributions a a h designed and conducted the experiment performed the analyses and writing original draft
